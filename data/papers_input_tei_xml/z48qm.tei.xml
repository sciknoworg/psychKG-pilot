				<p>Humans lie to one another frequently with local and global consequences. Here we examine and operationalize the choice to lie using a mathematical model which we fit to participant behavior. This model combines perceptions of exploitability and fairness attitudes to explore the interaction between two types of utility: instrumental utility and moral utility. These utilities differed in concert with individual differences in participants&apos; behavioral traits, and those differences underwrote lies with distinct motivations. Strategic deception-wherein the lie benefits the individual-was common amongst people with elevated subclinical psychopathic traits in the absence of paranoia. It was driven by differences in instrumental utility. Whereas pathological deception-which has no apparent economic or strategic benefit-was common among highly paranoid participants (who also had elevated scores on dark triad personality traits) and was governed by the moral utility of the lie. They lied for little apparent benefit because they failed to modulate their fairness attitudes in line with the decision context. These data challenge accounts of deception that suggest deceiving oneself is a prerequisite to successful lying. They also oppose accounts of psychopathology that connect psychopathic traits to pathological lying, and theories that implicate strategic social decision-making dysfunction in paranoia. More broadly, these data highlight the importance of individual differences in efforts to mitigate deception, which have thus far, largely focused on incentive structures and decision architectures. Main Everyone lies. People lie under different circumstances and for different reasons but these have yet to operationalized. One possibility involves a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the gains of deceit against potential losses 1-4 , which includes the strong moral opposition to deception 5. Strategic deception, where one deliberately misleads another to gain an advantage, is self-serving 6,7. In contrast, prosocial deception benefits others 8-10. Pathological deception is less common, and has no apparent motive and benefits neither self nor others 11,12. It is generally considered maladaptive and has been associated with a variety of psychiatric conditions. 11 The cost-benefit tradeoff underwriting deception is modulated by different motives. Will the reciever be credulous? This contributes to the instrumental utility of the deceptive choice. Furthermore, choosing to deceive involves attitudes towards morality and fairness. If one has a strong fairness orientation 13 , this impacts the moral utility of a deceptive choice. Deception is thus a balance between these two utilities: can you lie (and get away with it) and should you? This balance may relate to certain personality traits. The dark triad comprises subclinical psychopathy, machevillianism, and narcissism, which all involve deliberate and callous manipulation of others 14-19. Subclinical psychopathy as well as machevellian traits associate with greater manipulation and deception whereas narcissism and borderline personality disorder (BPD) 20-22 may involve lying to one&apos;s self in order to deceive others [self-deception] 11,16,20,23-26. Lying which stems from issues with the self may be independent from the strategic deception characteristic of psychopathy and machevellianism 16. Paranoia, the belief that others are out to harm you, is also strongly associated with self-deception. However,in paranoid individuals, self-deception was not other-regarding. 27 Given that lying might have different motivations, with distinct underlying mechanisms 3,28 , we sought to dissect the underlying computational reasons for particular lies. We aimed to use those reasons investigate whether the interplay between instrumental valuation and moral attitudes underwrites in individual differences in deception choice and circumstances. Results We developed a perceptual decision-making task under uncertainty which offered participants the choice to deceive others in different contexts. A minimal group design with low cost and incentives for lying facilitated both pathological and strategic deception (Figure 1A). Strategic deception occurred when participants lied to a competitor and financial compensation was yoked to their partner&apos;s performance. Pathological deception involved lying in the absence of such yoking. We define a deceptive choice as a response pattern where participants have self-consistent classifications (C1 = C2) but choose to give advice that conflicts with their classification (advice ≠ C1; Figure 1B). Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 615) and completed either the competition version or the control version of the task. The versions of the task differed only on language used &quot;opponent&quot; (competition) versus &quot;partner&quot; (control) and the conditions of the economic bonus. Comparison of the deception scores between the control group (N = 310) and the competition group (N = 305) revealed that the competition group had significantly elevated levels of deception (Welch&apos;s t-test: t(373.69) = 13.104, p &lt; 2.2e-16, Cohen&apos;s d = 1.06, 95% CI: [0.88, 1.24]; Figure 1C). A large portion (~ 34%) of the control group did not engage in a single deceptive trial; whereas only ~10% of the competition group engaged in zero deception. No differences in deception scores were seen when examining demographic variables (gender: F</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The prevalence and variability of strategic deception propensity in this context allowed us to examine individual differences in the choice to deceive. To determine how patterns of personality and psychopathological traits are associated with deception propensity, latent profile analysis (LPA) was performed on the collection of self-report scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> . The minimum BIC value was observed for a 4 latent class solution with variable variances across classes and fixed covariances (Extended Data <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Interpretation of the defining aspects of the classes is as follows: Class 1 (moderately high AFF+LIF, moderately low paranoia; N = 230), Class (moderately low psychopathy, moderately high paranoia, moderately high BPD; N = 109), Class 3 (very low psychopathy, very low paranoia, very low BPD; N = 158), and Class 4 (very high psychopathy, very high paranoia, very high BPD; N = 118) ( <ref type="figure">Figure   2A</ref>). Investigation of the differences in deception propensity between latent classes showed a significant interaction effect between experimental group and class (Levene's test for non-homogenous variance: p &lt; 2.2e-16; Welch-James' statistic, p = 0.01; <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). Post-hoc testing (Welch's t-test) revealed that there was a significant elevation in deception score in Class 1 relative to Class 3 in the competition group (t(188.71) = 3.0598, p-corrected = 0.015, Cohen's d = 0.44, 95% CI: [0.15, 0.72]). This suggests the role of moderately elevated psychopathy (without elevated paranoia/BPD) in increasing strategic deception probability. Comparison within the control condition revealed elevated deception scores in Class 4 relative to Class 3 (t(73.425) = 3.2321, p-corrected = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.57, 95% CI: [0.21, 0.93]) -individuals characterized with high elevations in psychopathy, paranoia, and BPD had increased deception scores when the decision context did not reward deception. More severe manifestations of these traits appear to be linked to pathological deception rather than strategic deception. The task design inspired our model choice through two key factors: the lack of learning in the task, and the use of sensory uncertainty only in the classification. Crucially, participants are not given feedback about the correctness of their own choices, and are not given any information about their partner nor about their partner's choices. This design allows us to measure deception propensity in the absence of learning, in order to distill someone's baseline propensity to engage in deception while controlling for differences in learning documented with paranoia and BPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . Despite the classification being a perceptual decision, the decision of interest (to deceive or not to deceive) is a value-based decision determined by preferences rather than by objective evidence. Taken together, these factors indicate that a preference-based decision-making framework common in behavioral economics would allow us to explore differences in deceptive choice. Our model combines a well-known framework for choices in situations of inequal rewards, the Fehr-Schmidt model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , with custom reward functions that were derived to test different hypotheses about perception of a partner in the absence of information (Extended Data <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>; Extended Data <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). This allows to explore two potential motivations to deception: attitude towards inequality and perception of the other's vulnerability. Both motivations can result in increased deception in the model. Choice data from each participant was used to fit the model to estimate subject-specific latent parameters using maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation. Empirical priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> for the parameters were derived from an independent dataset (see Methods for details). Model parameters were assessed for differences between experimental group and psychological class ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure    3B</ref>). The competition group had elevated (guilt) values (t(611.91) = 3.6, p = 0.00036, Cohen's d = 0.29, 95% CI: [0.13, 0.45])as well as elevated / (perceived vulnerability) values (t(598.81) = 7.8, p = 2.7e-14, Cohen's d = 0.63, 95% CI: [0.47, 0.79]) relative to the control group. The decreased guilt parameter in the control group is a natural consequence of the decision context -when the monetary bonus is not yoked to the social interaction, advantageous inequality should not discount utility (as much), as there is no direct impact to the other individual. The increased perceived vulnerability parameter in the competition group suggests the decision context influences how manipulatable one thinks their opponent is (specifically, the incentive to outperform your opponent increases this) -which increases the likelihood of deception to increase. When considering model parameters independently, we found no significant interaction effect between experimental group and LPA class on the vulnerability index (F(3,607) = 1.77, p-adjusted = 0.45, Cohen's f = 0.09, 95% CI: [0, 0.16]). However, there was a main effect of LPA group on perceived vulnerability ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4B</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4C</ref>). These results demonstrate the maladaptive inequality attitude that is not properly adjusted based upon decision context in the groups with elevated paranoia and BPD traits (Class 2 and Class 4). Taken together, differences in perceived vulnerability appear to explain group differences in deception within the competition group (strategic deception), whereas differences in guilt illustrate the group differences in deception within the control group (pathological deception). However, the relationship between deception scores and model parameters appears to involve an interaction between η/ γ and β ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A</ref>) -warranting a multivariate investigation. To examine the interaction between the perceived vulnerability and guilt parameter and how this differed between LPA class and group, we performed a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA). There was a significant interaction between LPA class and group on the interaction between perceived vulnerability and guilt (F(3, 607) = 3.476, p-adjusted = 0.006, Cohen's f = 0.13, 95% CI: [0.05, 0.17]). To quantify this interaction, we employed descriptive discriminant analysis (DDA) for post-hoc analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> DDA determines the linear combination of the dependent variables (DVs) that give rise to maximal separation of the groups. Since we are interested in how LPA classes within the decision context differ, we performed DDA separately on the competition and control groups. For the competition group, the discriminant coefficient for the vulnerability parameter was 0.9515, whereas it was -0.361 for the guilt parameter. In the control group the discriminant coefficient for perceived vulnerability was 0.267 and 0.97 for the guilt parameter. Therefore, for the competition group, the perceived vulnerability dominates differences in LPA classes, whereas guilt differentiates LPA classes within the control group. This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4B</ref> and 4Cthe LPA classes within the competition group are separated more by perceived vulnerability and slightly by guilt, whereas within the control group LPA classes are separately predominately by guilt values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our data suggest that the individual differences in deception propensity are specific to the type of deception. While previous work centered the relationships between self and other , here we conceptualize low-cost, lowinformation deception as a tradeoff between moral and instrumental utility. Instrumental valuation dominates strategic deception, an increase in deceptive choices is driven predominately by an increased belief in their partner's exploitability. Moral utility guides pathological deception -increases in deception are predominately controlled by changes in guilt over receiving more than the other person.</p><p>Moderate elevations in subclinical psychopathy (in the absence of elevated paranoia) were associated with increased strategic deception. This challenges our conception of psychopathy, which is defined by pathological lying . While individuals with psychopathic traits lied more frequently, they did so primarily when they themselves might benefit rather than lying for the sake of lying. In contrast, people with extreme elevations in subclinical psychopathic traits, paranoia, and BPD engaged in more pathological deception. This may be because studies of psychopathy are commonly conducted in incarcerated people <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> and elide comorbidities like impulsivity and maladaptive decision-making. Indeed, pathological lying may even be a separate diagnostic entity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Our data support this distinction. Importantly, our results contradict the long-held evolutionary theory suggesting that self-deception facilitates the strategic deception of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> . Instead, Trivers' theory might apply specifically to pathological deception in humans. This is further supported by our findings that subclinical trait psychopathy is associated with strategic rather than pathological deception. Subclinical psychopathy is not associated with selfdeception <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> unlike paranoia and narcissism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . This has implications for models of psychopathology that invoke strategic coalitional mechanisms that explain all symptoms, since strategic deception plays less of a role in some aspects of psychopathology than others. Others have highlighted the importance of incentives and decision architecture in moderating decisionmaking, including the decision to lie. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> Our data suggest that inherent qualities of the decision-maker are also important and will govern the success of those interventions. Understanding the interactions between decision-maker, partner, and architecture will be key to encouraging veracity and protecting against the societal consequences of lying.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics statement</head><p>All experiments were approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee. Written informed consent was provided by all participants. All work was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral task</head><p>We adapted a perceptual decision-making task that was previously used to measure motivated perception. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> Each trial was composed of three parts: C1 classification, classification advice, and C2 classification ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1A</ref>). Participants were first informed that would classify an image as either a scene or a face. Images were hybrids that included mixtures of 100% scene/0% face to 0% scene/100% face, and there were a total of 79 images. Following the initial classification of an image (C1 classification), they rated their confidence on a scale from 1 to 7. Next, they were told to choose to give advice or to receive advice about what the image they just saw was. Participants were informed initially that if their partner chose the same as them on the advice step that they would get that choice, and if they disagreed, that they would be randomly assigned to either giving or receiving advice. In actuality, since they were playing against the computer, random assignment was conducted on each trial to ensure each participant had multiple trials to give and receive advice. Following either having to give advice or receive advice, participants were shown the same image from C1, and classified the image again (C2 classification), and reported their confidence. Note that when participants received advice, the advice was correct for 50% of the trials. Participants were assigned to either the competition condition (N = 305) or the control condition (N = 310). In the competition condition, participants were informed that they were playing against an opponent, and crucially, that they would receive a monetary bonus if they classified more images correctly than their opponent. In the control condition, participants were told they were playing with a partner, and that they would receive a monetary bonus if they were in the top percent of scorers in the experiment. Questionnaires After completing the behavioral task, participants were asked to complete a battery of questionnaires. They reported demographic information -including age, gender, ethnicity/race, mental health diagnoses, and medication use. We collected the Revised Green et al. Paranoia Thoughts Scale (R-GPTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> , Self-Report Psychopathy -Short Form (SRP-SF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> , Short Dark Triad (SD3) machiavellianism scale and narcissism subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , and the Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline Scale (PAI-BOR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> . Free response questions were included to help detect bot responses. Participants were recruited online via CloudResearch 55 using their new data quality tools. As reported in our preregistration (https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=ZDK_688), participants who declined 50% of the questionnaires were automatically rejected, as well as any non-sensical free responses that appeared to be not written by a human (N = 6). Additionally, to diminish the effect of inattentive responding, we excluded individuals who missed over 75% of the control stimuli in the experiment from any analysis (N = 7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral metrics</head><p>Deception was quantified by measuring the number of trials in which a participant had consistent classifications (C1 = C2) but gave advice that conflicted with their own classification (C1 ≠ advice; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1B)</ref>.</p><p>The number of trials were this pattern occurred was divided by the total number of trials in which they gave advice (since this was randomly selected and varied between participants). Deception scores ranged between 0 (no deception) to 100 (deception on every trial where they gave advice).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latent profile analysis</head><p>Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted on the psychological scales to create data-driven clusters of individuals who share similar patterns on these scales. LPA is a form of Gaussian mixture-modeling that probabilistically assigns each individual to a latent class <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> and is often conceptualized as a form of modelbased clustering. We performed LPA in RStudio using the mclust package. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> To find the optimal number and structure of latent classes, we examine the Bayesian information criteria (BIC) for a variety of LPA models. We determined that the best BIC value (Extended Data <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) occurred with a four-class solution with varying variance, and fixed covariance (named VVI by mclust). The latent profiles are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multivariate parameter analysis</head><p>To assess the effect of experimental group and LPA class on the interaction between model parameters, we performed a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) in R. To identify the combinations of model parameters that contributed the most to group differences between LPA classes within experimental groups, we employed descriptive discriminant analysis (DDA) as a post-hoc method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> We used the lda function from the MASS package in R to calculate the discriminant functions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> Since we were primarily interested in the differences between LPA groups within the experimental condition, we performed a DDA analysis separately for the control and competition group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling</head><p>We combined a well-known framework for preference-based decision-making in situations of inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> with custom reward functions that incorporated the stimulus ambiguity. The Fehr-Schmidt model computes the utility of a choice as follows: = − α max( − , 0) − β max( − , 0) ( . 1) where is the self-reward, is the reward for the other, α is the envy parameter, and β is the guilt parameter. Importantly, the Fehr-Schmidt model assumes that individuals dislike both advantageous ( &gt; ) and disadvantageous inequality ( &lt; ) -this operationalized in the model by restricted both and to be positive. Since the foundation of deception is that it is inherently selfish, we relax the assumption on to allow it to take any value. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> This allows for the utility of a choice resulting in advantageous inequality to be increased. In order to investigate the baseline propensity to deceive, we restrict information to minimize learning. There is no feedback given to participants about their classification accuracy, nor any information about their partner, their partner's choices, or about whether they accepted the advice (hence, popular Bayesian belief models are inappropriate for these data). This informs our construction of reward functions: the reward to the self for a trial is directly proportional to the stimulus ambiguity. The reward function for estimating the reward to the other individual is more complex. How do we represent what someone else will do (and has done) without feedback? There is no updating of this representation, as there is no information that can be used to improve this estimation. We utilize a common framework on expected reward:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ∑ 1, 2 ( 1, 2) (<label>. 2)</label></formula><p>all combinations of C1, C2 The main question becomes how one estimates the probability that their partner chooses a specific response pattern. We utilize Bayesian model comparison in order to test (in a data-driven way) a variety of hypotheses about how people might actually estimate this probability. Our winning model (M6) combined the Fehr-Schmidt utility function with reward functions that utilize the stimulus ambiguity and the individual's estimated probability about what their partner might do. The reward to the self, , is the same for decisions in both the give and receive advice contexts. Here, the expected reward for answering consistently is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">, 1= 2 = 2 ( . 3)</formula><p>where s is the stimulus ambiguity. When the answer is switched between the C1 and C2 classifications, the expected reward is:</p><p>, 1≠ 2 = 1 ( . 4) since at most one of the classifications is correct regardless of the stimulus ambiguity. The reward for the other person is different depending on the advice context. In the "give advice" context, the individual is choosing between four options (C1 = C2 = advice, C1 = C2 ≠ advice, C1 ≠ C2 = advice, C1 ≠ C2 ≠ advice), and has no information about what their partner might have chosen. For the two cases that include giving advice that matches their C1 classification (consistent advice), we have: give. The ratio of these two parameters, , can be interpreted as representing the participant's belief about how susceptible their partner is to the advice. If &gt; 1, this means that the participant thinks their partner is more likely to give consistent responses when the advice agrees with their own classification than when the advice disagrees with their own classification -this represents a participant who believes their partner is gullible. When the participant is instead asked to receive advice, the decision in simpler. Now, they are only choosing between two (instead of four) choices -to stay (C1 = C2), or to switch (C1 ≠ C2). Now, the reward functions for the participant's estimation of their partner's reward are split by whether the participant receives advice that conflicts with their own C1 classification: ( . 8) Here, these reward functions use but set = 0.5. This is representing the idea that the participant's estimation of their partner's likelihood to stay with the same answer after giving consistent advice is only related to the stimulus ambiguity. The participant's estimation of their partner's likelihood to stay with the same answer after giving inconsistent advice is equal to their estimation of their partner's likelihood to stay with the same answer after receiving advice. This suggests that an individual's baseline assumptions of their partner's distrustfulness towards them is based upon the individual's perception of their partner's deceitfulness. This supports the notion that individuals who lie more frequently have a tendency to believe others lie more too. The reward functions for the contexts are used to compute utility for each choice (four choices for the give context; two choice for the receive context) using the Fehr-Schmidt utility function (Equation 1). These utilities are then run through a softmax function, with decision noise , to determine the probability of a choice:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R , = 1 = 2 + (1 − ) + (1 − )(1 − ) (Eq</formula><p>(choice ) = ∑ =1</p><p>( . 9)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model comparison</head><p>Model comparison allows us to compare models to elucidate underlying mechanisms -model comparison does not tell us if our model is "good" at recapitulating the behavior, but rather, tells us which model is better than the rest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> To deduce the best model from our model space <ref type="table">(Extended Data Table 2</ref>), we used Bayesian model selection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> Exceedance and protected exceedance probabilities were computed using the mfit package. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> The complete list of models compared (with their respective reward functions) are outlined in Extended Data <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and 3.

Note that we compared models that were "simpler", as they had less free parameters. Therefore, we conclude that the additional complexity of M6 is required to properly model the behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation</head><p>In order to validate our model and ensure that the model is able to recapitulate the behavior, we created simulated choices and created simulated parameter sets. Since our modeling results rest on parameter values, we ensured that parameters could be recovered successfully. Each parameter set (from an individual) was simulated a total of 100 times, and each of the simulations was used to fit the model again. Each parameter was significantly correlated with its simulated version: λ: = 0.88, &lt; 0.0001, α: = 0.94, &lt; 0.0001, β: = 0.96, &lt; 0.0001, η: = 0.77, &lt; 0.0001, γ: = 0.8, &lt; 0.0001.</p></div>

Model parameters were analyzed using ANOVAs, and post-hoc comparisons were conducted with two-sided independent samples t-tests, with Bonferroni correction for multiple-comparisons when needed. Deception scores were analyzed using methods robust to nonhomogeneous variance: the Welch-James' statistic was used instead of ANOVA when variance was not homogenous, with two-sided Welch's t-tests used for post-hoc analyses. Levene's test was used to determine if variance was homogenous to determine if a Welch-James' test was appropriate. The effectsize package <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> in R was used to calculate Cohen's d and Cohen's f to assess effect size.

B, Example of a deceptive response pattern. If a participant classifies an image as a face, gives advice that the image was a scene, and then classifies the image as a face again -the trial is counted as deception. C, Deception scores are elevated when the monetary bonus is linked to directly outperforming their opponent (competition context, N = 305) compared to when the bonus is tied to being a top scorer in the experiment (control context, N = 310).

The optimal clustering structure included four profiles. Class 1 (N = 230) included individuals with elevations in subclinical psychopathy, machiavellian traits, and low paranoia. Class 2 (N = 109) was marked by low subclinical psychopathy, elevated paranoia, and elevated BPD scores. Class 3 (N = 158) was the group of individuals that were low in all traits, while Class 4 (N = 118) was distinguished by very high elevations in all traits. B, Deception scores within the control group (pathological deception) was increased in Class 4 (high in all traits; N = 62) relative to Class 3 (low in all traits, N = 77). C, Within the competition group (strategic deception), Class 1 (elevated psychopathic traits without paranoia; N = 117) had elevated scores relative to Class 3 (low in all traits; N = 81). *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.

Post-hoc tests revealed this difference was driven by an increase in perceived vulnerability in Class 1 relative to Class 3 (t(386) = 3.5, padjusted = 0.0028, Cohen's d = 0.37, 95% CI: [0.16,0.57]) as well as Class 2 relative to Class 3 (t(265) = 3.44, padjusted = 0.0041, Cohen's d = 0.43, 95% CI: [0.18,0.67]). This suggests that having no elevations in any measured traits might be associated with having a diminished perception of partner exploitability regardless of decision context. In contrast, there was a significant interaction between experimental group and LPA class on guilt (F(3, 607) = 5.32, p-adjusted = 0.004, Cohen's f = 0.16, 95% CI: [0.07, 0.23]).
