<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Do White Americans prefer society to be 'color-blind' by rising above racial identities, or 'multicultural' by openly discussing and considering them? We developed an ideology-rationality model to understand support for these diversity perspectives. Specifically, since people endorse a diversity perspective in line with their ideological values, we hypothesized that conservatism is related to a relative preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism. However, since colorblindness and multiculturalism are complex and multi-layered ideologies, we further hypothesized that the relationship between conservatism and a preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism is especially pronounced under higher levels of rationality. Results confirmed the hypotheses, either when rationality was operationalized within a dual process theory <ref type="bibr">(Study 1,</ref><ref type="bibr">N = 496)</ref> or experimentally induced within a tripartite model of cognition <ref type="bibr">(Study 2,</ref><ref type="bibr">N = 497)</ref>. Higher levels of rationality guided White Americans high in conservatism towards a stronger preference for color-blindness, but those low in conservatism towards a stronger preference for multiculturalism. These results suggest that among White Americans the endorsement of color-blindness versus multiculturalism stems from the interplay between ideological orientation and rationality, and that rational considerations about racial policies may further divide rather than unify along ideological lines.</p><p>Societies are becoming increasingly diverse. How society should approach racial diversity is fiercely debated among politicians, social scientist, and lay people. People hold different opinions on the topic. Why do some people believe that society benefits from ignoring racial characteristics, and why do others believe that society benefits from considering racial characteristics? To answer this question in the US context, we propose an ideology-rationality model, holding that White Americans' support for color-blind versus multicultural policy is rooted in political ideology and, critically, is bolstered by rationality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Color-blindness and multiculturalism</head><p>Some believe that society benefits from a color-blindness perspective, referring to the belief that 'race and racial differences should not be taken into account when decisions are made, impressions are formed, and behaviors are enacted' <ref type="bibr">(Apfelbaum et al., 2012, p. 205)</ref>. Colorblindness entails the view that one should focus on uniform norms for all, and that racial characteristics should be disregarded. Others believe that society would benefit from a multicultural perspective, where racial differences are recognized, appreciated, and openly discussed. Multiculturalism subscribes to the idea that, although no one racial group should be central in society, racial differences do matter, and should be taken into account rather than ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Apfelbaum et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>At face value, both approaches reflect promising avenues to promoting intergroup harmony <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Plaut et al., 2009)</ref>. If racial differences are acknowledged without judgment -a central corollary of multiculturalism -one will not devaluate those of a different racial background.</p><p>Likewise, if race is not even considered -a central corollary of color-blindness -one supposedly cannot discriminate on this basis. However, it has been argued that the deemphasizing of group differences within the color-blind view can entail a reinforcement of the current (unequal) social order between racial groups in Western societies such as the US, thereby obviating an equitable society <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Forman, 2004)</ref>. In fact, some scholars have even claimed that color-blindness serves a 'neo-or internal colonial' agenda, and works against redressing racial inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Crenshaw, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jackson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yogeeswaran et al., 2018)</ref>. In a color-blind Western society, the White majority perspective is still dominant, without considering the perspective and cultural background of racial minorities. Color-blindness may thus foster cultural ignorance and risks the denial and perpetuation of racism <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fryberg &amp; Stephens, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, rather than promoting equality, some have asserted that color-blindness constitutes a form of racism <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bonilla-Silva, 2003)</ref>. Although it is important to note that neither perspective is without its limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Plaut et al., 2018)</ref>, empirical research supports the notion that policies and norms representing multiculturalism relative to color-blindness are related to several positive intergroup outcomes in the US and other western countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sasaki &amp; Vorauer, 2013)</ref>, such as more positive face-to-face intergroup interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Vorauer et al., 2009)</ref>, less implicit and explicit racial bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Richeson &amp; Nussbaum, 2004)</ref>, less behavioral prejudice (Son Holoien &amp; Shelton, 2012), a higher probability of detecting racial discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Apfelbaum et al., 2010)</ref>, and among racial minorities: better academic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Birnbaum et al., 2020)</ref>, work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Plaut et al., 2009)</ref> and feeling accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Meeussen et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>A deeper insight of color-blindness and multiculturalism is needed to gain knowledge of intergroup interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rattan &amp; Ambady, 2013)</ref>. Previous research examined intergroup orientations from different perspectives, such as social identity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Garcia et al. 2005)</ref>, intergroup threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Velasco González et al., 2008)</ref>, selective exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(De keersmaecker &amp; Schmid, 2023)</ref>, and emotional capabilities <ref type="bibr">(Van Hiel et al., 2018)</ref>. In the current contribution, we propose an ideology-rationality model to advance understanding of White majorities' support for color-blindness versus multiculturalism in the US. The model holds that 1) people endorse a particular diversity perspective in line with their ideology of conservatism (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kauff et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wolsko et al., 2006)</ref>, and 2) that higher levels of rationality increase the alignment between one's core ideological beliefs and one's support for the specific diversity perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The ideology of conservatism</head><p>Some theoretical accounts articulate that conservatism can be conceptualized as two interrelated dimensions (see <ref type="bibr">Duckitt, 2001 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jost et al., 2003 for overviews)</ref>. The first dimension of conservatism concerns the preference for maintaining the current social order and structure by preservation of tradition. This resistance to change dimension is mainly oriented towards social issues, and therefore often labeled social conservatism. The authoritarian variant of social conservatism is typically captured by Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), which in addition to a preference for conventionalism and traditionalism, is also characterized by authoritarian submission and authoritarian aggression <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Altemeyer, 1981)</ref>. However, although social conservatism and RWA are interrelated given their focus on traditionalism, not all social conservatists are high on authoritarianism.</p><p>The second dimension of conservatism concerns the tolerance towards economic or status inequality and preference for a competitive society. This acceptance of inequality aspect is focused on economic-hierarchical issues and typically labeled economic conservatism. An ideological concept that also taps into attitudes towards inequality is Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), referring to one's preference for hierarchical and non-egalitarian relations among social groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pratto et al., 1994)</ref>. Although both SDO and economic conservatism legitimize inequality and group dominance in society, conceptually, the former reflects an attitudinal orientation regarding intergroup relations, whereas the latter is more directly oriented towards economic policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pratto et al. 1994</ref>).</p><p>The bipartite conceptualization of conservatism in terms of (a) resisting social change and (b) accepting economic inequality, has often been used in social psychology research where the social vs economical distinction is directly relevant (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Asbrock et al., 2010)</ref>. However, conservatism has also often been operationalized on a single dimension ranging from left-wing or liberal to right-wing or conservative <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jost et al., 2009)</ref>. In this approach, the social and economic domain are rather considered as merely different areas in which conservative ideology can be expressed. Indeed, empirical studies have shown that different measures of ideology tapping into social and economic dimensions of conservatism are closely intertwined and stem from an overarching conservatism dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Azevedo et al., 2019)</ref>. Specifically, Azevedo et al.</p><p>(2019) postulated that in Western societies both dimensions of conservatism are structurally and functionally interdependent since they both capture acceptance of (existing) inequality, albeit in different domains (i.e., social and economic), and social ideas and policies have ramifications for the economic domain and vice versa. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hare (2022)</ref> demonstrated that the social and economic dimensions of ideology in the US have become increasingly intertwined over the past four decades and that opinions on policy controversies about economic, social, and racial issues better fit a unidimensional ideological structure in the US. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Stoetzer and Zittlau (2020)</ref> found that in US presidential elections, voters' attitudes about social and economic policies have become almost non-separable and collapse into a single dimension. As such, one can expect similar effects of social and economic conservatism in domains where general conservatism, rather than specific social or economic aspects, is the underlying driver of the effect.</p><p>Ideology plays a key role in how people think about race-related issues and policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kinder &amp; Sanders, 1996)</ref>. In this vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Poteat and Spanierman (2012)</ref> found that RWA and SDO are related to the endorsement of color-blind attitudes. Indeed, we argue that both dimensions/expressions of conservatism align more with the color-blindness perspective compared to the multicultural perspective in the US. The fundamental idea of ignoring differences and having uniform norms for all to abide by which underlies the color-blindness perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Apfelbaum et al., 2012)</ref>, matches well the central tenets of both social conservatism and RWA, which is to focus on conventionalism and (forcefully) protecting the existing unequal social order <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jost et al., 2003)</ref>. Color-blindness validates the order, ideas and values of the current social system which privileges and benefits the White majority relative to racial minorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Neville et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, when conservatism is applied in the economic domain, a preference for colorblindness over multiculturalism aligns with the competition core of both economic conservatism and SDO that legitimizes economic and status inequality among groups. By not considering and ignoring the systematic and structural disadvantages faced by minorities, color-blindness justifies and fosters racial inequality and sustains social hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Neville et al., 2013)</ref>. If (historical) group differences are ignored and the same norms, that are set by White majority members, apply to everyone, a level playing field for competition is assumed in which potential preferential outcomes in favor of the dominant White majority can be justified as 'fair and unbiased'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An ideologyrationality model of colorblindness and multiculturalism</head><p>We argue that the relationship between conservatism and a preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism is stronger under higher levels of rationality in the US. Human reasoning is typically conceptualized within a dual process framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Stanovich et al., 2016)</ref>, holding that there are two types of information processing: intuitive thinking (often referred as Type 1) and deliberative or rational thinking (often referred as Type 2). Intuitive thinking is an automatic process with low involvement of high-level control systems; it is fast and effortless. Rational thinking is a fine-grained elaborative process that is computationally expensiveit is slower and more effortful.</p><p>How can rationality impact one's endorsement for color-blindness or multiculturalism?</p><p>People pursue coherent belief systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Azevedo et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, we argue that people tend to adopt a diversity orientation that maximizes the likelihood of reaching their ideological goals, i.e., conservatism is related towards a preference of color-blindness over multiculturalism (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Poteat and Spanierman, 2012)</ref>. However, we further purpose that this coherence between ideology and diversity orientations is especially pronounced among individuals who think rationally, because this likely deepens their understanding of the differences between colorblindness and multiculturalism. Indeed, color-blindness and multiculturalism are complex and multi-layered ideologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mazzocco, 2017)</ref>. We expect that intuitive thinking may be insufficient to fully capture the true meaning and potential societal consequences of both diversity perspectives; it might (erroneously) lead one to conclude that color-blindness and multiculturalism are different means that will result to a similar goalthat of erasing groupbased discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Plaut et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>To fully grasp the different implications underlying the two diversity perspectives, more elaborate reasoning may be necessary. Rational decision-making entails making decisions that better enable individuals to achieve their personal life goals using the best possible means <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Stanovich et al., 2016)</ref>. Color-blind policies are more likely to retain the current social system and the (unequal) societal status-quo, while multicultural policies are more likely to generate social change that advances the concerns and status of minority groups in the US. Hence, for White majorities high in (social and economic) conservatism, whose goal it is to maintain the existing social order, dominance and competition, the 'rational choice' is to prefer colorblindness over multiculturalism. In contrast, for those low in (social and economic) conservatism, whose aim it is to change the existing social order, dominance and competition, the 'rational choice' is to prefer multiculturalism over color-blindness. Thus, we hypothesized a positive relationship between conservatism and a preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism among white majorities, which is especially pronounced under high levels of rationality.</p><p>We tested our hypothesis in two studies. In each study we measured RWA, SDO, social conservatism, and economic conservatism. The goal of including different ways of measuring conservatism is to examine whether the moderating role of rationality on the association between conservative ideology and a preference for color-blindness versus multiculturalism emerges regardless of the domain in which it is expressed (i.e., social or economic) and generalizes across different measures of conservatism. We report all measures, manipulations and exclusions.</p><p>Sample sizes were determined before any data analysis, and data were analyzed after data collection was completed. Supplementary analyses (see below), data, and R-code of the studies are available at https://osf.io/xpytw/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>We tested our ideology-rationality model of color-blindness and multiculturalism among US White majority members. We expected to find a positive relationship between conservatism and a preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism, and that this relationship is magnified (i.e. moderated) by higher levels of rational thinking. In line with the theorizing of Duckitt (2001), we measured two dimensions of conservatism; the traditionalism dimension, captured by social conservatism and RWA, and the inequality dimension, captured by economic conservatism and SDO. We expected similar ideologyrationality results among the different indicators of conservatism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. We conducted a power analysis using a simulation for linear multiple regression using the nsim function in R (code available on OSF). We had a priori no clear expectation of what effect sizes we could reasonably expect. Therefore, we opted for a power analysis on an 'expected' β = .20 for the main effect of ideology, and β = .15 for the ideology x CRT interaction. These values were based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gignac &amp; Szodorai (2016)</ref>, who demonstrated that in research on the relationship between individual differences, a standardized beta of .20 corresponds to a medium effect size, and a standardized beta of .15 to a small-tomedium effect size. 1 Thus, in the simulated model, the effects were set as follows: βideologoy = .20, βcrt = .00, βideologoyXcrt = .15; and the significance level at .05. The simulation revealed that 500 participants would result in &gt; .90 power to detect the interaction effect. We recruited 500 White US citizens on Prolific. Five hundred and fifteen participants started the study whereof 496 completed the full study (Mage = 39.87 years, SDage = 13.02; 296 identified as male, 188 identified as female, 10 identified as non-binary, and 2 participants preferred not to disclose their gender  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morris et al. (2015)</ref>. The labels of color-blindness and multiculturalism were not used in the description. Participants were asked to indicate which policy they preferred on a scale from 1 (strongly prefer policy 1) to 7 (strongly prefer policy 2). Responses were recoded such that higher scores indicated a relative preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism.</p><p>Next, we measured ideology. Specifically, we administered RWA (11 items; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altemeyer, 1981)</ref>, SDO (16 items; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pratto et al., 1994)</ref>, the self-placement on a social conservatism continuum (1 item; 'In general, how would you describe yourself with regard to your position on social issues?' 1 = very liberal, 7 = very conservative), and the self-placement on an economic conservatism continuum (1 item; 'In general, how would you describe yourself with regard to your position on economic issues?' 1 = very liberal, 7 = very conservative).</p><p>Finally, a reworded version of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frederick's (2005)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Toplak et al.'s (2014)</ref>  Analyses. First, we calculated the correlations among all variables. To test the predicted ideology-rationality model for the different indicators of ideology, we ran four linear regression models in which color-blindness support over multiculturalism was regressed on the centered scores of the respective ideology indicator, the centered scores of the CRT, and their interaction term. Only participants who provided complete data were included in the analyses. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> represents the correlation matrix. In line with recent work (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Azevedo et al. 2019)</ref>, the four indicators of conservatism (RWA, SDO, social conservatism, economic conservatism) were highly interrelated. Furthermore, higher scores on the indicators of conservatism were related to a relative preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism. The</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>CRT was not significantly related to diversity policy preferences. The ideology-rationality model is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. As expected, the positive associations between the ideological variables and a preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism were moderated by CRT-scores. The interaction pattern was largely consistent across the four measures of ideology. More specifically, the positive relationship between conservatism and a relative preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism emerged only for individuals showing higher reflective thinking on the CRT. This interaction was significant for SDO, social conservatism, and economic conservatism. For RWA, the interaction was not statistically significant (p = .057), but a similar pattern with a more pronounced conservatism effect under high reflective thinking was observed. Thus, individuals were particularly likely to endorse color-blindness over multiculturalism if they were higher in ideological conservatism and rational thinking. The results are visualized in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Including age and/or gender in the analyses did not meaningfully alter the results. The results of these additional analyses can be found on OSF. Note. Coefficients are standardized. Values between brackets represent 95% confidence intervals. 'Ideology' refers to the specific ideology considered as independent variable (IV) in each model (Model 1: RWA, Model 2: SDO, Model 3: Social conservatism, Model 4: Economic conservatism).</p></div>

The full line represents mean + 1SD on the CRT and the shade represents its 95% confidence interval, the dotted line represents mean -1SD on the CRT and the shade represents its 95% confidence interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>In Study 1, we operationalized rationality within a dual-process theory. We used the CRT; capturing the thinking style to override intuitively appealing responses in favor of more elaborated ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Frederick 2005)</ref>. However, although the CRT assesses 'thinking style' rather than 'thinking ability' <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Toplak et al. 2014)</ref>, some have argued that performance on the test is aided to a certain degree by thinking ability (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sobkow et al. 2020</ref>).</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stanovich et al. (2016)</ref> incorporated the dual-process theory of rationality into a tripartite model of cognition. This conceptual model explicitly differentiates between thinking style and thinking ability, and rationality results from an interplay between both cognitive systems. Thinking style refers to whether someone relies on automatic cognitive processing (i.e., intuitive thinking), or engages in reflective and higher order cognitive processing (i.e., rational thinking). Thinking ability refers to cognitive ability or 'intelligence', one's maximal ability to conduct higher cognitive processes of reasoning. This tripartite model thus holds that rationality is the result of both: 1) allocating sufficient cognitive resources to the problem (i.e., engaging in rational rather intuitive thinking) and 2) having sufficient cognitive capabilities to process the information and solve the problem (i.e., cognitive ability).</p><p>In Study 2, we aimed to replicate the ideology-rationality model, building on this more recent account of rationality. Specifically, we differentiated more clearly between thinking ability and thinking style, by measuring individual differences in ability and experimentally manipulating style. A reflective thinking style was instilled in half of the participants by asking them to reflect on the diversity policies and to write down their reasoning (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Isler et al., 2020</ref>).</p><p>Hence, we tested a more fine-grained prediction in Study 2, that when it comes to supporting particular diversity orientations, individuals 1) endorse a perspective that is in line with their core ideological attitudes, and 2) that they do so especially when they engage in elaborative reasoning on the diversity perspective and have more cognitive capabilities to process relevant information adequately. Thus, we hypothesized that a preference for color-blindness relative to multiculturalism was predicted by a three-way interaction between conservatism, thinking style, and thinking ability. Specifically, we expected that the positive relationship between (social and economic) conservatism and a preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism is magnified when individuals engage in reflective thinking and have relatively higher levels of cognitive ability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. We conducted a power analysis using a simulation for linear multiple regression using the nsim function in R (code available on OSF). Given that the means of the main effect of ideology, and of the interaction effect in Study 1 were close to the values used for the theoretical estimates used in Study 1 (i.e., .20 and .15, respectively), we also used these for the power analysis in Study 2. The simulated model then reads as follows: βideologoy = .20, βcondition = .00, βcognitive ability = .00, βideologoyXcondition = .00, βideologyXcognitive ability = .00, βconditionXcognitive ability = .00, βideologyXconditionXcognitive ability = .15; and the significance level at .05. The simulation revealed that 500 participants would result in &gt; .85 power to detect the three-way interaction effect. Five hundred White US citizens were recruited on Prolific. Three participants were omitted from the sample because they did not follow the instructions, leading to a final sample size of 497 (Mage = 38.71 years, SDage = 12.80, 245 identified as male, 245 identified as female, 6 identified as nonbinary, and 1 participant preferred not to disclose their gender).</p><p>Procedure and materials. First, participants completed the same measures of RWA, SDO, social conservatism, and economic conservatism as in Study 1.</p><p>Next, participants were presented with the same description of color-blindness and multiculturalism as in Study 1. We experimentally induced thinking style by assigning participants randomly to a no reflection or a reflection condition. In the no reflection condition, identical to Study 1, participants were merely asked to indicate which policy they preferred. In the reflection condition, participants were presented with a textbox, and instructed as follows:</p><p>'Please reflect on both policies. What do you think about these policies? Write down your thoughts' (for a similar procedure of inducing reflective thinking in the context of mathematical problems, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Isler et al., 2020)</ref>.

The relationship between ideology and a preference for color-blindness over multiculturalism was most pronounced under high levels of rationality, i.e., for individuals who had higher cognitive abilities and engaged in reflective thinking (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>). More specifically, the relationship between conservatism and a relative preference for color-blindness (main effect of ideology) was more pronounced among individuals with relatively higher levels of cognitive ability (two-way interaction between ideology and cognitive ability), and this pattern was strengthened when individuals were prompted to engage in reflective thinking (three-way interaction between ideology, cognitive ability, and reflective thinking). This pattern was consistent and statistically significant for all indicators of ideology, except for economic conservatism where the interaction pattern was similar but not statistically significant (p = .099). Hence, using an experimental approach, Study 2 replicates Study 1 showing that the relationship between conservatism and a preference for color-blindness versus multiculturalism is especially pronounced among rational individuals. The results are visualized in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Including age and gender in the analyses did not meaningfully alter the results. The results of these additional analyses can be found on OSF. Note. Coefficients are standardized. Values between brackets represent 95% confidence intervals. 'Ideology' refers to the specific ideology considered as independent variable (IV) in each model (Model 1: RWA, Model 2: SDO, Model 3: Social conservatism, Model 4: Economic conservatism) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The relationship between ideology and attitudes towards color-blindness relative multiculturalism, depending on the interplay of reflective thinking and cognitive ability Note. The full line represents mean + 1SD on the cognitive ability measure and the shade represents its 95% confidence interval, the dotted line represents mean -1SD on the cognitive ability measure and the shade represents its 95% confidence interval. For each ideological measure, the left panel represents scores in the no reflection condition, the right panel represent scores in the reflection condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We found that US white majorities' support for color-blindness versus multiculturalism is a result of the interplay between their conservative ideological orientations and levels of rationality. Higher levels of conservatism were related to a relative preference for colorblindness, whereas lower levels of conservatism were related to a relative preference for multiculturalism. Critically, this pattern manifested mainly among relatively more rational individuals. This indicates that people support diversity positions and policies that align with their core ideological values, and that rationality increases the coherence of one's belief system.</p><p>The cognitive reflection test (Study 1) and cognitive ability (Study 2) were not significantly related to a preference for colorblindness over multiculturalism.</p><p>Results showed that participants who were most likely to be able to rationally analyze and understand the policies displayed attitudes that aligned more strongly with their core ideological beliefs. Among similar lines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kahan et al. (2012)</ref> found a polarizing role of science literacy on the relationship between cultural world views and perceptions of climate change risk.</p><p>The present results indicate that polarized attitudes about policies in the left-wing or right-wing direction should not be perceived as irrational, inconsiderate opinions, or stemming from lazy cognition. Given one's ideological core values, the endorsement of relatively more outspoken or 'extreme' attitudes about certain policies can originate from rational means to attain one's ideological goals. Consequently, appeals to encourage elaboration in order to change minds and thereby garner support for a particular opposing policy may be ineffective. Instead, they may even further entrench people in their ideology-congruent convictions about which policy is preferable.</p><p>In Study 2, we adopted a novel perspective and methodological approach on cognition by operationalizing rationality as the interplay between thinking ability and thinking style (based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stanovich et al., 2016)</ref>, and experimentally manipulating thinking style (based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Isler et al., 2020)</ref>. The observation that asking people to actively reflect on policies causes a stronger alignment between one's ideology and policy preferences, but only among those with relatively more cognitive abilities, signifies the theoretical and methodological importance to distinguish between cognitive styles and cognitive abilities, and consider their potential interplay. This interplay between thinking ability and thinking style has the potential to advance understanding of judgment and decision making across many domains, but is largely neglected in the empirical literature.</p><p>Our results also highlight the importance of situational and contextual factors in politics.</p><p>There are times in which people engage in or are prompted to engage in more elaborative reasoning about diversity policies, for example in the run-up to elections or when incidents take place that get a lot of (social) media attention. In situations such as these, the opinions of individuals with left versus right leaning political orientations might diverge as a consequence of elaboration. Moreover, this process is likely to be further reinforced since people often discuss political issues in echo chambers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cinelli et al., 2021)</ref>, and the discussion of thoughts and opinions among like-minded people leads to more extreme opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schkade et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Importantly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Knowles et al. (2009)</ref> showed that the term 'color-blindness' might mean something different depending on one's political ideology and perceptions of intergroup threat.</p><p>Specifically, high levels of threat prompt White majorities high in SDO to define the concept of color-blindness relatively more in terms of a procedural justice than a distributive justice principle. For this reason, we avoided the ideology-loaded terms of color-blindness and multiculturalism in our experiments. Since no single standard measurement method exists to assess attitudes towards color-blindness and multiculturalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mazzocco, 2017)</ref>, and different investigations use slightly different conceptualizations of color-blindness and multiculturalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Plaut et al., 2018)</ref>, we operationalized color-blindness and multiculturalism based on their most central defining characteristic, i.e. beliefs about whether racial characteristics matter, and should be considered or not (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Apfelbaum et al. 2012)</ref>. However, we wish to point out that other scholars have developed multi-faceted theoretical models of color-blindness. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mazzocco (2017)</ref> identified different variations of color-blindness, based upon people's degree of egalitarianism and awareness of racial inequality. Future research with a more direct focus on color-blindness might examine differences in the endorsement of these subtypes of colorblindness.</p><p>This research can be of applied relevance to policy makers and practitioners. Common approaches to changing minds entails encouraging elaboration that seek to garner support for a particular opposing policy view. The present results suggest that such practices may be ineffective and may actually further entrench people in their ideology-congruent convictions. In contrast, reframing policies so that they align more with the ideology of those that one wishes to persuade, might be a more promising avenue. For example, focusing on the value of multiculturalism as a tool for cultural preservation of both minority and majority culture might be appealing to relatively more conservative individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>In the present studies, we relied on <ref type="bibr">Azevedo et al.'s (2019)</ref> work that people generally pursue a coherent belief system, and built on the assumption that people with higher levels of rationality have the ability to develop a more coherent belief system. That is, we considered rationality as a source of participants' awareness of the potential societal implications of the two diversity beliefs. However, a limitation is that this assumption was not explicitly tested. An alternative account might be that people with higher levels of rationality also have a stronger motivation to develop coherent belief systems. Although this possibility does not detract from the present findings, investigating whether such motivation plays a role may provide further insights into the underlying mechanisms Moreover, we focused on White majority members in the US in the present investigation, a most relevant target group and context given its racial disparities and growing diversity.</p><p>Therefore, we prescreened participants based on nationality (US citizens) and ethnicity (White).</p><p>However, since exposure and experiences with different cultures impact intergroup orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Tadmor et al. 2012</ref>), a limitation of our studies is that we did not take participants' (historical)</p><p>immigration background into account.</p><p>The obtained results were robust, with comparable effects across two different studies, four different operationalizations of conservative ideology, and two different operationalizations of rationality. Nevertheless, a limitation is that our model was only tested in one country, and we explicitly caution against overgeneralizing the results across contexts and time. Relationships between ideological orientations and intergroup attitudes are context dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Roets et al., 2015)</ref>, and changes in societal awareness about color-blindness and multiculturalism might impact support for these perspectives. Indeed, political and racial beliefs are not fixed, and partly shaped by exposure to media coverage of public affairs and the discourse of political elites <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zaller, 1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Rationality polarizes diversity attitudes along ideological lines among White Americans.</p><p>That is, rationality guides conservative White majorities towards a preference for colorblindness, and liberal White majorities towards a preference for multiculturalism, as either policy presents a rational means to achieve their differently valued ideals. Insight in this dynamic may help us to better understand and acknowledge why people hold different viewpoints. Such acknowledgement rather than a normative approach, may be a necessary step to counter polarization on social issues. Ironically, rational appeals may thus further divide rather than unify public opinion on key social issues.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>this cognitive ability test, participants are presented with four different pictures and a list of 50 words of varying difficulty in their meaning (e.g. edible, bellicose).

Hence, when decisions are made, impressions are formed, and behaviors are enacted, all people should be treated in an identical manner, without regard to race and ethnicity') and a multicultural perspective ('I believe that we should pay attention to racial, ethnic and cultural differences. I believe that, although no group should be central, ethnic and racial identities actually do matter. They should be recognized and openly discussed.
