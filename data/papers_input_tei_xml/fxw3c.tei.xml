				<p>The long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in resting-state intrinsic brain activity is known to be associated with temporal behavioral patterns, including decision making based on internal criteria such as self-knowledge. However, the association between the neuronal LRTC and the subjective sense of identity remains to be explored; in other words, whether our subjective sense of consistent self across time relates to the temporal consistency of neural activity. The present study examined the relationship between the LRTC of resting-state scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and a subjective sense of identity measured by the Erikson Psychosocial Stage Inventory (EPSI). Consistent with our prediction based on previous studies of neuronal-behavioral relationships, the frontocentral alpha LRTC correlated negatively with identity confusion. Moreover, from the descriptive analyses, centroparietal beta LRTC showed negative correlations with identity confusion, and frontal theta LRTC showed positive relationships with identity synthesis. These results suggest that more temporal consistency (reversely, less random noise) in intrinsic brain activity is associated with less confused and better-synthesized identity. Our data provide further evidence that the LRTC of intrinsic brain activity might serve as a noise suppression mechanism at the psychological level.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the last two decades, studies have demonstrated that the intrinsic activity of the resting-state brain is not random noise, and instead exhibits scale-free temporal patterns, including slowly decaying autocorrelation, called long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . LRTC has been observed using several neuroimaging modalities, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . LRTC emerges from the neuronal network with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , and is thought to reflect the ability of brain networks to integrate information over extended periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> .</p><p>Such temporal neuronal features link with temporal patterns in behavior <ref type="bibr">16-18 ,</ref> including those related to decision making based on one's internal criteria, known as internally-guided decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nakao et al. (2019)</ref> reported that participants who showed stronger LRTC in resting-state frontocentral (FCz) alpha (8-13Hz) EEC showed higher temporal-consistency of the decision in occupational preference judgment tasks (e.g., "Which occupation would you rather? … Lawyer or Designer").</p><p>Together with other relevant results from simulation and task-related brain activities, they concluded that participants with stronger frontocentral alpha LRTC (i.e., less random neural dynamics) had less random noise-contaminated internal criteria. Since internal criteria basically correspond to self-knowledge, which is knowledge of one's traits, sense of values, and beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> , this finding is consistent with the idea that our self has a central role in suppressing random noise by integrating information <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> . In contrast to the relationship between LRTC at the neuronal level and less randomness at the behavioral level <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> , the relationship between temporal consistency (reversely, less randomness) in the neuronal and subjective mental levels remains to be elucidated.</p><p>A subjective sense of integrated and coherent self across time is conceptualized as identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30</ref> . This subjective experience of identity consists of two fundamental components: identity synthesis and identity confusion. Identity synthesis is a feeling that one's self is temporally continuous and consistent and one knows where one is headed (e.g., a sense of knowing their purpose and direction), while identity confusion refers to a feeling of one's self as temporally changeable and fragmented, and one is indecisive and unable to keep commitments to important life decisions (e.g., a sense of feeling mixed up) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> . Identity synthesis and confusion are not polar opposites but exist simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31</ref> . Since decision making and identity are assumed to have close relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35</ref> , a similar relationship between neuronal LRTC and decision making is also expected in the context of identity.</p><p>Although the relationship between identity and gray matter volume has been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36</ref> , no previous studies have addressed the relationship between identity and the temporal dynamics of intrinsic brain activity. Besides, neuronal LRTC in both fMRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37</ref> and EEG 38 is known to relate to private self-consciousness, which is the tendency of attending to one's inner thoughts and feelings <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40</ref> . However, private self-consciousness does not reflect the aspect of the temporal consistency itself, and has been conceptually distinguished from identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref> .</p><p>The present study aims to investigate the link between temporal consistency of intrinsic brain activity (i.e., LRTC) and the subjective sense of temporal consistency of one's self (i.e., identity). We focused on alpha range LRTC at the frontocentral electrode (FCz) based on previous studies that examined the relationship between neuronal LRTC and internally-guided decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">45</ref> was applied to quantify LRTC, and the larger DFA exponent (DFAe), within a range of 0.5 to 1.0, was reflective of a high degree of LRTC. The Erikson Psychosocial</p><p>Stage Inventory (EPSI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47</ref> , which measures the degree of identity synthesis and confusion, was applied to assess identity. We hypothesize that frontocentral alpha LRTC is positively correlated with identity synthesis and/or is negatively correlated with identity confusion. This hypothesis is based on the finding of a previous study 20 in which participants with stronger frontocentral alpha LRTC (i.e., less random neural dynamics) showed less random noise-contaminated internal criteria (i.e., selfknowledge). Since we had a specific hypothesis, we applied one-tailed statistical tests for those relationships. Nevertheless, we had no specific hypothesis regarding whether identity synthesis or confusion correlates with LRTC, and as such, we examined this point exploratively. That is, we avoided type I error inflation by applying a Bonferroni adjusted p-value for the two correlation analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LRTC</head><p>Since our hypothesis focuses on alpha range LRTC at FCz based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> , <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the results of resting-state alpha range DFAe at FCz. The average DFAe was 0.73 (SD = 0.10) at FCz. The ICC was calculated to estimate the reliability of DFAe in the present data, and the ICC of DFAe was found to be acceptable (0.72, 95% CI = 0.55, 0.83).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surrogated data analysis was conducted in order to confirm whether the</head><p>DFAe of the present data reflected non-random temporal structure. The grand average LRTC and identity 5 of the surrogated alpha DFAe was 0.60 (SD = 0.05) at FCz; this result was smaller than the original DFAe values (0.73). The critical value that corresponded to the higher one percentile of the mean surrogated DFAe was 0.61, which was smaller than the observed mean DFAe (0.73). These results indicated that the DFAe of the present data reflected the non-random temporal structure of the phase. values are similar to those reported in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48</ref> .</p><p>In order to confirm the external validity of identity synthesis and confusion, the degree of depressive tendency was measured using the Japanese version <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">49</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the correlation between the alpha DFAe at FCz and the identity (synthesis or confusion). Bonferroni correction was applied for the two correlation analyses between DFAe and the two identity factors (synthesis and confusion) in order to avoid type I error inflation. No significant correlation was found between the alpha    It is intriguing that the (negative) correlation with frontocentral alpha LRTC was found only in identity confusion, albeit we expected that the (positive) correlation would be also be found in identity synthesis. The prediction with respect to the frontocentral alpha was based on the finding of the previous decision making study <ref type="bibr">20 ,</ref> in which LRTC was associated with less noise on internal criteria. Given that a result consistent with the prediction was found only in the identity confusion, the small amount of noise contained in the internal criteria may be perceived as the subjective sense of identity confusion. The relationship between internally-guided decision making and the subjective sense of identity has not been explored, and this point needs to be examined in future studies. Meanwhile, the salience of identity confusion is in line with the findings of the previous studies on identity. Indeed, identity confusion was related to more diverse dimensions of psychological well-being and adjustment than identity synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48</ref> . These findings suggest that the lack of temporal coherence in one's sense of identity may be especially problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32</ref> . Taken together, our results provide a novel insight into the relationship between alpha LRTC and identity; thus, mechanisms for the link between LRTC and identity might be different between identity synthesis and identity confusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between LRTC and identity</head><p>In addition to our focus on the alpha range, in the analysis for descriptive purposes, we observed that the frontal theta LRTC correlated with identity synthesis, and the centroparietal beta LRTC correlated with identity confusion <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3</ref>). The directions of the correlations were consistent with our hypotheses, but the frequency ranges and channels were outside the scope of prediction. Although the details of the underlying mechanism of these correlations are unclear, our results suggest that identity synthesis and confusion are associated with different spatiotemporal neural substrates, at least for the sample used by us.</p><p>Frontal theta relates to the activity within the medial prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr">55,56 ,</ref> which is a part of the default mode network (DMN). The DMN is the first identified resting-state network <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">58</ref> , and has an essential role in the internal/self-oriented cognitive process <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">60</ref> . Given that the LRTC emerges from the network with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , it is possible that the well-organized theta range activity within the medial prefrontal cortex relates to the subjective sense of identity synthesis.</p><p>Regarding the beta ranges, Nikulin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">61</ref> reported that schizophrenia showed attenuation of LRTC, including the occipitoparietal channels. Schizophrenia is thought to be characterized by increased neuronal noise based on a reduction in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">62</ref> . Given that schizophrenia is associated with identity confusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">64</ref> , we postulate that identity confusion might be associated with reduced excitatory and inhibitory connections, similar to that observed in schizophrenia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future implications</head><p>Although we revealed the link between neuronal temporal consistency and subjective sense of identity for the first time, the following limitations should be considered. First, the sample of the present study was limited to undergraduate and graduate students in Japan, which may inhibit the generalizability of our findings. LRTC is known to change with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , and careful consideration of cultural differences is essential for the study of identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">65</ref> . Considering the correlation between LRTC and identity confusion was not strong (rho = -0.27), it is essential to confirm reproducibility using a larger sample population in further studies.</p><p>Second, the largest time scale to calculate DFAe was 16 seconds, similar to that performed by Meisel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> ; thus, the LRTC with a larger time scale was not reflected in the present results. We applied an automatized preprocessing procedure as outlined previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> , in order to avoid the effect of artifacts. In cases using epochs with a longer time (e.g., 30 seconds), the proportion of the rejected epochs are increased, which results in a decreased signal-noise ratio. We selected 20 second epochs for the present dataset in order to keep the available data after applying preprocessing.</p><p>Additional studies are needed to examine the relationship between LRTC with longer time scales and identity.</p><p>Third, the tripartite relationship between LRTC, internally-guided decision making, and identity remains unclear. While Nakao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> reported the most obvious correlation between LRTC and internally guided decision making in the alpha band, the present data showed that LRTC in the theta and beta bands had close relationships with identity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> and 3). Those findings suggest that the relationships between LRTC and internally-guided decision making or identity do not necessarily capture an analogous brain-mind association. These tripartite relationships remain an issue for future consideration.</p><p>Fourth, the correlation in our main finding was not strong (rho = -0.27;   <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">66</ref> , which tap into exploration and commitment, must also be included in future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In the current study, we demonstrate that the neuronal noise of intrinsic activity, as indexed by its frontocentral alpha LRTC, is related to the subjective sense of identity confusion. At the same time, although reported for descriptive purposes only, negative correlations between LRTCs and identity confusion were also found in the occipitoparietal beta band, while positive correlations between LRTC and identity synthesis were found in the frontal theta band. Thus, less noise and more temporal consistency in the intrinsic activity, as indexed by a higher LRTC in different bands and channels, may be involved in lower degrees of random noise at the psychological level of sense of identity (i.e., less confused and well-synthesized identity). Our data provide further evidence that the LRTC of intrinsic activity might serve as a noise suppression mechanism at the psychological level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Based on an a prior power test for one-tailed correlation (statistical power =0.80, type I error probability = 0.05, effect size = 0.30) and the predicted sample reduction in EEG preprocessing, 87 healthy undergraduate and graduate students (47 male; age range, 18-36 years; mean age, 21.5 years) were recruited from Hiroshima University. We confirmed the following based on the participants' self-reports: All participants were native Japanese speakers, right-handed, with normal or corrected-tonormal vision. All were free of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and none of the participants were medicated, habitual drinkers, or smokers. We instructed all participants to avoid consuming caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine within the 3 hours before starting the experiment, which they followed. All experimental protocols were conducted in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations approved by the Ethical Committee of the Graduate School of Education, Hiroshima University. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the experiment, and each participant was paid a small fee for participation.</p><p>After the automatized preprocessing of resting-state EEG (see below for more details), 16 participants, who remained less than 10 epochs (20 seconds epochs with 75 % overlapped) data, one participant who reported that they slept during the restingstate EEG recording, and two participants with missing questionnaire data were excluded. Thus, a total of 68 participants (34 male; age range, 18-36 years; mean age = 20.96 years) were included in the final analyses.</p><p>The data used in the present study were collected as a part of an ongoing project at the Cognitive Psychology Laboratory of Hiroshima University to investigate associations among resting-state EEG, behavioral performance, and personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">67</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>Prior to the experiment, participants were informed about the experimental procedure, read an information sheet, and signed the consent form.

The scale consisted of 20 items, and the sample item included " I was bothered by things that usually don't bother me".

A ground electrode was placed at AFz. Although the reference electrode was positioned on the tip of the nose during on-line recording, all electrodes were later re-referenced to the average reference. Eye movements and blinking were monitored with electrodes above and below the right eye (vertical electrooculogram; VEOG). The electrode impedance, measured after the placement of electrodes, was less than 20 kΩ, which was in accordance with the recommendation of Brain Products <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">68</ref> . The EEG signals were amplified with a low-pass of 250 Hz, and were digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz using a Brain Amp DC-EEG recorder (BP-01110; Brain Products GmbH., Gilching, Germany).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EEG preprocessing</head><p>Preprocessing of resting-state EEG data was conducted by EEGLAB toolbox (ver.14.1.2b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">69</ref> running on Matlab 9.4.0 (The Mathworks Inc.). The EOG channels were removed from the data, and the automatized artifact rejection methods were based on those used in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . Data were down-sampled to 250 Hz and were filtered using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, with a low-pass of 50 Hz and a highpass of 1 Hz. The 'clean_rawdata' EEGLAB plug-in was used to remove bad channels and non-stationary artifacts with the Artifact Subspace Reconstruction method (ASR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">70</ref> . Channels with a flat line longer than 5 seconds, with less than 0.85 correlation with their reconstruction from neighboring channels, or those with line noise more than 4 standard deviations (SD) from the other channels, were removed.</p><p>The mean number of the removed channels across participants was 2.03 (SD = 1.91).</p><p>A threshold of 20 SD was used for non-stationary artifact correction. The time windows were rejected if the artifact contaminated more than 25% of the channels, even after applying ASR. The rejected channels were spherically interpolated using the 'pop_interp' function. EEG data were re-referenced to an average reference.</p><p>Independent component analysis (ICA) was used for the rejection of stationary artifacts (e.g., eye movement) from the EEG data. An adaptive Mixture of ICA (AMICA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">71</ref> was conducted once for each participant's data. The number of ICs was determined by the rank of the EEG data matrix. An equivalent current dipole was estimated for each IC (DIPFIT EEGLAB plug-in using the Fieldtrip toolbox). The selection of ICs and fitting of the bilateral dipole were performed using the 'fitTwoDipole' EEGLAB plug-in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">72</ref> . The ICs were rejected based on the criteria of dipoles with more than 15% residual variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">73</ref> , and the outside brain was rejected.</p><p>On average, 41.78 (SD = 5.17) ICs were rejected from the data of each participant, and 19.19 ICs (SD = 4.99) were retained. The retained number of ICs was similar to that of the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . The remaining ICs were back-projected onto the scalp electrodes to obtain artifact-free EEG data. To leave as many epochs as possible, and thus to increase the signal-noise ratio, the EEG data were segmented into 20-second epochs as outlined previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . The epochs were 75% overlapped, and if the epochs contained a boundary as the result of ASR time window rejection, the epochs were rejected. The data of 16 participants, which retained less than 10 epochs after the artifact rejection, were removed from the following analyses. The averaged retained number of epochs for the 68 participants was 38.29 (SD = 13.84).</p></div>

By following the methods described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nakao et al. (2019)</ref>, two types of mean surrogated data were calculated for the DFAe.

The mean surrogated DFAe was then used to calculate a critical value, which corresponds to a higher percentile of the mean surrogated DFAe <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">75</ref> . The second type was the mean surrogated DFAe for each participant, which was calculated by averaging the DFAe across the 2,000 surrogated data for each participant. These data were used to examine the relationship with the EPSI scores.</p></div>

The red circle on each topo map indicates an electrode; the data from which is shown in the scatterplot.DiscussionThe present study sought to investigate the relationship between neural temporal consistency and subjective sense of identity. Consistent with our hypothesis, individuals with higher alpha range LRTC in the frontocentral channel had a less subjective sense of identity confusion(Figure 2(b), see alsoFigure 4for a LRTC and identity 9 schematic summary). Although the correlation was not strong (rho = -0.27), this finding is consistent with that of the previous study regarding the relationship between neuronal level and behavioral level. Specifically, a higher frontocentral alpha LRTC (i.e., less neuronal noise) was associated with high consistency (i.e., less randomness) in occupation preference judgment<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . Thus, the temporal dynamics reflected in the LRTC of intrinsic brain activity likely have a crucial role in the consistency of self, including the subjective level, namely, a sense of identity.</figDesc></figure>

Participants used a chin rest to maintain their head position and minimize the movement during recording. Participants performed 5 minutes of eyes-closed baseline periods, in which participants were instructed to relax. After the resting-state recording, participants completed a short questionnaire, which involved items relating to whether they kept closing their eyes, whether they remained wakeful during the recording, and the ninepoint scale subjective-rating of arousal level during the resting-state recording. Identity synthesis and confusion were assessed by the identity subscale of the Erikson Psychosocial Stage Inventory 46 (Japanese version validated by Hatano et al. 47 ). The scale consists of 12 items (6 items for identity synthesis and 6 items for identity confusion), and the response scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The sample items include the following: For synthesis, "I know what kind of person I am" and "I've got a clear idea of what I want to be"; and for confusion "I feel mixed up" and "I can't decide what I want to do with my life"</figDesc></figure>

A larger DFA exponent (DFAe), within 0.5 to 1.0, reflects a high degree of long-range temporal correlation. A 62-degree FIR filter was applied to extract the alpha range (lower cut-off frequency = 8 Hz, upper cut-off frequency = 13Hz) EEG time series for each artifact-free 20-second epoch. The Hilbert transform was used to calculate the amplitude envelope, and the cumulative sum of the envelope was computed. Twenty-six time windows of log-linearly increasing length from 1 s to 20 s were extracted with a 0% overlap from each epoch, and each of these time window was linearly detrended using a least-squares fit; this was set to 0% overlap, since the epoch itself was extracted with the 75% overlap to increase the number of remaining epochs during preprocessing. The SD of the detrended data was computed for each time window. The average of the SD across all the time windows of the same size from all epochs were used as the fluctuation function, F(t). F(t) was plotted for all time window sizes on the logarithmic axes. The exponent of DFA (i.e., the linear slope of the trend line in the 2-16 s range; DFAe) was estimated according to Meisel et al.
