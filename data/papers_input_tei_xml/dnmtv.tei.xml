			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a quantum-mechanical model that represents a human system of beliefs as quantized energy levels of a physical system. This model underscores a novel perspective on opinion dynamics, recreating a broad range of experimental and real-world data that exhibit an asymmetry of opinion radicalization. In particular, the model demonstrates the phenomena of pronounced conservatism versus mild liberalism when individuals are exposed to opposing views, mirroring recent findings on opinion polarization via social media exposure. Advancing this model, we establish a solid framework that integrates elements from physics, psychology, and philosophy, and also emphasize the inherent advantages of the quantum approach over traditional classical models. Our findings enhance ongoing efforts to elucidate psychological, behavioral, and decision-making phenomena using the laws of quantum mechanics. These results also lend additional support to the quantum mind hypothesis, suggesting that the most radicalized opinions may not necessarily mirror the most firmly held beliefs but are driven by strongly held opinions and exposure to dissenting views.</p>

In the context of religion, we observe polarization in the form of divergent beliefs on topics such as abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and the role of religion in public life <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.

Opinions on technological issues involving artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and data privacy are further examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance Statement</head><p>This work presents a unique intersection of physics, psychology, and philosophy, using the principles of quantum mechanics to model the dynamics of human belief systems and opinion formation. The proposed quantum model has significant implications not only for understanding social and political polarization, but also for making sense of complex decision-making processes. Importantly, our findings also support the quantum mind hypothesis, suggesting that cognitive processes might share certain characteristics with quantum-physical systems. Thus, the proposed model may serve as a launching pad for future interdisciplinary research, fostering a deeper understanding of how a human mind operates and how opinions evolve, polarize, and radicalize in the increasingly interconnected world.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. In each of these studies, groups exhibited the backfire effect after being subjected to an opposing view. Note: Each of the horizontal axes should be read independently. Results from the cited papers are normalized to be presented on a scale from -1 to 1. The figure demonstrates the direction and magnitude of the backfire effect for one or more groups in each study, showcasing that Republicans, people highly concerned with vaccination side effects, climate change deniers, and religious people are more likely to become more conservative, more likely to refuse vaccination, more likely to deny climate change, and more likely to object to the abortion rights, respectively, after being subjected to opposing views. At the same time, Democrats and non-religious people exhibit a much lower backfire effect in magnitude than their Republican and religious counterparts, respectively. The counterpart views are not available for all studies.</p><p>bias, referring the tendency of people to give more credence to evidence that supports their preexisting beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>To further understand the complex dynamics of the backfire effect, our work advances a model derived from the principles of quantum mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. This approach provides a unique perspective for comprehending and quantifying opinion radicalization, elucidating the evolution of individual beliefs when exposed to counter-attitudinal information and revealing its contribution to societal polarization.</p><p>Examining societal opinion dynamics through the lens of this quantum-inspired model bears considerable implications. This model reproduces the asymmetric behavior of opinion radicalization commonly observed when individuals confront opposing views. Such a radicalization, augmented by the backfire effect, is prominently manifested in political domains. For instance, in the political arena of the United States, exposure to counter-attitudinal information typically results in an entrenchment of beliefs among both Democrats and Republicans. However, Republicans have been observed to radicalize to a higher degree than Democrats in response to conflicting perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the applications of the model are not limited to politics since the phenomenon of radicalization applies to other societal issues such as climate change, gun control, and vaccinations, often leading to an intensification of individuals' initial beliefs when they are presented with contrasting evidence or viewpoints. Our model elucidates this counter-intuitive dynamics, thus offering a new perspective on the complex landscape of human beliefs and opinions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> provides empirical evidence of the "double-sided" polarization behavior triggered by the backfire effect, observed in the domains of politics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> and abortion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Conversely, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> the domains of climate change (2) and vaccination (6) are marked by a seemingly "one-sided" view. This discrepancy arises due to missing data for these areas as studies focusing on climate change and vaccinations typically present scientifically accurate information in experimental treatments without offering opposing viewpoints.</p><p>The apparent limitation of the available motivational data should not be perceived as a detriment to our investigation since our model can predict radicalization trends in contexts where data on opposing views are unavailable or scarce. Thus, by elucidating such trends, we aspire to contribute to an interdisciplinary understanding of opinion dynamics, with the potential of informing interventions that could mitigate polarization and foster more productive and respectful societal dialogues.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposed model reveals the fundamental origin of advantages over classical models in understanding the radicalization of opinions, thereby providing a robust framework that can predict opinion changes with superior accuracy and reliability. This model also contributes to the growing body of research exploring the plausibility of the "quantum mind" hypothesis, which posits that the principles of quantum mechanics could underlie cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. In particular, through its successful simulation of experimental data on opinion dynamics, the model provides further arguments supporting the potential of this hypothesis.</p><p>The examples of the backfire effect in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> provide evidence of the scale and gravity of polarization across multiple dimensions of our society. Yet, understanding these dynamics is only the first step. The ultimate goal is to leverage these insights and devise strategies to alleviate the destructive effects of radicalization and polarization. By offering a comprehensive and robust framework to interpret these dynamics, the proposed quantum-mechanical model stands to make a contribution to these efforts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantized Energy Level Model of the System of Human</head><p>Beliefs. The application of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics in the fields of behavioral science, economics and decision-making has opened up novel opportunities for unifying and formalizing previously heuristically formulated psychological, cognitive and finance-related concepts and ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. In particular, an analogy between mental states and quantum states has been used to explain cognitive dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. A similar approach has been adopted in models of confirmation bias (30, 31), two-stage gambling (28), Prisoner's Dilemma game <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, conjunction fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref> and Ellsberg paradox <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. However, although there exist classical models of confirmation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>, opinion formation and polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, and backfire effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>, the principles of quantum mechanics have not been applied to these psychological phenomena yet.</p><p>We propose a quantum-mechanical model of human system of beliefs (see the inset in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>) and demonstrate its application to opinion radicalization and backfire effect. It is well-known that quantum-mechanical system can have only certain energies levels compared with a continuum of energy states of a classical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Therefore, we represent the system of human beliefs as a set of discrete energy levels. Furthermore, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> we draw a parallel between the social circles and atomic orbitals used in quantum mechanics to describe the location and wave properties of an electron in an atom <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. The electrons occupy atomic orbitals that have discrete energy levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. When atoms interact, their atomic orbitals overlap and energy levels hybridize <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. We adopt this physical property to model the influence of social circles on the system of beliefs of an individual.</p><p>The proposed model stands on solid psychological, philosophical, mathematical and physical ground. Firstly, it is consistent with both notion of discrete mental states <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> and understanding of information as energy states of a physical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>. Secondly, the model captures psychological <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> and mathematical (34, 49) complexity of a system of human beliefs. Thirdly, the model aligns with the famous philosophical maxim pronounced by Ortega y Gasset: "Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia" ("I am me and my circumstance") [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>, p. 322; a link between Ortega y Gasset's circumstance and quantum aspects of cognition has also been established <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>]. In the model, the circumstance is represented by interactions between atoms and its influence results in a change of the energy level structure. Finally, any outcome produced by the model originates from a rigorous solution of the fundamental Schrödinger equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>To establish a physico-mathematical connection between the energy levels and a system of human beliefs, we employ a harmonic quantum oscillator model represented by an electron trapped in a one-dimensional rectangular well, where the energy states are quantized as En ∝ (n/L) 2 , being n = 1, 2, . . . the number of the energy state and L the width of the well (26) (for simplicity, it is assumed that the well has an infinite depth). Noting that potential wells of different width L have different allowable energy levels En, we arrange two or more potential wells into a chain to represent interactions of an individual with social neighbors <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3)</ref>.</p><p>We also use the fact that electrons can change energy levels by emitting or absorbing a photon and note that crystalline solids can have energy bands that consist of many closely located discrete energy levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. In the latter case, although electrons are restricted to the band energies, they can assume a continuum of energy values inside a band.</p><p>Given this, we postulate that in our model a rather regular and sparse energy level pattern corresponds to a polarized (biased) set of beliefs, but the beliefs of an idealized unbiased person or a group of individuals are represented by a continuum of energy values. Of course, other scenarios are also possible, including the case of several continuum state bands separated by large energy gaps that would correspond to division of opinions into sub-groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>.</p><p>All model assumptions have a strict physical meaning. If a person holds deeply polarized beliefs, a significant amount of information would be needed to ameliorate the situation (53), for example, by means of metacognitive training <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>. Since information has been associated with energy <ref type="bibr">(45-47, 55, 56)</ref>, the quantum-mechanical model captures this scenario as a large energy needed for an electron to transition from one energy level to another. However, a set of densely packed Opinion polarization in social networks. We first use our model to capture the phenomenon of opinion polarization in a social network. When two individuals do not interact and are not influenced by the news media, the systems of their beliefs, represented by the energy levels, remain unchanged because the corresponding wave functions-probability waves that govern the motion of the electron and are described by the Schrödinger equation <ref type="formula">26</ref>-do not overlap. However, as a result of information exchange between these individuals, the potential wells move closer one to another and the wave functions overlap, thereby forcing the energy levels to adjust and split such that they remain unique <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, similarly to interactions between atoms, when a large number N of identical potential wells are arranged into a chain, which corresponds to the interaction between N individuals, each discrete energy level splits into N levels. The energy of transition between the so-formed adjacent levels becomes negligibly small so that they can be considered as a continuum, i.e. as an energy band <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. However, much larger energy is required to transition between the bands, which in the framework of our model means a polarization of opinion. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> shows a result of simulation of this scenario, where we form a social network of like-minded individuals, i.e. individuals whose systems of beliefs are represent by the same discrete energy level systems. We take into account a large number of members of the social group and represent them as a periodically arranged sequence (one-dimensional lattice) of identical potential wells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3a)</ref>.</p><p>In the calculation, we define the period of repetition of the potential wells as a and apply Floquet periodic boundary conditions used in solid state physics to approximate a large system using a small part called the unit cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. We consider a reciprocal lattice that represents the Fourier transform of the periodic lattice of potential wells in the physical space (the x-coordinate in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3a</ref>) and that exists in the reciprocal space of wavevector k. According to the convention adopted in the field of solid state physics, we plot an energy dispersion diagram as a function of the normalized wavevector ka/π in the range of values corresponding to the first Brillouin zone that defines the unit cell in the reciprocal space <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</p><p>The main panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3b</ref> shows the calculated energy dispersion diagram (the solid curves) alongside the energy levels of a standalone single potential well (the dashed lines). The former represent the group opinion formed in a social network of like-minded individuals but the latter corresponds to the opinion of one individual considered separately from social neighbors. The right inset to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3b</ref> shows the discrete energy levels corresponding to the group (the solid lines) and the isolated individual (the dashed lines). In this calculation, the depth and width of the wells are 0.1 eV and 1 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</p><p>We can see that, in the group, the original energy levels corresponding to the individuals split and self-arrange, forming several allowed energy bands separated by band gaps (regions of forbidden energies). The formation of energy bands <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Example of opinion polarization. (a) Like-minded individuals are exposed to an opposing opinion, represented by a one-dimensional lattice of identical potential wells with a "defect" lattice node given by an irregular well. A super cell approach described in the main text is employed in the calculation. (b) Main panel: Energy dispersion diagram corresponding to the group opinion before the exposure to an opposing opinion (the solid curves) and after it (the dotted curves). The respective energy level structures are shown in the left inset. Note that the exposure to the opposing opinion results in addition of new discrete energy levels and splitting of the existing ones, which can be seen both in the right and central insets and which is interpreted as opinion polarization. The degree of opinion polarization can be estimated computing the energy difference between the lowest and highest energy levels, as shown in the central inset.</p><p>corresponds to the polarization of opinions: the opinions of the group participants is more likely to remain withing the energy bands but changes of opinion are less likely because a high energy is required for an interband transition.</p><p>Opinion radicalization. Now we showcase the ability of the model to capture the backfire effect and opinion radicalization in social networks. As an example, we refer to a study demonstrating that exposure to opposing views on social media can radicalize political views <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. In the cited paper, members of the Republican and Democratic parties received financial compensation to follow officials and opinion leaders with opposing political views. As a result of the experiment, compared with the control group, both Republican and Democrat participants developed more radicalized views with respect to their respective traditional party positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Interestingly, the degree of opinion radicalization was different among the two groups: the Republican participants showed substantially more conservative views but the Democrat participants exhibited just a slight but statistically significant increase in liberal attitudes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, top panel)</ref>.</p><p>The corresponding model situation is presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>, where persons with the same systems of beliefs, represented by regular potential wells, are exposed to an opposing opinion expressed by a person represented by an irregular potential well. Unlike the regular potential wells that are 0.1 eV deep and 1 nm wide, the irregular well is 0.07 eV deep and 2 nm wide. Subsequently, the allowed energy levels of an individual irregular well taken alone are significantly shifted with respect to those of an individual regular well. To account for the presence of the irregular well in an otherwise periodic sequence of identical regular wells, we employ a super cell computational approach that is often used to model a crystallographic defect-an interruption of the regular patterns of arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</p><p>In the main panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 4b</ref>, the solid lines denote the energy dispersion diagram corresponding to a polarized opinion in a group of like-minded individuals, which corresponds to the control group (i.e. the irregular well is replaced by a regular one). The dotted lines plot the energy dispersion in the case of exposure to an opposing opinion. The corresponding energy bands are shown in the inset. For the sake of presentation, we limit the energy range of interest to 0 . . . 0.1 eV. We also note that the introduction of a super cell consisting of N cell potential wells effectively folds the Brillouin zone, modifying the energy dispersion curves and requiring an adjustment of the wavevector normalization as kaN cell /π compared with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3b</ref>.</p><p>We can see that the exposure to an opposing opinion changes the energy level structure because a defect in an otherwise perfectly periodic lattice of potential wells produces a series of sparse energy levels. As we stipulated that a sparse energy level pattern corresponds to a polarized set of beliefs, we conclude that our model reproduces the backfire effect.</p><p>According to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, the radicalization also occurs in a reverse scenario illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5a</ref>, where the majority opinion is represented by the potential well considered in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref> as irregular. We simulate this scenario by a super cell consisting of 0.07 eV deep and 2 nm wide potential wells containing a 0.1 eV deep and 1 nm wide irregular well <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5a)</ref>.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a. (a)</ref> Like-minded individuals are exposed to an opposing opinion, represented by a one-dimensional lattice of identical potential wells with a "defect" lattice node. Unlike in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>, the irregular well is deep and narrow but the majority opinion wells are shallow and wide. (b) Main panel: Energy dispersion diagram corresponding to the group opinion before the exposure to an opposing opinion (the solid curves) and after it (the dotted curves). The respective energy level structures are shown in the left inset. Even though the exposure to the opposing opinion results in addition of new discrete energy levels and splitting of the existing ones as in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4b</ref>, these processes are less pronounced thereby indicating a lower degree of opinion polarization with respect to the scenario modeled in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.</p><p>The corresponding result is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5b</ref>, where we also observe that the exposure to an opposite view leads to the formation of sparse discrete energy levels, i.e. to a radicalization of the group opinion. We can also see that the sparse energy levels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5b</ref> are quantitatively different from those in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4b, which</ref> indicates that the levels of opinion radicalization corresponding to the results presented in these figures are also different.</p><p>To provide a measure of radicalization, we calculate the energy difference between the highest and lowest energy states of the top energy bands in the insets to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4b and Fig. 5b</ref>. Comparing the ratios of these energies corresponding to the group opinion and radicalized opinion (see the solid and dotted lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4b and Fig. 5b</ref>), we reveal that the opinion radicalization in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> is an order of magnitude stronger than in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>. This result is consistent with the ratio of the experimental values in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, top panel)</ref>.</p><p>Similar results hold for a wide range of realistic physical parameters and profiles of potential wells. The model can also be extended to two and three spatial dimensions, being able, in general, to represent interactions in an N -dimensional space <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. It is also noteworthy that a potential well profile capturing an intricate system of beliefs can be arbitrary complex depending on objectives of the model. For example, one can use a machine learning techniques to synthesize a profile that encodes human emotions and brain activity using the well-known algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Physical aspects. While the ability of quantum-mechanical models of psychological effects and decision-making processes to outperform their classical counterparts has been demonstrated in many works <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58)</ref>, the exact origin of advantages of quantum approaches remains disputed. To address this challenge in the context of our model, consider the interaction between two individuals-Alice and Bob-in the context of a classical model that considers the nodes of a network as opinions that can assume one of the two allowable states ξ ′ and ξ ′′ (34). These dynamical states can be represented by two identical physical particles defined at any time by the position and momentum ξA ≡ (rA, pA) and ξB ≡ (rB, pB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> Assuming that Alice's opinion is in a certain state ξ ′ and that of Bob is in the state ξ ′′ , we can write that H(ξ ′ , ξ ′′ ) =Ĥ(ξ ′′ , ξ ′ ). This result implies that in a classical model the common opinion state of a group consisting of two individuals is known to within the permutation of the individuals. This ambiguity does not represent any difficulty in modeling opinion polarization. However, it does not enable us to differentiate the impact of Bob's views on Alice's opinion and vice versa at a fundamental level due to the symmetry of H, thus implying that qualitative agreement with the result from (8) cannot be achieved.</p><p>The treatment of this scenario using methods of quantum mechanics leads to a different outcome. Indeed, assuming that the states of Alice and Bob are ψ ′ (r) and ψ ′′ (r), which represent wave packets associated with the particles, it can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> that the observation of the interaction between Alice and Bob does not permit to decide whether the group opinion is in the state ψ(rA, rB) ≡ ψ ′ (rA)ψ ′′ (rB) or ψ(rA, rB) ≡ ψ ′′ (rA)ψ ′ (rB). This situation is called exchange degeneracy and it originates from the fact that the functions ψ andψ are both eigenfunctions corresponding to a set values produced by the measurement. Subsequently, any linear combination αψ + βψ with |α| 2 + |β| 2 = 1 can be the outcome of measurement. As a result, it is unknown which linear combination represents the state of the system.</p><p>Quantum mechanics removes the exchange degeneracy introducing a symmetrization postulate that fixes the coefficients α and β of the linear combination of the states ψ and ψ <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. As a result, the states of a system of N interacting identical particles are necessarily either all symmetrical or all antisymmetrical with respect to N permutations. Since the proposed model uses the properties of electrons, the corresponding state are antisymmetrical and they are governed by the Pauli exclusion principle stating that no two electrons can occupy the same individual quantum state.</p><p>This result is important for capturing the asymmetry of the backfire effect. In particular, since in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> data are not available for the pro-vaccine groups and climate change believers, one might first fit the model parameters for reproducing the degree of radicalization of vaccine skeptics and then use the so-calibrated model to estimate the degree of polarization of vaccine supporters. A similar procedure can be applied to climate change believers data.</p><p>Psychological aspects. The implications of the proposed model for psychology and decision-making are profound due to the ability of quantum physics to describe certain aspects of human cognition and behavior that classical models have struggled to represent effectively. The principle of superposition, for instance, captures the idea that our minds can hold conflicting ideas or attitudes at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>. This phenomenon is often observed in human cognition, with people simultaneously maintaining disparate views until a decision point forces them to "collapse" into one position or another.</p><p>Moreover, the ability of the proposed model to leverage the laws of quantum physics presents unique advantages for understanding how polarized opinions form and evolve within social groups. The interactions of individuals, viewed as interacting particles, provide a powerful metaphor for the complex and dynamic nature of human opinions and beliefs. These interactions can lead to changes in "energy", which is a metaphor used by us for the degree of radicalization or polarization within a group.</p><p>Crucially, this quantum-mechanical approach allows for a differentiation of the impact of one individual's views on another, which is a functionality that is difficult to implement in classical models due to exchange degeneracy. This novel perspective offers potential pathways for designing more effective interventions to mitigate extreme polarization and radicalization using the concept of quantized energy levels.</p><p>Finally, incorporating quantum mechanics into models of psychological phenomena could allow for significant advancements in the study of human cognition and decision-making processes. Much like the quantum leap in computational power provided by quantum computers compared with classical digital computers (59), quantum-enhanced models could help overcome certain fundamental limitations in understanding human behavior and decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This paper demonstrates the potential of a quantummechanical model to illustrate, interpret, and explain the dynamics of opinion polarization and radicalization in social networks. We have shown that the structure of energy levels of a quantum system, specifically of a chain of potential wells, can effectively model social dynamics such as interactions between individuals and groups.</p><p>Our results indicate that the phenomenon of opinion polarization can be represented by the formation of continuous energy bands and interband gaps when like-minded individuals interact within a social network. These energy bands represent the polarized groups, with transitions between them requiring significant energy. The alignment of this model with the established social psychology theories is a promising indication of its predictive capacity.</p><p>Moreover, we extended this model to capture the effects of exposing like-minded groups to opposing views, demonstrating that this situation can lead to the creation of new, sparse energy levels, symbolizing the radicalization of the group's opinion. This is interpreted as the backfire effect, a behavior observed in real-world scenarios and supported by empirical studies. We also showcased how variations in potential well profiles can influence the degree of opinion radicalization, corroborating with the observation that different groups might react differently to the exposure to opposing views.</p><p>Utilizing a novel approach of conceptualizing social interactions, this model provides a theoretical basis for understanding and predicting social dynamics in intricate scenarios. Although this work primarily employs a one-dimensional model, it opens the door to future research extending the model to higher spatial dimensions and considering more complex potential well profiles. In conjunction with the ability of machine learning techniques to synthesize profiles that capture intricate systems of human beliefs, emotions, and brain activity, this property may allow us to further refine the model and better represent and anticipate the multifaceted reality of social network interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>The model proposed in this paper is based the Schrödinger equation that defines eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalues E of the Hamiltonian operatorĤ as <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Hψ(r) ≡ − ℏ 2 2m ∆ + V (r) ψ(r) = Eψ(r) ,<label>[1]</label></formula><p>where ℏ is Plank's constant, ∆ is the Laplacian operator, m is the mass of the electron and V (r) is the scalar potential. We numerically solve Eq. 1 in a one-dimensional space given by the coordinate x using a finite difference method that represents V (x) as a vector of Nx equally spaced points with a step hx <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>. Using a second-order central finite-difference scheme, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ψ ′′ (x i ) ≈ 1 h 2 x [ψ(x i−1 ) − 2ψ(x i ) + ψ(x i+1 )] .<label>[2]</label></formula><p>The substitution of Eq. 2 to Eq. 1 gives rise to a finite-difference version of the Schrödinger equation written in a matrix form. We employ Floquet periodic boundary conditions ψ(x 0 ) = ψ(x N x ) exp(−jka) and ψ(x N x+1 ) = ψ(x 1 ) exp(jka), where j is the unit imaginary number, k denotes the wavevector and a is the period of repetition of the profile of V (x) (for an isolated potential well ψ(x 0 ) = ψ(x N x+1 ) = 0). The resulting matrix equation is solved using a standard procedure eigs of MATLAB software to find the eigenvalues E for each discrete value of the wavevector k corresponding to the first Brillouin zone. The energy level diagrams plotted as the insets in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3b, Fig. 4b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5b</ref> are obtained integrating the values of E for all values of k taken into account in the calculation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Notable examples of the backfire effect in the literature.

The dashed lines denote the energy levels of a standalone potential well corresponding to an isolated individual. Note that in the group the energy levels split and aggregate, forming bands of continuous energy states, compared with the purely discrete energy levels of the standalone individual. While transitions inside an energy band are readily possible, high energy is required to transition between the bands. This physical property is interpreted as opinion polarization. energy levels would represent "open-mindedness" because a continuous distribution of energy levels is characterized by a low transition energy, which means that the individual is receptive to new information, ideas and opinions.</figDesc></figure>
