<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Suppose we are cooking a nice soup; the pot is on the stove. When the soup starts to boil over, we instantly reach for the handles to remove the pot from the heat source, and we instantly know we are making a mistake because we are fully aware that the handles are hot. That is the moment when we get burned. A couple of seconds before the burn, two forces clashed in our mind, and if we disregard the awareness that we got burned, in this situation, two types of responses conflicted. The automatic response prevailed over the rational one.</p><p>Clark, one of the founders of the extended cognition hypothesis (ExCog), which "boldly claims that sometimes parts of the environment partially constitute cognitive processes" <ref type="bibr">(Milojević, 2013, p. 4)</ref>, explains the described situation as an example of the possibility of the existence of coexistent, and quite different, cognitive processes. Some are based on representations, and others are dynamically described without the representations and are described by the processes and mechanisms on which they are based (computationally). The former, Clark assumes, is controlled to a greater degree based on available information, and the latter is, to a greater extent, automatic or, rather, automatised <ref type="bibr">(Clark, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">272;</ref><ref type="bibr">Milojević, 2013)</ref>. In the present text, the story of boiling soup is an example of the possibility of two types of responses of the cognitive system, i.e. two types of outcomes of Clark's cognitive processes. The automatic, faster response, i.e. grabbing the pot, can also be labelled as heuristic, autonomous, intuitive, even reflexive, or -System 1 response. By "rational" (or, "reasonable") behaviour, we consider a normatively rational response, which we reached through a process that is reflective, calculated, strategic, or a System 2 response (for example, taking a heat-insulating kitchen glove). Their supposed conflict in our minds is a conflict of two types of processing (Type 1 and Type 2). The distinctive features that differentiate the two types of processing are working memory and propensity for hypothetical thinking <ref type="bibr">(Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013)</ref>. A cramped kitchen and the time pressure of the decision represent a hostile environment, the existence of a glove would represent a sign or signal from the environment that could "trigger" adequate processing ("rational") that would save us from a burn and the awareness that the handles are hot and that we made a mistake would fall under conflict monitoring, i.e. metacognitive processes 1 . These are the main concepts within the psychological approaches to rationality, more precisely, the contemporary iteration of the psychological examination of the duality of thinking. The most notable psychological approaches to human rationality are bounded rationality, heuristics and biases approach, dual-process theory, and ecological rationality, and the central phenomena are cognitive biases. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and offer complementary, even when they do not admit, perspectives on human rational thinking, highlighting different aspects of this complex phenomenon.</p><p>Whether we are rational beings is an intriguing dilemma in the social sciences, and almost every scientific discipline has joined the so-called "Great Rationality Debate." This includes economics, philosophy, political science, sociology, anthropology, even mathematics and physics, and now the field of artificial intelligence. Although the fact that we have given our endeavour the epithet "great" does not guarantee the quality of the answer to this dilemma, whichever position you intuitively take, "you will find yourself in the excellent company" <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(French, 1986)</ref>. The dilemma may not make sense for people who do not follow the great rationality debate by profession: sometimes we are, and sometimes we are not. Moreover, emphasising the opposition of different scientific approaches to rationality and calling the classic scientific discussion "great" (or even "rationality wars") is detrimental to scientific work and unfounded because the viewpoints are not essentially opposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Sturm, 2019)</ref>. Some of the approaches within this field of research are also known as behavioural economics, the heuristics and biases approach, judgment and decision-making, or descriptive (as opposed to normative) theories of decision-making. Psychological approaches to rationality try to answer the questions of when and how our thinking as a cognitive process is rational. Psychology has not started this debate, nor is it the first time in its history that it has dealt with rationality. Irrationality is one of the fundamental concepts of Freud's and every other psychoanalysis. In Albert Ellis's rational emotive behaviour therapy, the psychotherapeutic process aims to build rational beliefs about the world that will help our emotions be functional (as opposed to dysfunctional; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ellis, 1976</ref>). However, it was only by including the phenomenon of (ir)rationality of thinking, i.e., the rationality of higher cognitive processes, at the beginning of the 1970s, that psychology offered decision theory, one of the areas of the great debate, research tools, and in return received the conceptual apparatus of traditional (philosophically, economically and mathematically defined) rationality. The most significant contribution of this alliance is the emergence of numerous psychological models that explain how thinking works.</p><p>Along the way, psychologists and psychological insights have been awarded several Nobel Prizes for -economics 2 .</p><p>By joining the broad field of rationality, psychology has prepared itself for Clark's call: "A suitable project for the new Millenium is to radically reconfigure our image of human rationality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Clark, 2001</ref>; page 1). This love message extended by the philosopher to psychology conveys the notion that the issue of human rationality must be answered not conceptually but empirically, using all the means of modern cognitive science. Stein believes such a contribution would also have a broader scope since empirical considerations are also relevant to the theory of knowledge; therefore, epistemology should be naturalised <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Stein, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>While human cognition can be and is conceptualised in various ways, cognitive psychology considers and studies human cognition as a natural higher-order cognitive system 3 . A cognitive system, broadly defined, is a system that learns and develops knowledge. The cognitive system of humans is a complex system that learns and develops knowledge and connections between knowledge, with a single primary goal: maintaining its functionality in each environment. It achieves this by collecting and operating on sensory (sense-gathered) information, and it is successful in these processes because it has a physical basis (the brain). The human cognitive system cannot be operational if the brain is not functional. Being a higher-order cognitive system, human cognition, in addition to learning and adapting to the environment, is characterised by varying degrees of intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Heyes, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Silberstein &amp; Chemero, 2012)</ref>. The cognitive-psychological study of rationality focuses on the rationality of thinking for solving problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive-psychological approaches to the rationality of thinking</head><p>Psychology does not define rationality. Rather, it takes, according to its needs, theoretical frameworks from other disciplines native to rationality, primarily philosophy. However, psychology quite clearly considers that thinking is an inseparable part of the psychophysical equipment with which every person is born, and possessing thinking is not a matter of choice. Thinking is not a human right, at least not to a greater extent than having hands or the sense of sight, are human rights. Thinking is one of the primary mental functions that always exists in all people, and it is one, but not the only, way of solving problems and cognitive process (both mental and cognitive) by which knowledge about relationships is reached, phenomena are related and compared, or decisions are made. This is achieved through operating with (from anything in our perceptive field and those we imagine) mental representations, such as concepts, words, mental images, etc. The thinking processes studied within the psychology of rationality are judgment, inferencing, and decisionmaking. These processes belong to directed thinking, different from undirected thinking, such as daydreaming or free association <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gilhooly, 1983)</ref>. The umbrella term for these interconnected processes is reasoning or, strictly psychologically, complex cognition. Complex cognition encompasses all the mental processes a person uses to arrive at new information, whether they "extract" it or "construct" it from given information, and whose purpose is to solve problems and plan actions. We recognise these processes in everyday life whenever we analyse, connect, or judge and evaluate something (analysis, synthesis, evaluation). They rely on the combination and interaction of more elementary processes such as perception, learning, memory, emotions, and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Knauff &amp; Wolf, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sternberg &amp; Ben-Zeev, 2001</ref>). The essential characteristic of complex cognition is that it occurs in complex conditions in which multiple cognitive processes interact with each other and with other non-cognitive processes. The "complexity" in the name is, therefore, twofold and refers to both the processes and the conditions in which they occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Damnjanović, 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assumed Cognitive Architecture</head><p>Researchers in the psychology of rationality attribute a limited set of principles related to the complex cognitive processing to the human cognitive system. We can consider these to be "boundary conditions" for the validity of psychological models of rationality. This means that all cognitive-psychological models of rationality belong to a cluster limited by the cognitive system's assumed characteristics. Models from that cluster would not be able to survive as convincing scientific models if we imagined and accepted different characteristics of the cognitive system. The principles on which the psychology of rationality is based are implicitly or explicitly present in psychology before it deals with rationality in this fashion. Those principles appear in the same or similar form in contemporary cognitive models of rationality, such as dual-process models of cognitive processing. The four basic principles are cognitive economy, environment-dependent processing, knowledge structures, and probabilism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Cognitive Miserliness -How Does the Cognitive System Work?</head><p>The idea of cognitive miserliness as an inherent principle of our mental functioning is not exclusively related to complex cognition or integrative functions. The principle of cognitive miserliness implies that in every situation, we try to expend as little mental effort as possible, that is, to solve the problem using (ideally) the minimum necessary resources. All theorists of the duality of reasoning, when dealing primarily with the function of two assumed modes of thinking ("rational" and "non-rational"), have the same starting point: the basic idea of cognitive miserliness, regardless of what kind of cognitive architecture they proposed or adopted (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arkes et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Newman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Oaksford &amp; Chater, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Reyna &amp; Brainerd, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Stanovich, 2018)</ref>. Cognitive miserliness implies two ideas: that the human cognitive system (a) cannot process everything from the environment or all stimulation and that (b) it should not process everything.</p><p>(a) The first idea that the cognitive system cannot process everything is the ontological aspect of cognitive miserliness. It has existed in psychology since the beginning of empirical research. The first psychophysical and experimental studies of sensory perception from the 19th century brought findings that imply limitations of mental processing. The psychophysical concepts of just-noticeable difference, absolute and differential threshold, and soon after the textbook example of Wundt's "thought meter" (German: der Gedankenmesser), used to measure the mental processing of two simultaneous stimuli, presumed that the mental apparatus somehow arranges processed material and that it cannot process everything <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Farr, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fechner, 1948</ref><ref type="bibr">, according to Farr, 1983</ref>). Piaget's developmental stages imply that developmental limitations exist in the ability to form representations, schemas, and cognition and are transformed during development <ref type="bibr">(Piaget, 1983)</ref>. In one of the most cited psychological papers on the "magical number seven plus or minus two", the central problem is measuring the limit of the mind's capacity to process information <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Miller, 1956)</ref>. The idea that we cannot process or retain everything is present in the signal detection theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Swets, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tanner Jr. &amp; Swets, 1954</ref>); Broadbent's investigations of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Broadbent, 1958)</ref>; in Sperling's discovery and investigation of iconic memory <ref type="bibr">(Sperling, 1963)</ref>; the memory models of Atkinson and Shiffrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968)</ref>, and in both iterations of Baddeley's model of working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baddeley, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974)</ref>. The idea of the limitations of cognitive processing is, therefore, inherent in the entire cognitive functioning of the mental apparatus, which finally gets the name "(humans) cognitive system" in the seventies <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Neisser, 1967)</ref>.</p><p>(b) The second constitutive idea of cognitive miserliness, that the cognitive system should not process everything represents the epistemic aspect. While the impossibility of total processing is not theoretically explained in the listed works, the idea that the cognitive system should not process everything is directly debated. The explanation of why we should not and why we cannot process absolutely everything that reaches our cognitive system is partly based on the view of our mind as a (natural cognitive) system that evolved. The first attempts to define general principles of functioning that are strategic, not specific, are related to establishing the general theory of systems <ref type="bibr">(von Bertalanffy 4 , 1934)</ref>. The idea of cognitive miserliness is evident in perceptual economy as early as Gestalt psychology, first through the tendency towards the best possible structure (Prägnanz principle, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Wertheimer, 1923)</ref>), and then through more specific internal perceptual tendencies towards a minimum, to save mental energy, and tendencies towards a maximum, to increase the quality of perception <ref type="bibr">(Koffka, 1935</ref><ref type="bibr">(Koffka, , 2013</ref>. The relationship between these two internal tendencies, Gestalt psychologists believed, should be optimal, and the quality of the percept is sustained bybetter (adequate) organisation of stimulation, which is also perceptually more economical. Wertheimer points out that observing an object as a whole is more accurate and takes less energy. On top of that, the whole contains the essence of what is observed, not individual elements and details. Simon, in his highly influential works on systems theory and bounded rationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Simon, 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Simon, , 1972</ref>, states that we cannot and should not process everything and that human rationality, being limited, is effective 5 because it compensates for its limitations. Human rationality overcomes its limitations by relying on observed regularities from the environment, ultimately leading to a "satisficing solution" (Simon's neologism from satisfy and suffice; <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Simon, 1947</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Simon, , 1972</ref>. In works on categorisation and the problem of higher-order organisation of mental representations, Eleanor Rosch emphasises that the first of the two fundamental principles of categorisation systems refers to their function to provide maximum information with the least cognitive effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rosch, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, social psychologists Susan Fiske and Shelley Taylor coined the phrase "cognitive miser" <ref type="bibr">(Fiske, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1984)</ref>. Cognitive economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Simon, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kahneman, 2011)</ref> or shallow psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dawes, 1976</ref>) is a trade-off, i.e., an optimal relationship between power and cost. In sum, cognitive miserliness as a feature of the system is assumed and supported by numerous evidence, in all models of the duality of cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De Neys, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Evans &amp; Over, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gilovich &amp; Griffin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Liberali et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stanovich et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stanovich, 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Stanovich &amp; Toplak, 2023;</ref> A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Thompson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981)</ref>, as well as in the predecessors, the prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref> and cumulative prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>, fuzzy trace theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Reyna &amp; Brainerd, 1995)</ref> and the ecological rationality model <ref type="bibr">(Gigerenzer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mata et al., 2013)</ref>. The human mind works like the animal mind, and ...all animals are under stringent selection pressure to be as stupid as they can get away with <ref type="bibr">(Richerson &amp; Boyd, 2005, p. 135)</ref>. Such "stupidity" is sufficient and even useful when our environment is benign, i.e., suitable for the way of thinking that is activated.</p><p>2 Dependence on the Environment -Where Does the Cognitive Miser Work?</p><p>The second principle of the cognitive system on which the psychological study of rationality is based is the dependence of cognitive processing on the environment. Behaviour is not only a consequence of our personalities, values, experiences, constructs or preferences but is also influenced by the situation and the environment. We interpret cues from the environment, devise responses, and behave accordingly. This view is not exclusive to psychological models of the rationality of thinking. As in other areas of cognitive psychology, for example, in psycholinguistics, processing dependence on the environment is explained under the broad umbrella term of situated cognition 6 . All four perspectives of situated cognition (embodied, embedded, extended, and enactive; 4E) recognise the vital role of the environment and the body in shaping cognitive processes. Cognition does not occur only in our heads but is also embodied, embedded, enacted, or extended by way of extra-cranial processes and structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carney, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The roughest sketch of psychology could be that psychology explains "how the physical is mapped into the mental." "Mapped into the mental" would mean how something outside of us, in the environment, is transferred and represented in our mind, mental slate, and inner world. The "physical" transferred to the mind can be a moving car, an abstract idea from a book, a change in lighting, or our thoughts or feelings. The fundamental psychological question of the relationship between mental and physical is answered by the first schools of psychology, psychophysics, and structuralism (which, as well as most empirical disciplines, do not deal with whether innate ideas exist or not). The role of the environment in empirical psychological programs was first posited as a necessary element in functionalism when, under the influence of evolutionism, as the adaptive function of consciousness, i.e., emphasising adaptation to the environment 7 . A broader framework for studying the influence of the environment on our psyche, the environmental complexity, is provided by several psychological concepts. In Lev Vygotsky's socio-constructivist developmental approach, the environment triggers the development, dubbed allomorphic development <ref type="bibr">(Vygotsky, 1929)</ref>. The formative role of the other (object) on the dynamics and structure of personality is highlighted within the psychodynamic framework, from classical psychoanalysis to relational psychoanalysis and, e.g., Fonagy's connection of cognitive development and attachment theory through the function of mentalisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fonagy et al., 2018)</ref>. At a more molecular level, within the study of cognitive processing and before the emergence of dual processing models, signal detection theory (SDT) describes perceptual regularities in an uncertain environment (an environment that changes in a way that is not completely known to us). SDT explains how, in that environment, we detect (and do not miss) what is relevant to our decision (a signal that is information) and how we distinguish it from noise (numerous regularities that are irrelevant to us), that is, the avoidance of type 1 error and type 2 errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Peterson et al., 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tanner Jr. &amp; Swets, 1954)</ref>.</p><p>Perhaps the most remarkable similarity to the concept of automatic and autonomous information processing, which is today called heuristic processing, is Gibson's affordance, which is a term he coined and presented as a concept in most detail in the book The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception <ref type="bibr">(Gibson, 1966</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gibson, , 2014</ref>. Affordance is a concept that indicates the complementarity of the environment and the organism and is a measure of what the environment offers the organism so that the organism can fulfil its needs. The relationship between the ecological niche and the organism shapes perceptual processes to the same extent and in the same way that any ecological niche shapes how an animal lives in that niche. Affordance is relational and shows the suitability of the environment to the observer. For example, stairs with a step height of 30cm will be a receptive and helpful environment for someone who is 3m tall (high affordance, i.e. high complementarity of the organism and the environment) and can afford that person easy and fast climbing but will not be a good environment for a person of usual height (low affordance, i.e. low fit). A single environment has different affordances for different needs and different organisms, and the needs of the organism control the perception of affordance (through selective attention), triggering actions and modifying the environment. Affordance also implies the selection of elements and information from the environment. Not everything in the environment is "affordant", but only what we perceive from the offer defines our action. Similarly, when we decide (a complex cognitive process) about something, for example, about buying shoes in a store (environment), the mind is surrounded by numerous information, such as the lighting of the store, the dryness of the air, the temperature of the room, the tone of the seller's voice, the price of the shoes, the material from which they are made, the size of the shoes, many models, the method of payment. However, for this decision, our attention focuses only on the information that is important to us, including the shoe model, size, price, and payment method. We do not direct our attention to the temperature in the room and the number of windows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditions in the Environment Where Reasoning Takes Place</head><p>We are not always in a completely uncertain environment when we make decisions. In addition to conditions of uncertainty (e.g., who will be the president of the US in 2035), there are conditions of measurable uncertainty or risk (e.g., gambling) and conditions of certainty (e.g., buying shoes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Knight, 1921;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rakow, 2010)</ref>, and there is no fourth type of environment. Every decision is made in one of these three conditions. As an explicit definition of the environment in which complex cognitive processes take place, in addition to Knight's exhaustive categorisation of decision-making conditions, Savage's note on decision-making in the "small" and "big" world is also cited <ref type="bibr">(Savage, 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Savage, , 2012</ref>. A small world is an environment in which all available choices, states of the world, consequences, and probabilities are known, while big worlds are those in which some of the above are unavailable. Savage argues that to apply Bayesian methods to analyse large worlds, we must make simplified idealised assumptionsto analyse them as if they were a small world. The environment in game theory is conceptualised as "Nature as a player" and refers to all those circumstances and aspects not controlled by the decision-maker (Dixit &amp; Skeath, 2015).</p><p>Today, in the dual process paradigm, the terms benign and hostile environment are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chater et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stanovich, 2018b)</ref>. A benign environment does not interfere with the cognitive process, i.e., that is an environment in which the probability that a cognitive miserly response (based on intuition 8 ) will lead to an error is low or relatively low. As in the example of boiling soup from the beginning, a second is enough to turn off the heat source because the stove is on gas, or you have a pot with heatinsulating handles, so you can react quickly. A hostile environment is an environment that hinders or disrupts the cognitive process and in which the probability that a non-analytical cognitive process, i.e. recklessness, will lead to an error (for example, burns) is high or relatively high (for example, the stove takes time to cool off, the pot does not have heatinsulating handles, gloves are not in sight). In both benign and hostile environments, we can operate recklessly (type 1 processes) and thoughtfully (type 2 processes), and the predictions of theoretical models about the outcomes of judgment, decision-making, and reasoning depend on the combination of environment and processing. Experimental tasks in this paradigm simulate uncertainty or risk and a hostile environment, thus prompting participants to reason intuitively in a hostile environment. One way to simulate the hostility of the environment is by experimentally manipulating the deep structure of reasoning tasks by obscuring, concealing, or hiding key information. For example, in the task from the famous Frederick's Cognitive Reflection Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Frederick, 2005)</ref>, which reads, "A man bought a pig for 60 euros, sold it for 70 euros, rebought it for 80 euros, and finally sold it for 90 euros. How much did he earn?" in one of the studies, 36.47% answers were correct (20 euros). When the same respondents (N = 94) were presented with the task with the introduction of a reference point, i.e. when the text was preceded by the information "The man has 80 euros in his pocket", 52.94% of correct answers were recorded. Moreover, 31.76% of so-called heuristic (typically incorrect) answers were recorded in the first variant of the question. With the added reference point, the number of such incorrect answers decreased to 21.18% <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Damnjanović et al., 2019)</ref>. If the environment is benign, i.e. if the information is not obscured, our thinking more easily reaches the criteria of normative rationality. Finally, in ecological and social rationality approaches, the basic starting point for studying higher cognition is the notion of the interactive, adaptive nature of these processes to the information structure of the environment. The essential assumption is that there is no uniform, universal strategy for rational cognition, but rather different principles adapted to different situationsthe set of these principles is called the "adaptive toolbox" <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Todd &amp; Gigerenzer, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>

Put, function and structure, to a certain extent, are one and single entity -one cannot think without the matter (content) to think about, nor would the matter exist if it does not have the function. Knowledge structures are always involved in solving reasoning tasks <ref type="bibr">(Stanovich, 2018b)</ref>. Successful, or at least satisfying, reasoning in a hostile environment requires procedural skills and declarative knowledge to avoid attractive miserly processing. Kahneman and Frederick propose the mechanism of attribute substitution as an explanation for the systematic errors recorded in tasks for registering heuristics and biases (HB tasks). A paradigmatic example is the "bat and ball" problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Frederick, 2005)</ref>:</p><p>A bat and a ball together cost 1.10 $. A bat costs 1 $ more than a ball. How much does the ball cost?</p><p>The participants, by large, give an intuitive (and incorrect) answer (10 cents), e.g. 80% of students (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Damnjanović et al., 2019)</ref>. The correct answer is 5 cents. Respondents change the critical relational information "more than" to a more straightforward absolute value "more", and by simply parsing the sum, they arrive at the correct answer -but to the wrong question. The relation between the attributes that are changed comes from knowledge structures. Similar explanations come from fuzzy trace theory's authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Reyna and Brainerd (1995)</ref>, and ecological rationality, Gigerenzer (2009). Being cognitive misers, we humans developed mechanisms that provide us with functional adaptation to the environment for "little money". By describing intuitive thinking (type 1 processes), <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kahneman and Frederick (Kahneman &amp; Frederick, 2005)</ref> explain that the mechanism of attribute substitution implies replacing the attribute that is more demanding to process with an attribute that is more receptive simpler, and close to the demanding attribute. According to the Kahneman and Frederick model, the connection between the changed attributes comes from knowledge structures; it is not random. We process the seductive attribute with type 1 processes (intuition), probably stored in the implicit procedural memory domain via non-associative and associative learning. We approach the true but more difficult-to-process attribute through a type 2 process stored in the explicit declarative memory domain. Although not stored in the same memory locations, the connection between the two changed attributes results from learning, associative and discriminative, i.e., experience in and with the environment. Therefore, solving HB tasks relies on stored knowledge from different domains, and the operational term mindware relates to stored knowledge, rules, procedures, and strategies. The term "mindware" was coined by Perkins <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Perkins, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr">, according to Stanovich, 2009</ref>, and Clark <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Clark, 2001)</ref> introduced it into cognitive science, somewhat changing its original meaning. The mindware necessary for successfully solving HB tasks differs for different tasks and includes knowledge of probabilistic reasoning, explanations of causality, scientific reasoning, and numeracy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Stanovich (2018)</ref> believes that the "irrational System 1" (sic), in addition to declarative knowledge, contains normatively rational rules and strategies that have been repeated, practiced, and have become automated. They automatically compete and sometimes win over any alternative non-normative answer. This idea is not new either. The category of autonomous processing in cognitive science has long included the automatic triggering of "overlearned" rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(LaBerge &amp; Samuels, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Moors &amp; De Houwer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Posner &amp; Snyder, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schneider &amp; Shiffrin, 1977)</ref>. In other words, automated subprocesses include not only <ref type="bibr">Fodor's modularity (1983)</ref>, but also many rules, stimulus discrimination, and decision-making principles that have been practiced to automaticity through repetition <ref type="bibr">(Gigerenzer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schneider &amp; Shiffrin, 1977)</ref>. In addition to rules that are consciously and intentionally practised and thus automated, a large part of the automatic associative learning accumulated, compiled, and autonomously launched from System 1. Not all " located " knowledge in System 1 is automated through intentional and conscious practice because implicit knowledge can also be automated, such as implicit associative knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Evans, 2010)</ref>. For example, some statistics lecturers cannot empathise with their students for whom the fundamental axioms of probability are not transparent. The teacher can no longer remember when those axioms were not the primary intuition; in Vygotskian terms, he does not remember the transition from scientific to spontaneous concepts <ref type="bibr">(Vygotsky, 1929)</ref>. Findings show that, during type 1 processing, the degree to which mindware is instated can affect not only the correctness of answers but also the judgment of the correctness of one's answer (metacognitive assessment, the feeling of rightness, FOR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Thompson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Thompson, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Thompson, , 2014</ref>. In studies that use HB tasks, but also in models developed based on them, the emphasis is on the procedural aspect and task processing, while the knowledge component is not in focus, although the necessity of knowledge is implied <ref type="bibr">(DeNeys, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">(DeNeys, , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">(DeNeys, , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">(DeNeys, , 2022</ref><ref type="bibr">DeNeys &amp; Glumicic, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Evans, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">Evans, , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">Evans, , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">Evans, , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">Ferreira et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pennycook et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stanovich, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stanovich &amp; West, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Thompson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thompson &amp; Johnson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Thompson &amp; Morsanyi, 2012)</ref>. All HB tasks include mindware to some, but rarely to a small degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Stanovich, 2018)</ref>, which means that success on the task will depend on the degree of "mindware instantiation" in memory. Thus, the answer to the task can be both an indicator of miserly processing and the depth of learned (automated) mindware, which has theoretical and empirical implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Probabilistic Mind -How Does the Cognitive Miser Work?</head><p>The fourth principle of the cognitive system implied by all cognitive-psychological models of rationality is the ability of our mind to develop and cope with uncertainty. The world and the system in which the cognitive system of Homo sapiens sapiens is located abounds with uncertainty. The sensory stimuli based on which we derive mental representations of the environment are surprisingly diverse, the consequences of actions are usually very unpredictable, and even our scientific "laws of nature", at best, represent guesses and valid assumptions, not certainties <ref type="bibr">(Chater &amp; Oaksford, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Damnjanović, 2018)</ref>. We do not know what will happen in five minutes, five hours, or five years. Our expectations and predictions may be more successful for a closer point in time than for the distant future. However, it may also be easier to imagine what will happen to our building in five years than to know when the sudden downpour that caught us on the street will stop. We will be surprised with a game in which a team from a lower league "miraculously" scores not one but two goals against the national champion. However, we will hardly notice when, while studying for an exam, our grandmother, as usual, brings us an apple and cookies. Something will surprise us more, something less, but we generally do not have firm, conscious, and clear expectations about a specific event that should happen. The cognitive system successfully copes with a complex and constantly changing environment and can only function in uncertainty. We could imagine that the cognitive system is pre-equipped with narrowly specialised structures and functions for processing each singular and specific surprising event, but such an assumption would be empirically and theoretically refuted by numerous disciplines, from information theory through systems theory to cognitive psychology <ref type="bibr">(Chater &amp; Oaksford, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Posner, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Damnjanović, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Instead, the cognitive system is characterised by general strategies for overcoming uncertainty, earning the name "probabilistic mind" <ref type="bibr">(Chater &amp; Oaksford, 2008)</ref>. The idea that the laws of probability are also the laws of the mind has survived since the Enlightenment. Then available mathematical tools, such as Bayes' theorem and Laplace's interpretation, Bernoulli's distribution, were considered descriptions of real reasoning <ref type="bibr">(Daston, 1981</ref><ref type="bibr">, according to Chater &amp; Oaksford, 1999</ref>. Probabilism is the view that the probability of an event is related to the conditions with which that event (be that mental event, such as a decision or anything from the environment) is, to some extent, connected. When we scientifically observe and predict how, for example, a parent decides whether to allow a child to bungee jump, we assume, even if we do not measure directly, that a) the probability of an unfavourable outcome of bungee jumping was (whether explicit or not) a factor based on which the parent made the decision, that is, that there is a mental representation of probability in the parent's mind; and b) that the cognitive process of decision-making itself takes place following the laws of probability theory. Psychological models of rationality and mathematical probability theory share a twofold connection: phenomenological and conceptual.</p><p>In prospect theory, cumulative prospect theory, and fuzzy trace theory, the central question is how we experience, perceive, and operate with environmental probabilities. Connectionist models of reasoning, the application of information theory in cognitive psychology, signal detection theory, or models based on discriminative learning, base descriptions of cognitive processing or cognitive architecture directly on the principles of probability theory. All cognitive-psychological theories of reasoning include both aspects of the probabilistic mind, that we necessarily process probability (for example, information about the riskiness of bungee jumping) and that the processing occurs as a function of probability. Uncertainty and the ability to cognitively function in uncertainty are key aspects of thinking, decision-making, and judgment <ref type="bibr">(Chater &amp; Oaksford, 2008</ref>. Retaining the idea that all human cognition, like all natural systems, functions according to the principles of probability theory, psychological approaches to rationality introduce one of the fundamental questions in the field, and that is how we assess and judge probability. While the idea of a single "g factor" of human non-rationality (or cognitive biases) is intriguing, the evidence points towards a more complex picture. Multiple general and specific factors (cognitive limitations, motivational factors, personality traits, and situational influences) are more likely to contribute to the diverse cognitive biases. Some biases might be more related because they operate in similar domains (contextualized in addition to generic) measures need to be improved or developed., involve similar cognitive processes, or rely on the same or similar heuristics, and all those different influences interact, too. Further, researchers sometimes treat achievement on the e.g. cognitive reflection test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Frederick, 2005)</ref> as a dispositional correlate (instead of a phenomenon) of rational thinking. Studies indicate no homogeneous one-dimensional psychological construct of rationality. Although different cognitive biases share a certain degree of variance (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Reyna et al, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stanovich, 2009b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stanovich, , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stanovich et al, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teovanović et al., 2015)</ref>, the reliability of the composite score of heuristic answers is relatively low -around 0.20 (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Aczel et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teovanović et al., 2015)</ref>, to moderate (around 0.5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Toplak et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, West et al., 2008</ref>. Stanovich and colleagues elaborated on the construct of the rationality quotient as an intellectual or cognitive ability different from intelligence <ref type="bibr">(Stanovich et al., 2016)</ref>. In sum, research continues to explore the relationships between different biases and the underlying cognitive processes involved, but "the measurement of individual differences in cognitive biases is still in its infancy" <ref type="bibr">(Berthet, 2021)</ref>. We suggest that the elusiveness of a single indicator of rational thinking and its mechanisms (if we aim to describe it) is due, at this point, to methodological limitations within the field.</p><p>Psychology has many methods and techniques for observing, registering, "measuring", and predicting the phenomena it studies. When it deals with the rationality and non-rationality of reasoning, it traditionally uses experiments, and biases are quintessential experimental constructs. Numerous studies confirm the existence of cognitive biases as reliable experimental effects and demonstrations of (non-)rationality, including the stability of the recorded magnitudes of those effects. Although we can rely on such findings, with this approach, we cannot know how much people differ from each other in their propensity for cognitive biases. Knowing and understanding the differences in (non-)rational thinking between people and within people is necessary to confirm these constructs' scientific, especially theoretical, reality.</p><p>Suppose we operationalise rational reasoning as a set of evolved complex cognitive processes. In that case, we must also consider the differences between people in that ability and not just the similarities. As mentioned, human reasoning is determined by the situation and the environment and our "internal" characteristics, dispositions, or a set of dispositions with which we can explain the differences between people. For a psychological description, it is not enough for the rationality of reasoning to be understood as unchanging and identical in all circumstances or phases of phylogenetic and ontogenetic development. Just as all people have ears and the sense of hearing, but not all ears are uniform, and hearing is not the same in all people; everyone has a (structure of) personality that differs from each other, so rational and irrational reasoning must exist in all people, but its manifestations are different (intersubjective variance). Rational thinking, as a monomorphic evolutionary organ that serves to solve some of the problems of adaptation, must also have a variance that stems from differences between people; that is, it must be flexible enough. If complex cognition is one of the many functions we have to adapt and survive in a complex environment, it must be adaptable, not just adaptive. The conclusion is derived by analogy with Daniel Nettle's consideration of personality variations in the context of evolution <ref type="bibr">(Nettle, 2006)</ref>. However, where to aim to map that variance since examining individual differences in cognitive biases did not yield a satisfactory description of the phenomena?</p><p>Here we propose that examination should be aimed at the variance of underlying cognitive mechanisms of cognitive biases, let us say heuristics, and that this could be achieved by immersion of the psychology of rational thinking into traditional constructs of cognitive psychology. On a conceptual level, this became possible only with the establishment of the dual process approach as the dominant paradigm in the field. Lee Cronbach, calling for integrating two, at his time, mainstream traditional methods in psychology, experimental research and differential research, pointed out, "...Individual differences were a nuisance rather than a challenge to the experimenter. His goal is to control behaviour, and within-treatment variations are proof that he has failed... For statistical and philosophical reasons, error variance is to be reduced by all possible means" <ref type="bibr">(Cronbach, 1957, p. 674)</ref>. Integrating methods on one phenomenon or a group of psychological phenomena is far from a trivial task and has not yet been achieved in many areas of psychology. One of the reasons such integration has not happened is that some of the tasks traditionally used in the psychology of rationality are unsuitable for individual differences. In the differential approach, reliability means a different property, which is why researchers have difficulties when trying to translate excellent experimental design into examining individual differences <ref type="bibr">(Hedge et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ross et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barch et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>For example, in a study examining what people think about their own decisions and what they base such self-assessment on, respondents in two experimental situations answered whether they acted "smartly" when buying shoes online. In one situation, the shoes that arrived fit; in the second, they were not. If the shoes are fit and comfortable, then the decision, the respondents believed, is smart. If they are small or large, the purchase decision was assessed as less smart <ref type="bibr">(Orlić &amp; Damnjanović, 2016)</ref>. The statistically significant difference between the assessment of the identical decision (online purchase of shoes) in two situations with opposite outcomes is the experimental effect, i.e. the difference between the assessments is attributed to the difference between experimental situations. A reliable experimental effect is a behaviour most participants display in studies examining a phenomenon and if it is replicated in most studies on dependence of the judgment on the outcome (called outcome bias; <ref type="bibr">Baron, 1988)</ref>. In our experiment, as in any other, in every experimental situation or condition, the participants do the same thing (judge), only in a different way and to a different degree (in our example, in both conditions, they evaluated the decision). Though the effect overall exists, there are differences in the same behaviour: someone is terribly angry because of the wrong shoes and considers it an irresponsible act, someone else is just dissatisfied and even less judgmental; with the opposite outcome, the first person can be very excited, even proud, that the shoes are good, and the second can say that she was simply lucky with the outcome. Moreover, the same person can display the same effect but with different magnitudes on different occasions.</p><p>In conclusion, the epistemic contribution of the differential approach, which is a necessary next step in explaining rationality of reasoning, should be found at another level of molarity, i.e., at the level of the cognitive process and not only at the level of its manifestation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Epistemic contributions of the psychological study of (ir)rationality of thinking are phenomenological (for example, cognitive biases), conceptual (e.g., heuristic algorithm) and empirical (posing research questions). The current theoretical state of the psychology of rational thinking presumes that the rationality of our thinking is characterised by cognitive miserliness and probabilism and depends on the environment and knowledge structures. The next endeavour in the field should be to merge experimental and differential approaches. To achieve this, psychology needed to delimit its research problem from the normative description and establish its model with psychological constructs, not mathematical or economical <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . At the beginning of the development of psychology of rational thinking, there were normative theories of rationality, and psychology joined the field to observe and understand deviations from defined norms.</p><p>As in the case of other areas of psychology, in the study of judgment, decision-making, and reasoning, the subject of research was not initially set as psychological, but the goal was a psychological explanation of phenomena and systems that were described by other sciences or that were observed in people's lives. For example, in the case of psycholinguistics, we use the linguistic description of the language (say, adjectives and nouns) and view it as a natural system -to describe the linguistic and cognitive function (how we (our mind) make a psychological distinction between "kind" as an adjective and "kind" as a noun). In the case of the psychology of perception, we follow how our sensory cognitive system learns and evaluates physical reality described by parameters that come from physics, while the measuring device for what we vary in the experiment and for what we measure is the same. When examining how we estimate distance, we can express both the real objective distance of the bus approaching and the subjectively estimated perceived distance in meters, and we can easily record the deviations between these two data from interval scales. To examine personality structure, we rely on norms from etic and emic studies and the lexical hypothesis -the basic assumption that important aspects of socio-psychological functioning are recorded as words in natural languages. On the other hand, to describe someone's coping mechanisms, defence mechanisms, motivation for learning, and numerous other states and behaviours, it is enough to rely on constructs that come only from psychology.</p><p>To take the following steps within the psychology of rationality, it was necessary to describe rationality as an ability entirely in psychological concepts. Establishing the dual processes accounts for thinking is a milestone that enabled methodological merge and reconceptualisation of the starting notions. It enabled the debate about whether two types of thinking even exist or are helpful to be used as useful fiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Melnikoff &amp; Bargh, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Oaksford, 2022)</ref>, which may be partially answered empirically. All further psychological models of rationality, next to the accepting 4+1 features, should be "immersed" in cognitive psychology and juxtapositioned with the basic and researched concepts of cognitive psychology. This will emphasise the integrity of the currently valid idea of cognitive architecture, in which complex cognitive processes are only one of the necessary parts of manifestation. More importantly, findings from other areas of cognitive psychology can be considered in the context of psychological models of reasoning, and vice versa -the concepts of traditional cognitive psychology (e.g. working memory, associative processes, intelligence, cognitive styles…) can explain findings from the psychology of rationality. The psychology of rational thinking benefits the most from this expansion of the quantity and complexity of empirical findings that we can use -in which the number of constructs that are entirely new and isolated from the body of knowledge about human cognition is small but significant (e.g. heuristics, conflict detection, dual processes, cognitive biases). The scientific question of whether and how human thinking is rational can also be seen as a change in the reference point from which the study of thinking is approached, from observing products of human thinking as deviations from some ideal to humanising human errors and fallacies, and accepting those as our feature, not a bug.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Boundary principles of cognitive-psychological approaches to rationality5 The Missing Fifth Element: The Challenge of Individual Differences, Because Not All Misers are Equally Thrifty</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">In a broader sense, "situated cognition" represents the view that the primary mode of our cognitive activity is precisely "active" cognition, which is then supported by metaphysical and evolutionary claims. Our "offline" or "autonomous" cognitive activity, such as representing past events, daydreaming, using language, planning, etc., is mainly secondary compared to cognition oriented towards action in the environment. Therefore, situated cognition does not claim that we are initially capable of "offline" cognition, which we then transfer to the environment, but on the contrary, that the struggle for survival in the environment has enabled us to perform cognitive operations that are separated from the environment(Milojević, 2013, p. 27). 7 This is today examined in more detail within the framework of ecological rationality program.</note>
