				<p>Computational phenotyping has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing individual variability across a variety of cognitive domains. An individual&apos;s computational phenotype is defined as a set of mechanistically interpretable parameters obtained from fitting computational models to behavioral data. However, the interpretation of these parameters hinges critically on their psychometric properties, which are rarely studied. In order to identify the sources governing the temporal variability of the computational phenotype, we carried out a 12-week longitudinal study using a battery of seven tasks that measure aspects of human learning, memory, perception, and decision making. To examine the influence of state effects, each week participants provided reports tracking their mood, habits and daily activities. We developed a dynamic computational phenotyping framework, which allowed us to tease apart the timevarying effects of practice and internal states such as affective valence and arousal. Our results show that many phenotype dimensions covary with practice and affective factors, indicating that what appears to be unreliability may reflect previously unmeasured structure. These results support a fundamentally dynamic understanding of cognitive variability within an individual.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Untangling sources of individual variability remains a central challenge in cognitive science. This endeavor has been revolutionized by the use of computational models <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, which provide precise, algorithmic accounts of cognitive processes in terms of parsimonious sets of parameters, collectively termed the computational phenotype <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Importantly, these computational parameters can be intuitively interpreted as cognitively meaningful entities, such as learning rate or risk attitude. The interpretability of the computational phenotype has made it an appealing tool for studying complex phenomena as far-reaching as brain function <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>, psychiatric illness <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref>, developmental processes <ref type="bibr">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>, and cross-species variation <ref type="bibr">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13]</ref>. For example, research in the field of computational psychiatry demonstrates that computational modeling can be particularly insightful for teasing apart different behavioral aspects of mental illness. While the link between anxiety and disrupted decision making is well established <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, characterizing the specific behavioral disruption was accomplished in a study that estimated the computational phenotype in patients diagnosed with pathological anxiety and healthy controls. The study showed that anxiety is specifically associated with enhanced risk aversion (indicating less risk-taking), but not loss aversion <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Another example of the merits of computational phenotyping comes from developmental science. Previous behavioral studies have shown that children tend to explore more than adults <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. While this could be explained by generally noisier behavior in children, a computational phenotyping study helped to elucidate this phenomenon, indicating that in fact children rely more on directed, but not random exploration, thereby reducing uncertainty about the environment by choosing high-uncertainty options <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the widespread use of computational phenotypes, their interpretation hinges critically on their psychometric properties <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>, which remain poorly understood <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. This issue is even more prominent in longitudinal studies that address changes within individuals over time <ref type="bibr">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr">22]</ref>. However, test-retest reliabilities of the computational phenotypes remain largely unknown since computational models are rarely fit within the same subjects over more than one time point. Only a few studies explicitly address the reliability of computational phenotypes (see review in <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>), and rarely in more than two sessions (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). Such studies have found mixed results, with most phenotype parameters showing poor test-retest reliability, and a few showing moderate to high testretest reliability. Furthermore, a large-scale study, focusing on the domain of self-control, showed significantly lower reliability for task-based measurements, including the computational phenotype, compared to classic self-reported measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Low test-retest reliability of the computational phenotypes could reflect measurement noise, non-stationarity of the underlying construct, or both. If the underlying construct is non-stationary, its temporal trajectory could be relatively unpredictable (e.g., a random walk) or relatively predictable (e.g., directional drift induced by practice). Deciphering these sources of variability necessitates a robust, high-powered longitudinal dataset-a task that we undertake in this study. Our investigation seeks to better discern the "noise" and the "signal" in computational phenotypes by modeling multiple potential sources of temporal variability.</p><p>Over a continuous three-month period, we engaged 90 human participants in a weekly battery of seven online computer-based tasks -Go/No-Go, Change detection, Random dot motion, Lottery ticket, Intertemporal choice, Two-armed bandit, and Numerosity comparison. These tasks were chosen since they cover various aspects of cognition such as learning, memory, perception, and decision making. Using these tasks, we estimated the computational phenotype of each participant on a weekly basis. Additionally, the inclusion of a survey tracking individuals' mood and daily activities enabled us to estimate day-specific state effects on the computational phenotype. This unique dataset, which we make publicly available, allows us to illuminate the processes governing the temporal variability of cognition.</p><p>Our results provide evidence for a fundamentally dynamic view of the computational phenotype within an individual, and indicate that both practice and affective effects contribute to its temporal variability. ξlapse rate εlearning rate ρeffective rew/pun size ρeffective neut outcome size b -"Go" bias, π -Pavlovian bias ρrisk attitude βinverse temperature How much did you feel nervous or anxious over the past 24 hours? 1) Very slightly or not at all 2) A little 3) Moderately 4) Quite a bit <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Experimental tasks and models. a.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A longitudinal dataset for measuring dynamical computational phenotypes</head><p>We collected data from 90 participants who performed 7 online cognitive tasks on a weekly basis for 12 consecutive weeks. The tasks we used were Go/No-Go, Change detection, Intertemporal choice, Lottery ticket, Numerosity comparison, Two-armed bandit, and Random-dot motion. These tasks were selected for two main reasons. First, they are commonly used in cognitive and neurocognitive research, as well as in phenotyping individual, clinical, and age-related variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Second, these tasks have well-established and validated computational models.</p><p>First, we calcuated reaction time and accuracy (where applicable) for each task averaged (± std) across weeks and participants. As can be seen from <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>, on average, participants' performance was adequate and in line with previous studies using similar tasks. For more detailed analysis of the behavioral data, see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>.</p><p>Next, for each participant and for each task, we fit the free parameters with previously validated computational models using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which formalized various assumptions about within-and between-participant variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. By accounting for the structure of the data, this hierarchical framework has been shown to improve parameter stability and provide a more accurate estimate of parameter values at the participant level <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. In particular, we fit two statistical models to the data, an "independent" and a "dynamic" model. The independent model allowed us to quantify parameter stability without building it into our modeling assumptions: the parameters for each participant were assumed to be drawn independently each week from a participant-specific distribution. The dynamic model, which we describe in detail below, formalizes a more structured set of assumptions about how the computational phenotype evolves over time, thus allowing us to make insightful inferences about sources of its temporal variability. Model fitting yielded week-specific estimates for the 19 parameters comprising the computational phenotype for each participant. First, we examined widely used diagnostic measures, such as R-hat and the number of divergent transitions, that serve to assess the convergence of the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure for parameter estimation (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Information)</ref>. Second, we verified that the parameters were identifiable. Third, we verified that all computational models yielded excellent posterior predictive checks (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S8)</ref>.</p><p>We then asked whether the parameter estimates were stable over time within an individual. This was quantified using intraclass correlations (ICC), a widely used measure of test-retest reliability. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows the ICC values for the computational phenotype estimated using the independent model and the reduced model (see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref> for an alternative calculation of the ICC and Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S2</ref> for a visualization of the variance components used in calculating the ICC). ICC values covered a wide range of 0.49 − 0.99, with half of the parameters showing poorto-moderate stability, and half moderate-to-excellent stability (according to <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>). In agreement with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, models with fewer parameters tended to be more stable, and parameters derived from the same task tended to have similar values. Go/No-Go is a notable counterexample, including both the most stable and least stable parameters across tasks.</p><p>While these ICC values are imperfect, indicating variability of the measured computational phenotype over time, they are relatively high compared with those often reported in the literature <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. We suspected that these relatively high values can be attributed to fitting our data using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, which adequately captures the hierarchical structure of the data. Indeed, previous work showed that the fitting procedure has notable effects on parameter stability, whereby hierarchical models that pool information across participants promote parameter stability <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the ICC analysis, this time fitting the behavioral data using a reduced hierarchical model. In this reduced model, sessions were not nested within participants; instead, all sessions across all participants were considered independent, such that model parameters were drawn from a single population-level distribution. As expected, this procedure resulted in lower ICC values across all phenotype parameters <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2</ref>, red dots). For further details on this analysis see Supplementary Information).</p><p>We used simulated data to calculate an ICC upper bound for each parameter based on a groundtruth phenotye that was fixed across time (see Methods). This analysis yielded near-perfect stability for all parameters across tasks ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, red vertical lines). While such near-perfect stability may seem surprising, it is the result of using the independent hierarchical model in the process of parameter estimation (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> and Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S4</ref> for the lower ICC values obtained from the reduced model, i.e., without accounting for the full hierarchical structure of the data). This result indicates that the lower stability values observed in the real data are not the result of low inter-participant variability or of inadequate task design (e.g., a low number of trials), but rather that there is true longitudinal variability in the computational phenotype within participants. Finally, for each task, we also calculated the ICC values for the behavioral measures of accuracy and mean reaction time (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S5)</ref>. These values were mostly in the moderate regime (0.5-0.75). Mean reaction times were consistently more stable than accuracy values. For each task, at least some of the computational phenotype parameters were characterized by higher ICC values compared with these summary statistics.</p><p>In what follows, we demonstrate our approach for investigating the dynamics of the computational phenotype by giving a detailed account of a single task. We chose the Go/No-Go task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>) because this task has the richest computational phenotype (6 parameters), and it illustrates all of the dynamic effects (practice and mood) found in other tasks. We then summarize the results of the remaining six tasks (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Information and Figures S6-S7 for  further details)</ref>. Finally, across all tasks we verified that the reported practice effects persist also after excluding the first session, meaning that they are not an artifact of insufficient understanding of the task at the first session (see Supplementary Information).</p><p>The Go/No-Go task: structure and noise in temporal variation</p><p>In the Go/No-Go task, participants were trained to choose between pressing a key on their keyboard ("Go") or withholding a key press ("No-Go") depending on which of four visual stimuli they were shown. Participants were probabilistically rewarded or punished based on their responses. Guitart-Masip and colleagues developed a model that captures the key behavioral characteristics in this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, which we adopt in our study. This model posits that responses depend on three factors: expected reward for each stimulus-response combination, an unlearned "Go" bias and a learned "Go" bias that increases with average reward for a cue and decreases with average punishment. The learned bias allows the model to capture the tendency to approach rewarding stimuli ("Go") and avoid punishing stimuli ("No-Go"), a form of Pavlovian misbehavior that can disrupt correct instrumental performance. This manifests as an increased probability of incorrect "Go" responses in the "No-Go to win" condition and an increased probability of incorrect "No-Go" responses in the "Go to avoid" condition. Notably, we departed from Guitart-Masip's original model by modeling neutral outcomes as rewards (+1) in the punishment conditions and as punishments (-1) in the reward conditions. This reflects the assumption that participants perceive outcomes in a . Black points mark the median, shaded areas mark the inter-quartile range. Vertical red lines mark the upper stability bound estimated using simulated data with a phenotype that is fixed in time. Red points mark the median ICC values estimated using the reduced statistical model, which does not account for the full hierarchical structure of the data. Note that most of the reduced model estimates fall within the area indicating poor reliability (see Supplementary Information for more details and discussion). Gray regions mark a common interpretation of ICC values <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>: &lt; 0.5 (poor), 0.5−0.75 (moderate), 0.75−0.9 (good), and &gt; 0.9 (excellent). ICC was calculated only in participants without missing sessions: Go context-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The strengths of the "Go" biases are controlled by two parameters: b for the unlearned (instrumental) bias and π for the learned (Pavlovian) bias. The instrumental and Pavlovian learning processes are jointly controlled by a learning rate parameter (ε) and the "effective size" (ρ) of different outcome types. We fit a separate ρ parameter for neutral outcomes to accommodate their distinct role in governing participants' performance. Finally, noise in the action selection process is controlled by a lapse rate parameter (ξ) that captures the probability of random responses.</p><p>At the behavioral level, participants' performance improved across the 12 weeks. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref> shows the group-level overall accuracy and accuracy in each task condition over time. All conditions except "Go to win" were well-fit by a power-law curve (R 2 adj &gt; 0.8, p &lt; 0.001, random permutation test of the session order), consistent with classic models of practice effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Turning to the independent model fits, the posterior predictive checks indicate that our version of this Pavlovian reinforcement learning (RL) model, which treats neutral outcomes as potential reinforcers, captures the key behavioral characteristics of the task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3b</ref>; see Supplementary Figures S9-S10 for the results of the original model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the mean estimated parameters over time in all participants. Some parameters (e.g., the effective neutral outcome size) show a clear trend over time, while others show fluctuations with no clear structure (e.g., the lapse rate). Parameter stability for this task spanned a wide range: lapse rate ξ (median ICC=0.45), Pavlovian bias π (0.48), effective size of neutral outcomes ρ neut (0.65), Go bias b (0.66), learning rate ε (0.9) and effective size of reward/punishment ρ rew\pun (0.99).</p><p>To better understand potential sources of temporal variation, we refit the Pavlovian RL model with a "dynamic" model in which parameter values are governed by three sources of temporal variation: (i) practice effects (i.e., monotonic directional changes); (ii) state effects (affective valence and arousal, extracted from an analysis of the survey data, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S12)</ref>; and (iii) random noise. Practice effects were modeled as a power law change in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, while state effects were modeled as fluctuations around each participant's baseline, based on daily self-report surveys. Intuitively, valence captures the positivity vs. negativity axis of participants' affective state, whereas arousal captures the excited vs. calm axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Finally, we added a random noise effect to model any other source of variability that is not accounted for by the aforementioned sources. We quantified the relative contribution (RC) of each source to the computational phenotype by calculating its standard deviation over time relative to the sum of standard deviations of all the sources. <ref type="figure">Figure  4</ref> shows the relative contributions of different sources to each of the phenotype parameters in the Go/No-Go task. Noise had the strongest contribution for 4 of 6 task parameters, followed by practice effects. See Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S2</ref> for a breakdown of the conventional variance components underlying the ICC calculation.</p><p>To quantify the statistical strength of each source contribution, we calculated the probability of direction (pd), the proportion of the posterior distribution that has the same sign as the median <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Rather than a binary cutoff such as exclusion of zero from the highest density interval, this allows for a graded quantification of the effects, with recommended interpretation of ≤ 95 ("uncertain"), ≥ 95 ("possibly existing"), ≥ 97 ("likely existing"), ≥ 99 ("probably existing"), ≥ 99.9 ("certainly existing"). For the Pavlovian bias, we found a certainly existing negative effect of practice (pd=100, median RC=0.23). The sign of the reported effect (positive or negative) indicates the direction of the association between each parameter and the variability source (indicated by black arrows in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>; e.g., the Pavlovian bias decreased with practice). For the lapse rate, valence had a probably existing negative effect of practice (pd=97, median RC=0.14). For the effective size of Both overall accuracy (left) and accuracy in different task conditions (right) increased over time (except for the "Go to win" condition, which was already at ceiling). We fit the data with a power-law curve and report the p-value of R 2 adj based on 10,000 random permutations of the sesssion order. b. Posterior predictive checks. We used the parameter estimates from the independent model to predict the probability of taking a "Go" action in different task conditions. Model fits (red) closely matched behavior (black). Real and predicted data were averaged across blocks, sessions and participants. Predicted data were also averaged across samples of the posterior distribution. Error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM) across participants. reward/punishment, as well as the effective size of neutral outcomes, we found certainly existing positive effects of practice (pd=100, median RC=0.51 and 0.52, respectively).</p><p>These results indicate heterogeneous sources of variability across the computational phenotype in the Go/No-Go task, where some parameters are driven mostly by practice effects (ρ rew\pun , ρ neut , π), while others are driven mostly by random noise (ξ, b, ε). See Supplementary Information for similar analysis of the "non-learning" participants which were excluded due to low task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> Below we report the results for each one of the remaining tasks. For each task we give a brief description of the task followed by the relevant computational model, and then report the stability scores of the phenotype parameters and the dynamic effects that account for their temporal variability. The relative contribution of each source to the computational phenotype of these tasks is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change Detection</head><p>In the Change Detection task, participants had to indicate whether two consecutively presented images depicting colored squares were identical. We modeled this task using the absolute difference model (MAD) introduced by Wilken and Ma <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, which assumes that participants compare each pair of corresponding squares in the two images independently based on noise-corrupted representations. Participants deem the corresponding squares different with a probability that depends on a detection threshold and on the absolute difference between their representations. The noise in the image representation is acounted for by a sensitivity parameter σ, and the decision threshold is controlled by the detection threshold θ. Here we assume that both parameters increase linearly with set size (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>). This requires two more free parameters, the slope of σ and the slope of θ with set size. Here we focus on the dynamics of σ and θ.</p><p>At the behavioral level, most task conditions showed stable accuracy values over time, with the exception of the 8-items-single-target condition (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>). Accuracy in this condition was well-captured by a power-law curve (R 2 adj = 0.7, p &lt; 0.01, random permutation test). The detection threshold and noise parameters were highly stable (median ICC 0.96). The dynamic model revealed certainly existing positive effects of practice for detection threshold (pd=100, median RC=0.37) and for sensitivity (pd=100, median RC=0.33).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random Dot Motion</head><p>In the Random Dot Motion task, participants viewed 200 moving dots and had to indicate the direction (left/right) of the coherently moving dots among them. Coherence levels were 5%, 10%, 35% or 50% of all dots.</p><p>To model participants' responses and reaction times, we used the drift diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. This model assumes that participants accumulate noisy evidence in favor of each potential response, and respond when the accumulated evidence passes a certain threshold.</p><p>In the drift diffusion model, evidence accumulation is controlled by the drift rate parameter δ. Here we assume that the drift rate is linear with the coherence level <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and thus fit a single drift rate for each session. The threshold for decision is controlled by the decision boundary α. Lastly, the reaction times are modeled as the sum of the evidence accumulation time and the non-decision time τ , which captures processes such as stimulus encoding and motor response.   <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: The dynamic computational phenotype in the Go/No-Go task. For each parameter, the left plot shows its mean and standard error across participants in each week (derived from the independent model), and the right plot shows the relative contribution of each source (derived from the dynamic model). Arrows indicate the direction of the effect on each parameter over time -positive (up) or negative (down), for effects with pd &gt; 95. Error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM) across participants.</p><p>Behaviorally, the accuracy across all motion coherence values improved over time and all conditions were well described by a power-law curve (R 2 adj ≥ 0.9, p &lt; 0.01 for all conditions using a random permutation test). Model parameters showed moderate stability: decision boundary α (median ICC 0.56), non-decision time τ (0.68) and drift rate δ (0.73). Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure S7</ref> shows the mean parameter values over time estimated using the independent model. While the decision boundary α and the non-decision time τ decrease, the drift rate δ increases with practice. Using the dynamic model, we found a certainly existing negative effect of practice (pd=100, median RC=0.25) for the decision boundary and a certainly existing positive effect of practice (pd=100, median RC=0.41) for the drift rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lottery Ticket</head><p>In the Lottery ticket task, participants chose to bet on one of two displayed tickets <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The "risky" ticket offered a gamble between a very high and very low sum of money, while the "safe" ticket offered a gamble between two moderate sums of money. We used a risk-sensitive utility function <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> to estimate the perceived expected value of each ticket, which was governed by the risk attitude parameter (ρ). Higher ρ indicates a higher tendency to prefer risky choices. We used a softmax probability function to model participants' choices, with the inverse temperature parameter (β) as a free parameter.</p><p>Both task parameters were highly stable (median ICC 0.95 and 0.9, respectively; 2). Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure S7</ref> shows the mean parameter values over time estimated using the independent model. Using the dynamic model, we found a certainly existing positive practice effect (pd=100, median RC=0.32) for inverse temperature. For the risk attitude, we found a certainly existing positive effect of practice (pd=100, median RC=0.51).</p><p>See Supplementary Information for similar analysis of the excluded participants who chose the "safe" ticket almost exclusively. Note that attempting to fit the data of all participants simultaneously resulted in severe convergence issues, indicated by large R-hat values and by a large number of divergences. This is probably the result of the extreme differences in phenotype parameters that best explain the different behavior patterns of the two groups ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figures S16-S17</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intertemporal Choice</head><p>In the Intertemporal choice task, participants were asked to choose between a small, but immediate amount of money or a larger amount, but temporally delayed.</p><p>For modeling participants' behavior, we adopted a model introduced by Kirby &amp; Maraković <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> where the tendency to prefer delayed rewards is represented by the discount rate parameter (k). Larger k values indicate greater impulsivity and preference to receive immediate rewards. We adapted the original hyperbolic function model with a softmax probability function to model participants' choice stochasticity, governed by the inverse temperature parameter (β) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> Larger β indicates less stochastic behavior. (See Supplementary Information for an analysis based on the original model without the softmax decision rule).</p><p>Both task parameters showed excellent stability (median ICC 0.91 and 0.93 for β and k, respectively; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure S7</ref> shows mean parameter values over time based on the independent model, suggesting that inverse temperature increases with practice. Using the dynamic model, we found a certainly existing effect of practice on the inverse temperature (pd=100, median RC=0.23), as well as a certainly existing effect of valence (pd=100, median RC=0.13).   These results indicate that decisions became more deterministic with practice. For the discount rate, we found a certainly existing effect of practice (pd=100, median RC=0.21), associated with reduced discounting of future reward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-armed Bandit</head><p>In the Two-armed Bandit task, participants chose between two "slot machines" labeled either R (risky) or S (safe). While risky machines led to a different reward outcome every time, the safe machines provided the same outcome every time. To model participants' behavior, we used the model introduced by Gershman <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, which accounts for different types of exploratory behavior. Specifically, we used a probit regression model in which choice is probabilistically governed by 3 factors. Exploitative choices are promoted by the weight of the estimated value difference of the two machines (w V ). Directed exploration is governed by the weight of the relative uncertainty between the two machines (w RU ). Random exploration is controlled by the weight of the signed total uncertainty (w sign(V )/T U ). We deviated from the original model by using the sign of V rather than V itself. This promoted model convergence and led to a better fit to behavioral data in an independent dataset (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Information)</ref>.</p><p>Behaviorally, the probability of choosing the machine with the higher expected value increases over weeks in all conditions and is fit reasonably well by a power-law curve (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure  S6</ref>. RS/SR: R 2 adj ≥ 0.4, p &lt; 0.05, random permutation test; SS: R 2 adj = 0.8, p &lt; 0.01; RR: R 2 adj = 0.6, p &lt; 0.01, random permutation test). Using the independent model, we found that all task parameters increased with practice. While the weight for the estimated value difference w V seems to increase gradually, the weights for uncertainty-driven behavior (w sign(V )/T U and w RU ) dramatically increased between the first and second sessions, and fluctuated afterwards.</p><p>These observations are in line with the stability results for the model parameters. The weight for estimated value difference between arms w V showed poor stability (median ICC 0.49), while the weights for relative uncertainty (w RU ) and signed total uncertainty (w sign(V )/T U ) showed moderate stability (median ICC 0.61 and 0.62, respectively). Using the dynamic model, we found a certainly existing positive effect of practice for all model parameters (pd=100, median RC=0.43 for the w V , median RC=0.48 for w sign(V )/T U and median RC=0.29 for w RU ). For the weight of relative uncertainty w RU , we also found a likely existing effect of valence (pd=98, median RC = 0.058).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numerosity Comparison</head><p>In the numerosity comparison task, participants indicated which of two presented clusters of golden coins contained more coins. To model participants' responses, we assumed that the number of coins in each cluster is encoded as a noisy estimate that follows a normal distribution centered around the true value a, with a magnitude-dependent noise a 2 w 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The parameter w is the Weber fraction, which controls the magnitude-dependence of noise.</p><p>Behaviorally, participants' accuracy in this task was very stable (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>). The subtle improvement in accuracy over time was fit well by a power-law curve (R 2 adj = 0.65, p &lt; 0.001, random permutation test). Inspection of the average parameter value based on the baseline model did not indicate any clear temporal trend. The Weber fraction showed good stability (median ICC 0.81). Using the dynamic model, we found a certainly existing negative effect of practice (pd=100, median RC = 0.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we introduced a longitudinal dataset and a statistical framework that together allowed us to explore the dynamic nature of the computational phenotype. Our model, fit to 90 participants performing seven tasks across 12 weeks, revealed the existence of three dynamical processes influencing computational parameters: practice, affective state and random noise. While this list is not exhaustive, it supports the view that the nature of the computational phenotype is dynamic and that some of its variability tracks meaningful changes in participant-related factors, rather than simply reflecting unreliability (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>). This view emphasizes the structured temporal variation in the computational phenotype, and suggests that it should be measured to provide insight into the inter-and intra-individual cognitive variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practice effects</head><p>In our study, almost all of the parameters comprising the computational phenotype were affected by practice. Even though we aimed to reduce practice effects by using different stimuli across weeks (e.g., different fractal images in the Go/No-Go task), we found a monotonic increase in the average accuracy in tasks where objective accuracy can be defined. Interestingly, in tasks that indicate personal preference, such as the Intertemporal Choice task, the choices that participants made become less stochastic with practice.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with existing studies examining effects of repetitive task administration on performance and on the estimated computational phenotype. The behavioral practice effects associated with improved task performance we report in our study are consistent with prior studies on repetitive administration of the Random Dot Motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, Numerosity Comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and Change Detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> tasks. The changes we observed in the parameters of the models for Random Dot Motion and the Intertemporal Choice tasks are also consistent with the previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</p><p>Even though task performance was adequate already in the first session, we observed continued improvement in task performance for some of the tasks well after the first few sessions. Since practice effects are a main confounding factor in longitudinal studies, these results imply that one cannot safely assume that task performance plateaus after a session or two, let alone after baseline practice (see discussion in <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>). Nevertheless, we found that practice effects were captured well by a power-law function, meaning that the relative contribution of practice effects diminishes with time. This is important for longitudinal experimental designs, since it could potentially allow other meaningful sources of longitudinal variability to become more prominent in later sessions (when they are less likely to be washed out by large practice effects).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affective state effects</head><p>Previous studies examined the effects of affect on the computational phenotype by manipulating mood or stress. For example, acute stress induction altered "model-based", but not "model-free" decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. In another study, induction of positive or negative mood throughout the task was associated with biased reward perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. In the current study, we focused on day-to-day spontaneous mood fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. We found that these fluctuations (particularly affective valence) were associated with temporal variation in 3 parameters: inverse temperature (Intertemporal Choice), lapse rate (Go/No-Go) and weight of relative uncertainty (Two-armed Bandit). Interestingly, these parameters are all associated with choice stochasticity. However, the specific effect of valence on choice stochasticity differed between parameters. Higher valence (more positive mood) was associated with more stochastic choices in the Intertemporal Choice task (lower inverse temperature), but more deterministic choices in the Go/No-Go task (lower lapse rate). In the Two-armed Bandit task, higher valence was associated with lower weight of relative uncertainty, thereby reducing the effect of uncertainty-guided directed exploration.</p><p>These findings hint at a complex relationship between mood and choice stochasticity. The positive relationship between valence and decreased choice stochasticity we report for two of three parameters is partially consistent with a previous study showing that positive mood predicted increased exploitation and high arousal predicted increased exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>). Our mixed findings could reflect fundamentally different sources for choice stochasticity in different tasks, each affected differently by mood. Our data-driven approach using PCA led to a general valence component, and future studies might benefit from a fine-grained analysis of the specific effects of different emotions on the computational phenotype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A longitudinal design improves our understanding of cognition</head><p>Our findings show that employing a longitudinal design permits a more nuanced comprehension of cognitive processes across longer time scales. An illustrative case of this point is the Go/No-Go task. Using a well-established Pavlovian RL model of this task [37], we were not able to fully capture participants' behavior (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S9)</ref>. Specifically, the model failed to account for participants' correct responses in the avoid-punishment conditions. Previous work using other reinforcement learning tasks suggests that participants perceive outcomes in a context-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Based on this idea, we were able to resolve the disagreement between the predicted and observed data by introducing a minor modification to the model, allowing the agent to learn from neutral outcomes (see Methods). Specifically, the modified model assumes that participants perceive neutral stimuli as rewards in the presence of punishments, and as punishments in the presence of rewards. It is noteworthy that the original model adequately fit the data from the first session, which may explain why the proposed modified model remained undiscovered until a longitudinal perspective was taken. Only through observing participants' behavior over time did this subtle nuance emerge as a robust effect.</p><p>One additional striking observation which became evident with the longitudinal design is the increased accuracy in the "No-Go to win" condition. One of the most established behvioral findings in the Go/No-Go paradigm is that participants are better in learning "Go" responses in reward conditions and "No-Go" in punishment conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In our study, while we observed improvement in all conditions of the Go/No-Go task over sessions, the "No-Go to win" condition showed the most significant improvement in accuracy and even surpassed "Go to avoid" condition, thus reducing the preference towards "No-Go" responses in the punishment conditions. This is likely explained by the decrease we found in the Pavlovian bias with practice, such that participants become less likely to withhold a key press in this punishment condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling limitations</head><p>For most of the parameters in the computational phenotype, a large fraction of the temporal variability was not attributed to one of the systematic sources we explored in this study (practice and state effects), but was associated with noise. One reason for this could be lack of relevant data that could have been collected longitudinally. While the daily surveys covered a wide range of questions that targeted participants' mood and daily habits, it is possible that relevant factors remained unexplored. Furthermore, the surveys related to the participants' daily state, rather than to momentary state during task performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, which would require a more frequent and fine-grain mood assessment, which was out of the scope of the current study.</p><p>Alternatively, it might be possible to reduce the prominence of noise by refining the dynamic model. For simplicity, as well as for promoting the convergence of our estimation procedure, we assumed similar effects across participants. In modeling the practice effects, we assumed a powerlaw change over time, whereby the magnitude is modulated by the participant-specific baseline, and the exponent was sampled from a population distribution. In modeling the state effects, we normalized the state measures within each participant and assumed population-level effects only. We made these modeling choices to tractably capture the primary effects observed in the data. This approach may conceal more nuanced participant-specific effects that potentially await to be revealed. To capture such effects, a more intricate modeling approach could be pursued, albeit at the cost of increased model complexity and potential challenges in parameter estimation.</p><p>Overall, we believe that capturing additional sources of variability in the computational phenotype is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying cognitive processes. While understanding these sources will not necessarily make the measurement more stable, in principle it could be used to obtain a "cleaner" measurement. For example, by collecting data that account for participants' affective state, one could regress out the state effects from the measured phenotype. Structural and functional neural states could also be longitudinally recorded concurrently with task performance to increase modeling accuracy in future studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Neural data can be used to associate the computational phenotype with specific biological phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Although collecting reliable neurophysiological daily point-estimates is a challenging task, recent advances in individualized brain imaging make this direction practically feasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref> and particularly exciting in the context of translational neuroscience, potential for clinical application, and precision medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>.</p><p>It is important to consider that participants in our study performed each task once a week, meaning that our dynamic model captured practice-related and affect-related effects based on this temporal resolution of longitudinal probing. The effects we report might be different when applying a different experimental protocol where participants perform the tasks every day or once a month. For example, we would expect the practice effects to be reduced as the spacing between sessions is increased.</p><p>The results we present here in terms of phenotype dynamics over time could depend on the specific variant of the task. For example, different methods for risk elicitation in the Lottery ticket task differ in terms of parameter magnitude and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. More work is needed to determine how parameter stability is affected by the presentation method (for example, presenting the different lotteries as a single list or trial by trial, as we did here).</p><p>Different statistical approaches could be used to study the effects that influence the dynamics of the computational phenotype. We chose a generative Bayesian model that makes explicit assumptions about the functional form of these dynamical effects and their underlying prior distributions. The main advantages of this approach are in providing the full posterior distribution of the model parameters, and in providing a suitably flexible hypothesis space supporting stronger inference. This is in contrast to techniques such as linear regression, which is less suitable in this case, since its hypothesis space is too restrictive. Consider for example the well established power law form of practice effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. While our generative model allows fitting of power law parameters for each participant, a linear regression model would require defining a fixed practice curve across the population, with the regression coefficient as a single free parameter that scales this curve.</p><p>An interesting future direction would be to model all tasks simultaneously, rather than one by one. That would allow to reveal potential relationships in the computational phenotype across tasks and to uncover unified cognitive processes that underlie seemingly disparate computational parameters. Our findings reveal one challenge associated with this approach: the prevalence of practice effects might lead to spurious correlations among computational parameters that are in fact independent of each other. Therefore, a systematic examination of cross-task relationships might require a more sophisticated experimental design that would allow us to tease apart spurious and true sources of shared variation.</p><p>The modeling framework we present here combines task-specific computational models with a general dynamic model of the computational phenotype. Together, they comprise a generative model in the sense that given model parameters, one can produce a time-series of phenotype values (with practice effects and affective effects governed by the model parameters) and simulate behavioral data <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. This generative model, however, is not mechanistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. While we hint at specific relations between certain state effects (e.g., affective arousal) and phenotype parameters (e.g., risk attitude), understanding a mechanism that underlies these relationships is an open question in cognitive neuroscience.</p><p>Establishing the reliability of the computational phenotype is crucial if one seeks to study human cognition through computational models of behavior. As illustrated by Karvelis and colleagues <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>, characterizing parameter reliability is only the first step in a hierarchy of steps, which was beyond the scope of our current research. A next important step in laying the psychometric foundation of computational phenotypes would be to establish their external validity and to compare it with the external validity of simpler summary statistics of task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Our study demonstrates that the computational phenotype can be highly dynamic. These dynamics to some extent reflect random fluctuations, and in this sense are truly "unreliable" (i.e., there is temporal variation that we do not yet know how to capture). At the same time, many parameters show structured covariation with time (specifically, practice effects) and with affective state. This suggests that the quest for reliable computational phenotypes may be the wrong way to think about such constructs. Rather, the quest must be redirected towards understanding the multiple sources of temporal variation underlying cognition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk through CloudResearch services. In order to increase the likelihood for continued participation throughout the study, the participant pool was filtered to have an approval rating of 90% or above. Participants were compensated at a rate of $10/hour. An additional payment of $6 per week in task bonuses could also be earned based on performance. Participants were also eligible to receive one-time $5 and $10 bonuses based on continued participation after 4 weeks and 8 week respectively (study mile-stones). Participants who finished all 12 weeks of the study were awarded an additional $15 completion bonus. Participants read the study description via Amazon Mechanical Turk and indicated whether they agree to participate with a button press. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Harvard University and was performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.</p><p>In total, 141 participants were recruited for the study. Participants were considered to take part in the study if they provided answers to the demographics and personal survey questionnaires that were administered together in the first day of the study. Due to a technical issue, demographic data were not collected from one participant. Since the main interest of the study was to examine the temporal dynamics of the computational phenotype, we only included participants who had at least 6 weeks of task data with no more than three missing consecutive weeks for each task. Out of the initial cohort, 90 participants (mean age: 39.4 ± 10.8 years; 47 identified as males, 41 identified as females, 1 identified as queer) satisfied these criteria. All further analyses were performed on this subset of participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and procedure</head><p>The study was comprised of 7 experimental tasks (described below). Based on the average amount of time required for each task, the tasks were divided into three groups or "sessions" performed on a weekly basis (two-three tasks per day). The order of tasks was shuffled each week within the session, however tasks did not rotate between sessions and session order remained fixed for all participants throughout the entire study. Participants completed one session a day for three consecutive days, every week for 12 consecutive weeks. At the beginning of each session participants completed a survey that asked 36 questions pertaining to their mood and health (e.g., "How stressed are you now?"; see Supplementary for all the survey questions). In the first session of the experiment, participants also completed a survey about their demographic data and personality traits, including Barratt Impulsiveness Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> and the DOSPERT scale for domain-specific risk-attitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.</p><p>Below we summarize the procedure for each task. Detailed descriptions can be found in the Supplementary Information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Go/No-Go</head><p>The design of this task was modified from a version created by Guitart-Masip and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The task has 3 blocks, each 80 trials long with a distinct set of 4 visual stimuli. On each trial, participants are shown one of the stimuli and asked to choose whether between pressing the space bar ("Go") or withholding a press ("No-Go"). At the end of the trial, participants received feedback in the form of reward (gain of points), punishment (loss of points), or a neutral outcome (neither gain or loss of points). Each stimulus prescribed a correct response: "Go to win", "Go to avoid punishment", "No-Go to win", and "No-Go to avoid punishment". If a stimulus was associated with the outcome rule "to win", and the correct response was selected, there was an 80% chance that the participant will win points (indicated by a green thumbs-up image), and a 20% chance that they will neither win or lose points (indicated by a flat gray hand image). If the stimulus was associated with the outcome rule "to avoid punishment" and the correct response was selected, there was an 80% chance that the participant will neither win or lose points (indicated by a flat gray hand image), and a 20% chance that they will lose points (indicated by a red thumbs-down image). If an incorrect response was selected, there was an 80% chance of receiving a neutral outcome in the win conditions or a punishment outcome in the punishment conditions. Each trial was followed by a 750-1500 ms intertrial interval with a fixation cross.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we classified participants into learners and non-learners. We defined non-learners as participants who had an average accuracy of less than 0.55 through the study. We focus our analysis on the 66 out of 90 participants classified as learners (for comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> found a similar fraction of learners, 19 out of 30 participants).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change Detection</head><p>The Change Detection task, based on the one studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, tests the participants' ability to detect a change between pairs of images. The images were sets of colored squares arranged in a ring formation. On each trial, one image was shown for 100 ms, followed by an intertrial interval (gray screen with white fixation cross presented for 1500 ms), and then a probe image, which was either the same as the first image (no-change condition) or different (change condition). In the change condition, one or more of the squares changes color. After the second image was shown participants were asked if the two presented images were the same or different, and how confident they were in their decision. Participants received feedback stating if they were correct of incorrect.</p><p>The task consisted of five blocks, each with 40 trials. For four of the blocks, the set size (the number of squares in the array) was either three, four, six or eight squares. Additionally there was one block with a set size of eight, and between zero and four squares changed color on each trial (the "multiple targets" block). Set size did not change within blocks except for during the practice trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random Dot Motion</head><p>On each trial of the Random Dot Motion task, participants are tasked with reporting the direction (left vs. right) of a cloud of moving dots. While some percentage of the dots (5%, 10%, 35% or 50%) are moving coherently in the same direction, other dots are moving in random directions. Participants completed 4 experimental blocks, each containing 96 trials. On every trial, the participant was shown a cluster of 200 randomly distributed white dots on a dark grey background. Participants had 1500 ms to determine the direction of motion of the coherently moving dots. After each trial, a 300ms intertrial interval showing a centered white fixation cross on a dark grey background was shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lottery Ticket</head><p>In the Lottery Ticket task, participants choose to bet on one of two possible tickets <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The "risky" ticket offers a gamble between a very high and very low sum of money. The "safe" ticket offers a gamble between two moderate sums of money. The odds associated with the outcomes are always the same between tickets. For example, the safe ticket may provide a 20% chance of winning $2, and an 80% chance of winning $1.60, while the risky ticket provides a 20% chance of winning $3.85 and an 80% chance of winning $0.10. The task consisted of three blocks, each 10 trials long. Each block utilized a different monetary range: low (EV ≈ $2), medium (EV ≈ $50), and high (EV ≈ $200). For modeling purposes, we removed trials with a win probability of 100%.</p><p>Even though this task reflects personal preference and there are no objective correct or incorrect decisions, we excluded participants who chose the same option on over 80% of the trials (these were all participants who chose the "Safe" option), leaving 58 participants for further analyses pertaining to this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intertemporal Choice</head><p>The Intertemporal Choice task is a subjective monetary questionnaire in which participants indicate their preference between a smaller amount of money available immediately or a larger amount of money available at a later time. This task is based on the one studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Each delayed monetary reward (small, medium, large) was used three times in the task, for a total of 27 trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-Armed Bandit</head><p>This task closely followed the design of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. On each trial, participants chose between two "slot machines" labeled either R (risky) or S (safe). Risky machines led to a different reward outcome every time; safe machines provided the same outcome every time. Participants were informed that one machine was always better than the other, and their task was to make choices that earn as much reward as possible. Participants had to explore each machine to determine which one had the higher expected reward. The task consisted of 30 blocks, each 10 trials long. The mean and variance of the machines changed across blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numerosity Comparison</head><p>In ihe Numerosity Comparison task, participants were required to make a judgement about which "treasure chest" has more "gold coins" hovering above it. Participants were told that all gold coins have the same value regardless of size. Gold coins were represented by yellow dots on a black background in an invisibly bounded section above a treasure chest. There were always two chests presented on a screen in every trial, one chest was the left side of the screen and one chest was on the right side of the screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. The task was 160 trials long. No two chests had exactly the same number of gold coins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal survey</head><p>The personal survey consisted of 36 questions. We excluded one question that allowed participants to freely express any issue they find relevant that was not captured by rest of the questions (question n.34 in the survey, see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Methods)</ref>. To reduce the number of items used in the dynamic model (see below), we ran a dimensionality reduction analysis on the survey responses. For each survey item, we z-scored the responses across participants (ignoring missing sessions), and then performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We used the top two components, which explained 32% and 9% of the variance in the data, respectively. Missing sessions were linearly interpolated after running PCA. Based on the principal component loadings, we interpreted these components as follows (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S12</ref>):</p><p>• PC1 -Affective valence: This PC loaded positively on items assessing positive emotions (e.g., enthusiasm, happiness, relaxation) and negatively on items assesing negative emotions (e.g., nervousness, being upset, irritation, sadness, loneliness, hostility).</p><p>• PC2 -Affective arousal: This PC loaded positively on all items assessing affective state, as well as on items assessing stress, energy levels, being active, sleeping well, and eating healthy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical models</head><p>We modeled all the task data using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which has been shown to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation compared with methods that fit the data of each participant (or session) independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Specifically, for each task, the parameters for a given session are drawn from a participant-specific prior distribution. The parameters of this prior distribution, in turn, are drawn from a group-level distribution with weakly informative hyperpriors. As detailed below, we fit two main variants of this hierarchical model: an independent model and a dynamic model. The key difference between them is that the independent model assumes that session-level parameters are conditionally independent given the participant-level parameters, whereas the dynamic model assumes that the session-level parameters have structured temporal correlations induced by practice and state variables (valence and arousal).</p><p>To illustrate the advantage of accounting for the full hierarchical structure of the data (sessions nested within participants), in the Supplementary Information we provide results based on a third, reduced model that only considers a single level of hierarchy. This reduced model treats the parameters of all sessions as independent draws from a single group-level prior distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent model</head><p>In the independent model, the parameter values across sessions for a given participant are sampled independently around a participant-specific baseline:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y s t ∼ N (µ s , σ 2 ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where y s t is the phenotype for participant s at time t, defined in the unconstrained space (i.e., before appropriate transformation are applied to ensure positivity or other constraints; see Supplementary Information for details) and σ 2 is the variance (i.e., the dispersion of session-level parameters around the participant-level mean). The participant-level mean µ s is sampled from a normal distribution at the group level:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">µ s ∼ N (µ g , η 2 g ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Notice that the session-level σ 2 was defined at the group level. The sampled phenotype value for participant s and session t is therefore the sum of 2 terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y s t = µ s + (σ s t ) 2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where (σ s t ) 2 is the sampled noise term for the session. The group-level parameters σ 2 , µ g , η 2</p><p>g are given weakly-informative hyper-priors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">σ 2 ∼ N + (0, 1) (5) µ g ∼ N (0, 1) (6) η 2 g ∼ N + (0, 1)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where N + (0, 1) denotes the half-Normal distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reduced model</head><p>The reduced model is similar to the independent model, except that it is missing the participantlevel priors. The parameter values across all sessions in the dataset are sampled independently around the group baseline:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y s t ∼ N (µ g , σ 2 ).<label>(8)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic model</head><p>In the dynamic model, the parameter values across sessions are governed by practice and state effects:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y s t ∼ N (µ s + δ s p (1 − t −b s ) + δ s v v s t + δ s a a s t , σ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>a sum of the following terms:</p><p>• Baseline term: µ s is the participant-specific baseline.</p><p>• Practice term:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">δ s p (1 − t −b s ) is a plateauing power law. δ s p ∈ (−µ s , µ s )</formula><p>is the maximal possible change due to practice, modeled as a fraction of the participant-specific baseline. This fraction is fixed across participants. To promote parameter identifiability, we constrain the learning exponent to be e −2 &lt; b s &lt; e 1 (otherwise the learning curve could flatten and trade off with the baseline term).</p><p>• State terms: δ s v and δ s a are the maximal possible changes due to practice, valence and arousal effects, respectively. Similarly to the practice term, they are modeled as fixed fractions of the baseline term µ s . The state predictors v s t and a s t are normalized within participant, to vary between -1 and 1 across sessions. This reflects the assumption that the phenotype of each participant is affected by the participant-specific state fluctuations around his or her own baseline, and ensures that the scale of the state terms is governed by δ s v and δ s a .</p><p>• Noise term: σ s is the participant-specific noise.</p><p>The sampled phenotype value for participant s and session t is therefor the sum of 5 terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">y s t = µ s + δ s p (1 − t −b s ) + δ s v v s t + δ s a a s t + (σ s t ) 2 .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>In addition to the priors used in the independent model above, we specified the each dynamic parameter δ i and their weakly-informative priors as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">δ s i = δ i µ s (11) δ i = 2Φ(δ prior i ) − 1 (12) δ prior i ∼ N (0, 1)<label>(13)</label></formula><p>This formulation ensures that δ i ∈ (−1, 1), such that each dynamic term can either increase or decrease the phenotype y s t .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter estimation</head><p>Parameters were estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (we used the default No-U-Turn sampler) implemented in the Stan software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. For each model we ran 4 chains with 1000 warmup iterations and 1000 kept iterations. We used default sapling parameters, and initialized each parameter to zero in the unconstrained space. We used the posterior mean for each session and participant as a point estimate of the dynamic computational phenotype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Posterior predictive checks</head><p>To check whether our computational models adequately matched participants' behavior, we simulated data from the fitted models and compared it to behavior on each task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3a</ref> and Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S8)</ref>. For each task we generated a figure that captures the key behavioral signatures, and compared the empirical data (averaged across participants and sessions) with the predicted data (averaged across participants, sessions and posterior samples).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter identifiability</head><p>To establish parameter identifiability, we refit the simulated data and checked the degree of match (as measured by correlation) between the recovered and ground truth parameters. To generate the simulated data, we used the same trial data as presented to the participants, with the following exceptions. The outcomes (rewards/punishments) in the Go/No-Go task and the Two-armed Bandit task were simulated based on the agent's choices. For these two tasks we drew the trial-wise outcomes from the same distributions as those presented to the participants, resulting in somewhat different trials than those presented to the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter stability</head><p>To estimate the stability of each phenotype parameter over time, we followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and calculated nonparametric bootstrapped intraclass correlations, ICC(2,1), with 1000 samples (bootstrapping over participants) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>. For each phenotype parameter, we used the mean of the posterior distribution as a point estimate, and calculated the ICC based on a 90x12 data matrix (90 participants with 12 sessions each) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. However, as noted earlier, some participants had missing sessions, and ICC cannot be calculated with missing data. Therefore, for each task, we calculated the ICC based only on participants with complete data. After incorporating the behavioral exclusion criteria (see above), this yielded the following number of participants per task: Go/No-Go (53), Change detection (65), Intertemporal choice (67), Lottery ticket (47), Numerosity comparison (69), Two-armed bandit (66), Random dot motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(73)</ref>. To verify that this methodological choice does not impact our main results, we repeated the ICC calculation with a different approach. This time, we used data from all participants, but using only the maximal number of sessions N max that existed for all participants. For participants with more sessions, we used the first N max sessions of each participant. The N max values were: Go/No-Go -9, Change detection -8, Lottery ticket -8, Two-armed bandit -8, Random dot motion -9, Intertemporal choice -7 and Numerosity comparison -8.</p><p>Since we are interested in quantifying the stability of the computational phenotype, it is important to rule out the possibility that methodological considerations, rather than true variability over time, drive the ICC to lower values. For example, even a stable phenotype might seem unstable if not enough trials are used to estimate the computational parameters. To estimate an upper bound for the ICC values given our experimental design, we simulated data from an idealized case in which the distribution of parameter values are the same as in our empirical data, but each agent has a perfectly stable phenotype that remains unchanged throughout the 12 simulated sessions. Specifically, we simulated data from 90 agents, based on the phenotype values of the first session in the empirical data. Then, we refit the independent model to the simulated data to obtain new estimated parameters (which should now be stable over sessions) and calculated the ICC for each parameter. In addition to the ICC of the computational phenotype, we also calculated the ICC values of behavioral summary statistics, namely accuracy and mean reaction time (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relative contribution and probability of direction</head><p>To estimate the relative contribution that each dynamical term has on the final phenotype, we used the different terms of the dynamic model in the unconstrained space. For simplicity, we used the posterior mean of each term for each participant, yielding a time series of up to 12 time points per term. As a measure of amplitude, we calculate the standard deviation SD k of each term k across sessions. The relative contribution of term k to the final phenotype is defined as: SD k / K i=1 SD i . Intuitively, dynamical terms with a wider spread contibute more to the variability of the phenotype over time.</p><p>Rather than using a binary test such as exclusion of zero from the highest density interval, we chose to quantify the evidence supporting each dynamical effect using the probaility of direction (PD). PD is the percentage of posterior probability that has the same sign as the median <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88]</ref>.</p><p>Code availability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary information for Dynamic computational phenotyping of human cognition</head><p>To begin a task, participants first had to accept a prompt that expanded their browser window to full screen mode. They then received instructions about the general procedure, and how to perform each task. Two multiple-choice comprehension questions reflecting important instructions had to be correctly answered to proceed. If one or more of the questions was incorrectly answered, participants were redirected to the beginning of the instructions. Every task except for the Intertemporal choice and Lottery ticket tasks included a short practice block, which was a shortened version of the tasks. Each practice block had built in "suspicion checks". If a participant always chose the same answer, chose no answers, or had an unusually high rate of error, "suspicion checks" were triggered and participants were sent back to the beginning of the instructions. This could happen a maximum of three times. To incentivise participants to perform all tasks as instructed, monetary bonus, proportional to their performance level, was awarded. No performance-based bonus was earned in the Intertemporal Choice task and during practice blocks of all tasks.</p><p>At the end of each task, participants were asked if they experienced any technological issues or major distractions, and how engaged they were in the task. Participants were also given the opportunity to provide any other feedback they felt appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Go/No-Go</head><p>In the Go/No-Go task, participants were instructed on the four types of stimulus presented in each block: "Go to win", "No-Go to win", "Go to avoid punishment", and "No-Go to avoid punishment". Each of these rules was randomly shuffled to be represented by a pseudo-fractal image. After a 48 trial long practice block, participants completed three 80 trial long experimental blocks (20 trials per condition). Different images were associated with different conditions in each block, but the same images were reused each week. The rule attached to each image was determined anew every week.</p><p>Each trial began with an intertrial-interval (ITI) displaying a fixation cross centered on a blank screen for a duration of 750ms, 900ms, 1050ms, 1200ms, 1350ms, or 1500ms. Each ITI duration occurred the same number of times in a block, and were shuffled randomly between trials. The stimulus image was then displayed for up to 1000ms. If the participant chose the "Go" response by pressing the space bar, that ended the trial early. A "No-Go" response was implemented by waiting for 1500 ms until the stimulus disappeared. Stimulus images were immediately followed by 1000ms of feedback.</p><p>Feedback could either be positive, as indicated by a green thumbs up, negative as indicated by a red thumbs down, or neutral as indicated by a grey flat hand with the palm down. If a participant correctly chose the response in a "to win" rule stimulus, there was an 80% chance they would receive positive feedback and a 20% chance they would receive neutral feedback. If they incorrectly responded in a "to win" rule stimulus, there was a 80% chance they would receive neutral feedback and a 20% chance they would receive positive feedback. If a participant correctly responded to a stimulus whose rule is "to avoid punishment" there was an 80% chance they would receive neutral feedback, and a 20% chance they would receive negative feedback. If they incorrectly responded to the "to avoid punishment" stimulus, there was an 80% chance they would receive negative feedback, and a 20% chance they would receive neutral feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Change Detection</head><p>In the Change Detection task participants saw a pair of sequentially presented images and were asked to determine if the images were the same (no-change type) or if they were different (change type), and how confident they were in that judgement <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Each image showed a number of colored squares arranged on an invisible ring with a dark grey background. Squares, by their HTML color name and RGB values could be:  <ref type="bibr">(255,</ref><ref type="bibr">182,</ref><ref type="bibr">193)</ref>. These colors were chosen to be easily distinguishable from one another. Colors were not repeated in a given image when there were less than 8 squares being shown. In conditions that showed eight squares a color could be repeated no more than once and neither image in a pair could show two of the same colors next to one another.</p><p>Participants completed five experimental blocks, each 40 trials long and one practice block 14 trials long. In four of the five blocks, trials were divided evenly between change type and no-change type. During a change type trial only one square (the target) would change color. These blocks differed by the number of squares, three, four, six, or eight, shown in each image. The number of squares did not vary within the block. In the remaining experimental block, eight squares were shown, but the number of targets varied between one and four. Trials in this block were evenly divided between no change, one target changed, two targets changed, three targets changed, and four targets changed. Trial types were were shuffled within blocks. The order of blocks was randomly shuffled at the beginning of each experiment. The practice block was completed prior to the experimental blocks, and it included one of every trial and condition type with regard to change/no-change, number of squares shown, and number of targets changed.</p><p>Participants had 100ms to look at each image, and had a between-image gap of 1500ms. During this gap the screen remained dark grey and a white fixation cross was displayed in the center of the screen. After the second image a white screen appeared asking them if the images had been the same or different and participants indicated their choice with a mouse cursor. There was no time limit set for this question, and participants were instructed that accuracy was more important than speed in this task. Immediately following this question was another asking them to rank their confidence for the previous judgment. Participants had four buttons on their screen that allowed them to select with a mouse "Very Unconfident", "Somewhat Unconfident", "Somewhat Confident", or "Very Confident". After the two questions participants received 500ms of feedback that displayed, "Correct" in green text or "Incorrect" in red text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Random Dot Motion</head><p>The Random Dot Motion task was taken from a standard random dot kinetogram task template on jsPsych <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Participants completed four experimental blocks, each containing 96 trials <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Experimental blocks were preceded by a practice block, 16 trials long. On every trial, participants were shown a cluster of 200 randomly distributed white dots on a dark grey background. Dots were confined to an invisible ellipse shaped boundary in the center of the screen. A percentage of the dots: 5%, 10%, 35%, or 50% moved in a coherent direction, either left of right. The remainder of the dots moved randomly within the boundary. Each direction and percentage of coherently moving dots occurred with equal frequency and were shuffled randomly within the blocks.</p><p>Participants had 1500ms to determine the direction of motion of the coherently moving dots. They indicated their choice by pressing the corresponding left or right arrow key on their keyboard. Trials ended when a decision was made. During the practice block, each trial was followed by a 300ms period of feedback. Feedback was displayed as colored text on the dark grey background and could be a red "Incorrect", green "Correct", yellow "Too Slow" (if they did not answer within the 1500 ms timeframe), or yellow "Too Fast" (if they answered in less than 250 ms). During the experimental (non-practice) blocks, no feedback was given if participant answered correctly, however, they did receive 300ms of feedback for being incorrect, too fast, or too slow. After the trial and/or feedback, a 300ms intertrial-interval showing a centered white fixation cross on a dark grey background was shown <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Lottery Ticket</head><p>In the Lottery Ticket task participants chose between a "risky" or a "safe" ticket to gamble on. The task had 3 blocks, which tested small, medium, or large amounts of monetary reward (see below). Each block was 10 trials long such that probabilities associated with any given monetary outcome spanned between 0% and 100% in increments of 10, and the sum of probabilities on each ticket totaled 100%. The probabilities were the same between tickets in a given trial. Participants used the right and left arrow keys on their keyboard to indicate their preference between one of the two tickets. Participants could make a response only starting 1500ms following trial onset to avoid random decisions.</p><p>The expected value for all tickets were calculated by first establishing the lower monetary reward offered in the risky ticket (henceforth referred to as the "risky lesser amount"). A Box-Muller function was used to determine this amount to be between $0.01-0.20 (1 cent increments) for the small bets block, between $1-5 ($0.25 increments) for the medium bets block, and between $5-15 ($0.50 increments) for the large bets block. The stimuli used for the task were generated anew each week by randomly sampling values from each block interval. The higher monetary reward on the risky ticket was the risky lesser amount divided by 0.026. The higher monetary reward on the moderate ticket was the risky lesser amount divided by 0.05. The lower monetary reward on the moderate ticket was the risky lesser amount divided by 0.0625. These amounts were rounded to the nearest increment corresponding to their block. The task consisted of three blocks, each 10 trials long. The order of the blocks was randomly shuffled at the start of each task.</p><p>It should be noted that for each block, there was one trial in which the "risky" ticket was not the riskier bet, as there was a 100% chance that the higher amount offered would be rewarded. This was included as a way of seeing if the participant was paying attention and these trials were not used for modeling purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Intertemporal Choice</head><p>It was previously shown that people differ in assigning value to future consequences of their actions and in the impulsiveness of their decisions <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. In this task, participants used the right and left arrow keys on their keyboard to indicate their preference between a smaller amount of money available immediately or a larger amount of money available at a later time. Participants could make a response only starting 1000ms following trial onset to avoid random decisions.</p><p>Unlike the task used by Kirby <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, we did not use the exact same monetary rewards, delay times and order throughout the study. The specific variables in our version of the task were determined anew with each run of the task to minimize the risk of participants merely memorizing and repeating the same answers from week to week. Variables generated for each trial were consistent with other Intertemporal Choice studies. We used the same discount rate parameters (k): 0.00016, 0.00040, 0.0010, 0.0025, 0.0060, 0.016, 0.041, 0.10, and 0.25. as well as the same small ($25, $30, $35), medium ($50, $55, $60), and large ($75, $80, $85) delayed reward amounts (A) used in <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. The delay (D) was bounded between 7 and 273 days. To determine the delay used and the amount of reward immediately available (V ) the following hyperbolic function was implemented across the range of delays:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">V = A 1 + kD (1)</formula><p>The amount of delay was chosen such that the amount of reward immediately available would be a whole number <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. We used the hyperbolic function to determine the immediately available amount, such that with each given discount rate, the immediate amount and the discounted delayed account will be of equal size. Each group of delay reward (small, medium, large) was used three times in the weekly administration of the task, for a total of 27 trials (1 block). No performance-based bonus was given for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Two-armed Bandit</head><p>In this task, participants were instructed to "play" one of two "slot machines" with the objective of maximizing their reward. Slot machines were represented by two side-by-side brightly colored rectangles the screen with the text "Risky" or "Safe" written in clear black font. The color of the rectangles remained constant within each game but changed between games. Participants played 30 sets of independent machines (games), each for 10 trials. It was emphasized in the instructions that the color of the machine had no bearing on the reward/loss and that, even if a color repeated in the task, there was no connection between the machines in different games. Each set of machines did not necessarily have one risky machine and one safe machine, a game could also be between two safe machines, or two risky machines. The designation for each machine was chosen randomly prior to each game. The exception to this was the practice trial, which always had a safe machine vs risky machine.</p><p>Participants played a slot machine by clicking on one of the colored rectangles with their mouse cursor. After each decision feedback was displayed for 1000ms. Feedback had two lines of text: an upper line displayed how many coins were gained or lost and the font was either green or red based respectively; the lower line of text displayed in black their current coin balance.</p><p>Participants were given a starting "balance" of 250 coins. Every decision they made led to a gain or loss of coins. Instruction comprehension questions checked that they understood that "Risky" machines would lead to a different outcome every time and "Safe" machines would lead to the same outcome every time. The balance carried over between games. For each machine in a game the mean outcome was drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 100. The safe machine returned the same µ(S) outcome every time. The risky machine returned an outcome generated from µ(R) with a standard deviation of 16. Participants were informed that one machine was always better than its counterpart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7">Numerosity Comparison</head><p>In this task, participants used the right and left arrow keys on their keyboard to indicate the "treasure chest" they believed had more dots ("gold coins") hovering over it. Once participants made a choice a rectangular white border briefly showed up around the chosen coins. This was followed by an ITI, which displayed a centered white fixation cross on a black background for 500 ms before the next stimulus.</p><p>The gold coins were filled bright yellow circles hovering mid-screen above an image of a treasure chest. The screen background was black and the treasure chest was brown. The number of coins in each trial was drawn from a distribution with a mean of 24 and standard deviation of 5. No two chests had the same amount of coins and coins did not touch or overlap. Half of the trials controlled for surface area, while the other half of the trials controlled for coin radius. In the trials that controlled for radius, the coins for both chests remained at a fixed size of 10 points and the number of coins was drawn from the distribution described above. In the trials that controlled for surface area, one chest (left or right) was randomly selected and displayed coins sized as the radii-controlled stimulus. The other chest had coins with either a larger or smaller radius such that the surface area for both chests was the same. The radii-controlled and surface-controlled trials were randomly shuffled within the task blocks.</p><p>First, participants completed a practice block, 16 trials long prior to two experimental blocks, each 80 trials long. During the practice trial, participants received feedback -a green "correct", red "incorrect", or grey "invalid response" screens that appeared for 500ms after their choice. Participants were made aware that they must answer within 1000ms or they receive an "invalid response" error. To move on to the experimental blocks from the practice block, participants had to have an error rate below 60%. If participants had an error rate above 60%, consistently chose only the right side or only the left side, or did not answer any of the trials, they were sent back to the instruction block. This could occur up to three times to ensure participants understand the task. Feedback was not given during the experimental blocks.</p></div>

The original model of Guitart-Masip et al. included only a single "effective size" parameter ρ, and neutral outcomes were modeled as r t = 0. This reflects the assumption that neutral outcomes do not reinforce behavior, but simply allow the estimated values of V t (s t ) or Q t (a t , s t ) to decay back to 0. Here, we modified this model in a simple but important way, by introducing an additional parameter of effective size for neutral outcomes. We further modeled neutral outcomes not as 0, but as ±1 based on their context: −1 in reward conditions and +1 in punishment conditions.

The estimated participants' behavior based on the computational phenotype derived from the dynamic model and the actual behavior is presented in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S8</ref>.</p><p>5 Intraclass correlations values computed based on all participants <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> in the main text shows the ICC values across the phenotype. Since ICC cannot be calculated in the presence of missing data, there we used only participants that had no missing sessions. An alternative is to use data from all participants, but include only the maximal number of sessions in each task, for which all participants have data. <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S1</ref> shows the stability of the computational phenotype using this alternative calculation. The results are qualitatively similar to those presented in the main text.</p><p>6 The implications of using a fully hierarchical model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> in the main text shows the ICC values based on the independent hierarchical model we used to fit the data in the main text. This model includes two levels of hierarchy, where participant-specific priors are sampled from a population-level distribution, and session-specific phenotype parameters are sampled around the participant-specific prior. To test whether accounting for the hierarchical strucutre of the data promotes phenotype stability, we repeated the analysis with the reduced statistical model. In this model, all sessions across all participants are considered as independent, such that the phenotype parameters are sampled around a population-level value (as opposed to the indepndent model, where the phenotype parameters are sampled from session-specific and participant-specific distributions). Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S4</ref> shows the ICC values for the reduced model. Compared with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> in the main text, it is clear that the ICC values are much lower for all phenotype parameters estimated using the reduced model. This result is in line with previous work that found higher test-retest reliability with hierarchical model fitting, compared with methods like maximum likelihood estimation <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref>.</p><p>The advantage of using a fully hierarchical model for parameter estimation is even more striking in the case of simulated data. As described in the main text, when calculating an upper bound for the ICC values, we simulated data based on a known phenotype, which was fixed in time. An ideal parameter estimation method would yield ICC values of 1 for all parameters, since the ground truth phenotype is fixed in time. By pooling information across participants and sessions, the hierarchical model yielded highly stable parameter estimates, resulting in ICC values very close to 1 (red vertical lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> in the main text). In contrast, using the same simulated dataset as input, the reduced model yielded much lower ICC values. Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S3</ref> is identical to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> in the main text, but includes also the estimated upper bounds of ICC based on the reduced model (marked with triangles).</p><p>For completeness, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Supplementary Figure S2</ref> we provide a visualization of the variance components used to calculate the ICC: between-participant variance, between-session variance and error variance. The results for the independent model are shown on the left and the results for the reduced model are shown on the right. The reduced model doesn't account for the full hierarchical structure of the data (all phenotype parameters were sampled from a population-level distribution, as opposed to a session level nested within a participant level). Notably, in this calculation the error variance is generally much larger than the between-session variance. This is true even for phenotype parameters for which the analysis in the main text identified a greater contribution of (between-session) practice effects compared with noise, such as the effective size of neutral outcomes (ρ neut ) in the Go/No-Go task. This highlights a limitation in the interpretation of betweensession variance in the ICC calculation: This source of variance only accounts for systematic changes between sessions across participants <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref>. In other words, if practice effects are participant-specific, they will be absorbed into the error variance. The same is true for effects of participant-specific affect. By explicitly modeling different sources of variance, the approach we present in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> in the main text allowed us to more properly depict the relative contribution of known sources (practice and affect) and unknown sources (noise) to the phenotype dynamics.</p></div>

In the Go/No-Go task, we excluded participants defined as "non-learners", namely participants who had an average accuracy of less than 0.55 throughout the study, which resulted in excluding 24 participants (for comparison, <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> found a similar fraction of "non-learners", 11 out of 30 participants). Here we provide an analysis of these participants. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures S12, S13</ref>, and S14 show the average task performance in "non-learners", their posterior predictive checks, and the phenotype dynamics, respectively (compare with "learners" shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3  and 4</ref> in the main text). It is clear from Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S13</ref> that these participants fail to respond correctly to the two anti-Pavlovian conditions, "No-Go to win" and "Go to avoid punishment". This clear difference in behavior justifies the separate analysis of these two participant groups (as was done in <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>).</p><p>In the Lottery ticket task, we excluded participants who consistently chose one of the options (either "Safe" or "Risky" ticket) in over 80% of the trials (these were all participants who chose the "Safe" option).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12">Go/No-Go: The consequences of model misspecification</head><p>As explained in the main text, the original Pavlovian RL model of Guitart-Masip et al. <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> did not capture participants' behavior in our dataset, particularly their responses in the punishment conditions (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S9</ref>; importantly, previously suggsted modifications to the model, including separate learning rates or effective outcome size for reward/punishment also failed in fitting this data). Here, we highlight the consequences of fitting this misspecified model in terms of the phenotype dynamics.</p><p>Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S11</ref> shows that using the original model of <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, we found a certainly existing effect of practice (pd=100) for the learning rate and the Pavlovian bias. This is in contrast to the modified model we propose, for which we did not find these effects, and instead found a prominent practice effect for the new parameter we introduced, the effective size of neutral outcomes. This demonstrates the consequences of model misspecification: Failure to include this additional parameter results in a misinterpretation of the underlying cognitive process. The variability that can be best explained by the missing parameter is now attributed to changes in the learning rate. While these changes allow the model to fit the first few trials in the punishment conditions (likely when participants get punished for making the wrong choice), they fail to capture their gradual improvement over the course of the session. This serves as a compelling example of the effects of model misspecification. Fortunately, in this case, the model misfit was clearly evident in the posterior predictive checks, signaling the need for the modification we made to the model. Interestingly, both models perform similarly in fitting the first session (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S10)</ref>. However, as participants gained practice in later sessions, our modified model demonstrates an advantage in explaining the data. This is clearly depicted in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S10</ref>, where the two models exhibit similar loglikelihoods for the first session, but a substantially better log-likelihood for the modified model in subsequent sessions.</p><p>13 Intertemporal Choice: The effects of the computational model on parameter stability</p><p>In the main text, we modeled the data from the Intertemporal choice task using a hyperbolic discount function with a stochastic softmax choice rule. <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S18</ref> shows that this computational model (used in both the independent and reduced models) yields higher ICC values (median 0.93) compared with the original hyperbolic discount model proposed by <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, which does not allow for choice stochasticity (median ICC 0.68). In part, this can be attributed to the statistical model that is used for parameter estimation. As discussed in the main text, accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data promotes higher parameter stability. In line with this notion, the independent model yields the highest ICC values, followed by the reduced model that ignores that participant-level structure (reduced model median ICC 0.81). The lowest ICC values are obtained for the original hyperbolic discount model (median 0.68), for which the discount rate was estimated independently for each session without the softmax choice rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practice effects persist after the first session</head><p>A potential concern regarding the practice effects we observed in our study is that they result from insufficient practice prior to the first session, such that participants become sufficiently familiar with the task only after completing the first session. However, the gradual increase in accuracy and in many of the computational parameters suggests that the practice effects we observed do persist over multiple sessions. To provide further support for this claim, we repeated the fitting of the dynamic hierarchical model to all tasks, this time excluding the first session. The probability of direction (pd) of the practice effects remained similar across the computational phenotype, with the exception of two parameters: in the Go/No-Go task, both the lapse rate ξ and the learning rate , which previously showed no clear practice effects, now showed negative practice effects (pd=97 and pd=100, respectively).</p></div>
