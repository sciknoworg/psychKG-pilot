			<abstract>
				<p>Growing evidence for moment-to-moment fluctuations in visual attention has led to questions about the impetus and time course of cognitive control. These questions are typically investigated with paradigms like the flanker task, which require participants to inhibit an automatic response before making a decision. Connectionist modeling work suggests that between-trial changes in attention result from fluctuations in conflict-as conflict occurs, attention needs to be upregulated in order to resolve it. Current sequential sampling models (SSMs) of within-trial effects, however, suggest that attention focuses on a goal-relevant target as a function of time. We propose that within-trial changes in cognitive control and attention are emergent properties of the dynamics of the decision itself. We tested our hypothesis by developing a set of SSMs, each making alternative assumptions about attention modulation and evidence accumulation mechanisms. Combining the SSM framework with likelihood-free Bayesian approximation methods allowed us to conduct quantified comparisons between subjectlevel fits. Models included either time-or control-based attention mechanisms, and either strongly-(via feedforward inhibition) or weakly-correlated (via leak and lateral inhibition) evidence accumulation mechanisms. We fit all models to behavioral data collected in variants of the flanker task, one accompanied by EEG measures. Across three experiments, we found converging evidence that control-based attention processes in combination with evidence accumulation mechanisms governed by leak and lateral inhibition provided the best fits to behavioral data, and uniquely mapped onto observed decision-related signals in the brain.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>To achieve our goals and navigate a world that is teeming with distractions, humans rely on cognitive control to manipulate limited processing resources in a goal-directed manner. While it is known that cognitive control fluctuates as we complete the tasks of the day and upregulates attention as we encounter competing sources of information, the mechanisms and time courses of these processes remain a topic of active research. In addition to work showing post-feedback modulation of attention via cognitive control to improve future performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blais, Robidoux, Risko, &amp; Besner, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Botvinick, Cohen, &amp; Carter, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Verguts &amp; Notebaert, 2008)</ref>, there is growing evidence that cognitive control acts at faster time scales as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Braver, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Goschke automaticity (Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>. Notably, all three of the existing flanker SSMs describe decision and attentional processes that are calculated as a function of time. As such, these models assume cognitive control processes engage based only on the stimulus at hand and the amount of time spent on a trial. This contrasts with the connectionist models, which assume cognitive control is based on layered inputs from continuously-interacting populations of neurons.</p><p>In the current article, we introduce an SSM of the flanker task in which cognitive control and attention are emergent properties of the dynamics of the decision itself. Three core concepts from decades of research on cognitive control are foundational to this work: 1) conflict arises from the mutual activation of multiple choice options, 2) cognitive control is deployed as a direct response to the presence of conflict, and 3) cognitive control biases visual attention toward goal-relevant information. We begin with a standard two-accumulator SSM framework, in which noisy evidence for each possible response accumulates through time until a decision boundary is reached. In our model, a measure of cognitive control is continuously calculated within-trial based on the total amount of evidence across responses. The area of the visually attended region is in turn calculated from the cognitive control output, narrowing onto the target as cognitive control increases or widening as the need for control relaxes away. As in the shrinking spotlight (SSP) model introduced by White, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Ratcliff, and Starns (2011)</ref>, the evidence for each response is calculated from the amount of attention allocated to target and distractors, respectively. The proposed model is a closed-loop system, in which cognitive functions are a passive byproduct of interacting processes within the broader decision and action. This framework presents a parsimonious alternative to modularized conflict monitoring and cognitive control in the connectionist models, and also serves as a biologically plausible alternative to the strictly timebased processes in the SSMs.</p><p>The idea of cognitive control as an emergent property of activation dynamics has been suggested previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Mayr &amp; Awh, 2009</ref>; e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Ward &amp; Ward, 2006)</ref> and has been implemented in a connectionist model of the flanker task <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Scherbaum et al., 2012)</ref>. The current work stands apart, however, in a number of ways. First, our novel implementation of dynamic processing in an SSM framework allows us to focus on within-rather than between-trial mechanisms. Second, the SSM framework in combination with Bayesian-inspired analysis techniques gives us the power to go beyond generating data that only matches summary statistics, and to fit our model to full distributions choice-RT data at the individual-subject level. This allows us to assess our model's ability to capture the nuanced differences in performance from subject to subject. Third, we fit multiple model variants representing alternative mechanistic hypotheses to the same sets of observed data, and provide a quantified comparison of goodness-of-fit statistics. Given that nearly all published models are able to match observed data in some capacity, the ability to directly compare fit quality based on full distributions of data is critical for model falsifiability.</p><p>We did not simply want to determine if a within-trial mechanism for cognitive control could generally capture the data, but rather wanted to identify which specific patterns of subject-level data were better fit by our model compared to a time-based alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Evidence accumulation processes</head><p>We developed models with an attentional system driven by cognitive control as previously described, and compared them to models with an attentional system driven by time as in the SSP developed by <ref type="bibr">White and colleagues (2011)</ref>. Given that our mechanism of interest critically depends on the evidence for two-choice alternatives, defining the nature of competition between accumulators was a matter of importance. There is considerable discrepancy on this point when comparing the relevant connectionist models to the flanker SSMs. In connectionist models, units representing separate groups of neurons are organized into layers, which in turn correspond to different elements of a trial such as perception, attention, and decision. Units connect to one another in a weighted fashion, passing excitatory or inhibitory inputs from layer to layer. Though units critically affect each other, they typically maintain some level of independence due to random noise, nonlinear activation functions, probabilistic firing, and passive decay of activity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Liu, Holmes, &amp; Cohen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McClelland &amp; Cleeremans, 2009)</ref>. As such, activation of both "left" and "right" decision units in a flanker task may occur simultaneously. The existing flanker SSMs, however, consider evidence for the two responses to be perfectly anticorrelated, and only evidence for the "left" or the "right" can be above zero at any given time. To compare these assumptions, the models in our investigation included evidence accumulation mechanisms that were either strongly-correlated as in the original flanker SSMs, or were weakly-correlated and governed by leak and lateral inhibition mechanisms to approximate elements of the connectionist framework. Specifically, model variants incorporated calculations from two well-studied SSMs:</p><p>the feedforward inhibition (FFI) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Shadlen &amp; Newsome, 2001</ref>) and the leaky-competing accumulator (LCA) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Summary and outline</head><p>In our main comparison, each model contains a combination of mechanisms from two different categories: drive to attentional processes (time-based vs. control-based attentional processing),</p><p>MODELING  and competition between accumulators (strongly-vs. weakly-correlated). These alternative mechanisms are illustrated as a flowchart in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. As in the SSP, visual attention is conceptualized as a target-centered density function for a Gaussian distribution. The standard deviation of the attentional spotlight changes throughout a trial, either as a function of time itself or an internal calculation of cognitive control. Drift rates for the two accumulators in the decision process are determined by the area under the attentional spotlight allocated to the target and flankers, respectively. Evidence for each response is calculated within either the FFI or the LCA framework, such that the accumulators are strongly-or weakly-correlated with one another as they stochastically race toward a decision boundary. In the control-based models, cognitive control is represented as the cumulative distance between the total evidence and a threshold, .</p><p>Because the conflict models were designed as a closed-loop system, this measure of cognitive control feeds back into the calculation of the attentional spotlight standard deviation at the next moment in time.</p><p>MODELING WITHIN-TRIAL CONFLICT 11 within either an FFI or LCA framework (Panel 4). For control-based models, cognitive control as calculated as the cumulative distance between total evidence and a threshold <ref type="bibr">(Panel 5)</ref>. This measure is in turn used to calculate the standard deviation of the attentional spotlight in the control-based models, whereas the spotlight shrinks at a constant rate in the time-based models.</p><p>We fit all models to data collected in three experiments. Experiment 1 was a standard flanker task with arrow stimuli, in which participants indicated whether a central target was pointing 'left' or 'right'. We were interested in observing how models with dynamic mechanisms for cognitive control would compare to those with time-based mechanisms in the standard paradigm,</p><p>given that the time-based flanker SSMs have been shown to capture general congruency and conditional accuracy effects in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(White et al., 2011)</ref>. In Experiment 2, which was designed and administered by <ref type="bibr">Servant and colleagues (2014)</ref>, participants were asked to indicate whether a target circle was red or blue while ignoring congruent (same-color) or incongruent (different-color) distractor circles. Importantly, targets varied in color saturation across six different conditions while the color saturation of the flankers was held constant. Here, the models with strongly-correlated accumulation mechanisms would predict equal and opposite evidence for the 'red' and 'blue' responses across saturation conditions. Models with weakly-correlated accumulation mechanisms governed by leak and lateral inhibition, however, would predict variations in evidence for each response that correspond to the perceptual strength of the relevant stimulus. In Experiment 3, EEG data were collected as participants completed a standard flanker task. With its high temporal resolution, EEG methods provided insight into the decision process during a standard flanker task that we could not get from behavior alone. Using latent input joint modeling analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mack, Preston, &amp; Love, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Palestro, Sederberg, Osth, Van Zandt, &amp; Turner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Turner, Forstmann, Love, Palmeri, &amp; Van Maanen, 2017)</ref>, we determined the correlation between each model's calculations of attentional drive and observed neural activity at the level of each individual trial. Across these three experiments, we found converging evidence that control-based attention processes in combination with evidence accumulation mechanisms governed by leak and lateral inhibition provided the best fits to behavioral data and uniquely mapped onto observed decision-related signals in the brain.</p><p>Our goal was to investigate the possibility of cognitive control as an emergent property of decision dynamics, within a framework that was amenable to data-fitting and quantifiable comparisons. Starting with an existing SSM that was designed to capture the behavioral effects of perceptual conflict, we developed, fit, and compared new model variants that represent competing hypotheses on the nature of within-trial decision processes. We were specifically interested in exploring two attributes of the decision-making process: competition between accumulators, and the driving force underlying attention. Through model comparison and modelbased EEG analyses, we investigated how competition between choice alternatives dynamically affects decision processes that manifest in the brain. We have organized the current article as follows. First, we will provide an overview of the existing SSMs of behavior under conditions of perceptual conflict. Second, we will discuss the details of the models we developed to investigate the within-trial dynamics of the decision process in the flanker task, and the theoretical predictions of each. Third, we present the methods and results of the three experiments that served as a testbed for our model investigation, as well as the details of our model-fitting procedures. Lastly, we provide an interpretation of our results and a discussion of our findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model development</head><p>Two existing SSMs of the flanker task were central to our investigation: the shrinking spotlight model of <ref type="bibr">White and colleagues (2011)</ref> and the dual-stage, two-process model of <ref type="bibr">Hübner and colleagues (2010)</ref>. Given our specific interest in within-trial mechanisms of attention, we selected these models due to their intended fidelity to findings from the attention literature. Both models were designed as variants of the diffusion decision model (DDM), in which a single accumulator accrues evidence through time toward one of two response boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Laming, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ratcliff, 1978)</ref>. The single-accumulator structure is meant to represent the difference in firing between populations of neurons tuned to each choice (P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2004)</ref>. While the standard DDM assumes evidence accumulation proceeds at a constant drift rate through time, the SSP and DSTP include alternate implementations of a time-varying drift rate in order to capture conditional accuracy effects in the flanker task.</p><p>The SSP follows the zoom lens metaphor of attention, in which attention is represented by a gradient of strength about a central focal point that can expand and contract alongside the area of the visual field. Retinotopic mapping studies in fMRI have provided evidence that visual attention is indeed oriented around a central fixation point in a graded fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brefczynski &amp; DeYoe, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tootell et al., 1998)</ref> and that attention-related neural activity negatively scales with the size of the attended region in a zoom lens-like manner (N. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Müller, Bartelt, Donner, Villringer, &amp; Brandt, 2003)</ref>. This work contributed to the idea that attentional resources are finite, and that top-down selective processing is necessary for preferentially allocating attention to behaviorally-relevant stimuli and events <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Mesulam, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mesulam, , 1999</ref>. In the SSP, the spotlight concept is implemented as a density function for a Gaussian distribution that is centered on the target, and each item (e.g. arrow) in the stimulus occupies one unit of perceptual space. The standard deviation of the spotlight shrinks as a function of time, and drift rate is calculated at each time step based on the area under the curve allocated to each item. Though attempts to fit the SSP to data from tasks other than the flanker task have yielded mixed results <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Servant et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>, the model is still able to capture a wide range of behaviors across task conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(White et al., 2011)</ref> and includes recoverable parameters governing the time-varying drift rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(White, Servant, &amp; Logan, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The DSTP, in contrast, builds off of the dual-process hypothesis, which proposes that two processing routes take effect when a stimulus appears: a direct, automatic route dominated by the perceptual qualities of the stimuli, and a slower, effortfully-controlled route that depends on the goal at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(De Jong et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kornblum, Hasbroucq, &amp; Osman, 1990)</ref>. As illustrated by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, the DSTP specifies two discrete stages of visual processing: 1) an early stage for identifying simple stimulus features and perceptual filtering, and 2) a late stage dedicated to processing the target. The early stage is divided into two racing diffusion processes: a stimulus selection phase and a response selection phase. Boundaries in each phase represent target and flanker stimuli, respectively. If the response selection phase terminates first, a response corresponding to the crossed boundary is made immediately, based only on the perceptual features of the stimulus. If the stimulus selection phase terminates first, the model transitions into the late, target-processing stage (stage 2). In Stage 2, the drift rate of the response selection phase shifts to reflect the outcome of the stimulus selection phase. The starting value of Stage 2 equals the value of the response selection process at the time that the stimulus selection process crossed a boundary. The direction of the drift rate in Stage 2 reflects the choice outcome of the stimulus selection phase. While this model can capture behavioral data patterns on a flanker task under various conditions and has gained support from electromyography data <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Servant, White, Montagnini, &amp; Burle, 2015)</ref>, a recent parameter recovery study indicated that the drift rate parameters could not be reliably recovered from simulated data <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(White et al., 2018)</ref>. We selected the SSP as the basis of our model investigation, systematically modifying the original model to incorporate an attentional spotlight driven by cognitive control as well as strongly-and weakly-correlated evidence accumulation mechanisms. The continuous, singleprocess format of the SSP was amenable to these modifications, whereas the multi-step architecture of the DSTP imposes constraints on when perceptual conflict can occur during a decision. Within our comparison of model mechanisms, our goal was to test the theory that cognitive control and related modulation of attention are emergent properties of the dynamics of the decision process. Our hypothesis, as implemented in the SSP framework, assumes that these dynamic processes interact and update continuously throughout a trial. While the cognitive control processes in the DSTP are generally time-based because the stimulus selection phase is a diffusion process with a constant drift rate, one could argue that attention in the DSTP depends on decision dynamics in addition to time alone. Specifically, the switch-point in the Stage 2 response selection drift rate is determined by the outcome of Stage 1 processes, rather than occurring at a predetermined time point. We therefore fit the DSTP to the behavioral data across our three experiments in addition to our SSP variants as a point of comparison, given that the DSTP offers an alternative account of the decision-based attention processes of interest.</p><p>Equations and details of our implementation of the DSTP can be found in the supplementary materials. In the following sections, we provide the details of mechanisms we implemented within the SSP framework as part of our main investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Competition between accumulators</head><p>While the original SSP was implemented within a diffusion model framework, we adapted the shrinking spotlight mechanism within a single-boundary, dual-accumulator framework. These two classes of models make subtly different assumptions about which neural processes are represented by evidence accumulation. In the diffusion models, evidence represents the cumulative difference in firing across populations of neurons corresponding to each of two choice options. A response is made when this difference is sufficiently large, and a boundary representing one of the two choices is crossed. In contrast, evidence in the accumulator models reflects direct competition between the two most active populations of neurons during a decision.</p><p>Here, a response is made when one population of neurons reaches a predetermined firing rate threshold. Models from these two classes have been fit to data and compared extensively over the past several years, with the general consensus being that different classes of models are appropriate for different kinds of decisions (P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2004)</ref>. In our project, we were interested in testing which set of assumptions is appropriate for decisions involving perceptual conflict: are decisions in the flanker task based on the difference in neural representations of targets and distractors, or the active competition between them?</p><p>Evidence accumulation in our models was mathematically defined using either LCA or FFI mechanisms. LCA is a well-known example of the accumulator class of models, and was designed to reflect observed biological mechanisms in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbot, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amit, Brunel, &amp; Tsodyks, 1994)</ref>. Each accumulator in the LCA model passively leaks evidence through time, and is inhibited based on the strength of the other accumulators. The FFI model, in contrast, features two accumulators with crossed inputs and no leak. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Turner et al. (2016)</ref>, we constrained the FFI model so that evidence accumulation for each choice was anticorrelated with that of the other. This implementation was meant to mimic the single-accumulator diffusion model framework, in which a movement toward one decision boundary necessitated a movement away from the other. Similarly for the constrained FFI model, one accumulator moving toward the decision boundary requires the other to move toward zero. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> provides illustrations of how evidence accumulation for two choice options occurs in the FFI and LCA models. Because evidence in the constrained FFI model is anticorrelated, the path of the decision process diffuses along a single plane and the total evidence can only increase if one accumulator reaches zero, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, Panel C. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, Panel F shows that the decision path in the LCA model is not isolated to a diagonal plane due to the independence of the accumulators. </p></div>

In line with the conventions of accumulator models, evidence for each accumulator c was bound at zero so that neither accumulator could ever be negative. Evidence for each alternative accumulates through time until decision threshold is reached, and a response is selected in favor of the winning accumulator.

Although different approaches could have been taken, accumulator starting points were set in relation to the decision threshold such that for {1,2}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Drive to attention mechanisms</head><p>Our core mechanistic hypothesis is that attention is directly modulated within-trial as an emergent property of decision-making dynamics. This hypothesis is based on evidence of withintrial changes in attention and cognitive control from neuroimaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Czernochowski, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Nigbur et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Scherbaum et al., 2011)</ref> and connectionist models in which cognitive control is dynamically mobilized in response to the mutual activation of multiple response nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(De Pisapia &amp; Braver, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Frank, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Scherbaum et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Verguts, 2017)</ref>. Our proposed control-driven attention mechanism stands in contrast to existing SSMs of decision processes Our selection of the cognitive control function was based on three factors. 1) Cognitive control is recruited in response to the presence of conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Botvinick et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Larson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001)</ref>, which is defined as the mutual activation of multiple choice options <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Botvinick et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Botvinick et al., , 1999</ref>. Our implementation of the SSP within a dual-accumulator model framework allows us to track evidence for both response options throughout a trial, and we opted to base our calculation of cognitive control on the total amount of evidence in the system. 2)</p><p>Braver's dual mechanisms of control framework (2012) suggests that when conflict exceeds the available resource of cognitive control, cognitive control is upregulated within-trial until conflict can be successfully resolved. When conflict is resolved, cognitive control is allowed to decrease.</p><p>The active level of cognitive control, then, is continuously compared to a required level of control, and is updated accordingly throughout a trial. We implemented this idea into our models by calculating cognitive control as an evidence-based signal relative to a threshold, where the threshold represents a predetermined level for optimal conflict resolution. 3) Given that more conflict occurs on incongruent compared to congruent trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Botvinick et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gratton et al., 1992)</ref>, cognitive control should reach a higher peak on incongruent compared to congruent trials. Combining all of these factors, we developed a measure of cognitive control that is based on the dynamics of the evidence accumulation process, generally builds through time, is able to relax toward the end of a trial as conflict is resolved, and naturally demonstrates differences between task conditions. Average simulations of within-trial cognitive control signals for each task condition are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, alongside time signals for contrast. Because our calculation of cognitive control is based on the sum of evidence at each time step, the mode of evidence accumulation (FFI vs. LCA) has notable effects on the moment-to-moment changes in cognitive control, and subsequently, the behavior of the spotlight. The accumulators in the FFI model are strongly correlated and trade off as shown by the phase plane plots in developed FFI and LCA model variants in which the spotlight is driven by time with additional within-trial variability. As described in Section 2.2.3, the standard deviation of the noise distribution was added as a free parameter, so that variability in the spotlight calculation could be added as needed to optimally fit the data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows calculations of attentional spotlight widths through time, generated from the FFI-conflict and LCA-conflict models as well as timeand time+noise-based models. In the following sections, we will provide the mathematical details of each type of attentional spotlight mechanism that we explored in the current project. each simulation displayed as a gray line to demonstrate the between-trial variability captured by each model.

Data from three experiments served as the testbed for the seven model variants. The first experiment was a standard flanker task, which was intended to test each model's ability to capture basic behavioral effects between conditions. The second experiment included a manipulation in which the perceptual strength of the target relative to the flanker items varied from trial to trial. These data were fit by adding free parameters to modify perceptual input strength (p) depending on the perceptual strength of each item in the stimulus array. The third experiment was a standard flanker task during which we also recorded scalp EEG measurements.</p><p>The models were fit to behavior alone for all experiments, and simulation methods were used in our analysis of data collected in Experiment 3 to observe which models most successfully mapped onto within-trial EEG voltage at each electrode.</p></div>

Participants completed a standard flanker experiment, in which they indicated the direction of a central arrow while ignoring congruent, incongruent, or neutral distractor items. Although we only fit the models to data from congruent and incongruent trials, we hoped that the inclusion of neutral trials would boost flanker effects via increased rarity of incongruent trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gratton et al., 1992)</ref> while maintaining equal numbers of congruent and incongruent observations.</p></div>

Participants responded by pressing the 'J' key on the keyboard if the arrow in the center of the array pointed left, and the 'K' key if the center arrow pointed right. Participants were asked to respond with their right forefinger and right middle finger respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.1">Behavior</head><p>Responses shorter than 150 ms or longer than 2000 ms were excluded from analyses and modelfitting (&lt;4% of trials across subjects). Neutral trials were excluded from analyses due to an unforeseen pop-out effect in our data, such that participants were slightly faster at responding to neutral stimuli compared to congruent. As such, only congruent and incongruent trials were analyzed further. A summary of behavioral results is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. Behavioral results were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests, where the degrees of freedom for within-condition performance comparisons were based on the number of subjects who made at least one error in the condition of interest. We observed the expected flanker task effects, including significantly lower accuracy on incongruent trials compared to congruent (t(25)=-2.919, p&lt;0.01) and significantly slower RTs for incongruent trials compared to congruent (t(25)=7.520, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Our data also demonstrated significantly faster errors than correct responses in the incongruent condition (t(22)=-3.778, p&lt;0.01), but not in the congruent condition (t(9)=0.910, p=0.386).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref>. Out of 26 total participants in Experiment 1, the LCA control model was the best performing model for 8 participants, the FFI control model was the best performing model for 5 participants, the LCA time model was the best performing model for 2 participants, the DSTP model was the best performing model for 7 participants, and the FFI time model was the best performing model for  interest. All four models were able to capture typical flanker effects of slower, less accurate responses in the incongruent compared to the congruent condition, and faster errors than correct responses in the incongruent condition. Given that the SSP was specifically designed to capture robust congruency and conditional accuracy effects, it is unsurprising that all models were able to fit the standard pattern of data. Though the control-driven models were better suited for capturing the peaks of the correct response distributions than the time-driven models, acrosssubject results reflect strong model mimicry. To gain more insight into the differences in predictions among the models, we need to delve into the more nuanced patterns of behavior that were not necessarily robust across all subjects. We provide analyses using two measures of response capture: error location indices (ELIs) and conditional accuracy functions (CAFs). An ELI value represents the proportion of incorrect responses that are faster than trials chosen at random <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Servant, Gajdos, &amp; Davranche, 2018)</ref>. For example, a participant who performed less accurately when they made fast responses would likely have a high (close to 1.0) ELI, whereas a participant who performed less accurately when they made slower responses would likely have a low (close to 0.0) ELI. The SSP was developed to capture the general effect of fast errors specific to the incongruent condition of the flanker task, which manifests as higher ELI values in the incongruent compared to the congruent condition. While all four of the main models in the current investigation can capture this basic effect, we observed differences among the models in terms of their abilities to predict individual differences in ELIs in the incongruent condition. After fitting each model to data from each subject, we used best-fitting parameters to generate predicted ELI values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref> shows correlations between observed and predicted ELI values in the incongruent condition for each model. Per the requirements of the calculation, participants were only included if they made at least one error in the incongruent task condition (23 participants). These results suggest that the LCA control model is best able to capture the nuanced subject-level differences that we observed in our dataset. To assess significance, we applied a Fisher's z transformation to each r correlation and calculated an observed z test statistic at an alpha level of 0.05 for each pairwise combination of models. The observed vs. predicted ELI correlation for the FFI control model was significantly lower than that of the LCA control (z=2.284, p=0.011) and LCA time models  While ELIs were developed as a quantitatively interpretable alternative to CAFs, CAFs remain a common tool for illustrating behavioral effects in the flanker task. In the CAF, performance is plotted as a function of RT. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 9</ref> shows average CAFs across subjects calculated from observed data in the incongruent condition, overlaid by average predicted incongruent CAFs generated from each subject's best-fitting parameters for each model. As mentioned previously, all four models can capture fast errors in the incongruent condition, which is illustrated by lower accuracy in the initial RT bins. The models differ, however, in their abilities to capture slow errors. Neither the LCA time nor the FFI time model appropriately captures the dropoff in accuracy for longer RTs. The control models, however, are able to predict a decrease in cognitive control toward the end of a trial, which allows the models to capture patterns of accuracy that reach a peak before slightly decreasing. This is due to the nature of our conflict signal as illustrated by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1 and 4</ref>, which allows for the widening of the attentional spotlight toward the end of a trial depending on the parameter values. The FFI control model, however, appears to overpredict the proportion of slow errors due the combination of the control mechanism and the strong correlation between accumulators, resulting in the lowest correlation between observed and predicted ELI values across the models as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref>. ELIs for the congruent condition were useful for distinguishing these models as well. Similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows ELI values calculated from observed data in the congruent condition in relation to the predicted ELI values generated from best-fitting parameters in each model. Per the requirements of the calculation, participants were only included if they made at least one error in the congruent task condition (10 participants). Predictions using the LCA control model best mapped onto subject-level ELIs in the congruent condition compared to the other models.</p><p>The observed vs. predicted ELI correlation for the LCA control model was significantly higher than that of the FFI time (z=3.088, p=0.001) and FFI control models (z=1.871, p=0.031), and the correlation for the LCA time model was significantly higher than that of the FFI time model as well (z=1.822, p=0.034). No other comparisons were significant (LCA control vs. LCA time:</p><p>z=1.266, p=0.103; LCA time vs. FFI control: z=0.606, p=0.272; FFI control vs. FFI time:</p><p>z=1.217, p=0.112). To observe specific differences in model predictions within the congruent condition, mean CAFs were generated separately for participants with low (0.11-0.31) and high (0.74-1.00) observed</p><p>ELIs as determined by median split. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows observed and model-predicted CAFs for low-ELI participants in the congruent condition, in which the observed data demonstrates a higher proportion of errors for longer compared to shorter RTs. While all models miss the mean performance values considerably, the LCA control, LCA time, and FFI control models are able to capture a general pattern of slow errors in the congruent condition. Though the LCA time model lacks the ability to relax attentional processing like the control models, it is presumably able to capture these slow errors via the leak parameter. The FFI time model, however, has no mechanism for capturing slow errors in the congruent condition.  While the cognitive control-driven attentional system allows the FFI control model to predict fast errors, these processes in combination with a strongly-correlated accumulator structure result in an overprediction of slow errors. The LCA control model, however, is able to predict fast errors without inappropriately predicting slow errors as well. were sorted according to RT within 6 equally-spaced percentile bins. Performance and minimum RT for each bin were averaged across participants (blue Xs). After generating 1,000 choice-RT pairs from each subject's best-fitting parameters within each model, the same procedure was used to calculate CAFs for each model (gray lines).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Discussion</head><p>The results of Experiment 1 demonstrate strong mimicry between models, but showed overall better fits for models with control-driven attentional mechanisms compared to time-driven alternatives as determined by our BPIC comparison. In interpreting the BPIC results, it is important to remember that these calculations favor less complex models. With 8 free parameters, it is therefore notable that the LCA control model outperformed the more parsimonious alternatives in a substantial number of cases. For the 4 instances in which the more parsimonious FFI time model was the winning model, it appears that the improvements in fit afforded by the more flexible models were not substantial enough to justify the additional complexity. The most complex model was the DSTP with 9 free parameters, and its flexibility resulted in 7 wins. For a majority of subjects, however, the added complexity did not improve the fits over what the other models could provide, and the model barely performed better than FFI time on average. Interestingly, the conflict models provided better fits than the time+noise models in almost all cases, indicating that conflict mechanisms themselves are tapping into an aspect of the data beyond improvements resulting from additional noise. Because each model makes the standard predictions for choice-RT distributions equally well, ELI and CAF analyses allowed us to investigate the predictions of the models at a finer granularity than what choice-RT summarizations could provide. Among the FFI time, LCA time, FFI control, and LCA control models, only LCA control could predict patterns of fast and slow errors in each condition that varied by subject. Although Experiment 1 has provided tentative evidence that cognitive control, rather than time alone, underlies attention processes in the flanker task, the data as a whole did not provide a strong dissociation between FFI and LCA mechanisms for interactions between the accumulators when considering general effects across subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Experiment 2</head><p>Because the results of Experiment 1 did not favor strongly-correlated FFI or weakly-correlated LCA evidence accumulation mechanisms, we next fit the models to data from a task that we believed would challenge these alternative hypotheses. In the standard flanker task, the nature of the arrow stimuli results in an equal amount of perceptual strength for each item in an array, and evidence for a left response is equal and opposite to evidence for a right response. As such, it is not surprising that both FFI and LCA accumulation dynamics were able to capture the data equally well. In Experiment 2, we opted to test the models under task conditions in which the perceptual strength of the flanker items was not necessarily equal to that of the target. The task, designed and administered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Servant et al. (2014)</ref>, required participants to indicate the color of a target circle amid flanker circles of a congruent or incongruent color. As a manipulation of relative perceptual strength, the color saturation of the target circle varied from trial to trial while the saturation of flanker circles was held constant. Due to the strongly-correlated behavior of the accumulators in the FFI models, we predicted that the FFI models would be less capable of capturing the observed patterns of choices and RTs across conditions in this task relative to LCA models. Our hypothesis is in line with recent work showing that models with strongly-correlated accumulators fail to capture observed patterns of data across a range of equal-and unequalevidence task conditions <ref type="bibr">(Kirkpatrick, Turner, &amp; Sederberg, submitted)</ref>.</p></div>

Detailed behavioral results of Experiment 2 are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Servant et al. (2014)</ref>. In summary, participants were significantly slower (t(11)=6.491, p&lt;0.001) and less accurate (t(11)=-3.437, p&lt;0.01) on incongruent trials relative to congruent, across target color saturation conditions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.2">Model fits</head><p>BPIC values for each model were mean-centered within subject, and are shown as a heat map in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>. The LCA control model was the winning model in 8 out of the 12 participants, the FFI control model was the winning model for 3 participants, and the DSTP was the winning MODELING WITHIN-TRIAL CONFLICT 51 model for 1 participant. Accounting for the magnitude of the wins across subjects, the LCA control model outperformed all alternatives, including FFI control, while the FFI time and DSTP models fit the worst overall.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7</ref>, the two control-based models provided better qualitative fits to the RT distributions for correct responses, compared to the time-based models. This again reflects the ability of the control-driven models to capture the nuanced differences in behavior across subjects, specifically subject-level differences in fast and slow responses across conditions due to the nature of the control signal. More importantly, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> shows that the FFI and LCA models make drastically different predictions about the error RT distributions, particularly in the incongruent condition. While the LCA models are generally able to capture the peak and spread of the incongruent error RTs, the FFI models consistently predict a larger proportion of fast errors across target color saturation conditions than we observe in the data. This overprediction of fast errors is a natural consequence of the strongly-correlated evidence accumulation mechanism in the FFI models. The FFI models are able to predict different drift rates across saturation conditions due to differences in the perceptual input strength scaling parameters , and are therefore able to capture the general pattern of faster correct responses for high target saturation trials. Because of the strongly-correlated evidence accumulation mechanism, however, faster positive drift rates for one accumulator result in correspondingly faster negative drift rates for the other. As such, the FFI models are limited in their ability to concurrently capture observed RTs for correct and error responses across all conditions. In contrast, the flexibility of the weakly-correlated evidence accumulation mechanism in the LCA models allow the models to seamlessly adapt to conditions of unequal perceptual strength between target and flanker stimuli. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Discussion</head><p>We hypothesized that the flanker saturation manipulation in Experiment 2, in which targets and flankers differed in perceptual strength from trial to trial, would cause models with strongly-and weakly-correlated evidence accumulation mechanisms to make contrasting predictions. Because an increase evidence for one choice option results in an equivalent decrease in evidence for the other choice, the FFI models do not predict any mechanistic differences for how a participant processes stimuli across different target saturation conditions. These models, therefore, depend on the values of the perceptual input strength scalars to capture any behavioral differences between high-and low-saturation target conditions. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>, however, the FFI models were only able to approximate RTs for correct responses at the expense of the error distributions--both the FFI time and the FFI control models predicted faster error RTs in the incongruent condition. The LCA models were more successful overall compared to the FFI models at fitting the shapes of all choice-RT distributions across saturation and congruency conditions, suggesting that the flexibility afforded by a weakly-correlated evidence accumulation structure is necessary for fitting these data.</p><p>Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, models with control-based attention mechanisms provided better fits to the data compared to time-based alternatives. Despite being the most complex model in our comparison with 14 free parameters (compared to 7 in FFI time, 8 in FFI time+noise and FFI control, 9 in LCA time, and 10 in LCA time+noise and LCA control), the DSTP provided the worst quantitative fits as determined by BPIC. We included the DSTP in the current project to test our control-based attention mechanism against an alternative decisionbased mechanism. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that our control-based mechanism strikes a more effective balance between flexibility and parsimony than the DSTP.</p><p>Taken together, the results of Experiment 2 indicate that both LCA evidence accumulation mechanisms and control-driven attention mechanisms are necessary for appropriately predicting behavior under conditions of differing perceptual strength.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Experiment 3</head><p>Our main motivation for the current project was to develop a neurally-plausible mechanism for modulation of attention within-trial. Our theory, which we operationalized via our cognitive control-based models, is that modulation of attention is an emergent property of the dynamics of the decision process. While we do find evidence for cognitive control-based processes across Experiments 1 and 2 by fitting our models to behavioral data alone, we wished to determine whether our model-generated signal for cognitive control actually maps onto an observable, within-trial signal in the brain. In Experiment 3, we collected EEG data alongside the same standard flanker task administered in Experiment 1 and designed a latent input joint modeling analysis to gain insight into the within-trial processes that we could not observe from behavior alone. Based on the results of Experiments 1 and 2, we predicted that LCA mechanisms in combination with control-based attentional mechanisms would most effectively track latent EEG measures.</p></div>

The ground electrode was located at Fpz and the reference was set to the average of mastoid electrodes TP9</p><p>and TP10 during recording. Electrode impedances were reduced to less than 25K ohms via application of electrolyte gel as recommended by the equipment manufacturer. Instructions for the task appeared on the computer screen, and were read aloud by the experimenter. Participants were given the opportunity to take breaks from the task in between task blocks, but remained seated in the testing room throughout. During each trial, a fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen for 1000 ms before being removed. The trial stimulus then appeared on the screen after a jittered duration of 100-900 ms. Participants responded by pressing the 'J' key on the keyboard if the arrow in the center of the array pointed left, and the 'K' key if the center arrow pointed right. Participants were asked to respond with their right forefinger and right middle finger respectively. Only responses made 150 ms after the stimulus appeared were recorded, and the stimulus was removed from the screen immediately after the participant made a valid response. Participants were given an unlimited amount of time to respond, but were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. EEG signal was monitored by the experimenter throughout the session for abnormalities using PyCorder software (BrainProducts GmbH, Munich, Germany) on the acquisition PC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.6">Model-based EEG analysis</head><p>Given that the models in the current investigation make different predictions about the behavior of the spotlight within each trial, our goal was to determine which mechanism best mapped onto observed neural signals. As such, we used within-trial correlation analyses to assess the link between model-generated attention signal and EEG voltage at each channel. Here, the "attention signal" refers to vectors of time or cognitive control that contribute to the calculations of spotlight standard deviation throughout a trial. We first fit each model to behavioral data from each participant, and identified MAP estimates for each parameter. For each model, subject, and task condition, we generated 30,000 trials using best-fitting parameters. Each simulation generated a choice (correct or incorrect), RT, and vector of values representing drive to the attentional mechanism at each timestep during the decision process. For each observed response, we defined a selection window from to and identified the simulated responses that terminated therein for the relevant subject and task condition. Observed trials that matched fewer than 100 out of the 30,000 simulated trials in at least one model were discarded from further analyses (38.5% of trials). Despite excluding a large proportion of trials, 3,914 trials across participants were still included in our final analysis. Across simulated trials that matched a given observed trial, we calculated the mean attention signal value at each timepoint. The result was a single attention signal vector for each observed trial and model. We then identified the decision-relevant neural data on each trial. Once the EEG voltage data at each electrode was preprocessed and segmented into trial-level epochs as described in the methods, we defined a decision-relevant window on each trial in between after the stimulus appeared on the screen and prior to the response being executed, where was the best-fitting non decision time parameter value from the model at hand. The next step was to determine the relationship between model-generated attentional drive and EEG voltage at the within-trial level. For each trial, model, and electrode, we calculated the Pearson's r correlation between EEG voltage and attentional drive through time. We then performed a Fisher's Z-transform on the trial-level r values at each electrode. P-values were calculated via one-sample t-tests at the level of each electrode, where the null hypothesis was that trial-level Z values did not differ from 0.</p><p>Significance was determined via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for adjusting for multiple comparisons, which entails a rank-ordering of p-values at each electrode and a sliding significance criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995)</ref>. The result was a single EEG topography for each model, indicating the extent to which model-generated attentional drive significantly correlates with trial-level EEG activity. Because the DSTP model does not contain a continuous within-trial mechanism for attention modulation, we fit the DSTP to the behavioral data but did not include it in the EEG analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Discussion</head><p>Because we were interested in developing a neurally plausible model of the flanker task, we wanted to test whether the attention mechanisms in any of our models resembled the fluctuations of within-trial neural signals as measured by EEG. Attention mechanisms in all models were most correlated with EEG activity in right-posterior regions, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>, but only the LCA control model yielded significant correlation results. This is an interesting pattern of findings in light of previous EEG studies designed to probe the spotlight view of spatial attention, which often reported attentional correlates at posterior electrodes as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Awh, Anllo-Vento, &amp; Hillyard, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Busch &amp; VanRullen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Handy, Soltani, &amp; Mangun, 2001</ref>). These studies, however, tended to observe attention-related activity at central-posterior electrodes, and lateralized effects only occured when stimuli appeared in the edges of the visual field <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hillyard, Teder-Sälejärvi, &amp; Münte, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mangun &amp; Hillyard, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">M. Müller, Malinowski, Gruber, &amp; Hillyard, 2003)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mangun and Hillyard (1988)</ref> investigated the hypothesis that early sensory-evoked peaks would reflect a spotlight-like filtering of information. The authors identified gradual decreases in P1 and N1 amplitudes that varied as a function of distance between attended and evoking stimuli. These effects were specifically observed in posterior electrode locations, contralateral to the screen location of the attended stimuli. Because stimuli were only presented in the center of the screen in our paradigm, we believed our right-lateralized results could reflect contamination by motor effects given that participants made all responses with the right hand. Because this would result in strong motor-related activity in the left hemisphere, it potentially obfuscated the attention-related activation. It is nevertheless notable that only the LCA control model generates a within-trial attention modulation signal that significantly correlated with the gradual ramp-up and relaxation of neural amplitudes at attention-relevant locations on the scalp.</p><p>We calculated the pairwise differences maps shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 20</ref> for two purposes: 1) to cancel out the motor effects that could have affected each individual model-based EEG analysis, and 2)</p><p>to observe how each model compared to the others in terms of generating a neurally plausible attention modulation signal. Specifically for comparisons involving the LCA control model, we identified large differences in correlation means that were widespread across the scalp. This implies that the LCA control model was able to generate within-trial signals that resemble the general time course of EEG voltages better than the alternative models. While we do not make any strong claims here about the LCA control model capturing any specific neural processes, the results of Experiment 3 support the notion that the mechanisms in the LCA control model behave in a way that is in line with observed voltage time courses in the brain.</p></div>

When specifying the evidence accumulation processes in our models, we developed models with either strongly- In Experiment 1, we fit the models to data from a standard flanker task. While all models fit the data well, the two control-based models provided the best fits as determined by BPIC. Further insights from ELI and CAF analyses revealed that the LCA control model was particularly effective at capturing nuanced differences in performance between subjects, including slow errors in the incongruent condition and fast errors in the congruent condition. To hone in on the mechanistic assumptions of the FFI and LCA mechanisms, Experiment 2 featured a manipulation of target color saturation. Because the FFI models assume that an increase in evidence for one response requires a decrease in evidence for the other, we found that the FFI models overestimated the speed of error distributions across conditions. The LCA models, and particularly the LCA control model, were more flexible and therefore able to capture behavior under conditions where targets and flankers differed in perceptual strength.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Interpretation of results</head><p>In the current project, we aimed to address a gap in the literature concerning within-trial mobilization of cognitive control and modulation of attention. Several dominant theories suggest that cognitive control operates on multiple timescales to appropriately focus attention on goal-relevant information while also conserving cognitive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Braver et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">e.g. J. Brown et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davelaar, 2008)</ref>. These theories have often been operationalized within connectionist models, which feature biologically-inspired mechanisms for engaging cognitive control as a direct response to mutual activation of multiple choice units. Connectionist models, however, typically include within-trial mechanisms only en route to explaining between-trial effects, such as improved accuracy on flanker trials immediately following errors. Theories specifically designed to explain trial-level effects, such as fast errors in the incongruent flanker task condition, have instead been implemented within the SSM framework as variants of the single-accumulator DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hübner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Ulrich et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">White et al., 2011)</ref>. These Furthermore, the single-accumulator structure of the flanker SSMs make the powerful assumption that an increase in evidence for one choice results in a decrease in evidence for the other. Given the assertion that inhibitory control decisions involve two separate routes of processing, automatic and controlled, it may be overly constraining to assume that evidence accumulation between two choices is perfectly anticorrelated. weakly-correlated mechanisms in the LCA model, rather than the difference between them. Our results seem to stand in contrast to recent findings from a stop-signal study, which found that perfect negative dependence between racing accumulators predicted aspects of observed behavior better than independent accumulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Colonius &amp; Diederich, 2018)</ref>. This, perhaps, is indicative of mechanistic differences between 2-alternative choices and go-nogo choices, or indicates that accumulator dependence exists as a gradient and manifests differently from task to task as has been suggested in the past (P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2004)</ref>. Because it has been shown that the LCA model can mimic a standard DDM under conditions of balanced leak and lateral inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bogacz, Brown, Moehlis, Holmes, &amp; Cohen, 2006)</ref>, the most parsimonious assumption favors the model that is flexible enough to capture all observed patterns in the data.</p><p>We hypothesized that within-trial attentional mechanisms were based on some element of the decision process rather than the mere passage of time. As such, we defined sets of models with attention mechanisms driven by time like the original SSP, models driven by time with added variability, and models driven by cognitive control which was calculated from the accumulators at each timestep within the decision process. In Experiment 1 and even more strikingly in Experiment 2, the control models outperformed the time-based models in terms of fits to behavioral data. It is important to note that the control models consistently fit the data better than time models with added variability, indicating that control mechanisms were tapping into a signal present in the data beyond random noise. In Experiment 3, this contention was reinforced by model-based EEG findings, indicating that the LCA conflict model was the only one with a time course of visual attention mechanisms that significantly correlated with within-trial EEG voltage.</p><p>Our findings provide a model-based, mechanistic complement to recent neuroimaging work that has investigated attention processes within-trial. One study recorded EEG data while participants completed a variant of the flanker task with a manipulation of visual probe locations. Probes were presented at different distances from the target on each trial in order to force modulation of the visual field <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Nigbur et al., 2015)</ref>. N1 ERP amplitudes, which have been shown to be an index of spatial attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Heinze et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mangun &amp; Hillyard, 1988)</ref>, provided evidence that conflict resolution on incongruent trials occurred mainly via target enhancement, not distractor suppression. The critical difference between Nigbur et al.'s findings and our own is that the N1 ERP reflects early perceptual processing 150-200 ms after stimulus onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Haider, Spong, &amp; Lindsley, 1964)</ref>, which is distinct from decision-related processes of interest in the current study.</p><p>Considering the two sets of results together, it is possible that initial stimulus-processing in the spotlight framework of attention depends on target enhancement only, but that higher-order decision processes require additional distractor suppression mechanisms. Indeed, previous studies in EEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Philiastides, Ratcliff, &amp; Sajda, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">VanRullen &amp; Thorpe, 2001)</ref> have shown that visual processing and decision-making reflect distinctly different mechanisms. <ref type="bibr">Philiastides and colleagues (2006)</ref>, for example, recorded EEG data while participants indicated either the color or category of stimuli with different levels of phase coherence. The researchers showed that a negative ERP at 170 ms post-stimulus onset reflected identification of the goal-relevant feature in a trial (color vs. category), and that later ERPs reflected components of the decision process (red vs. green or face vs. car). Importantly, only the late ERP components reflected triallevel difficulty or conflict between the two competing choice options. Nevertheless, further work is needed to understand the possible dissociation between perceptual processing and decisionrelevant computations in the presence of conflict.</p><p>Despite converging findings across three experiments, the current study is not without limitations. First, we mathematically defined within-trial cognitive control as the cumulative distance between total evidence and a conflict threshold. We defined this function based on the DMC framework of Braver and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Braver, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">De Pisapia &amp; Braver, 2006)</ref>, in which cognitive control increases within-trial until conflict is resolved, and then may decrease toward the end of a trial. Both of these properties were observed in neuronal firing patterns in the conflict-relevant ACC during a recent single-unit recording study <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hunt et al., 2018)</ref>. Our specific definition of the cognitive control function, however, may not be precisely correct in terms of representing drive to attentional mechanisms. For example, a related mechanism described by <ref type="bibr">Yeung and colleagues (2004)</ref> calculated conflict as the product of activations across possible responses. Within the SSM framework, however, the product of activations would result in an unchanging attentional spotlight if one accumulator sporadically reached zero, which would be a frequent occurrence on congruent trials. While it seems possible that the attentional spotlight would not be necessary on congruent trials, Servant and colleagues (2014) compared the original SSP to a variant in which the spotlight only shrank on incongruent trials. The authors found that the alternative model provided worse fits to behavioral data compared to the original model, and was specifically unable to capture the range in performance across subjects in the congruent condition. Future work will investigate the nature of the cognitive control signal as it relates to the amount of evidence in the system at a given time.</p><p>A second limitation of the current investigation is that we investigated competing hypotheses within the SSP model. We made this choice despite results from other studies demonstrating that the SSP cannot capture patterns of data beyond the flanker task (notably, negative-going delta functions in the Simon task; <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>, and that a version of the SSP implemented in the LCA framework could not capture pre-motor partial error responses as measured by MEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Servant et al., 2015)</ref>. We believe with modifications such as those explored in the current project, the shrinking spotlight framework can indeed extend beyond what it was designed to capture. Preliminary investigations of extensions for the LCA control SSP model presented here are currently underway, specifically for tasks involving gradations of conflict outside of the flanker paradigm.</p></div>

(2014)</ref>, required participants to indicate the color of a target circle amid flanker circles of a congruent or incongruent color. The color saturation of center target circles varied from trial to trial within six conditions (degrees of suprathreshold saturation levels: 15%, 25%, 35%, 45%, 60% and 80%), while the color saturation of flanker circles was held constant at 80%. An example of the stimuli used in Experiment 2 is provided in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> of the main manuscript. To fit the DSTP model, we needed to make adjustments to accommodate the target color saturation manipulation. When modifying our SSP variants to fit data from Experiment 2, we replaced the perceptual input strength parameter with six points along a monotonically increasing sigmoid function. We took a similar approach to modifying the DSTP. We made the assumption that the target color saturation manipulation would affect both RS1 and SS phases of Stage 1, with RS1 representing automatic feature-driven attentional processes and SS representing a more controlled mode of selecting a stimulus for further processing. Because RS2 in Stage 2 represents decision processes after the target has already been identified in the SS phase, specific perceptual features of the target like color saturation should not have an affect on We therefore implemented sigmoidal functions to calculate drift rates in both RS1 and SS. Because the color saturation of targets varied between trials while the color saturation of flanker stimuli was held constant, we specified a vector such that was calculated via a sigmoidal function where and , , and were free parameters.</p><p>, representing the floor value of the sigmoidal function, was fixed to 0 since values of were constrained to be positive in the original model. was then calculated with the equation for each target color saturation condition , where was negative on incongruent trials.</p><p>Similarly for the SS phase, we specified a vector such that was calculated via a sigmoidal function Where , , , and were free parameters.

To test our hypothesis against the assumption of time-dependent attention processes, we developed variants of the SSP with either time-based or control-based attentional spotlights. The time-based models mirror the original SSP so that attention, implemented as a density function for a Gaussian distribution centered on the target of a flanker array, gradually shrinks throughout a trial as a linear function of time. In the control-based models, cognitive control is calculated as the cumulative distance between total evidence and a threshold. The standard deviation of the attentional spotlight is in turn calculated as a function of cognitive control. These mechanisms are illustrated inFigure 1.</figDesc></figure>

Though the competing hypotheses concerning attention modulation and evidence accumulation were implemented and compared within the SSP model, we fit the DSTP model as an additional point of comparison as well. The DSTP presents an alternative mechanistic explanation for decision-guided attention, in which response selection processes are conditionally dependent upon the outcome of stimulus selection processes. Across three experiments, we found evidence that weakly-correlated LCA mechanisms in combination with dynamic, control-guided attention modulation mechanisms best-accounted for the data in each task condition.</figDesc></figure>

Despite being designed to fit data from tasks that present conflicting information for two possible options, the existing flanker SSMs do not include mechanisms for tracking or modulating parameters based on mutual activation of two options. Changes to drift rate occur as a function of time, regardless of the state of competition between the two choice alternatives. By considering only the difference in activation of the two choices, these models are potentially missing an important piece of the story concerning how the brain recruits cognitive control.</figDesc></figure>
