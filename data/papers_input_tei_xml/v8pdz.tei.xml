			<abstract>
				<p>Objective: Mindfulness has been an active area of research focused on the potential links to health. Recent work has also established that trait mindfulness is also related to cognition and decision-making. The present study tested the relationship between dimensions of trait mindfulness and measures of perception, cognition, and decision-making. Method: Forty-three undergraduate males and 126 online participants (54 females) completed a perceptual accuracy task, Stroop task, and surveys assessing five facets of trait mindfulness, problem solving, decentering, and mental health measures (stress, depression, anxiety). Results: Overall, only a subset of mindfulness facets were related to performance on the perceptual accuracy and Stroop tasks, partially replicating previous reports. Similarly, a subset of mindfulness dimensions was related to ethical decision-making and problem-solving success. In contrast, measures of poor mental health (stress, worry, depression) were non-specifically related to the majority of mindfulness facets. Relationships between mental health measures, but not measures of cognition and decision-making, were mediated by decentering. One exception was perceptual accuracy, which was related to several mindfulness facets, and mediated by decentering. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that separable dimensions of mindfulness are specifically related to distinct cognitive skills and decision-making, and that these relationships are largely distinct from those between mindfulness and psychological health.</p>

Similarly, mindfulness inductions can reduce task motivation, but without impacting task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hafenbrack &amp; Vohs, 2018)</ref>. A better understanding of the relationships between mindfulness and cognition will be important not only for an insight into the mechanisms of mindfulness, but also to better map the costs and benefits of mindfulness beyond health.</p><p>While multiple definitions of mindfulness exist in the literature, one popular conceptualization of mindfulness was developed by <ref type="bibr">Baer and colleagues (2006)</ref> that proposes that mindfulness as a trait is a collection of at least five separate dimensions, or facets (Observing, Describe, Acting with Awareness, Non-reactivity and Non-judging), each of which includes a set of cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual traits or skills. While a number of studies have characterized the relationships between mindfulness and cognition utilizing singledimensional measures of mindfulness, the multi-dimensional model of mindfulness would predict that the cognitive correlates of mindfulness will vary across different dimensions, depending on the processes which comprise the mindfulness facet. In line with this prediction, <ref type="bibr">Anicha and colleagues (2012)</ref> have found that perceptual abilities vary selectively with the Observing facet of mindfulness, while cognitive control varies selectively with the Nonreactivity facet.</p><p>In the present study, our goals were to replicate previous findings that specific mindfulness facets were associated with perceptual accuracy and performance under cognitive conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anicha et al., 2012)</ref>, and to extend this work by determining if specific facets of mindfulness were related to problem-solving and ethical negotiation strategies (which have previously been correlated with general measures of trait mindfulness, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ostafin &amp; Kassman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ruedy &amp; Schweitzer, 2010)</ref>. In light of previous research which has demonstrated that many of the relationships between trait mindfulness and health are mediated broadly, and nonselectively, by decentering (D. B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown, Bravo, Roos, &amp; Pearson, 2015)</ref>, we also tested if the relationships between trait mindfulness and cognition were similarly mediated by decentering.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr">Anicha and colleagues (2012)</ref>, we hypothesized that perceptual accuracy (measured through a temporal judgment task) would be positively related to the Observing facet of mindfulness while unrelated to the other facets. We also hypothesized that cognitive control (measured through a Stroop task) would interact with scores on the Non-reactivity facet, and be unrelated to the other facets; specifically, we predicted that for individuals reporting higher scores on the Non-reactivity facet, the Stroop cost-calculated as reaction time for incongruent trials minus reaction time for congruent trials-would be stronger following congruent trials (i.e., congruent primes) and weaker following incongruent trials (i.e., incongruent primes).</p><p>In light of the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ostafin and Kassman (2012)</ref> who found a positive correlation between a broad measure of trait mindfulness-using the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003)</ref>-and solving problems requiring insight, we aimed to determine which of the five facets of mindfulness would be correlated with successful insight problem solving. We also extended <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ruedy and Schweitzer's (2010)</ref> finding that general trait mindfulness was related to less willingness to use unethical negotiation strategies, to determining which facet(s) in particular.</p><p>Finally, other work has demonstrated that while trait mindfulness is related to better psychological health, the relationship between mindfulness and mental health is mediated through a common construct, decentering (D. B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown et al., 2015)</ref>, which involves a reduction in a person's attachment to their thoughts and emotions. We expected that decentering would mediate the relationship between mindfulness and mental health, but that decentering would not be related to the relationship between mindfulness and cognitive and perceptual skills. We hypothesized that, using simple mediation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004)</ref>, decentering would significantly mediate the relationship between mindfulness facets and measures of mental health (stress, anxiety, and depression) but not mediate the relationship with cognition and perceptual skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited from the Wabash College Psychology department pool (of male undergraduates) and Amazon's Mechanical Turk (mTurk) service from a pool of 2,002 individuals who lived in the United Stated and had previously completed a demographicsscreening questionnaire (surveying age, gender, and race/ethnicity). Respondents who reported ages between 18 and 35, and who indicated their gender as male or female, were given a qualification code to participate in the present study. Participants from mTurk were paid $6 USD for completing the study, which was estimated to require 30-50 minutes for most individuals to finish. Data were obtained from 43 undergraduate males (18-21 years old, M = 19.1 years, SD = 0.9 years) and 126 participants from mTurk (54 females, 20-63 years old, M = 29.1 years, SD = 5.1 years). The majority of participants self-identified as white/non-Hispanic (67%), with an additional 12% as Asian, 8% as African-American, and 7% as Hispanic, Latino or Mexican. For the undergraduate males, 35 were tested in supervised conditions in a classroom computer lab, and 8 participated online (in the same method used for the mTurk participants).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tasks</head><p>Temporal judgment. To assess perceptual abilities, participants completed a temporal judgment task (based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anicha et al., 2012)</ref>. Participants completed 100 trials of this task, in which a fixation point (+) was presented for 2 seconds; after 500ms the fixation point was removed, and a visual stimulus (i.e., a blue square) was presented to the left or right of the fixation point. After a delay (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA: 17, 33, 50 or 83ms) and without the removal of the first stimulus, a second stimulus appeared on the side of the fixation point that was opposite to the first stimulus. Using the computer mouse, participants would click on the stimulus that they judged to have appeared first. The task was implemented using the Unity3D game engine (https://unity3d.com/) and embedded in a web page hosted on one of the author's website. Once all trials had been completed, data were automatically transmitted via an email through the website. Data from the temporal judgment task were obtained from 169 participants, except for some cases in which sufficient trials were not obtained at each target SOA-because the participants' screen refresh rates were not compatible with all the SOAs. Specifically, trials were included for each SOA only if the delay between the first and second stimulus was within ±3ms of the target SOA (e.g., within 14-20ms for the 17ms SOA). Analyses of the temporal judgment task were restricted to participants for whom at least 15 trials were obtained at each SOA (n = 143).</p><p>Stroop. Participants completed 360 trials, in which the words RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW and XXX were presented. Each stimulus appeared in a red, blue, green or yellow font.</p><p>Participants were asked to position their hands over the Z, X, N and M keys, and to press Z if the word presented was in a red font, X if blue, N if green, and M if yellow, as quickly as possible.</p><p>The key/color assignments were presented on the initial instruction page and remained at the bottom of the screen throughout the trials. Intertrial intervals were 250ms, and errors were penalized by presenting the word "Incorrect" and delaying the start of the subsequent trial by 2 seconds. No feedback was given after correct responses. After each block of 36 trials was complete, participants were allowed to rest (the message "X percent complete, press Enter when you are ready to continue" [where X = 10%, 20%, etc.] was presented on the screen, and the task resumed when the participant pressed Enter).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants completed the temporal judgment task, followed by the Stroop task.</p><p>Participants were then directed to a battery of survey measures (administered through SurveyMonkey, https://surveymonkey.com/). First, ten lists of words from the DRM task , were presented as two groups of five lists (on two separate pages). Participants were asked to study each set of lists for two minutes and were instructed that they would be tested on the words later.</p><p>Participants then completed two non-insight problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Schooler, Ohlsson, &amp; Brooks, 1993)</ref>, followed by a second repetition of the ten DRM lists. After this, participants completed three insight problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Schooler et al., 1993)</ref>, followed by a recognition memory test for the DRM task. (For parsimony, results from the DRM task are not reported here).</p><p>After the recognition memory test, participants completed the 16-item Self-reported  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Meyer, Miller, Metzger, &amp; Borkovec, 1990)</ref>, and 10item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (10-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Next, they completed the 15-item Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS), followed by the 39-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire <ref type="bibr">(FFMQ, Baer et al., 2006)</ref>, and ending with demographics questions (gender [binary choice between female or male], age, and race/ethnicity). After completing the survey, participants were given a debriefing on the purpose of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS. Following Anicha and colleagues <ref type="formula">2012</ref>, separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted for the interactions of FFMQ scores with performance on the Stroop, and again with temporal judgment tasks. Bivariate correlations were used to assess the relationships between trait mindfulness measures and other measures of psychological health, insight problem solving, and ethical decision-making. Sobel tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004)</ref> were used to test for simple mediation by decentering of the relationships between trait mindfulness, psychological health outcomes (depression, perceived stress, anxiety), insight problem-solving, and ethical decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal judgment task</head><p>Of the 144 participants whose data from the temporal judgment task were complete, accuracy on the task improved across the four delays from an average of 57.8% (SD = 12.2%) correct at the 17-ms delay to 88.1% (SD = 13.9%) at the 83-ms delay. However, while accuracies were high for the 83ms delay, a number of participants performed poorly on the task. At the 83ms SOA, accuracies ranged from a high of 100% to a low of 41% (below chance), and 15% of participants had an accuracy of less than 75% at the longest delay). As it is likely that participants who performed poorly at the longest delay may have had difficulty with the task displaying correctly on their computers or had been less motivated to attend to the task, analyses for the temporal judgment task were restricted to participants who achieved at least 80% accuracy at the 83-ms delay (n = 112). <ref type="formula">2012</ref>, we analyzed the arcsign transformed accuracies on the temporal judgment task, using the SOA (17ms, 33ms, 50ms, 83ms) as a within-subjects factor and mindfulness facets as a between-subjects factor. As previously mentioned, separate ANCOVAs were performed for each FFMQ facet. For each ANCOVA, there was a significant main effect of SOA (with increasing accuracy at longer SOAs, as expected: at 17ms: M = 60.0%, SD = 11.7%; at 33ms: M = 74.3%, SD = 12.9%; at 50ms: M = 84.3%, SD = 13.5%; at 83ms: M = 94.5%, SD = 0.6%). While mean accuracies were lower at the shortest SOA, accuracies were also significantly above chance performance at each delay (assessed using one-sample t-tests, all p-values &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Following Anicha and colleagues</head><p>In addition to the relationship between SOA and accuracy, we also replicated the finding that the Observing facet was related to accuracy on temporal judgment task. For the Observing facet, both the main effect of SOA (F(3, 330) = 16.3, p &lt; 0.001, 2 = 0.13) and the Observing facet (F(1,110) = 4.0, p = 0.048, 2 = 0.035) were significant, while the Observing × SOA interaction (F(3, 330) = 1.1, p = 0.35, 2 = 0.01) was not. The Observing scores were also found, as expected, to be positively related to accuracies on the temporal judgment task.</p><p>While only the Observing facet was expected to be related to accuracies on the temporal judgment task, the ANCOVAs additionally revealed a significant main effect by the Nonreactivity facet (F(1, 110) = 10.9, p = 0.001,  2 = 0.090), and a non-significant trend for the Describe facet (F(1, 110) = 3.2, p = 0.077,  2 = 0.028), which in both cases was also due to a positive relationship between trait mindfulness and accuracy on the temporal judgment task. The main effect by the Acting with Awareness and Non-judging facets were not significant (Fs &lt; 1.2, ps &gt; 0.28, 2 s &lt; 0.01).</p><p>We found a significant interactions between Describe × SOA (F(3, 330) = 3.0, p = 0.032, 2 = 0.026), and Acting with Awareness × SOA (F(3, 330) = 2.9, p = 0.033, 2 = 0.026). In both cases, examination of the relationship between mindfulness facets and accuracy at each delay revealed that Describe and Acting with Awareness scores were positively related to accuracy at the 50ms SOA, but that the relationship was weaker for the shorter and longer SOAs.</p><p>Interactions between SOA and the remaining mindfulness facets (i.e., Non-judging and Nonreactivity) were not significant (Fs &lt; 1.97, ps &gt; 0.11, 2 s &lt; 0.02).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stroop task</head><p>Data from the Stroop task were submitted by 167 participants, and average accuracies on the task ranged from 86% to 100% (M = 96.0%, SD = 2.6%). Reaction times in the Stroop task were first analyzed using a 2 x 2 ANOVA with Target (Congruent vs. Incongruent) and Prime (Congruent vs. Incongruent) as within-subjects factors. Our results for these analyses agreed with <ref type="bibr">Anicha and colleagues (2012)</ref>; there was a significant main effect of Target (F(1,166) = 641, p &lt; 0.001, 2 = 0.79) and Prime (F(1,166) = 6.7, p = 0.01, 2 = 0.04), indicating that reaction times were faster for congruent targets compared to incongruent targets, and for congruent primes compared to incongruent primes, respectively. Also, the critical Target × Prime interaction was significant (F(1,166) = 312, p &lt; 0.001, 2 = 0.65), with the Stroop cost being significantly higher following congruent primes (i.e., reaction time after congruent primes: with congruent targets, M = 707ms, SD = 150ms; with incongruent targets, M = 894ms, SD = 208ms), compared to incongruent primes (i.e., reaction time after incongruent primes: with congruent targets, M = 780.8, SD = 177.3ms; with incongruent targets, M = 829.1, SD = 188.2ms).</p><p>Anicha and colleagues (2012) reported that for the log transformed reaction times, the Non-reactivity facet of the FFMQ was related to Stroop performance, and critically to the threeway interaction of Non-reactivity × Target × Prime in a GLM analysis. We found that reaction times were positively related to Non-reactivity scores, which produced a main effect of Nonreactivity (F(1, 165) = 6.3, p = 0.013, 2 = 0.04); however, the three-way interaction was not significant (F&lt;1, n.s.), nor were either two-way interactions significant (Fs&lt;1, n.s.). These results suggested that individuals with higher trait Non-reactivity were slower to respond on the Stroop task, but were not differentially sensitive to the Stoop effect or to the cost of switching between types of stimuli (congruent and non-congruent).</p><p>For the other mindfulness facets, none of the 3-way interactions were significant ( Fs &lt; 1.5, ps &gt; 0.22, 2 &lt; 0.01). There was a significant Observing × Target interaction (F(1,165) = 5.3, p = 0.023, 2 = 0.03) and a nonsignificant trend for the Non-judging × Target interaction (F(1,165) = 3.6, p = 0.058, 2 = 0.02). In both cases, each mindfulness facet was associated with shorter reaction times for incongruent targets compared to congruent targets (indicating a weaker Stroop effect for individuals high in Observing or Non-judging). No other main effects of or interactions with mindfulness facets were significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem-solving and ethical decision-making</head><p>As predicted (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>), MAAS scores were negatively correlated with the SINS (r(167) = -0.16, p = 0.036), and positively correlated with insight problem solving (r(167) = 0.20, p = 0.011) while not significantly related to non-insight problem solving (r(167) = -0.08, p = 0.28).</p><p>Examining the FFMQ subscales, Acting with Awareness was negatively related to SINS scores (r(167) = -0.20, p = 0.008) and positively related to insight problem solving (r(167) = 0.21, p = 0.007). Insight problem solving was also negatively related to Non-reactivity (r(167) = 0.21, p = 0.005). Non-insight problem solving was negatively related to Non-judging (r(167) = -0.17, p = 0.27). Decentering did not show a significant relationship to any of the three measures (SINS, insight problem solving and non-insight problem solving), though there was a trend for individuals who scored higher in decentering to solve more insight problems (r(167) = 0.15, p = 0.056).</p><p>To determine if the relationships between FFMQ subscales and cognitive measures were mediated by decentering, we tested using simple mediation models. Specifically, Sobel tests examined for significant reduction of any direct relationship between mindfulness and each cognitive measure (stress, depression, worry, problem-solving, and ethical decision-making) via decentering.</p><p>Our results for measures of psychological health agreed with the findings of <ref type="bibr">Brown and colleagues (2015)</ref> in that each FFMQ facet was positively correlated with decentering, and that decentering was negatively related to measures of stress, worry, and depression (i.e., PSS, PSWQ, and CESD-R). All of the mindfulness facets, except Observing, were also negatively related to measures of stress, worry, and depression.</p><p>To determine if decentering mediated the direct relationship between mindfulness and psychological health, simple mediational models were tested <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). As summarized in <ref type="table">Table   2</ref>, for the four mindfulness facets (all but Observing) which were correlated with measures of psychological health, there was a significant direct relationship (c in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) between mindfulness (X) and psychological health (Y). There was also a significant relationship between the four mindfulness facets (X) and decentering (M), and between decentering (M) and psychological health measures (Y); furthermore, there was evidence for a significant indirect path based on the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval. For each mindfulness facet and each measure of psychological health, the strength of their relationship significantly decreased once decentering had been introduced (Sobel tests, cc', <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In most cases, decentering only partially mediated the relationship between mindfulness and psychological health (and c' remained significant). These results support previous research indicating that decentering serves as a general factor linking facets of trait mindfulness to measures of psychological health.</p><p>To extend the work of Brown and colleagues (2015), we examined the relationship among mindfulness, decentering, and measures of cognition and decision-making e.g., temporal judgment, Stroop performance, ethical decision-making, and problem-solving. In each case, we restricted our analyses to the facets that had significant bivariate correlations with one of the dependent measures. Mixed results were obtained for the temporal judgment task, where including the indirect relationship via decentering significantly reduced the relationships between the Observing and Describe facets and accuracy, but did not significantly reduce the relationship between Non-judging and accuracy. For Stroop performance (e.g. overall reaction time and the Stroop cost), ethical decision-making, insight and noninsight problem solving, their relationships with mindfulness facets were not mediated by decentering (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In specifics, in each case, there was no significant relationship between decentering and the dependent measures (path b in <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>; there was no evidence for a significant indirect path based on the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals; and none of the Sobel tests were significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Consistent with published findings, we found that higher levels of trait mindfulness were related to several measures of cognition, including measures of problem solving, decisionmaking, cognitive control, and perceptual ability. Specifically, the Observing facet of mindfulness correlated with better performance in a perceptual accuracy task that involved identifying which of two stimuli appeared first in a display. And, scores on a general mindfulness scale (MAAS) were correlated with better problem-solving that required creative insight, and with less willingness to use unethical strategies in high-stakes negotiations.</p><p>While previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anicha et al., 2012)</ref> has demonstrated that only the Observing mindfulness facet is correlated with perceptual accuracy, our results indicated that Non-reactivity was also positively related to performance on the temporal judgment task, and that Acting with Awareness interacted with the delay between stimuli. These results suggest that mindfulness may be broadly related to perceptual accuracy, across multiple mindfulness facets. <ref type="bibr">Anicha and colleagues (2012)</ref> also reported that Non-reactivity was related to cognitive flexibility; however, we did not find any of the five facets of mindfulness to be significantly related to cognitive flexibility (defined as the effect of the previous trial, the prime, on the Stroop cost). While we did find that the Stroop cost depended strongly on the prime (such that the cost was highest for trials that followed a congruent prime), we did not find evidence that this effect of the prime was related to any of the facets. The only relationship between Stroop performance and Non-reactivity that we observed was that participants with high Non-reactivity scores tended to have slower reaction times on the task in general.</p><p>However, there was an interaction between Observing and congruency (more mindful individuals were faster on the incongruent trials, showing a weaker Stroop effect overall). These results support the general claim that some mindfulness facets are associated with better cognitive performance as measured on a Stroop task, though the specific facets involved differed from the one reported by Anicha and colleagues (Non-reactivity). Our Stroop task, as noted elsewhere in this report, used four color targets (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, and BLUE) along with our neutral target (XXX), rather than two color targets (RED and GREEN) as in <ref type="bibr">Anicha and colleagues (2012)</ref>, which could have caused the discrepancy between our results and those of Anicha and colleagues. Further research is warranted to determine under what conditions each facet of mindfulness may be related, if at all, to perceptual accuracy or cognitive flexibility.</p><p>Beyond perceptual accuracy and cognitive control, we also replicated findings that a broad measure of mindfulness (MAAS) is correlated with performance on solving problems requiring insight <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ostafin &amp; Kassman, 2012)</ref>, and with reduced willingness to use unethical strategies in hypothetical high-stakes negotiations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ruedy &amp; Schweitzer, 2010)</ref>. We extended this work by demonstrating that only Acting with Awareness and Non-reactivity were related to insight problem-solving, and Acting with Awareness to the use of unethical negotiation strategies. Interestingly, the Non-judging facet was negatively related to non-insight solving problems (i.e. requiring logic rather than insight). These results are consistent with the proposal that mindfulness is not a unitary construct, but is instead composed of a set of distinct facets or dimensions, which are each comprised of a distinct set of cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual traits or skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baer et al., 2006)</ref>. Consistent with this model, measures of cognition (Stroop performance, problem-solving) and decision-making (willingness to use unethical negotiation strategies) demonstrate relationships to a subset of mindfulness dimensions. In contrast, perceptual accuracy on the temporal judgment task showed less specificity, correlating or interacting with multiple mindfulness dimensions.</p><p>In a model of how mindfulness is related to health, <ref type="bibr">Shapiro and colleagues (2006)</ref> proposed that mindfulness-"the process of intentionally attending moment by moment with openness and nonjudgmentalness"-led to repercieving (or decentering), a shift in perspective in which one identifies less with one's experiences and is able to better observe them objectively.</p><p>Repercieving was proposed to facilitate improvements in health through self-regulation, values clarification, cognitive and behavioral flexibility, and exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Shapiro et al., 2006)</ref>. In an empirical test of this model, <ref type="bibr">Brown and colleagues (2015)</ref> found that the relationship between four mindfulness dimensions (all facets except Observing) were either partially or fully mediated by a path including decentering and the proposed psychological mechanisms (measured by survey measures assessing purpose in life, environmental mastery, distress intolerance, and selfregulation). Consistent with this research, our findings indicated that decentering partially or fully mediated the relationship between mindfulness facets and measures of psychological health (here, stress, anxiety, and depression). Furthermore, decentering mediated the relationships between Observing, as well as Describe, and perceptual accuracy. Decentering did not mediate any of the relationships between the five mindfulness facets and Stroop performance, ethical decision-making, and problem-solving. These results are not surprising if decentering is a metamechanism that is related to mindfulness, and the cognitive measures we examined (perhaps with the exception of perceptual accuracy) are related to the underlying cognitive mechanisms that comprise specific mindfulness facets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Research focusing on mindfulness is primarily motivated by a desire to understand the relationship between mindfulness and health. Correlational studies, brief mindfulness inductions, and interventions have all demonstrated that mindfulness is positively related to health and can be cultivated to improve health. And, recent studies have also shown that trait mindfulness is related to a range of measures related to cognitive performance, which may also be affected by interventions targeting mindfulness. As such, by examining the relationships between cognition and decision-making to mindfulness dimensions (and testing the impact of mindfulness interventions on these measures), future research can provide insights into the mechanisms linking mindfulness to health and to cognitive performance more generally.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.
