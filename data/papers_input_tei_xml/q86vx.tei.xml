			<abstract>
				<p>Sacrificial moral dilemmas elicit a strong conflict between the motive to not personally harm someone and the competing motive to achieving the greater good, which is often described as the &quot;utilitarian&quot; response. Some prior research suggests that reasoning abilities and deliberative cognitive style are associated with endorsement of utilitarian solutions, but as has more recently been emphasized, both conceptual and methodological issues leave open the possibility that utilitarian responses are due instead to a reduced emotional response to harm. Across eight studies, using self-report, behavioral performance, and neuroanatomical measures, we show that individual differences in reasoning ability and cognitive style of thinking are positively associated with a preference for utilitarian solutions, but bear no relationship to harm-relevant concerns. These findings support the dual-process model of moral decision making and highlight the utility of process dissociation methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Moral dilemmas are a central feature of the human condition: too often, we can only prevent a large harm by committing a smaller one. Dilemmas of this kind arise in personal settings (whether to abort a fetus to save the mother), corporate settings (should products be tested on live animals to prevent possible harm to consumers?), and political settings (should we risk civilian lives to bring a swifter end to war?). These dilemmas admit of two basic solutions, each associated with a broad school of philosophical thought: the utilitarian response that favors maximizing welfare by any means <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Mill, 1998)</ref> and the deontological response that often forbids causing harm, especially instrumentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Kant, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Over the last two decades, psychologists have devoted intense theoretical and empirical effort to understanding the processes underlying these competing motives, as well as the process that adjudicates between them. These studies typically employ hypothetical vignettes that pose a dilemma between harming a few people to save a larger number of individuals from harm <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Christensen &amp; Gomila, 2012)</ref>. Most prominently, the Dual-Process Model (DPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, &amp; Cohen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, &amp; Cohen, 2001)</ref> posits that two systems support moral decision-making: (i) an automatic and emotionally-grounded system that favors deontological decisions, and (ii) a deliberative reasoning system that supports utilitarian decisions. The process underlying deontological decisions is assumed to be automatic, affective, and resource independent, while the process underlying utilitarian responses is assumed to be deliberate, cognitive, and effortful. In the specific case of sacrificial dilemmas, these systems render competing motives, resulting in a response conflict . It is important to note, however, that the DPM proposes that these two processes operate independently and are not inversely proportional to each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>. Thus, one can find it morally acceptable to endorse the utilitarian option within sacrificial moral dilemmas either because they are better at cognitive deliberation (e.g., abstract reasoning, problem solving) or because they have reduced harm aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Although much evidence implicates emotional arousal in supporting nonutilitarian/deontological moral judgments (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Greene, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">R. Miller &amp; Cushman, 2013)</ref>, the evidence implicating reasoning in utilitarian moral judgments is far less consistent (see below). This is the point of departure for our research: as a matter of fact, are individual differences in the tendency to render utilitarian moral judgments due to individual differences in the capacity and propensity for reasoning, or not? If yes, is this association independent of harm-relevant concerns?</p><p>To pose this question requires a basic operational understanding of "reasoning". Although there are many variants of dual-process models <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Dolan &amp; Dayan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Epstein, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kahneman &amp; Frederick, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Sloman, 1996)</ref>, generically, all models distinguish between an automatic, parallel, and effortless thinking system (intuitive/heuristic system) and a deliberate, sequential, and effortful thinking system (analytical/deliberative/reflective system). Here, we use the term "reasoning" to refer to explicit, reflective, and conscious information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013)</ref>. Reasoning is a mode of thinking that has domain-general involvement in solving novel problems, making decisions, or arriving to a conclusion in the absence of simple evolutionary programs (instincts/reflexes) or a previously learned response (habits) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Evans, 2017)</ref>. In the context of moral dilemmas, reasoning may involve either employing consciously available rules (e.g., "always try to do what is best for the most people" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bennis, Medin, &amp; Bartels, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Nichols &amp; Mallon, 2006)</ref>) or a systematic cost-benefit analysis ("five lives saved is better than one"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bartels, 2008)</ref>). Our strategy is to investigate reasoning in this broad and general sense by aggregating across diverse measures. This is an important but preliminary step which, if successful, would lay the foundation for more detailed analyses of the contribution of reasoning to moral judgment.</p><p>In sum, we investigate the association between the capacity and propensity for domaingeneral reasoning and the judgment of sacrificial moral dilemmas pitting the welfare-maximizing option against physical harm to another. Across a series of eight studies (N = 4,204), we find that reasoning is associated with utilitarian resolutions to moral dilemmas but is independent of an aversion to carrying out harm. We begin by reviewing the extant evidence that bears on this question, noting several conceptual and methodological limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulations of reasoning</head><p>Several prior studies explore the role of reasoning in utilitarian moral judgment by taxing executive resources necessary for deliberation <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Patil &amp; Trémolière, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Trémolière, Neys, &amp; Bonnefon, 2018)</ref>. This is done in several ways: a) time pressure manipulation: limiting the amount of time available to provide moral judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Cummins &amp; Cummins, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Rosas &amp; Aguilar-Pardo, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Suter &amp; Hertwig, 2011)</ref>; b) cognitive load manipulation: taxing working memory capacity through another concurrent cognitively demanding task <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gawronski, Armstrong, Conway, Friesdorf, &amp; Hütter, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, &amp; Cohen, 2008)</ref>, or exhausting cognitive resources via sleep deprivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Killgore et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Tempesta et al., 2012)</ref> or with a prior sequential cognitive depletion task <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Timmons &amp; Byrne, 2018)</ref>, or leading people to think about their mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Trémolière, Neys, &amp; Bonnefon, 2012)</ref>, or, the reverse, easing up the cognitive load by presenting efficient kill-save ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Trémolière &amp; Bonnefon, 2014)</ref>; c) cognitive priming manipulation: nudging participants to use a deliberative thinking mode (versus "feelings thinking mode") <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Li, Xia, Wu, &amp; Chen, 2018)</ref>, priming analytical thinking mode by asking them to solve mathematical puzzles before performing the moral judgment task <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Kvaran, Nichols, &amp; Sanfey, 2013)</ref>, or presenting dilemmas written in hard-to-read (disfluent) fonts <ref type="bibr">(Spears, Fernández-</ref>Linsenbarth, Okan, Ruz, &amp; González, 2018) to trigger analytic thinking.</p><p>The dual-process model predicts that, by diminishing reliance on the cognitive system, these manipulations will reduce utilitarian moral judgments. Yet existing studies exhibit a mixed pattern: some studies find the predicted pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Białek &amp; De Neys, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Byrd &amp; Conway, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Cummins &amp; Cummins, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Kvaran et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Li et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Spears et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Suter &amp; Hertwig, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Timmons &amp; Byrne, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Trémolière &amp; Bonnefon, 2014)</ref>, while others do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bago &amp; De Neys, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gawronski et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Greene et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Killgore et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Lane &amp; Sulikowski, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Rosas &amp; Aguilar-Pardo, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Tempesta et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Tinghög et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, evidence from extraneous manipulation of cognitive resources provides inconsistent support for the reasoning-utilitarian association.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual differences in reasoning</head><p>Some prior research also asks how individual differences in self-reported cognitive style relate to utilitarian moral judgments. The DPM predicts that higher scores on such measures will be associated with utilitarian responses to moral dilemmas.</p><p>To this end, various self-report measures have been utilized, along with a few behavioral tasks. These include Need for Cognition (NFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982)</ref>, the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Frederick, 2005)</ref>, Actively Open-minded Thinking (AOT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Stanovich &amp; West, 1997)</ref>,</p><p>and Rational decision-making style <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Scott &amp; Bruce, 1995)</ref>, among others. We will discuss these measures in more detail later, but for now it suffices to say that the DPM prediction has received mixed support from this line of inquiry as well. Many studies do find a positive association between reasoning measures and utilitarian tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aktas, Yilmaz, &amp; Bahçekapili, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bartels, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Byrd &amp; Conway, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Conway, Goldstein-Greenwood, Polacek, &amp; Greene, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Paxton, Bruni, &amp; Greene, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Royzman, Landy, &amp; Leeman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Wiech et al., 2013</ref>), but others do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Attie &amp; Knobe, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kahane et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">McNair, Okan, Hadjichristidis, &amp; de Bruin, 2019)</ref>, and some provide mixed or inconsistent findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baron, Scott, Fincher, &amp; Emlen Metz, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> McPhetres, Conway, Hughes, &amp; Zuckerman, 2018).</p></div>

Accordingly, we also explore the neuroanatomical basis of individual differences in utilitarian moral judgment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual challenges</head><p>Given the volume of empirical work inspired by the dual process model, it is remarkable that we remain so uncertain about several of its core claims. This owes, in part, to underlying conceptual issues prevalent in the existing literature. As noted above, a major conceptual issue in this body of work is that utilitarian and deontological inclinations are treated as mutually exclusive psychological processes, when in fact the theory states that they are independent and non-exclusive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>. (The "conflict" between them in many studies is forced only by the structure of the sacrificial dilemmas used as stimuli.) This point has two important consequences. First, even if reasoning supports utilitarian moral judgment, individual differences in the propensity for utilitarian moral judgment in sacrificial dilemmas could be determined mostly by individual differences in the competing motive to avoid direct, personal harm. Second, and of greatest relevance to the present work, evidence that individual differences in reasoning correlate with individual differences in utilitarian moral judgments in sacrificial dilemmas need not imply that reasoning contributes principally to cost-benefit analysis. An alternative possibility is that reasoning inhibits the strong emotional response to the harm involved in the moral dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Cushman, Gray, Gaffey, &amp; Mendes, 2012)</ref>. In other words, the existing work argues that better reasoners are more likely to endorse utilitarian responses on moral dilemmas because they are more adept at weighing the cost of harming someone with the benefit of saving more lives. But the manner in which these studies have indexed utilitarianism makes these findings compatible with the alternative explanation that better reasoners are simply less emotionally responsive to the aversive nature of harm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bartels &amp; Pizarro, 2011)</ref>. We resolve this conceptual ambiguity by relying on the process dissociation (PD) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Conway et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gawronski et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Reynolds &amp; Conway, 2018)</ref> in several of the studies reported here. This method (discussed in depth later) allows researchers to independently assess individual differences in costbenefit analysis versus aversion to harm.</p><p>A second conceptual issue is the narrow definition of "utilitarianism" often implicitly adopted in the contemporary psychological literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Gawronski &amp; Beer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kahane et al., 2018</ref>). In many contexts, "utilitarianism" is operationalized exclusively as a willingness to engage in instrumental harm for the greater good. This is because "utilitarianism" has been studied principally in the context of sacrificial dilemmas (e.g., asking participants if they would push a man to his death in order to save five others from a runaway train). A second component of "utilitarianism" is impartial beneficence, which signifies that we should help others as much as we can from a completely impartial perspective, giving no special weight to ourselves or to our family or friends. The present manuscript involves many studies of instrumental harm, but no direct study of impartial beneficence; thus, our results hold implications for individual differences in impartial beneficence only indirectly <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Capraro, Everett, &amp; Earp, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodological issues</head><p>In addition to these conceptual issues, several methodological issues are present in existing research, each of which we attempt to overcome here:</p><p>1. Often a limited number of moral dilemmas is used, which makes it difficult to generalize observed results to the general class of dilemmas from which specific examples are drawn. 3. Classical moral dilemmas are typically used, with a single scale that forces utilitarian and deontological inclinations to be inversely related. 4. Self-report measures of individual differences in cognitive/reasoning ability dominate the current literature.</p><p>In the current work, we try to address all of these concerns by carrying out studies with (relatively) large sample sizes, using a variety of both self-report and behavioral task measures of reasoning, and using mixed-effects models to generalize the results not only across subjects, but also across items. Consistent with the diversity of measures that we employ, our goal is not to investigate which specific reasoning measure is associated with utilitarian inclinations, but rather whether reasoning-defined and assessed broadly-is correlated with such inclinations at the aggregate level across individual measures. Of course, the results for individual measures will be informative for future meta-analyses with a more focused inquiry (e.g., "are individual differences in CRT predictive of differences in utilitarian judgments?"). But we hesitate to make claims about any specific reasoning measure (e.g., CRT) having greater or lesser predictive utility for individual differences in utilitarian choices given that our goal is to provide evidence for the most general form of relationship between the constructs of domain-general reasoning and moral utilitarianism.</p><p>Finally, while the battery of measures we use here is not exhaustive, it is drawn from the DPM literature where these measures have been utilized across a variety of subfields to index various aspects of reasoning (please see Linden J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ball &amp; Thompson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Blanchette, 2013;</ref> for discussion of how several of these measures relate to one another and the broader construct of reasoning).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using R programming language (https://www.rproject.org/). As we note above, since the behavioral data had a multilevel or nested structure (i.e., items within conditions within participants in Study 1), we utilized generalized linear mixed-effects models with maximal random effects structure.</p><p>Our studies were not designed to characterize a detailed pattern of associations between individual reasoning measures and utilitarian moral judgment (e.g., some specific correlations would be stronger than others), but instead to firmly establish the general form of this association.</p><p>Therefore, we carried out random-effects meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &amp; Rothstein, 2009</ref>) using regression estimates (and the associated standard errors) across measures for each study 1 and assessed if the meta-analytic effect was significantly different than 0. We also provide an index of variability (I 2 ) in effect size estimates that is due to statistical heterogeneity and not due to sampling error <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Borenstein et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to providing details from null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approach, we also compute Bayes Factors for the random-effects meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Heck, Gronau, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2017)</ref>. The prior distribution for the mean effect was assumed to be normal (d ~ N(0, 0.3)), while the prior for the standard deviation of study effects τ in the random-effects metaanalysis was assumed to follow half-Cauchy distribution (scale = 0.5). This analysis is especially crucial for establishing evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (BF01), where the NHST approach is uninformative <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aczel et al., 2018)</ref>. Note that, where relevant, we provide natural logarithm values for Bayes Factors (i.e., loge(BF01)), which need to be exponentiated to get the BF01.</p><p>Our conclusions are based on these meta-analytic summary effects. Note that under a random-effects model it is assumed that the true effect size varies from study to study and the metaanalytic summary effect is an estimate of the mean for the population of effect sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Borenstein et al., 2009)</ref>. This was indeed the case for the current study where we acknowledge that the precise strength of the relationship between any given measure of reflective reasoning and utilitarianism might vary from measure to measure. As such, we test whether the mean association is significantly different than zero in both frequentist and Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis.</p></div>

In this study, we assessed associations between self-reported measures of reasoning and "utilitarian" moral judgment as indexed by a single measure that assumes utilitarian and deontological tendencies are inversely related. As we note above, this approach is problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Conway et al., 2018)</ref>, but this is how utilitarianism has typically been assessed and therefore we wanted to see if we could find a positive association between reasoning and utilitarian inclination when it is assessed in this manner.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In Study 1a, participants were randomly assigned to complete one of the following questionnaires: NFC, REI, or AOT plus BB.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The linear mixed-effects regression (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>; also see Supplemental materials (Text S2; <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref>-1 to 10)) revealed that the estimates were positive for all measures (except for NFC).</p><p>Despite this, random-effects meta-analysis showed that the summary estimate was not significantly greater than zero. More importantly, the Bayes Factor in favor of the null hypothesis (summary estimate not being significantly different than 0) was 2.45 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1)</ref>, which corresponds to inconclusive evidence to support the null <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Jarosz &amp; Wiley, 2014)</ref>. In other words, even though selfreported reasoning scores were on average associated with increased likelihood of viewing the "utilitarian" course of action to be more permissible, the evidence to support this claim was inconclusive. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is a meta-analytic association between reasoning measures and utilitarian responses, nor can we conclude that there is not, which, as discussed in the Introduction section, is in line with the mixed findings in the existing literature utilizing classical moral dilemmas. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Neural basis of individual differences in reasoning and utilitarian moral judgments</head><p>In this study, we tested whether individual differences in cortical thickness of dlPFC (a neuroanatomical measure associated with deliberative reasoning, complex planning, and goaldirected reasoning; <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Koechlin, Ody, &amp; Kouneiher, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">E.

The affirmative answer always corresponded to commission of sacrificial action and was deemed "utilitarian."

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Smoothed cortical thickness (CT) maps were entered in a 2nd-level GLM for each hemisphere separately.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We observed only one significant effect: a positive association between CT at right middle frontal gyrus (or right dlPFC) and utilitarian moral judgment scores (x = 30, y = 17, z = 46; k = 133, p &lt; 0.0001 (primary threshold), p (FWE-corrected) = 0.037). In other words, as predicted, individuals who were more likely to say that they would cause harm when this was necessary for producing greater general welfare also had thicker right dlPFC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we tested whether individual differences in cortical thickness were associated with making utilitarian choices in moral dilemmas. Indeed, increased thickness in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was associated with greater frequency of utilitarian decisions. This converges with our previous results identifying a positive association between greater deployment of reasoning-related activity, arguably stemming from greater computational efficiency afforded by thicker cortical surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Kanai &amp; Rees, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Wagstyl &amp; Lerch, 2018)</ref>, and the propensity to downregulate a competing harm-averse response if this is necessary to obtain a better overall outcome (for more detailed discussion, see Supplemental materials (Text S5)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 3a-3e -Reasoning and utilitarian inclinations</head><p>As we note above, the classic approach to assessing how people resolve moral dilemmas conflates selecting the deontological choice with rejecting the utilitarian choice (and vice versa).</p><p>However, the dual-process models maintain that the deontological and utilitarian inclinations derive from conceptually independent processes, rendering it possible for them to produce conflicting inclinations in high-conflict moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Koenigs et al., 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Conway and Gawronski (2013)</ref> have outlined a PD approach that allows independent measurement of individual differences in the strength of deontological and utilitarian tendencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process dissociation method</head><p>The central idea underlying PD is to compare responses on incongruent trials, in which the underlying processes lead to divergent response tendencies, as well as responses on congruent trials, in which the underlying processes lead to the same response tendency. Therefore, participants are administered two types of dilemmas: Incongruent and Congruent moral dilemmas (10 items of each type). Incongruent dilemmas pit deontological against utilitarian inclinations (traditionally known as high-conflict moral dilemmas): for example, is it acceptable to sacrifice animals for scientific experimentation if this can lead to discovery of a life-saving drug? On the other hand, congruent variants of the same dilemmas are designed to avoid this tension between deontological and utilitarian inclinations, and so both moral concerns converge on the same solution: for example, is it acceptable to sacrifice animals for scientific experimentation if this can lead to discovery of a cosmetic product to maintain smooth skin? Comparing responses on incongruent trials (when the two underlying processes compete) to responses on congruent trials (when the two underlying processes converge), the independent contributions of deontological and utilitarian inclinations to responses on moral dilemmas can be dissociated 3 . It is worth highlighting here that PD parameters aren't exactly homologous to the two processes described by the DPM, but rather represent response tendencies/inclinations, which result from the combined influence of diverse underlying processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Conway et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, utilitarian response tendency can be a result of a deliberative reasoning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>, processes related to concerns about moral identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>, etc., while deontological response tendency can be a result of an outcome/empathic aversion process (Christov-Moore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Conway, &amp; Iacoboni, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Conway et al., 2018)</ref>, an action aversion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Reynolds &amp; Conway, 2018)</ref>, and so on.</p><p>In the current work, we test whether deliberative reasoning is associated with a utilitarian response tendency but not associated with a deontological response tendency. This latter aspect of our investigation is crucial because the same processes can contribute to both response tendencies.</p><p>For example, prior work shows that processing of religious concerns contribute to both utilitarian and deontological response tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>. Thus, it is important for us to not only establish that reasoning processes contribute to utilitarian concerns about outcome-maximization, but also to show that the same processes do not contribute to deontological concerns about harm avoidance.</p><p>Therefore, in Study 3, we assessed utilitarian and deontological inclinations separately using the PD approach and hypothesized that individual differences in cognitive ability and deliberation would be positively associated specifically with utilitarian inclinations, which represent a favorable attitude for harm considering the cost-benefit analysis. We predicted no such relationship between reasoning measures and deontological inclinations, which reflect concerns about avoiding harm to others.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Study 3a</head><p>Study 3a assessed all the same measures from Studies 1a &amp; 1b (AOT, REI, NFC, BB, CRT)</p><p>along with participants' utilitarian and deontological inclinations, as quantified by the PD method.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to complete one of the reasoning measures in addition to the dilemmas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3b-e</head><p>Because all the measures (except for CRT and BB) we used thus far have been self-report questionnaires, there is still a possibility that any positive association between analytic thinking and utilitarian inclinations could be aspirational or driven by self-representational concerns. To rule out this possibility, Studies 3b-e also included behavioral tasks that index effortful thinking, derived from a class of recent reinforcement-learning (RL) tasks that measure the degree to which people use either a more automatic, habitual strategy or a more deliberative, goal-directed strategy in decision making.</p><p>Reinforcement learning is a computational approach to modelling value-guided learning and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998)</ref>. Although value-guided decision making is just one part of a person's cognitive style, it is an especially useful part to interrogate for our purposes. In this framework, the habitual strategy, model-free RL, simply reinforces actions that previously led to good outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Thorndike, 1898)</ref>. This is a relatively "cheap" strategy, because it needs only to associate experienced rewards with the actions that produced them. On the other hand the goaldirected strategy, model-based RL, uses sophisticated search algorithms to plan over a representation (or model) of the environment towards goals. This is a computationally demanding strategy, but also a more accurate one, since it can incorporate sudden changes into its causal model, without having to learn from trial-and-error. Because we have well-specified computational models of each approach, we can construct decision problems that reliably elicit unique signatures of either model-free or model-based RL methods. This allows us to infer an important element of a person's cognitive style in an unobtrusive manner, avoiding aspirational or self-representational biases.</p><p>Specifically, model-free and model-based methods can be inferred from participants' responses to a family of so-called "two-step" tasks (i.e., tasks in which participants earn rewards by sequencing appropriate behaviors in two steps). Here, we focus on two variations of the two-step task <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Daw, Gershman, Seymour, Dayan, &amp; Dolan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kool, Cushman, &amp; Gershman, 2016)</ref>, both of which are able to distinguish contributions of model-free and model-based systems by introducing situations in which the model-based system can use its explicit model of the task structure to overcome the limitations of using direct action-reward associations. We included tasks of both types in order to provide convergent evidence for our hypothesis about a relationship between cognitive style and moral judgment; we did not predict systematic differences between the tasks in this relationship.</p><p>The logic of each task and their distinguishing features have been extensively catalogued elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Kool, Cushman, &amp; Gershman, 2018)</ref>. In essence, both tasks take advantage of certain situations in which a person takes an action that later leads to reward. Model-free algorithms selectively draw the local inference that the particular action should be repeated ("If A was repeated, choose A again!"), while model-based algorithms draw global inferences that sometimes favor different actions based on the internal logic of the task ("If A was rewarding, this implies that B must be just as good, or better!").</p><p>Most crucially for our purposes, model-based control in these tasks requires effortful thinking. For example, people show a reduced capacity for model-based control when they are under cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Otto, Raio, Chiang, Phelps, &amp; Daw, 2013)</ref>, or when functioning of their frontal cortex is disrupted using transcranial magnetic stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Smittenaar et al., 2013)</ref>. On the other hand, people increase model-based control when the potential for reward is temporarily amplified <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Kool et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, individual differences in the mixture or weighting parameter (w) on the two-step task predict those measures from tasks that require executive functioning, such as the Stroop task <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Otto, Skatova, Madlon-Kay, &amp; Daw, 2015)</ref> and the CRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Don, Goldwater, Otto, &amp; Livesey, 2016)</ref>, and it also predicts steeper temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Shenhav, Rand, &amp; Greene, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We measured participants' degree of model-based control using both the Daw (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kool (2016)</ref> versions of the two-step task, applying each of these in two different framings. First, following prior research, we embedded (a non-moral version of) each task in a space travel cover story <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a,c)</ref>. In these tasks, participants chose between spaceships to travel to planets where they encountered aliens from whom they could earn points in the form of treasure pieces <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Decker, Otto, Daw, &amp; Hartley, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kool et al., 2016)</ref>. Second, we used versions of both two-step tasks that were embedded in a cover story with a moral dimension <ref type="figure">(Figure 2b,d)</ref>. In these tasks, participants chose between doors that transitioned to rooms where they pressed buttons that administered painful electric shocks of varying intensities to other people (hypothetically). In this task, each outcome was paired with an image of a human face with a proportional painful expression. For all of these studies, we used the dual-system RL model to measure participants' relative balance between model-free and model-based control (see Supplemental Text S1 in the online supplemental materials for more detail; scripts for all RL tasks available at:</p><p>https://github.com/wkool/shockgames).</p><p>Across these four studies, we re-contacted (after a few months) participants who had completed the four variants of two-step tasks for us in the past. Participants who responded to the follow-up were then asked to complete the moral dilemma task. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The transition structures of the four two-step tasks (Study 3b-e). We used two different task structures/paradigms (Daw and Kool, respectively) that were both framed in a non-moral and moral context. The non-moral versions of the tasks involved 'space travel', where participants choose spaceships to fly to planets with 'aliens' that offer an opportunity to win 'space treasure'. The moral versions of the tasks involved choosing between doors that lead to rooms with buttons that administered shocks to a hypothetical agent. In the Daw versions of the two-step task (a, b), each trial begins with a first stage choice between two options. Each first-stage choice has a high (70%) probability of transitioning to one of two second-stage states and a low (30%) probability of transitioning to the other. Each second-stage choice was associated with a probability of earning a certain outcome (between 0.25 and 0.75) that slowly drifted according to a random Gaussian walk (σ = 0.025). In the Kool versions of the two-step task (c, d), each trial begins in one of two first-stage states, each of which offers a choice between two options. Each choice triggers a deterministic transition to one of two second-stage states, which in turn are associated with a scalar outcome (between 0 and 3) that drifted according to a random Gaussian walk (σ = 2). For each of these tasks, model-free and model-based decision making can be dissociated, because the model-based system can use its representation of the transition structure to plan towards goals, whereas the model-free system relies on slower trial-and-error learning to inform choice. (e) Trial sequence in the non-moral version of the Kool two-step task. On this trial, the participant selects the turquoise spaceship, and therefore transitions to the red planet, where she earns 4 pieces of space treasure. (f) Trial sequence in the moral version of the Kool two-step task. On this trial, the participant opens the brown door, and transitions to the purple room, where the button press leads to a maximally painful shock for the hypothetical agent.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Collapsing across Studies 3a-3e, we observed the predicted positive correlation between the utilitarian parameter and measures of reasoning.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The dual-process model of morality maintains that utilitarian responding to sacrificial dilemmas requires reasoning to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and also to override an emotional aversion to harm . Thus, individuals with a greater ability to reason, or propensity for reasoning, are predicted to make utilitarian moral judgments more often in sacrificial dilemmas. Although some prior work has supported this prediction, other work has not. Overall, this literature has been hampered by both conceptual challenges (on account of not using the PD approach to index utilitarian inclinations) and methodological weaknesses. In the current work, we use a PD approach to properly assay utilitarian attitudes and overcome prior methodological limitations to show that better reasoning skills are indeed on average associated with a preference for utilitarian outcomes in sacrificial moral dilemmas. Across eight studies and a variety of selfreport, behavioral, and neuroanatomical measures, we find that reasoning ability and a tendency toward deliberative thinking are positively associated with a preference for utilitarian solutions, independent of individual differences in harm aversion.</p><p>In recent years psychologists have paid increasing attention to the importance of conducting rigorous, principled tests of influential theories (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Lai et al., 2014</ref> for a parallel approach in the domain of IAT interventions). Here, our approach has been to incorporate several different measures of reasoning drawn from diverse subfields of psychological research and employing a variety of methods. We have also used a large set of moral dilemmas, including both traditional sacrificial dilemmas and those developed for PD. Generalizing across these dimensions of variability, we find a consistent relationship between reasoning and utilitarian moral judgments. An important consequence of this finding is that researchers may now seek to better characterize the precise nature of this relationship with increased confidence that, in the most general sense, some important relationship exists. Although this series of studies provides an intriguing data set documenting the relative strength of the correlations between diverse measures of reasoning and utilitarian moral judgments, it was not designed to characterize a detailed pattern of associations (e.g., some specific correlations would be stronger than others), but instead to firmly establish the relationship's general form.</p><p>Our study does inform a contemporary debate over the cause of "utilitarianism" as a dimension of individual difference. Several studies convincingly argue that individuals with coldhearted attitudes towards others' wellbeing, psychopathic traits, and antisocial tendencies tend to favor utilitarian actions on moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bartels &amp; Pizarro, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Djeriouat &amp; Trémolière, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Duke &amp; Bègue, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Francis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gawronski et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Gleichgerrcht &amp; Young, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Kahane, Everett, Earp, Farias, &amp; Savulescu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Marshall, Watts, &amp; Lilienfeld, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">McDonald, Defever, &amp; Navarrete, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Park, Kappes, Rho, &amp; Van Bavel, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Patil, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Patil, Melsbach, Hennig-Fast, &amp; Silani, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Patil &amp; Silani, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Reynolds &amp; Conway, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Tassy, Deruelle, Mancini, Leistedt, &amp; Wicker, 2013)</ref>. This has been taken to mean that a "utilitarian" response on the moral dilemma is diagnostic of dark traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bartels &amp; Pizarro, 2011)</ref> rather than an impartial concern for the wellbeing of the actors involved in the dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kahane et al., 2015)</ref>. But the relevant studies have used a single index to represent moral judgments of moral dilemmas, which conflates disregard for deontic prohibitions and endorsement of utilitarian principles. Once utility maximization and harm avoidance concerns are separately assayed, however, individuals who perceive themselves to be more rational (as reported on questionnaires like the NFC, REI, and AOT) and who perform well on cognitively demanding behavioral tasks (e.g., two-step RL tasks, BB, and CRT) prefer utilitarian solutions to moral dilemmas because of their elevated concerns for maximizing utility, and not due to reduced concerns about harm avoidance. Moreover, other studies using the PD approach show that dark personality traits in fact predict reduced deontological inclinations (i.e., a reduced aversion to harm), not increased utilitarian inclinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Conway et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Conway, Reynolds, Celestin, &amp; Pizarro, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gawronski et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Reynolds &amp; Conway, 2018)</ref>. In sum, utilitarianism in moral dilemmas is not a "mismeasure of morals" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bartels &amp; Pizarro, 2011</ref>) -rather, it partially but meaningfully reflects concerns about achieving the greater good <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Greene, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Greene et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>In addition to these theoretical contributions, we have also demonstrated the utility of taking a multimodal approach of using self-report, performance, computational, and neural assessments of a construct. For the first time, we have explored the role of model-based control in utilitarian reasoning. Prior formal, computational frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Crockett, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Cushman, 2013)</ref> propose two systems: (i) a model-based, outcome-focused algorithm that forms value representations through an internally represented causal model of the world, selects actions based on the value assigned to their likely outcomes, and supports a utilitarian response, and (ii) a model-free, action-focused algorithm that assigns value to actions intrinsically based on their reinforcement history and supports deontological harm aversion. These accounts predict that individual differences in model-based control would be correlated with utilitarian judgments on sacrificial dilemmas, a prediction modestly supported by the data (Studies 3b-e). Importantly, the strength of this association was sensitive to the ecological context (the nature of the task, rewards, etc.) and this can be a starting point for future studies on this topic.</p><p>Although there is a large body of evidence to implicate the dlPFC in various aspects of domain-general reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Asplund et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Cieslik et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">MacDonald et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Menon &amp; Uddin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">E.

In the current study, we provided evidence for the first time for an association between individual differences in a neural measure (cortical thickness at dlPFC) and "utilitarian" judgments. Given that we are relying on reverse-inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Poldrack, 2006)</ref> to attribute a functional role (i.e. "deliberative reasoning") to dlPFC in the context of utilitarian moral judgment, we refrain from discussing the exact mechanistic pathway for how thicker cortex at dlPFC can lead to greater utilitarian inclinations (for our speculative proposal, see Supplemental materials (Text S5)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Scope</head><p>A notable limitation of this study is that, despite using several diverse measures of reasoning, we are not well-powered to determine whether some show greater relationships to utilitarian moral judgment than others. Future research will benefit from assessing the relationship between different, more specific components of reasoning (problem solving, counterfactual thinking, etc.) and utilitarian preferences. For example, a recent study replicated the correlation between measures of reflection and increased utilitarian choices on dilemma judgments, but also revealed that arithmetic reflection, such as performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test, predicts only utilitarian tendencies, whereas logical reflection, such as a test measuring ability to solve logical syllogisms, predicts both deontological and utilitarian tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Byrd &amp; Conway, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Relatedly, the precise mechanistic pathway that connects reasoning to utilitarianism remains unclear. Although we have argued that reasoning supports cost-benefit analysis, it is possible that better reasoners are also better at down-regulating their emotional response to harm. This is an important avenue to explore in future research.</p><p>Lastly, the present studies are purely correlational in nature and cannot speak about a causal relationship between these two variables. Future work can rigorously attempt to use either extraneous load manipulations or neurostimulation techniques to assess causal influence of deliberative reasoning in utilitarian inclinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>Dilemmas are interesting to study precisely because they are so difficult to resolve. Outside of the laboratory, people routinely face difficult decisions about when harm to few is an allowable path to benefitting many. Is it fair to take a toy from one toddler so it can be shared with the class?</p><p>Is it right to abort a fetus for the welfare of its mother? How many civilian deaths are permitted in order to win a just war?</p><p>Although no one thinks that descriptive facts about human moral psychology are sufficient to answer these difficult questions, many people find them informative <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Greene, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Kohlberg, 1971)</ref>. To the extent that ordinary people's utilitarian moral judgments arise from callous indifference to others' suffering, we might reasonably approach such judgments (and those who advance them) with skepticism by default <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bartels &amp; Pizarro, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Kahane, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, to the extent that they arise from deliberation about how to impartially minimize such suffering (consistent with our findings), less skepticism is warranted. Similarly, it has been influentially argued that reasoning plays no substantive role in moral judgment beyond post-hoc rationalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Haidt, 2001)</ref>. The possibility that reasoning is inert, and reasons post-hoc, holds significant implications for how we should approach moral disagreement and personal or societal moral improvement. Our finding that reasoning has an important and systematic role in resolving moral dilemmas is an important counterweight to this view, implying the possibility of moral change by rational thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hannikainen, Machery, &amp; Cushman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Pinker, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Pinker, , 2019</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The influential DPM of moral judgment makes a basic prediction about individual differences: those who reason more should tend to make more utilitarian moral judgments.
