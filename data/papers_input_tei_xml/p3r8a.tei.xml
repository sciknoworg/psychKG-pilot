				<p>A fundamental component of interacting with our environment is gathering and interpretation of sensory information. When investigating how perceptual information influences decision-making, most researchers have relied on manipulated or unnatural information as perceptual input, resulting in findings that may not generalize to real-world scenes. Unlike simplified, artificial stimuli, real-world scenes contain low-level regularities that are informative about the structural complexity, which the brain could exploit. In this study, participants performed an animal detection task on low, medium or high complexity scenes as determined by two biologically plausible natural scene statistics, contrast energy (CE) or spatial coherence (SC). In experiment 1, stimuli were sampled such that CE and SC both influenced scene complexity. Diffusion modeling showed that both the speed of information processing and the required evidence were affected by low-level scene complexity. Experiment 2a/b refined these observations by showing how isolated manipulation of SC resulted in weaker but comparable effects, whereas manipulation of only CE had no effect. Overall, performance was best for scenes with intermediate complexity. Our systematic definition quantifies how natural scene complexity interacts with decision-making. We speculate that CE and SC serve as an indication to adjust perceptual decision-making based on the complexity of the input.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>During decision-making, observers extract meaningful information from the sensory environment in a limited amount of time. In recent computational accounts of perceptual decision-making, sensory evidence for a decision option is integrated and accumulates over time until it reaches a certain boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . Across these computational accounts, the speed of evidence accumulation is thought to depend on the quality or strength of sensory information available (the drift rate, as formalized with the well-known drift diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> ).</p><p>In the current study, we aimed to investigate how decision-making processes are influenced by low-level image properties, diagnostic of scene complexity. While multiple studies have shown that specific image properties (such as spatial frequency, or stimulus strength) interact with decision-making, they manipulate visual information into "unnatural" stimuli. For example, we recently showed that image quality modulates response inhibition, and decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , by manipulating the spatial frequencies of images.</p><p>Ultimately, however, our goal is to understand how decision processes are influenced by information in natural scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</p><p>The scenes that we encounter in our everyday environment do not contain randomly sampled pixels, but adhere to specific low-level regularities called natural scene statistics .</p><p>Natural scene statistics have been demonstrated to carry diagnostic information about the visual environment: for example, slopes of spatial frequency spectra estimated across different spatial scales and orientations ('spectral signatures') are informative of scene category and spatial layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> . Similarly, the width and shape of histograms of local edge information estimated using single-and multi-scale non-oriented contrast filters have been shown to systematically differ with scene category and complexity <ref type="bibr">9-11 .</ref> Scene complexity reflected in local contrast distributions can be estimated using an early visual receptive field model that outputs two parameters, contrast energy (CE) and spatial coherence (SC), approximating the scale and shape of a Weibull fit to the local contrast distribution, respectively (see Supplementary section 1). CE and SC reflect different aspects of the local contrast distribution: CE approximates the scale parameter of the Weibull fit and reflects the average local contrast strength in an image. SC approximates the shape parameter of the Weibull fit and reflects to what degree the contrast distribution resembles a power law or Gaussian distribution. Cluttered or complex scenes, with high CE/SC values, have more Gaussian (bell-shaped) distributions compared to sparse or simple scenes with low CE/SC values (power-law shaped), that often contain one or a few salient objects <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>; adapted from Groen, Ghebreab, Prins, Lamme &amp; Scholte, 2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ).</p><p>Importantly, CE and SC are computed using a simple visual model that simulates neuronal responses in one of the earliest stages of visual processing. Specifically, they are derived by averaging the simulated population response of LGN-like contrast filters across the visual scene <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Similar to other models of representation in early vision (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> ), these two-parameters thus provide a compressed representation of a scene. In turn, they could serve as a complexity index that affects subsequent computations towards a task-relevant visual representation.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Groen et al. (2013)</ref>. SC (the approximation of the γ parameter of the Weibull function) describes the shape of the contrast distribution: it varies with the amount of scene fragmentation (scene clutter). CE (the approximation of the β parameter of the Weibull function) describes the scale of the contrast distribution: it varies with the distribution of local contrasts strengths. Four representative pictures are shown in each corner of the parameter space. Images that are highly structured (e.g., a street corner) are found on the left, whereas highly cluttered images (e.g., a forest) are on the right. Images with higher figure-ground separation (depth) are located on the top, whereas flat images are found at the bottom.</p><p>Here, we investigated whether task-irrelevant manipulations of SC and CE interact with perceptual decision-making by using the drift-diffusion model (DDM) . By considering response time distributions for both correct and incorrect choices, the DDM models the speed of evidence accumulation, as well as the amount of evidence required to make a decision. In experiment 1, stimuli were selected such that both CE and SC covaried with scene complexity, with increasing values representing more complex natural scenes. This is the 'natural situation', since SC and CE are typically correlated within our natural environment. To refine the observations in experiment 1, in experiment 2a and 2b, we also selected stimuli in such a way that the effects for both parameters could be evaluated separately. To investigate whether it is meaningful to differentiate between SC and CE, the two parameters were manipulated separately in experiments 2a (SC) and 2b (CE). For each condition, 80 animal and non-animal scenes were selected. B . Experimental paradigm. Participants categorized scenes based on the presence or absence of an animal. On half of the trials, participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible ("speed trials"), as indicated by a pre-cue. On the other half of the trials, participants had to respond as accurate as possible ("accurate trials"). C. Schematic representation of the Drift Diffusion Model. From a starting point z, information begins to accumulate in favor of one of the options with drift rate v until it reaches a boundary a, and the decision is made. Non-decision time T err captures the processes that are unrelated to decision-making, such as response execution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>In experiment 1, we investigated the combined influence of SC and CE on decision-making.</p><p>As SC and CE are generally highly correlated, varying them together provides the strongest manipulation of information. We expected the drift rate to decrease with increased scene complexity. Additionally, we expected a shift in the amount of evidence required, boundary, reflecting strategic adjustments to the complexity of the scene.  Groen et al., (2013) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , and selectively sampled scenes for three conditions: low, medium and high ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2A</ref>). Each condition contained 160 scenes, half of which contained an animal. Importantly, within conditions, animal and non-animal scenes were matched in CE</p><p>and SC values such that these two categories did not differ from each other in mean or median values (mean: all t(158) &lt; 1.14, all p &gt; 0.26, median: all z &lt; 1.08, all p &gt; 0.28).</p><p>Procedure .</p><p>Participants performed an animal/non-animal categorization task <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>). Scenes were presented in randomized sequence, for a duration of 100 ms. Between trials, a fixation-cross was presented with a semi-randomly duration (350, 400, 450, 500 or 550 ms), averaging to 450 ms. There were two trial instructions, that appeared on screen before every trial in randomly alternating blocks of 20 trials: on "speed trials", participants were asked to respond as fast as possible, whereas on "accuracy trials", they responded as accurately as they could. While instruction influences both the accuracy and duration of decisions, the ease of evidence accumulation (drift rate) should remain constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . Therefore, we aimed to specify how the processing of natural scenes can modulate decision-making processes when participants emphasize speed -and allow ample time for processing -or accuracy. Every scene was presented once for both instructions (960 trials in total). Keyboard buttons were switched halfway (based on a simultaneous EEG study). Comparing % errors in blocks before and after the switch did not indicate switch costs: M before = 0.13, SD = 0.15; M after = 0.16, SD = 0.11 , only taking participants into account for which the same instruction was repeated before and after the switch, averaged across experiments. On speed trials, participants received feedback on their response time ("on time" &lt; 500 ms &gt; "too slow"). On accuracy trials, participants were presented with "correct" and "incorrect" feedback. When participants didn't respond, "miss" appeared on screen. Participants were seated~90 cm from the monitor such that stimuli subtended~10x14°of visual angle. made fewer mistakes on medium scenes than on low SC/CE scenes, t(18) = 3.405, p = .003 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3C</ref>)</p><p>Relative to the null model, the model in which drift rate and response boundary were affected by SC and SC² provided the best fit (ΔDIC = -44.0, <ref type="figure">Figure 3D</ref>). Although the difference with the -less complex-model in which only drift rate was affected was small (ΔDIC = -42.6), we further evaluated the model with the lowest DIC.</p><p>Results indicated that the rate of evidence accumulation was related to the differences in SC and SC 2 (inverted U-shape; P &lt; 0.001). That is, low and high SC were associated with a decreased drift rate, as indicated by a negative shift in the posterior distribution. Increased SC values were additionally associated with a lowered response boundary ( P = 0.048), as the distribution shifted below zero (Figure 3E/F). We acknowledge that this effect should be interpreted with caution, given the small difference in DIC with the model in which only drift rate was allowed to vary and 4.8% of the distribution &gt; 0. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study systematically investigated the interaction between low-level statistics in natural scenes and perceptual decision-making processes. Results indicate that scene complexity, as indexed by two parameters (SC, CE), modulates perceptual decisions through the speed of information processing and evidence requirements. Experiment 2a/b refined these observations by showing how the isolated manipulation of SC alone results in weaker yet comparable effects, whereas the manipulation of CE has no effect. By using natural stimuli, we show that task performance was best on medium complex images. Overall, these results</p><p>show that very basic properties of our natural environment influence perceptual decision-making.</p><p>SC and CE together provide a compressed representation of scene complexity.</p><p>While CE captures information about the amount and strength of edges in a scene, SC indexes higher-order correlations between them, giving an indication of the amount of clutter.</p><p>In earlier work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Scholte et al. (2009)</ref> and Groen et al. (2013; 2016) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , differences in CE were shown to mainly influence the early part of the ERP, while SC effects arose later (up to 300 ms). In experiment 1, when SC and CE were both manipulated, model selection indicated a better fit when changes in drift rate and response boundary were related to SC.</p><p>Still, the strongest effects on decision-making were found when we manipulated SC and CE together. This could be explained by an inherent correlation between the parameters in the real world, as isolating the influence of both parameters separately could have led to an 'unnatural' sub-selection. For this reason, we cannot attribute our results from experiment 2 exclusively to the scene statistics.</p><p>From previous studies, using artificial manipulation of stimulus quality, one would expect performance decreases for more complex scenes. For instance, the search slope of reaction times increases with the number of distractors in conjunction search <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> and degrading stimulus quality (via spatial filtering) reduces the rate of evidence accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</p><p>Intuitively 'low' SC scenes are easiest: those scenes are sparser and typically contain the most distinct figure-ground segmentation. Surprisingly, our results suggest a more complex pattern. In experiment 1 and 2a, performance was better on 'medium' than on 'low' scenes.</p><p>Responses to natural scenes are often hard to predict from studies using artificial stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> because the scenes do not contain simple isolated patterns. But why would scenes with medium SC/CE be processed more efficiently? We outline a number of possible reasons below.</p><p>First, it could be that scenes with medium complexity are most commonly encountered in daily life, and that the visual system has become tuned to the statistical regularities of medium scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , resulting in optimized visual processing. Secondly, it could be the degree to which object context facilitates the recognition process. In natural scenes, objects appearing in a familiar background are detected more accurately and quickly than objects in an unexpected environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> . Here, most of the 'low' scenes contained little context because the backgrounds were, generally, homogeneous, providing no 'cues'</p><p>about animal presence or absence. For 'high' images, on the other hand, there may have been too much distraction by spatially unorganized clutter, which does not offer useful cues for animal detection. Third, SC and CE could be related to certain object properties, such as animal size or centrality (the location of the animal in the scene). Additional HDDM analyses however indicated that SC contributed to perceptual decision-making independent of object size, whereas object centrality had no effects <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Supplementary Figures S1, S2 and S3</ref>).</p><p>Finally, SC/CE could be used as diagnostic information, serving as a building block towards estimating other relevant properties in a scene (e.g. scene clutter, naturalness).</p><p>Since SC correlates with naturalness ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and, animals are potentially more strongly associated with natural environments, SC could be a diagnostic feature for the animal/non-animal discrimination task. Indeed, post-hoc evaluation of the responses in experiment 1 and 2a indicated a bias towards one of the response options (animal or non-animal), depending on the SC value of the scene. However, the pattern of errors, evaluated for animal and non-animal trials separately, was only partly consistent with a naturalness bias ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Supplementary Figures S4 and S5)</ref>. Additional modelling to assess whether SC biases the response (towards animal or non-animal) by changes in the starting point did not converge, indicating that the increased likelihood to respond 'animal' with increasing SC was not captured or well explained by a change in the starting point. Results from the current study suggest that participants require more evidence for sparse scenes (low SC), compared to complex scenes (high SC; see <ref type="figure">Figure 3F</ref>). In an animal detection paradigm, this could be reflected in the number of "animal" responses, indicating a decreased likelihood of responding "yes I detected the animal" for simple scenes, rather than being dependent on image naturalness or the likelihood of animal presence. To evaluate these hypotheses, future experiments should manipulate SC processing and expectation simultaneously by, for example, including trials in which the type of information to be received is cued (e.g., SC low/high or animal probability) prior to the actual stimulus presentation.</p><p>Crouzet &amp; Serre (2011) have shown that low-level image properties such as SC and CE can relate to human performance in an animal detection task. When they trained a classifier to distinguish between animal/non-animal images based on the Weibull parameters ( and ), classification performance was above chance, but relatively poor compared to alternative models which included more complex visual features, including oriented contrast (V1-like features) and combinations of oriented linear filter responses (mid-level and higher level features). Moreover, the least animal-like stimuli corresponded to more complex backgrounds, while our analyses of response bias (see Supplementary section 2) suggest the opposite pattern. This suggests that the relation between SC, naturalness and animal detection is not trivial and can vary with stimulus set or image database. Here, we carefully selected images to capture a broad range of CE and SC values, and ensured that animal presence was balanced within each condition. Therefore we believe that the current study is a more sensitive test of effects of low-level contrast statistics on perceptual discrimination than previous post-hoc assessments.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study provides clear evidence that SC and CE influence perceptual decision-making in an animal detection task. We propose that, because SC and CE could be plausibly computed in early stages of visual processing, they could indicate the need for more cautious or elaborate processing by providing the system with a global measure of scene complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Future studies should pinpoint whether this effect is based on the computation of SC and CE directly, as a general measure of complexity, or indirectly, as diagnostic information to estimate other task-relevant scene properties. Given that the rate of evidence accumulation depends on the complexity of the scene, this complexity-dependent adaptation could be reflected in the amount of evidence that is considered sufficient for generating a response. This adaptation, or flexible processing, can help to calibrate the decision process to maximize the goal at hand (e.g. to be accurate or quick).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A subselection of stimuli plotted against their CE and SC values.</figDesc></figure>

Task performance was best for medium SC/CE images.Experiment key question is whether the effects found in experiment 1 are driven by the two scene statistics together, as they are generally highly correlated in our natural environment, or whether one of them is the primary cause, as suggested by the SC preference in our optimal HDDM model. To refine our interpretation, we systematically manipulated SC while keepingCE constant (experiment 2a) and vice versa (experiment 2b). Experimental procedure and analyses occurred as in experiment 1, except where otherwise indicated. Methods Participants. Twenty-four participants (4 males; aged 18-28 years, M = 21.8, SD = 2.7) participated in experiment 2a; Twenty-seven participants (7 males; aged 18-27 years, M = 21.4, SD = 2.5) participated in experiment 2b. All participants gave written informed consent prior to participation and were rewarded with research credits or monetary compensation. The ethics committee of the University of Amsterdam approved the experiment, and all experimental protocols and methods described below were carried out in accordance with the guidelines and regulations. Stimuli. A new selection of 480 scenes was composed from the same image set as in experiment 1, except that each condition was now defined by either its SC (experiment 2a) or its CE (experiment 2b) values while the other was kept constant at intermediate values (Figure 2A). Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model. In experiment 2a we established that, next to varying response boundary across trial type (ΔDIC = −3426 compared to fixed), varying both parameters across SC was justified to account for the data. This fit produced lower DIC values compared to a fit in which the drift rate (ΔDIC = −70.5), response boundary (ΔDIC = −60.3) or both (ΔDIC = −27.8) were fixed across complexity. Next, we evaluated five regression models to assess the trial-by-trial relationship between scene complexity (indexed solely by SC), and drift rate and response boundary. For experiment 2b model selection indicated that a model in which, apart from varying response boundary across trial type, the parameters were fixed across CE best explained the observed data. This fit produced lower DIC values compared to a fit in which the drift rate (ΔDIC = −44.7), response boundary (ΔDIC = −76.7) or both (ΔDIC = −48.5) were allowed to vary across complexity.Thus, variability in CE alone seems to have no influence on the speed of evidence accumulation or the amount of information required to make a decision. As such, further regression analyses were not justified.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>We fitted a hierarchical version of the DDM (HDDM<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> ) using the RT distributions of correct and incorrect responses. HDDM uses a hierarchical Bayesian estimation, that uses MCMC sampling to estimate the joint posterior distribution of all model parameters, and has been described as method of preference in estimating drift rates for a small number of observations (in the order of 100-20)<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . HDDM assumes that during decision-making, information begins to accumulate from a starting point z, in favor of one of the options with drift rate v until it reaches a boundary a , and the decision is made. Non-decision time T err captures the processes that are unrelated to the decision-making, such as response execution. (Figure 2C).First, we evaluated five models in which drift rate ( v ) and boundary ( a ) were either fixed or varied across trial type (speed, accurate) and/or scene complexity (low, medium, high). Using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) for model selection we established that, next to varying response boundary across trial type (ΔDIC = −3404 compared to fixed), varying both parameters across scene complexity was justified to account for the data 23 . This fit produced lower DIC values compared to a fit in which the drift rate (ΔDIC = −133.3), response boundary (ΔDIC = −40.4) or both (ΔDIC = −68.1) were fixed across complexity. Then, to assess the trial-by-trial relationship between scene complexity and drift rate (v) and boundary separation (a) , we fitted eighteen alternative regression models. Both linear models (SC/CE centered around zero), and second-order polynomial models (quadratic)were fitted to examine whether the relationship was curvilinear (e.g. followed an inverted U-shape). We never included both scene statistics simultaneously, as their high correlation leads to multicollinearity and unstable coefficient estimates. To take into account the effect of task instruction on the response boundary a , we estimated two intercepts for this parameter (speed and accuracy) using the depends_on key argument. For each model, we ran four separate chains with 20,000 samples. The first 7500 samples were discarded (burn) and every 10th sample (thin) was concatenated, resulting in a trace of 5000 samples. Models were tested for convergence using visual inspection of the group level chains and the Gelman-Rubin statistic, which compares the intra-chain variance of the model to the intra-chain variance of the different runs. It was checked that all group-level parameters had an Rhat between 0.98-1.02. For the best fitting model (lowest DIC), we ran posterior predictive checks by averaging 500 simulations generated from the model's posterior to confirm it could reliably reproduce patterns in the observed data. Bayesian hypothesis testing was performed on the group-level posterior densities for means of parameters. The probability measure P was obtained by calculating the percentage of the posterior &lt; 0.</figDesc><table /><note>Images were presented at eye-level on a 23-inch Asus LCD display (sRGB, 2.27 gamma, 1.31 dE) with a spatial resolution of 1080*1920 pixels, at a refresh rate of 60Hz, using Presentation (version 17.0, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc.). The ambient illumination in the room was kept constant across different participants.Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model.Results Data from one participant were excluded for excessive errors (&gt;23%, 2.8 SD &gt; mean). RTs &lt;100 ms were considered "fast guesses" and removed. The repeated-measures ANOVA on RT (on correct trials) revealed main effects of both instruction (speed, accurate) and scene complexity (low, medium, high), but no interaction effect, F(36) = 0.261, p &gt; 0.77. Similarly, the repeated-measures ANOVA on error rates revealed main effects but no interaction effect, F(36) = 0.177, p &gt; 0.83. As expected, responses were faster and less accurate when given a "speed" instruction, in comparison to "accurate". Because there was no interaction, RTs and error rates were collapsed over speed and accurate trials to further understand how scene complexity modulates decision-making. Bonferroni correction was used for all comparisons.A repeated-measures ANOVA, with factor scene complexity differentiated RTs across the three conditions, F(2,36) = 19.81, p &lt; .001, η 2par = .524 (Figure 3A/B). Participants responded slower for high (complex) scenes than for medium-, t(18) = -7.293, p &lt; .001, and low scenes, t(18) = -3.914, p = .001. There was also a main effect on error rates, F(2, 36) = 14.26, p &lt; .001, η 2par = .442. Participants made more errors for high scenes than for medium, t(18) = -4.493, p &lt; .001, and low scenes, t(18) = -2.752, p = .013. Remarkably, participants</note></figure>
