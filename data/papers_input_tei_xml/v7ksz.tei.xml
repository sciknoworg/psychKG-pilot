			<abstract>
				<p>Discrimination can occur when people fail to focus on outcome-relevant information and incorporate irrelevant demographic information into decision-making. The magnitude of discrimination then depends on 1) how many errors are made in judgment and 2) the degree to which errors disproportionately favor one group over another. As a result, discrimination can be reduced through two routes: reducing noise-lessening the total number of errors but not changing the proportion of remaining errors that favor one group-or reducing bias-lessening the proportion of errors that favor one group but not changing the total number of errors made. Eight studies (N = 7,921) investigate how noise and bias rely on distinct psychological mechanisms and are influenced by different interventions. Interventions that removed demographic information not only eliminated bias, but also reduced noise (Studies 1a-1b). Interventions that either decreased (Studies 2a-2c) or increased (Study 3) the time available to evaluators impacted noise but not bias, as did interventions altering motivation to process outcome-relevant information (Study 4). Conversely, an intervention asking participants to avoid favoring a certain group impacted bias but not noise (Study 5). Finally, a novel intervention that both asked participants to avoid favoring a certain group and required them to take more time when making judgments impacted bias and noise simultaneously (Study 5). Efforts to reduce discrimination will be well-served by understanding how interventions impact bias, noise, or both.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reducing Discrimination: A Bias Versus Noise Perspective</head><p>Conceptualizing, measuring, and reducing discrimination has been a continual focus of social psychological research, and for good reason. Discrimination on the basis of characteristics like race, ethnicity, or gender has been at the center of political issues ranging from disproportionate police use of force against Black Americans in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cobb, 2016)</ref>, hiring discrimination against women in the sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Moss-Racusin, Dovidio, Brescoll, Graham, &amp; Handelsman, 2012)</ref>, and housing discrimination against Muslims and Roma across Europe <ref type="bibr">(EU-MIDIS, 2017)</ref>. Here, we consider discrimination as behavioral differences in treatment based on group membership. While stereotypes (mental associations between groups and characteristics) and prejudices (affective associations about groups; Fiske, 1998) are some of the mental inputs that contribute to discrimination, discrimination is the actual output for creating and maintaining real-world disparities in group outcomes.</p><p>Discrimination can take many forms. Often, discrimination is structural: existing rules, norms, or institutions preclude certain groups from access to the same rights or opportunities as other groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Green, 2003)</ref>. Here, discrimination can arise even if individual decision-makers do not incorporate demographic information into judgment (e.g., racial discrimination in college admissions as a result of minority applicants being disproportionately likely to attend lowerfunded high schools and therefore achieving weaker standardized test scores). But in many other cases, discrimination occurs when demographic information is actively used in evaluation. This form of discrimination is evident when certain groups are disproportionately likely to receive positive outcomes than other groups, all else equal. Field-based audit studies, which seek to manipulate only targets' demographic information, have consistently shown such discrimination based on information like race or gender. For instance, when trained actors bargained for the same model of car at the same dealership and followed the same script, White bargainers were offered greater discounts than Black bargainers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ayres &amp; Siegelman, 1995)</ref>. Studies using similar methods have found that consequential judgments like those concerning admissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Milkman, Akinola &amp; Chugh, 2012)</ref>, hiring <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Neumark, 1996)</ref>, housing <ref type="bibr">(Ross &amp; Turner, 2003)</ref> or lending <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ross &amp; Yinger, 2002)</ref> are impacted by targets' demographic information.</p><p>Decisions in these domains are usually not simple, and frequently require considering multiple pieces of information to determine an appropriate response. For example, an admissions officer must decide if an applicant deserves to be accepted by integrating relevant criteria (e.g., GPA, extracurriculars, standardized test scores), while ignoring ostensibly irrelevant demographic information. These two aspects of the decision-making context --the use of multiple pieces of relevant information and the presence of demographic information-complicate judgment. For one, synthesizing across multiple relevant criteria is not straightforward. The admissions officer must weigh information that varies considerably on dimensions like scale (test scores vs. GPA) and format (e.g., recommendation letter versus personal essay). One consequence of this need to integrate across relevant criteria is that clear decision rules (e.g., only accepting applicants with very strong recommendation letters) are impossible or exceptionally difficult to create.</p><p>Indeed, prior research finds that synthesizing across multiple criteria creates ambiguity in determining an appropriate response, leading evaluators to use more heuristic thinking to simplify the decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dhami, 2003)</ref>. Rather than trying to maximize performance, decision-makers who must synthesize multiple criteria rely on "fast and frugal" strategies that balance the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dhami &amp; Ayton, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dhami &amp; Harries, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Luan, Schooler &amp; Gigerenzer, 2011)</ref>. That is, individuals consider outcome-relevant criteria until they arrive at an internal threshold where they feel comfortable making a decision. This threshold allows for "good enough" performance, where decisionmakers are willing to accept the presence of errors in evaluation if they determine that the added benefit of increased accuracy is not worth the extra effort needed to achieve it. For instance, admissions officers will review each application long enough to get a general impression of whether the applicant deserves to be admitted or rejected, but not so long as to be unable to move through the large number of applications efficiently. The end result is that the admission officer will settle on a decision-making strategy that allows for satisfactory but far from perfect performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Martignon, Katsikopoulos &amp; Woike, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The presence of demographic information also alters the decision-making process. Most obviously, demographic information creates the opportunity for discrimination. The likelihood of discrimination is only further increased by the ambiguity created from having to integrate across multiple outcome-relevant criteria, as evaluators may incorporate demographic information into judgment when the correct decision is unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dovidio &amp; Gaertner, 2000)</ref>. In addition, the presence of demographic information can directly reduce attention to outcome-relevant criteria, specifically when demographic information is not diagnostic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Feingold, 1992)</ref>. Prior research has found that evaluators often falsely incorporate non-diagnostic information into judgment, and do so at the expense of using more diagnostic information (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Castellan, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Troutman &amp; Shanteau, 1977)</ref>. For instance, admissions officers may use demographic information like race or gender when forming an evaluation of an applicant, and doing so may lessen the attention paid to relevant criteria like grades. As a result, the presence of irrelevant demographic information not only allows for discrimination to be possible, but it can detract from attention that would have been otherwise given to parsing outcome-relevant information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using Signal Detection Theory to Understand Discrimination</head><p>In many contexts, decision-makers are susceptible to errors in judgment due to a) difficulty in correctly integrating across multiple criteria, and b) use of non-diagnostic demographic information. In this work, we apply signal detection theory (SDT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref> to illustrate how these two influences can be used to understand the impact of discrimination, following previous research using SDT to explore other phenomena in social psychology like stereotyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Park &amp; Banaji, 2000)</ref> or dyadic relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Xu &amp; Shrout, 2018)</ref> Much of SDT's application in psychological research centers on how people make decisions under uncertainty. In these cases, evaluators must work to detect underlying populations in the presence of distracting information. For example, the college admissions officer strives to identify the worthy versus the unworthy applicants, and must do so using information that is difficult to parse accurately (e.g., deciding whether a glowing reference letter compensates for low grades).</p><p>An SDT approach to decision-making considers the degree of noise and bias in judgment.</p><p>Noise refers to how well individuals perform at differentiating between the underlying populations in evaluation; less noise indicates that an individual has done a better job of detecting the signal (e.g., a superior job of admitting the more qualified applicants and rejecting the less qualified applicants). For analyses, we investigate the level of noise in judgment by calculating sensitivity, which is the degree to which an evaluator lacks noise; more sensitivity indicates less noise.</p><p>Bias, at least when applied to discrimination, is the extent to which a certain response is more likely for one group relative to another. For instance, a racially biased admissions officer may be more likely to accept White versus Black applicants. For analyses, we investigate the presence of bias by calculating criterion--the degree to which a particular response is more likely--separately for targets from different demographic groups. Bias is then evident when criterion differs between targets from different demographic groups. Greater differences in criterion mean more bias. In much of the psychological literature, bias has been used synonymously with discrimination to indicate socially-based favoritism in behavior or treatment.</p><p>Here, bias refers to the more specific outcome of group-level differences in response criterion.</p><p>Sensitivity and criterion are conceptually distinct; knowing one tells us very little about the other. For instance, evaluators can have the same level of criterion but differ in sensitivity.</p><p>One admissions officer may be better than another at identifying the best-qualified applicants (greater sensitivity), but the two admissions officers could have the same levels of criterion if they falsely admit the same proportion of less-qualified applicants (i.e., when errors are made, both officers are equally more likely to commit errors of falsely accepting less qualified applicants than falsely rejecting more qualified applicants). Conversely, individuals can have the same level of sensitivity but differ in criterion. For instance, two admissions officers may be equally capable at identifying the more qualified applicants, but one admissions officer may be more likely to make errors that falsely admit less-qualified applicants (low criterion for giving an "accept" response) while another more likely to make errors that falsely reject more-qualified applicants (high criterion).</p><p>In these conditions, the amount of discrimination can be conceptualized by considering the number and type of errors made when evaluating members of different demographic groups.</p><p>Specifically, the magnitude of discrimination can be determined by the degree to which the evaluation process simultaneously produces noise (i.e., high versus low sensitivity) and bias (i.e., large versus small differences in criterion between targets belonging to different demographic groups). As a result, the magnitude of discrimination can change even if one of these factors remains constant; for example, discrimination can increase when more errors are made in evaluation (i.e., there is greater noise) even if bias (the rate at which those errors favor one group over another) does not change. Below, we provide a more specific example concerning how these two factors provide distinct pathways for reducing discrimination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reducing Discrimination via Bias or Noise: A Test Case</head><p>Consider a tech company concerned about gender discrimination in hiring. In a simplified example, suppose the company recently reviewed 100 applicants (50 male, 50 female) for 50 intern positions. Each applicant was presented with outcome-relevant information (e.g., coding experience, educational background) and gender information through a name on the resume. It is the organization's job to integrate across the relevant information to arrive at an overall evaluation of each applicant. In this simplified example, we assume that 50 applicants are more qualified (based on whatever weighting of outcome-relevant information) and should be hired, whereas 50 applicants are less qualified and should be rejected. Finally, suppose that of the 50 more qualified applicants, half are male and half female, and the same is true of the 50 less qualified applicants. In other words, gender is non-diagnostic; knowing an applicant's gender tells you nothing about whether they should be hired or rejected.</p><p>Given that hiring decisions should be based on outcome-relevant information, the treatment of each applicant can be coded as either "correct" (hiring a more qualified applicant or rejecting a less qualified applicant) or "incorrect" (hiring a less qualified applicant or rejecting a more qualified applicant). Note that, from the applicant's perspective, one type of error results in a beneficial outcome (being hired when less qualified) and another type of error results in a detrimental outcome (not being hired when more qualified).</p><p>In this case, gender discrimination can only occur when two factors are present: 1) the existence of errors (or noise) in the selection process and 2) an unequal distribution of errors (or bias), such that one group is more likely to receive "beneficial errors" and another group relatively more likely to receive "detrimental errors." For example, imagine if the company has 60% accuracy for the 50 applicants from each gender (30 correct decisions, 20 errors). However, the types of errors are not distributed evenly. For men, 75% of the errors are beneficial (15 less qualified men incorrectly hired) and 25% are detrimental (5 more qualified men incorrectly rejected). For women, the reverse is true; 25% of errors are beneficial (5 less qualified women incorrectly hired) and 75% of errors are detrimental (15 more qualified women incorrectly rejected). In this case, the distribution of hires and rejections would be: Though men and women did not differ in overall qualifications, the combination of noise and bias resulted in discrimination, such that 60% of the hires were men.</p><p>How could the company reduce discrimination? One way is to make evaluators more accurate (i.e., reduce noise). Suppose an intervention helped the organization become considerably better at parsing an applicant's outcome-relevant information, such as by identifying what criteria were actually most related to job success and more actively stressing those criteria when selecting interns. Imagine that this intervention increased accuracy for male and female applicants from 60% to 92%. However, the intervention did not impact bias; 75% of remaining errors towards men were still beneficial and 75% of errors towards women were still detrimental. The distribution of hires and rejections would then be: Raising accuracy from 60% to 92% reduced noise and as a result reduced discrimination. Male applicants were still slightly overrepresented in the percentage of hires (52%) versus female applicants (48%), but the size of the gender gap was cut by 80%.</p><p>Another way to reduce discrimination is to lessen bias. Suppose a different intervention had no impact on accuracy (60%), but helped participants be more vigilant about gender bias, such as by warning evaluators to be on guard about possible gender-based favoritism in their judgments. The result of the intervention was that now only 55% of the errors towards men were beneficial and 45% of the errors towards women were beneficial. The distribution of hires and rejections would then be: Altering the distribution of errors lessened bias and also reduced discrimination, such that again male applicants constituted only slightly more hires (52%) than female applicants (48%). This approach to reducing discrimination accomplished the same outcome as reducing noise but through different means. Whereas the noise reduction approach worked by reducing the number of errors made, the bias reduction approach worked by changing the type of errors made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relations Between Bias and Noise</head><p>It is tempting to think that noise and bias in social judgment rely on similar processes.</p><p>The mechanisms behind how many errors are made in evaluation are potentially quite related to how those errors are distributed between groups. Indeed, attending to relevant information is almost synonymous with ignoring irrelevant information in everyday language. And yet, bias and noise are empirically independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref>. Knowing the amount of noise in judgment tells us almost nothing about the amount of bias. Given the analytical independence between noise and bias, the present work explores the possibility that the levels of noise and bias in judgment are determined by two distinct psychological processes; specifically, that the degree of noise in judgment is related to use of outcome-relevant information, whereas the degree of bias is related to use of irrelevant demographic information.</p><p>Knowing whether interventions effectively reduce discrimination via changes in bias versus noise has great practical and theoretical value. When judgments have a large amount of noise (i.e., difficult to distinguish between underlying populations) but bias is weak (i.e., relatively small differences in errors favoring one group over another), it may be easier to reduce discrimination by reducing noise rather than bias. For instance, evaluations of research grant proposals are notoriously noisy, with one analysis finding that the median single-rater reliability of grant quality was .33 <ref type="bibr">(Cicchetti, 1991)</ref>. Though the magnitude of bias is unknown, evaluations of research grants may exhibit racial discrimination, as a correlational analysis found that African American investigators were 13% less likely to receive NIH funding compared to</p><p>Whites <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ginther et al., 2011)</ref>. In noisy judgment contexts like grant evaluations, racial discrimination may then be more effectively reduced from interventions that seek to reduce noise (for instance, providing more detailed instructions on scoring of proposal weaknesses; <ref type="bibr">Sattler, McNight, Naney &amp; Mathis, 2015)</ref> than interventions that seek to reduce bias, such as by asking reviewers to directly guard against any possible race-based favoritism in their evaluations.</p><p>Unfortunately, prior research has often relied on outcome measures unable to distinguish between the relative impact of bias and noise in discrimination (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bertrand &amp; Mullainathan, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bodenhausen, Kramer &amp; Susser, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Uhlmann &amp; Cohen, 2005)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bohnet, van Geen and Bazerman (2015)</ref> examined the impact of a single evaluation (i.e., viewing partners one at a time) versus joint evaluation (i.e., viewing pairs of partners, one male and one female) judgment context on gender discrimination in choosing partners for a hypothetical academic competition. Participants had to select one partner from a pool of options, and partners were presented with relevant information (past academic performance) and ostensibly irrelevant demographic information (gender).</p><p>When participants completed the task in conditions of single evaluation, they were more likely to select male partners, even though more qualified female partners were available. When participants completed the task in conditions of joint evaluation, participants showed no genderbased discrimination. However, in this case, it's unclear whether joint evaluation reduced gender-based discrimination through greater attention to the relevant, academic information (reduced noise), or through greater ability to disregard the irrelevant gender information (reduced bias), or through both processes simultaneously. Understanding the relative contribution of bias and noise in discrimination requires measures that can distinguish them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Work</head><p>Using a novel task, we investigate whether different interventions impact the magnitude of discrimination in social judgment either by altering the degree of noise or bias. This work differs from past investigations using similar outcome measures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Axt, Casola &amp; Nosek, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Axt, Ebersole &amp; Nosek, 2016;</ref> by distinguishing between noise and bias as distinct routes for reducing discrimination. For example,  investigated the necessary components required for interventions to effectively reduce criterion bias. They found that interventions needed to specifically mention the social category on which targets differed (i.e., physical attractiveness) compared to using more general information (i.e., warning participants that targets will differ on "irrelevant characteristics"). While such work advances our understanding of what is needed for certain interventions to effectively reduce criterion bias, the present work examines a broader issue of how advances in reducing the magnitude of discrimination can be achieved by lowering bias, noise, or both.</p><p>Here, we focus on two primary determinants of bias or noise in evaluation: 1) an ability to change the behavior most responsible for bias or noise, and 2) a motivation to do so. These two forces--ability and motivation--have been consistently highlighted as necessary in models of behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Wilson &amp; Brekke, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wegener &amp; Petty, 1996)</ref>, associations between attitudes and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fazio, 1990)</ref>, and prejudice regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Monteith, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burns, Monteith &amp; Parker, 2017)</ref>. So long as people hold some level of ability and motivation to reduce noise or bias in judgment, then interventions targeting one of these factors should be effective at changing the relevant behavior (e.g., assuming people have any motivation to decrease the degree of noise in their evaluations, then increasing their ability to do so will result in less noise).</p><p>Across eight studies using a range of outcomes, social groups, and manipulations, we apply signal detection analyses to differentiate between bias and noise in discriminatory behavior. In Studies 1a and 1b, participants completed a judgment task either with or without the presence of irrelevant demographic information, and found that the presence of demographic information increased bias and noise. In the remaining studies, we tested whether various interventions differentially impact the degree of noise versus bias in judgment. Interventions that targeted one's ability or motivation to process outcome-relevant information --such as by imposing time pressure (Studies 2a-2c), requiring delays in response (Study 3), or instilling greater motivation to engage in heuristic versus systematic thinking (Study 4)--impacted noise but not bias. Conversely, an intervention that alerted participants to the social dimension responsible for favoritism in judgment impacted bias but not noise (Study 5). Finally, an intervention impacted bias and noise simultaneously by both alerting participants to the social dimension responsible for favoritism and requiring a delay in responding (Study 5). Together, these results suggest that bias and noise are distinct components of discriminatory behavior, and that the magnitude of discrimination can be reduced by targeting either or both outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 1a and 1b</head><p>Studies 1a-1b tested several of the basic assumptions concerning how individuals form judgments when integrating across multiple pieces of information in the presence of nondiagnostic demographic information. Specifically, Studies 1a and 1b examine whether 1) people make decision-making errors even when no irrelevant information is provided, 2) when irrelevant demographic information is available, errors are increased (either by reduced attention to outcome-relevant criteria or increased attention to demographic information), and 3) demographic information introduces bias by making certain types of errors more likely for some social groups than others.</p><p>Participants in these studies completed a version of the Judgment Bias Task (JBT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Axt, Nguyen &amp; Nosek, 2018)</ref>, which is designed to measure discrimination in social judgment. In this version of the JBT, participants evaluated applicants for an honor society based on relevant academic qualifications (GPA, recommendation letters, etc.). Participants either completed a 'blinded' JBT, where applicants were only shown with academic qualifications, or a JBT where applicants were also shown with social information known to influence judgment: physical attractiveness (Study 1a) or political affiliation (Study 1b). JBT performance was analyzed both in terms of overall noise (i.e., sensitivity) and bias (i.e., differences in criterion based on social group membership).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>For all studies, participants came from the Project Implicit research pool (implicit.harvard.edu; <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nosek, 2005</ref> all studies can be found at https://osf.io/brg76/.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants completed the JBT, followed by measures of perceived performance, desired performance, explicit preferences and implicit associations.</p><p>Academic Judgment Bias Task. In both studies, participants completed an academic Judgment Bias Task (JBT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Axt, Nguyen &amp; Nosek, 2018)</ref>. Participants received instructions that they would be making accept or reject decisions for applicants to a hypothetical academic honor society. Each application contained four pieces of information (Science GPA, Humanities GPA,</p><p>Letter of recommendation quality, and interview score; see Appendix A), and participants were instructed to weight each piece of information equally. Qualifications were manipulated to create two levels of applicant quality so that there were "correct" and "incorrect" decisions. Half of the applications were scored to be equally less qualified, and half were scored to be equally more qualified (see , Study 1a for scoring details). The JBT consisted of 64 unique profiles, and participants were instructed to accept approximately half of the applicants. Before making their accept and reject decisions, participants first viewed each application one at a time for one second each during an encoding phase.</p><p>In both studies, participants in the Blind condition saw only the applications with no additional information. In Study 1a, participants in the Unblind condition viewed the same applications with a face that was pre-rated as either more or less physically attractive (d = 2.64; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Axt, Nguyen &amp; Nosek, 2018)</ref>. There were equal numbers of males and females within each level of physical attractiveness. In Study 1b, participants in the Unblind condition viewed applications paired with an image indicating political affiliation (a donkey logo for Democrat and an elephant logo for Republicans). In both Unblind conditions, the more and less qualified applications were split evenly among more and less physically attractive people or Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>In Study 1a, participants in the Unblind condition were randomly assigned to one of 16 orders. Across orders, each face was equally likely to be assigned to a more or less qualified application. In Study 1b, participants in the Unblind condition were randomly assigned to one of 12 orders, with each application being equally likely to be described as a Democrat or Republican across orders.</p><p>Performance, explicit attitude and identity measures. Following the JBT, participants</p><p>in Unblind conditions completed two items assessing perceived and desired task performance.</p><p>Participants first reported their perceived performance for treating applicants from the study's two social groups (e.g., -3= "I was extremely easier on less physically attractive applicants and tougher on more physically attractive applicants", +3' "I was extremely easier on more physically attractive applicants and tougher on less physically attractive applicants"), followed by their desired performance (e.g., -3= "I wanted to be extremely easier on Republican applicants and tougher on Democrat applicants", +3= "I wanted to be extremely easier on Democrat applicants and tougher on Republican applicants").</p><p>Participants in both studies also reported their explicit preferences for the study's two social groups (e.g., in Study 1a, -3= "I strongly prefer less physically attractive people to more physically attractive people", +3= "I strongly prefer more physically attractive people to less physically attractive people").</p><p>Finally, participants in Study 1b reported their political identification (Democrat, Republican, Independent, Libertarian, Green, Other, Do not know). If participants selected an option other than Democrat or Republican, they then answered a forced-choice item asking them which of the two parties they would identify with if they had to. To maximize power, we grouped participants as Democrats or Republicans if they selected that party on either item,</p><p>given prior work that such participants behave similarly in political judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hawkins &amp; Nosek, 2012)</ref>. For Study 1b, data were also analyzed by whether applicants were from the same or opposing political party to maximize power.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Participants who completed an evaluation task in the presence of non-diagnostic demographic information made more errors (i.e., more noise and lower sensitivity). These errors were also biased (i.e., differences between social groups in response criterion), such that some groups were more likely to receive beneficial treatment than others (more physically attractive people in Study 1a and political ingroup members in Study 1b). On average, across the 64 total judgments, removing demographic information in Study 1a led to 2.7 fewer errors (i.e., the number of qualified applicants incorrectly rejected or less qualified applicants incorrectly accepted) and 1.7 fewer errors in Study 1b.</p><p>These results shed light on how individuals use outcome-relevant information and irrelevant demographic information in judgment. First, though noise was lower in Blind conditions, that did not mean performance was without error (Study 1a Blind error rate = 30.5%, Study 1b Blind error rate = 29.4%). The JBT is designed for applicants to systematically differ in qualification level based on only four pieces of relevant information, and it is conceivable for participants to "crack the code" behind the JBT's scoring and achieve 100% accuracy. However, this did not happen even when demographic information was removed. Rather, participants appeared to parse the outcome-relevant information so that they could achieve above-chance accuracy without spending too much time to do so. This suggests that some level of noise may be due to an inability or unwillingness to further parse outcome-relevant information.</p><p>That said, the presence of non-diagnostic demographic information increased noise. If participants did not incorporate the demographic information into judgment, there would have been no differences in sensitivity between Blind and Unblind conditions. Instead, the lower sensitivity in Unblind conditions suggests that the presence of demographic information increased noise by reducing attention to academic information in judgment, enabling the use of demographic information, or both.</p><p>Finally, bias was evident when demographic information was available. Participants were more likely to give members of more favored groups beneficial treatment (i.e., acceptance to the academic honor society) than members of less favored groups. The presence of irrelevant demographic information increased errors, but not in a way that simply made all errors equally more likely. Rather, the presence of demographic information increased errors in favor of preferred social groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Altering Noise versus Bias in Social Judgment</head><p>Studies 1a-1b illustrate how the presence of demographic information can increase noise and create bias in social judgment. In the remaining studies, we examine whether interventions differentially influence noise versus bias. Specifically, we test how noise changes due to the motivation or ability to process outcome-relevant information (Studies 2a-4), and how bias changes due to the motivation or ability to avoid processing irrelevant demographic information (Study 5).</p><p>Time is a straightforward determinant of the ability to process outcome-relevant information. Many studies have found that optimal performance on judgment tasks decreases as time pressure increases (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ariely &amp; Zakay, 2001</ref>). Decreasing the amount of time available to evaluators has been shown to be especially detrimental for judgments that rely on integrating across multiple pieces of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Rothstein, 1986)</ref>, and such time pressure is particularly effective at limiting the processing of outcome-relevant information (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Keinan, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">McDaniel, 1990)</ref>. In Studies 2a-2c, we examine the impact of added time pressure on both bias and noise in social judgment. Conversely, imposing time delays in judgment by requiring people to consider their judgments longer than they normally would has been found to increase accuracy and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Moulton, Regehr, Mylopoulos &amp; Macrae, 2007)</ref>, and in Study 3 we test the effect of requiring delays in responses. We would expect the amount of noise in decisionmaking to increase when people are placed under time pressure and decrease when people are compelled to take longer than normal to decide.</p><p>In Study 4, we examine how increasing reliance on systematic versus heuristic thinking affects noise and bias in social judgment. Motivation to process outcome-relevant information can be manipulated through inducing systematic versus heuristic thinking <ref type="bibr">(Chaiken, 1980)</ref>. For judgments that demand some deliberation, such as those requiring integration across multiple pieces of information, a more intuitive, heuristic mindset should be associated with increased noise while a more deliberate, systematic mindset associated with decreased noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kruglanski &amp; Gigerenzer, 2011)</ref>. Indeed, past work has found that engaging in more critical thinking can lead to more accurate evaluation. For instance, participants placed in a mindset of more systematic thinking (by recalling a situation in which careful reasoning was helpful) showed more empathic accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ma-Kellams &amp; Lerner, 2016)</ref>. Other research involving more complex judgments (e.g., predicting financial performance of corporate bonds) has similarly found that accuracy increases with more deliberate processing, such as through heightening feelings of accountability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ashton, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, efforts to increase one's ability or motivation to limit favoritism based on demographic information should reduce bias. In many contexts, heightening motivation to avoid favoritism in social judgment may be difficult to implement, as many people already report a strong desire to be unbiased. For instance, in , 86.6% of participants completing a JBT reported not wanting to favor applicants based on physical attractiveness, and 84.5%</p><p>reported not wanting to favor applications based on political affiliation. Manipulations that increase motivation to be unbiased may then be more effective for groups where individuals normally believe discrimination is acceptable (e.g., drunk drivers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Crandall, Eshleman &amp; O'Brien, 2002)</ref>. However, in contexts where motivation to be unbiased is high, reductions in bias should still follow from increasing ability to regulate the influence of demographic information on judgment. In Study 5, we test one method for doing so by drawing attention to the social dimension responsible for biased judgment <ref type="bibr">(Pronin &amp; Krugler, 2006)</ref>. Alerting people to the presence of socially-based favoritism may allow them to effectively monitor their behavior, increasing control over bias in judgment and creating greater alignment with existing motivations to be unbiased.</p><p>Notably, interventions that increase ability to regulate bias need not translate into reduced noise (i.e., fewer errors) if bias is reduced through overcorrection <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dunton &amp; Fazio, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sommers &amp; Kassim, 2001</ref>). For instance, in <ref type="bibr">Study 1)</ref>, participants completed the same attractiveness JBT as in Study 1a. Some participants were told beforehand that they would likely favor more physically attractive applicants and they should avoid doing so. Relative to a control condition, this manipulation reduced bias (i.e., relative differences in criterion for more versus less physically attractive applicants; d = .33), but a re-analysis found the manipulation had no reliable impact on noise (i.e., overall sensitivity on the JBT; d = .01).</p><p>Participants simply became more likely to reject all physically attractive applicants and accept all less physically attractive applicants, regardless of actual qualifications. The end result was that the manipulation reduced discrimination, perhaps by increasing the ability to counteract bias based on demographic information, but the level of noise in judgment was unchanged. In Study 5, we use a similar manipulation that warned participants of a potential for favoritism towards more attractive people in social judgment, and examined whether the manipulation impacted bias but not noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 2a-2c</head><p>In Studies 2a-2c, we tested how noise and bias in social judgment are influenced by the amount of time available to complete judgment. Past research strongly suggests that time pressure should increase errors, thereby decreasing sensitivity and increasing noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ariely &amp; Zakay, 2001)</ref>. It is less clear whether time pressure would impact bias (i.e., relative differences in criterion between social groups).</p><p>To consider how time pressure would impact bias, imagine a participant completing an attractiveness JBT without time pressure. When evaluating more physically attractive people, the participant makes two "detrimental" errors (falsely rejecting a qualified applicant) and four "beneficial" errors (falsely accepting a less qualified applicant). Suppose also that the reverse happens when evaluating less physically attractive people--four detrimental errors and two beneficial errors. In this case, 66% (4/6) of the errors towards more attractive people are beneficial compared to 33% (2/6) of the errors towards less attractive people, suggesting a strong bias favoring more physically attractive people. Now, imagine that this participant completed the same attractiveness JBT but did so with time pressure. How would the results change? One possibility is that time pressure causes the participant to make additional errors, but those errors are evenly distributed across all error types, which would create a reduction in attractiveness bias. If time pressure caused 12 additional random errors on top of the errors that one would normally make, that would mean 55% (10/18) of the errors would be beneficial for more attractive people and 45% (8/18) of the errors would be beneficial for less attractive people. The introduction of evenly distriuted errors would reduce the disparity in beneficial errors from 33% with no time pressure to 10% with time pressure.</p><p>A second possibility from research on automaticity and biased judgment suggests that time pressure causes people to rely more on social heuristics to guide decision-decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gilbert &amp; Hixon, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fazio, 1990)</ref>. In that scenario, time pressure would increase reliance on physical attractiveness in decision-making, causing the participant to make additional errors that are skewed in favor of physically attractive participants. In other words, time pressure would increase attractiveness bias.</p><p>A final possibility is that time pressure will have no impact on bias. This would occur if time pressure increased the total number of errors, but these errors accrued in the same proportion as when evaluation occurred without time pressure. As time pressure reduces the ability to deliberate, such results would suggest that the mental processes underlying bias are automatic and do not depend on much deliberation. Drawing from the prior example, time pressure may still triple the amount of errors, but these errors could be distributed in the same proportion as in conditions without time pressure (e.g., 18 errors towards more attractive people, with six detrimental errors and twelve beneficial errors, such that 66% of errors are still beneficial). In this case, the same degree of bias in social judgment would simply operate across a greater number of errors.</p><p>To examine the impact of time pressure on noise and bias, we experimentally manipulated the amount of time that participants had to make judgments in Studies 2a-2c. We investigated this question across two judgment tasks. In Study 2a, participants completed a First-Person Shooter Task (FPST; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Correll, Park, Judd &amp; Wittenbrink., 2002)</ref>, which required making 'Shoot' or 'Don't Shoot' decisions when viewing Black and White targets holding either guns or benign objects. Typical results find that participants exhibit a racial bias in judgment, with a lower criterion to give a "shoot" response for Black versus White targets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Correll et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Correll, Park, Judd &amp; Wittenbrink, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mendoza, Gollwitzer &amp; Amodio, 2010)</ref>.

In Study 2c, participants in the Timed condition completed the task with a 1500-millisecond response window. In Timed conditions, a message to "please respond faster" appeared after any trial timeout.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Studies 2b-2c conceptually replicated Study 2a's results using a different outcome measure, social groups, and timing constraints. We found that time pressure on the JBT increased the magnitude of discrimination based on physical attractiveness through increased noise (lower sensitivity). Specifically, time pressure increased discrimination by raising the number of errors made in judgment (Untimed: Study 2b = 20.9 errors, Study 2c = 21.7 errors;</p><p>Timed: Study 2b = 24.9 errors, Study 2c = 25.9 errors). However, time pressure had no impact on bias (relative differences in criterion between more and less physically attractive applicants), as all conditions showed comparable levels of lower criterion for more versus less physically attractive people. When less qualified applicants were incorrectly admitted, the rate at which errors occurred for more versus less physically attractive people did not differ strongly across conditions (Untimed: Study 2b = 54.2%, Study 2c = 54.5%; Timed: Study 2b = 53.2%, Study 2c = 53.6%). When more qualified applicants were incorrectly rejected, the rate at which these errors occurred for more versus less physically attractive people also did not differ strongly across conditions either (Untimed: Study 2b = 54.0%, Study 2c = 54.1%; Timed: Study 2b = 54.1%, Study 2c = 54.5%).</p><p>Across Studies 2a-2c, time pressure did not strengthen the degree to which demographic information impacted the distribution of errors in judgment. Time pressure did not result in greater bias by increasing reliance on demographic information in judgment, nor did it create less bias by simply making all types of errors equally more likely. Rather, time pressure increased the probability of making errors in judgment, meaning time pressure caused the same propensity for bias to be expressed across a greater number of errors. These results suggest that manipulations like time pressure, which reduce individuals' ability to parse outcome-relevant information, are much more related to processes that determine the level of noise versus the level of bias in social judgment. These findings appear to be inconsistent with research on automaticity and biased judgment suggesting biases will increase with time pressure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gilbert &amp; Hixon, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fazio, 1990</ref>). We explore this apparent inconsistency in more detail in the General Discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Study 3 investigated how requiring participants to deliberate impacts the degree of bias and noise in evaluation. Participants completed an attractiveness JBT either at their own pace, or completed a writing task about why deliberating was important and then could only respond after a 4500-millisecond delay. 4 While this manipulation is essentially the reverse of the time pressure manipulation used in Studies 2a-2c, it is possible that requiring a delay in response may produce different results. For one, mandatory response delays may have no impact on noise or bias if participants are unable or unwilling to use the added time effectively (i.e., through greater consideration of outcome-relevant criteria). Conversely, delayed responses could even translate into decreased noise and decreased bias if participants use the additional time to both better parse the outcome-relevant criteria and to counteract the influence of the biasing demographic information. Delayed responses could even increase bias if greater time led to the deliberate rationalization of biased reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kunda, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rand et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, requiring delayed responses could have a similar (though opposing) effect as time pressure if added time reduces errors, but remaining errors continue to favor more over less physically attractive applicants at the same proportion as when judgments are made with no required delay. Such results would suggest that required delays in responding can be used effectively by participants to reduce errors in judgment, but the benefits of such delays are limited to processes determining noise rather than bias.</p></div>

Participants completed a modified version of the JBT used in Studies 2b-2c.

Participants were warned ahead of time about the required delay in responding. In addition, participants in the Delay condition completed a short writing exercise before the JBT where they listed two reasons why thinking hard about one's decisions was important when completing the admissions task (see Appendix C). Exploratory analyses of how responses to the writing exercise related to JBT performance suggest that the manipulations' effects were driven by the time delay in responding, so our interpretation focuses on the impact of the time delay. 6</p><p>5 Study 3 used a p-critical design <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sagarin, Ambler &amp; Lee, 2014)</ref>.

Given that participants possess at least some ability to effectively parse the relevant criteria (as seen in above-chance levels of accuracy), motivation to process such information should moderate the level of noise in judgment. Heuristic thinking, which is associated with less cognitive scrutiny, should lead to more noise, while systematic thinking, which is associated with greater analysis of judgment-relevant information, should lead to less noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chen, Duckworth &amp; Chaiken, 1999)</ref>.

In addition, Study 4 investigated whether individual differences in thinking styles predict the degree of noise and bias in social judgment.

These measures may add correlational evidence concerning how thinking styles are associated with noise and bias in social judgment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Inducing systematic or heuristic thinking changed the amount of discrimination based on physical attractiveness. Participants who engaged in more heuristic thinking showed faster JBT responses and more noise (lower sensitivity). Participants who engaged in more systematic thinking showed slower JBT responses and less noise (higher sensitivity). In other words, the Study 4 manipulations impacted discrimination by making errors more or less likely (Heuristic = 21.4 errors, Control = 20.8 errors; Systematic = 19.8 errors). However, neither manipulation impacted bias, as all conditions showed comparable levels of a lower criterion for more versus less physically attractive applicants. That is, conditions did not vary in the rate at which errors of falsely admitting less qualified applicants occurred for more versus less physically attractive people (Heuristic = 53.8%; Control = 53.0%; Systematic = 53.7%), or in the rate at which errors of falsely rejecting more qualified applicants occurred for less versus more physically attractive people (Heuristic = 52.7%; Control = 53.3%; Systematic = 51.2%). Study 4 results are then similar to those of Studies 2a-3, which directly manipulated the time available for participants to respond.</p><p>Providing participants with greater motivation to process outcome-relevant information decreased noise, resulting in fewer errors, but had no impact on the proportion of those errors that favored one social group over another. That said, while the heuristic and systematic thinking manipulations led to changes in participants' reaction times and overall accuracy, Study 4 failed <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We also tested for interactions between experimental condition (with Control coded as the reference) and faith in intuition and need for cognition on overall sensitivity. There was no reliable interaction for faith in intuition (B =-.10, t = -.66, p = .507), or for need for cognition (B =.21, t = -1.42, p = .155).</p><p>to include a measure that allowed for a direct test of changes in participant motivation (e.g., a self-report item assessing desire to evaluate applicants accurately and based solely on their objective academic criteria). As a result, it's possible that the Study 4 manipulation impacted an outcome other than motivation. For instance, participants may have used the manipulation to create a self-imposed response deadline to either speed up in the heuristic condition or slow down in the systematic condition, a process that could have created changes in task sensitivity but not individual motivation per se. A goal of future work should be to include more straightforward measures of motivation when using this same manipulation, as well as to test whether other manipulations more closely tied to changes in motivation produce similar effects (e.g., incentivizing accurate performance).</p><p>Correlational analyses in Study 4 found weak but reliable associations between JBT sensitivity and faith in intuition as well as need for cognition, such that faith in intuition was negatively and need for cognition was positively associated with greater sensitivity. These small but reliable effects suggest that while the constructs of need for cognition and faith in intuition may be generally related to one's capacity or motivation to process outcome-relevant information in judgment, performance on this JBT specifically may be quite domain-specific (e.g., more related to faith in intuition about evaluating honor society applicants or in using physical attractiveness).</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, bias (relative differences in criterion) was also reliably and weakly correlated with need for cognition and faith in intuition, such that faith in intuition was positively and need for cognition was negatively associated with greater bias. In our pre-registration, we anticipated the possibility that these individual difference measures would be associated with both noise and bias. For example, perhaps participants high in need for cognition may spend more time parsing the relevant academic criteria (leading to a positive association with sensitivity) and also be less impacted by irrelevant social information when making errors (leading to a negative association with bias). These measures do not appear to assess processes distinctly associated with noise or bias in social judgment, an issue we return to in the General Discussion.</p><p>Studies 2a-4 provide strong evidence that the psychological processes dictating the degree of noise in social judgment differ from those dictating the degree of bias. Specifically, noise appears to be most tied to participants' ability and motivation to process outcome-relevant information, whereas these factors are less related or even unrelated in determining the level of bias in social judgment. Conversely, bias may be most tied to participants' ability or motivation to avoid the influence of irrelevant demographic information (e.g., giving participants greater ability to control bias in decision-making by alerting them to the demographic information likely to influence judgment). Study 5 tested this idea directly by investigating whether an intervention warning participants to the social dimension responsible for creating favoritism in evaluation, and asking them to avoid such favoritism, would impact bias, noise, or both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5</head><p>The interventions used in Studies 2a-4 impacted noise but had no effect on bias, which raises the question of what interventions impact bias. A separate line of research also using the JBT  has identified several interventions that reduce bias (i.e., relative differences in criterion). Four interventions --warning about the potential for biased judgment, committing to objective behavior beforehand, heightening accountability, or creating implementation intentions --all reduced bias on the JBT (all p's &lt; .003, all d's &gt; .17 <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr">Axt &amp; Nosek, 2018, Study 1)</ref>, provided that each intervention told participants that applicants would differ on a specific social dimension (here, physical attractiveness).</p><p>While the studies in  were focused specifically on what is needed for interventions to reduce criterion bias, a re-analysis of the Study 1 data found that none of these interventions impacted noise relative to a Control condition (i.e., sensitivity; all p's &gt; .112, all d's &lt; .09). In these cases, interventions allowed participants to counteract favoritism towards more physically attractive applicants, but doing so led to overcorrection--participants were now more stringent on all more physically attractive applicants and more lenient on all less physically attractive applicants, regardless of actual qualifications. The end result was a reduction in bias but no overall change in noise.</p><p>In Study 5, we sought to replicate and extend the findings of  by using one intervention previously found to reduce criterion bias (alerting participants to the social dimension responsible for favoritism in judgment) and directly testing whether this intervention, unlike those used in Studies 3-4, impacted bias but not noise. These results would provide further support for the claim that different psychological processes impact the degree of bias versus noise in judgment.</p><p>In addition, we tested whether interventions can be combined to impact bias and noise simultaneously by including a condition where participants were both alerted to a tendency to favor more physically attractive people and had a required delay in responding. If effective, this intervention would demonstrate one means to increase accuracy and fairness simultaneously.</p><p>However, it is possible that simply combining interventions will be ineffective if participants' attention becomes overly divided and the effectiveness of each individual intervention is reduced or eliminated (e.g., people can easily follow directions to rub their stomach or pat their heads, but have a hard time completing both tasks simultaneously). It is also possible that, in a combined intervention, participants could attend to only one component of the intervention, leaving the other component ineffective. Finally, combining interventions could fundamentally alter how each individual intervention operates--for instance, when alerted to a tendency to favor physically attractive people, participants may use the mandatory delay in responding to only further counteract the influence of attractiveness and not to better attend to the outcome-relevant criteria necessary for decreasing noise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Whereas the interventions used in Studies 2-4 impacted noise but not bias, the bias warning intervention used in Study 5 had the reverse effect of impacting bias but not noise. Both of the experimental interventions used in Study 5 reduced discrimination, but did so through different routes. Warning participants of a tendency to favor more physically attractive people reduced the rate at which errors of falsely accepting less qualified applicants occurred towards more versus less attractive people (Control = 52.9%, Bias Warning = 50.1%, Bias Warning + Delay = 50.5%) and the rate at which errors of falsely rejecting more qualified applicants occurred towards less versus more attractive people (Control = 52.4%, Bias Warning = 50.4%, Bias Warning + Delay = 49.4%). However, only requiring a response delay led to reliably fewer errors (Control = 21.0 errors, Bias Warning = 20.5 errors, Bias Warning + Delay = 20.0 errors).</p><p>The effectiveness of this bias warning manipulation replicates past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Axt, Casola &amp; Nosek, 2018)</ref>, but more specifically illustrates how alerting participants beforehand to a tendency to favor more physically attractive people reduces discrimination. The bias warning intervention reduced discrimination not by changing how many errors were made but instead by changing the distribution of errors such that more and less physically attractive people were equally likely to receive beneficial versus detrimental treatment. Moreover, Study 5 extends these prior studies by revealing how participants exposed to this same bias warning manipulation that were also required to wait 4.5 seconds before responding showed both reduced bias and reduced noise (i.e., greater sensitivity). These results confirm that it is possible for a "single" intervention to simultaneously lessen noise and bias, as reductions in bias did not come at the price of overcorrection.</p><p>It is notable that, in Study 5, interventions warning about favoritism towards physically attractive people were strong enough to eliminate rather than merely reduce the criterion bias in evaluation (and therefore eliminate discrimination based on physical attractiveness). These data, coupled with other uses of this same bias warning manipulation that also eliminated criterion biases favoring more attractive applicants on the JBT ; Studies 1 and 3), provide promising evidence of a particularly impactful intervention for reducing discrimination in social judgment. However, it is worth pointing out that the straightforward bias warning manipulation used in Study 5 may not produce comparable effects in more socially sensitive dimensions like race or gender, where participants could either dismiss the possibility that they may be biased or exert even higher levels of motivation to be unbiased. Though other work has used a similar manipulation to reduce political ingroup biases in judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Axt, Casola &amp; Nosek, 2018)</ref>, it will be important for future studies to test whether such interventions extend to other social dimensions. Finally, it remains unclear whether the relatively minimal bias warning used here would effectively reduce discrimination outside of a judgment context immediately following the manipulation; for more durable and generalizable changes in behavior, it will likely be necessary to include stronger and more immersive interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bezrukova, Spell, Perry, &amp; Jehn, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Forscher et al., 2017</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We investigated two distinct outcomes in determining the magnitude of discrimination in social judgment: noise--the overall number of errors made in evaluation--and bias--the degree to which errors favor one group over another. Using a judgment task that had objectively correct or incorrect answers, Studies 1a-1b found that the presence of non-diagnostic social information not only created bias in the distribution of errors but also increased the total number of errors made, revealing how such social information is actively incorporated into judgment at the expense of greater use of more outcome-relevant criteria. These studies provide the first experimental evidence that removing irrelevant social information from decision-making not only eliminates the possibility for bias but also improves the accuracy of evaluation, lending further support for the practice of "blinding" applications, resumes, or other means of evaluation when possible and appropriate <ref type="bibr">(Gouldin &amp; Rouse, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">c.f. Doleac &amp; Hansen, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In Studies 2a-5, the degree of bias and noise in judgment was differentially impacted by various interventions. Just as motivation and ability are key determinants of the strength of attitude-behavior correspondence <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fazio &amp; Olson, 2003)</ref>, they may also dictate the magnitude of noise and bias in social judgment. Specifically, manipulations that altered participants' ability or motivation to process outcome-relevant information changed the degree of noise but not bias.</p><p>Conversely, a manipulation that potentially increased participants ability and motivation to monitor the impact of irrelevant social information, by warning them of an influence on judgment that they may have otherwise failed to noticed or taken seriously, reduced bias but not noise. Finally, an intervention that both increased the time available to process outcome-relevant information and alerted decision-makers to the influence of irrelevant social information reduced both bias and noise, revealing that interventions can change both outcomes simultaneously.</p><p>This work provides additional evidence that warning participants of their potential biases can occasionally reduce those same biases in judgment <ref type="bibr">(Golding, Fowler, Long, &amp; Latta, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pope, Price &amp; Wolfers, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pronin &amp; Krugler, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schul, 1993)</ref>. In addition, the effectiveness of the bias warning manipulation used in Study 5 lends support to various diversity interventions that have all alerted participants to their own prejudices in efforts to reduce biased behavior or increase egalitarian motivations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Carnes et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Devine et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Forscher et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pietri et al., 2016)</ref>. The present results suggest that part of the power of these interventions is in making errors more evenly distributed in judgment contexts (i.e., reducing bias). Finally, our results align with a more recent investigation finding that discrimination can be lessened by simply increasing the accuracy of the decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chang &amp; Cikara, 2018)</ref>. At the same time, the present work extends these prior investigations by illustrating how warnings about potential bias can lead to reductions in the relative likelihood of certain groups receiving favorable treatment without influencing the amount of people receiving unfair treatment. Similarly, increasing the accuracy of the decision-making can reduce the amount of people receiving unfair treatment yet preserve the relative degree of favoritism for some groups over others when errors do occur.</p><p>Using a relatively novel measure of social judgment allowed for a more nuanced investigation into the impact of these previously strategies to reduce bias or discrimination. Our results highlights the need for additional measures of discrimination that lend themselves to a signal detection analysis, where behavior can be evaluated in terms of bias and noise. Many prior investigations of interventions seeking to reduce discrimination have used outcomes that leave it ambiguous as to whether such interventions are effective via changes in noise and/or bias (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bohnet, van Geen, &amp; Bazerman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Uhlmann &amp; Cohen, 2005)</ref>. As many existing measures of discriminatory behavior lack validation and suffer from low reliability <ref type="bibr">(Carlsson &amp; Agerström, 2016)</ref>, greater empirical and theoretical progress on research into discrimination will come from the use of validated measures that allow for more nuanced analyses like those presented here <ref type="bibr">(Greenwald, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>

It is certainly plausible that there is a correlation between the likelihood of making errors in general and the likelihood of those errors revealing more favorable treatment for some groups over others (e.g., participants more motivated to favor a certain group may also be less motivated to attend to the relevant qualifications when completing their judgments).</p><p>Indeed, bias and noise may share some overlapping causes. A meta-analysis across studies found a small, negative correlation between the criterion bias difference score and overall sensitivity (r = -.131, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.168, -.094]</ref>; see online supplement for results from each study).</p><p>This negative correlation indicates that participants who were more prone to making errors on the JBT or the FPST (i.e., lower sensitivity and higher noise) were also more likely to have those errors disproportionately favor one group over another (i.e., greater differences in criterion between social groups), though this relationship was relatively weak.</p><p>Study 4 results provide additional evidence for a conceptual link between bias and noise, and shed some light on the psychological constructs that may be dually associated with the two outcomes. Greater need for cognition was associated with decreased criterion bias and increased sensitivity, while greater faith in intuition was associated with increased criterion bias and decreased sensitivity. These data align with prior work that finds a consistent relationship between thinking styles and psychological processes like stereotyping (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kearney, Gebert &amp; Voelpel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schaller, Boyd, Yohannes &amp; O'Brien, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trent &amp; King, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, Studies 2b-2c provide preliminary evidence that more social motivations, such as the desire to avoid prejudice, are also jointly related to the degree of bias and noise in judgment. Participants completed an adapted versions of the internal motivation to avoid prejudice (IMS; Plant and Devine, 1999) scale as well as an attractiveness JBT. Across studies, greater IMS was weakly but negatively related with criterion bias (r = -.085, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.128, -.042]</ref>) and positively related with overall sensitivity (r = .122, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.080, .165]</ref>).</p><p>Though effects were again small, they extend past studies investigating behavioral outcomes associated with motivation to control prejudiced reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amodio, Harmon-Jones &amp; Devine, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Payne, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gonsalkorale, Sherman, Allen, Klauer &amp; Amodio, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Measures of thinking styles did not solely predict outcomes more associated with attending to relevant information (i.e., sensitivity), and measures of motivation to control biased responses did not solely predict outcomes more associated with ignoring irrelevant information (i.e., criterion bias). Rather, bias and noise were at least weakly associated with individual differences in both social and cognitive processes. Future research on this topic should continue to explore how and when individual differences in desires to be accurate versus desires to control one's social biases independently and jointly contribute to the magnitude of discrimination. In addition, individual differences in other psychological processes may also be related to both bias and noise, such as executive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ito et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Payne, 2005)</ref> or chronic egalitarianism <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Moskowitz &amp; Li, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, these results suggest that bias and noise are distinct but related. The manipulations within these studies consistently affected one without the other, and the correlational relationship between the two was consistently weak. However, the apparent association between the two is an encouraging sign for those seeking to design interventions that impact both bias and noise simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Automaticity and Cognitive Resources in Bias</head><p>Some of the more striking data from the present work come from Studies 2a-2c, where added time pressure strongly increased the level of noise in social judgment but had no reliable impact on bias in criterion. These results appear to conflict with prior perspectives that suggest processes like stereotypes and prejudice are partly automatic and are therefore exacerbated when cognitive resources are constrained. Indeed, several prior studies have found that social biases-either in judgment, attitudes, or perceptions--are heightened when cognitive resources are low.</p><p>For example, participants asked to remember an eight-digit number during a learning task then showed greater retention of stereotype-consistent than stereotype-inconsistent information relative to control participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Sherman, Lee, Bessenoff &amp; Frost, 1998)</ref>. Participants receiving the same or similar manipulations also showed increased activation of race-related stereotypes on a word-fragment completion task <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gilbert &amp; Hixon, 1991)</ref>, or exhibited less contextual sensitivity in a measure of person perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gilbert, Pelham &amp; Krull, 1988)</ref>. Given these earlier studies, one possible expectation is that participants completing the FPST or JBT in contexts where cognitive resources are limited, such as in the deadline conditions in Studies 2a-2c, should show greater activation of relevant stereotypes concerning race or attractiveness, which would lead to greater favoritism in judgment and increased bias in criterion.</p><p>At the same time, studies using outcomes and manipulations similar to those in the current work have failed to find that greater depletion or fewer cognitive resources impacts bias in criterion. For instance, completing a prolonged Stroop task (to induce feelings of depletion) produced more errors in a Weapons Identification Task but no changes on the level of bias in criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Govorun &amp; Payne, 2006)</ref>. In a more striking demonstration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Correll, Wittenbrink, Crawford and Sadler (2015)</ref> used a modified FPST where participants provided two responses on each trial. The first response had to occur within the 630 milliseconds that the target appeared onscreen. After the target disappeared, participants provided a second response where they could take as long as needed. Follow-up responses produced fewer errors and greater sensitivity than the initial speeded responses, but relative biases in criterion (i.e., a lower threshold to indicate shooting for Black versus White targets) did not reliably differ between the two response formats. These results closely mirror those of Studies 2a-2c in that increasing capacity to process outcome-relevant information did not translate into reduced biases in criterion.</p><p>Some of the discrepancies between the current work and past research suggesting that bias is partly automatic may be attributed to an inability for past social cognition research to distinguish between noise and bias in group-based disparities. Our approach separates the two by considering bias to be a proportional outcome--the relative likelihood of committing certain types of errors for some groups versus others. One consequence of using a proportional outcome is that some manipulations, like added time pressure, can raise the absolute value of these relative differences in the types of errors committed for some groups over others, but signal detection analyses will find no changes in bias if those errors accrue at the same rate as when judgments are made under less or no time pressure.</p><p>For example, the time pressure manipulations of Studies 2b-2c resulted in a larger number of more attractive applicants receiving beneficial treatment and less attractive applicants receiving detrimental treatment, but this effect could be attributed to a general increase in errors rather than a greater rate of favoring more over less attractive applicants when errors did occur.</p><p>This distinction is obscured in many prior studies that used outcomes lacking objectively correct answers to distinguish bias from noise (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gilbert &amp; Hixon, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gilbert, Pelham &amp; Krull, 1988)</ref>. In studies of social judgment that used outcomes lacking a correct response, conceptions of "bias" were closer to our use of discrimination-favoritism in treatment for one social group over another (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bodenhausen, Kramer &amp; Susser, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Norton, Vandello &amp; Darley, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The signal detection framework applied here and in recent studies help clarify the role of cognitive resources in social judgment and the degree to which social judgment is impacted by automatic processes. Cognitive resources do not appear to moderate the relative strength at which social biases impact judgments when errors are made; rather, fewer cognitive resources leads to more errors in general, and discrimination is increased when the same degree of bias operates over a larger number of errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preferences for Interventions that Reduce Bias versus Noise</head><p>One practical reaction to the distinction between bias versus noise may be whether interventions that lessen discrimination by reducing bias are any "better" or "worse" than interventions that lessen discrimination by reducing noise. One approach--reducing noise-minimizes the amount of people who receive unfair treatment but preserves the unequal dispersion of that unfair treatment across demographic groups. The other approach--reducing bias--preserves the amount of people who receive unfair treatment but reduces the degree to which that unfair treatment is more likely to impact one social group versus another.</p><p>We think the more effective approach depends on the situation. For instance, in outcomes where criteria are more straightforward and errors are highly costly (e.g., falsely shooting people who pose no threat of violence), improving sensitivity (i.e., lessening the total number of people who are unnecessarily shot) may be more beneficial than reducing bias based on targets' demographic information. Conversely, in outcomes where the criteria associated with improved accuracy are hard to determine and errors are relatively less costly, it may be more practical to lessen discrimination by targeting a reduction in bias. For instance, it is difficult to establish objective criteria for what constitutes an effective instructor; individuals may rightly weight various criteria differently--e.g., clarity of presentation, speed of receiving feedback, transparency in evaluation. In such cases, creating interventions that improve sensitivity (i.e., reducing the amount of worthy instructors who receive negative evaluations and the amount of unworthy instructors who receive positive evaluations), may be quite difficult. Instead, efforts to reduce discrimination in these contexts, like in addressing gender disparities in teaching evaluations <ref type="bibr">(Mengel, Sauermann &amp; Zolitz, 2018)</ref>, may be better served by focusing on reducing bias, such as in directly warning students to avoid using gender in their evaluations.</p><p>In many cases, it is not necessary to choose between the two approaches at all. It is often most effective to pursue both approaches simultaneously, as we have shown in Study 5. For example, hiring managers could enforce standardized criteria in evaluating job candidates to reduce noise and provide warnings to avoid using demographic information to reduce bias.</p><p>Employing both approaches in concert may lead to greater reductions in discrimination than using either approach in isolation.</p><p>Regardless of effectiveness, people may have preferences for what approaches should be used in everyday life. From an initial investigation, we suspect that lay preferences for how to reduce discrimination will be context-dependent and shift based on factors like the type of decisions being made and the social groups receiving the unfair treatment. We asked a sample of Americans (N = 1519) to read one of three vignettes that detailed various forms of discrimination. Each vignette described an organization seeking to address discrimination--a company trying to reduce favoritism towards more physically attractive candidates in hiring, a university math department trying to reduce preference for male applicants in graduate admissions, or a police department trying to reduce racial disparities in shooting unarmed suspects. Participants were told that the organization needed to choose between two training sessions that would reduce this discrimination. One training session would lessen bias--no overall change in the number of errors made, but a more equal distribution of errors across social groups. The other would essentially lessen noise--reduce the overall number of errors made, but some groups would still be more likely to receive unequal treatment. Participants then chose which training program should be implemented.</p><p>We found that preferences for training programs depended on the context. 52.1% of participants chose the bias-lessening program over the noise-lessening program when the goal was to reduce gender-based discrimination in admissions. However, 60.9% chose the noiselessening program instead when the goal was to reduce race-based discrimination in police shootings, χ²(1) = 16.96, p &lt; .001 (see online supplement for full methods and analyses). Though effects are relatively small, these data suggest that preferences for reducing discrimination via changes in bias or noise may vary based on the type or severity of the discrimination. Future work in this area will benefit from further exploring what factors drive preferences for changes in bias or noise as a means for reducing discrimination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Directions and Generality</head><p>Subsequent research into the role of bias and noise in discrimination should look to extend and clarify many of the claims made here. For one, it will be important to identify boundary conditions where increased systematic thinking or ability to regulate bias are ineffective. There are likely conditions that need to be met beforehand in order for such interventions to be effective. One candidate is task difficulty. In tasks where it is challenging to determine the correct answer, interventions that increase systematic thinking or heighten ability to control socially biased responding may be ineffective, as participants will lack the capacity to exert much mental control over responses <ref type="bibr">(Pehman &amp; Neter, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wilson &amp; Brekke, 1994)</ref>. The JBT may offer one means of testing this proposition directly, as task difficulty can be manipulated by altering the ease at which participants can identify the appropriate responses (i.e., by shrinking the relative gap in qualifications between more and less qualified applicants).</p><p>In addition, it will be of practical and theoretical value to identify additional interventions that reduce bias and noise simultaneously. Studies 1a-1b identified blinding as a strategy for doing so. Removing irrelevant social information eliminates the possibility of bias and reduces noise, but blinding is not feasible in many evaluation contexts (e.g., in-person interviews).</p><p>Another possibility is using a version of implementation intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999) that simultaneously directs attention towards the outcome-relevant criteria and away from the irrelevant social information (e.g., through having participants adopt the strategy of "When I see an application, I will ignore physical attractiveness and attend to the academic criteria"). Finding new approaches for reducing both bias and noise simultaneously will shed light on the mechanisms that give rise to these two components of social judgment.</p><p>Finally, though this work used multiple outcome measures and social groups as targets, samples were limited to a single source. Participants in all studies came from a volunteer website with a stated mission of investigating biases in attitudes and judgment. Though our large samples allowed for a relatively wide range of participants in terms of demographic characteristics like age, race, and political orientation, they are not representative of any definable population. It is possible that more representative samples would show differing effects from those presented here, though we cannot at the moment identify a plausible reason to expect this lack of generalizability. Regardless, investigating the generality of this work to both other populations and other forms of discrimination will be a priority of future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Progress on reducing discrimination will come from greater clarity into the processes that give rise to discriminatory behavior and the interventions that alter these processes. This work identifies two distinct but related components of discrimination--noise and bias--and reveals how each are differentially impacted by various interventions and rely on distinct psychological processes. Future efforts to reduce discrimination should consider the relative ease and effectiveness of targeting changes in bias, noise, or both. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, criterion biases were modestly but reliably associated with desired performance (r = .10, 95% CI[.02, .19]), perceived performance (r = .22, 95% CI[.14, .29]), explicit preferences (r = .11, 95% CI[.09, .14]), and implicit associations (r = .09, 95% CI[.06, .11]).</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">JBT exclusion rates did not reliably differ between conditions in Studies 1a-1b and 3-5, but did differ in Studies 2a-2c. The online supplement provides additional analyses as robustness checks for Studies 2a-2c as well as exclusion rates for all conditions and all studies.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">Timing was selected based on previous work using the FPST, which had a 630-millisecond response window (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Correll et al., 2007)</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">Greater internal motivation to avoid prejudice was weakly but reliably associated with lower biases in criterion favoring more physically attractive applicants (Study 2b r = -.09, 95% CI[- .15, -.04], Study 2c r = -.07, 95% CI[-.14, -.01]).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">In the Untimed condition of Study 2c, 87% of participants had an average response time lower than 4500 milliseconds, meaning a large majority of participants would have already made their decisions by this point.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">In our pre-registration, we indicated we would compare the reliability of the full 12-item scale to a 9-item scale that excluded items about visual imagery (e.g., "I am good at visualizing things"). Reliability was higher for the 9-item version, so analyses use this shortened version.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A</head><p>Criteria values for more and less qualified applicants. Applicants are scored by placing each criterion on a four-point scale. GPA's are already on this scale, and interview scores, which are displayed as out of 100 possible points are divided by 25. Rec. Letters are scored such that Poor = 1, Fair = 2, Good = 3, and Excellent = 4. Less qualified applicants have criteria that sum to a total score of 14, while more qualified applicants have criteria that sum to 14. Each BIAT contained four blocks. In the first block (20 trials), participants pressed the "I" key for all Dangerous words (Dangerous, Risky, Alarming, Threatening) and gray-scale images of White people (cropped to only show the face, two male and two female), and the "E" key for "any other images and words." These other stimuli were Safety words (Safe, Secure, Harmless, Protected) and gray-scale images of Black people (cropped to only show the face, two male and two female). The second block (20 trials) had the same design, but the "I" key was for Safety words and images of Black people, and the "E" key for "any other images or words".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Less Qualified Applicants</head><p>The third and fourth blocks repeated the first and second blocks, respectively.
