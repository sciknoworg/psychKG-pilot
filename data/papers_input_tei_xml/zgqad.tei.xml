				<p>Is AI capable of virtue? We propose that autonomous systems can, at least, be programmed to respond in ways that align with the behaviors of virtuous humans. Our test case is programming autonomous vehicles (AVs). Regardless of AVs&apos; competence, crashes are inevitable. However, it is impossible to program rules for failing gracefully in every crash scenario; nor is the ideal crash outcome always clear. We contend that AV crash decisions must be flexible, reflecting human drivers&apos; diverse values, driving styles, and crash responses. To that end, we aim to understand both how and why human drivers behave the way they do in crash scenarios. We conducted three studies using surveys and driving simulations and found that the core value of benevolence is associated with a prosocial driving style and self-sacrifice. In contrast, the value of power is associated with a competitive driving style and self-preservation. There may be roles for both benevolent and power AVs. We are currently conducting proof-of-concept studies on programming small-scale robot AVs with driving behaviors that reflect these human values.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Virtuous Vehicles: Identifying the Moral Profile of Responsible Human Drivers as a Basis for Ethical Decision-Making in Self-driving Cars</head><p>The eventual development of advanced computerized systems capable of learning, making decisions, and acting on those decisions-independently of humans-is inevitable. One example is autonomous vehicles (AVs; self-driving cars). AVs are currently being tested across the U.S., and proponents argue that these vehicles are more competent and far safer than vehicles operated by human drivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blanco et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Teoh &amp; Kidd, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>However, integrating AVs into human society poses social and ethical challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fagnant &amp; Kockelman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gerdes &amp; Thornton, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Malle &amp; Scheutz, 2014)</ref>. Specifically, crashes are inevitable and are likely to persist as long as AVs share the road with human drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blanco et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Goodall, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Teoh &amp; Kidd, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, in uncertain, dynamic, or complex environments, a timely handover to a human supervisor is not always feasible due to human fatigue, distraction, or slow reaction times <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Elander et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fagnant &amp; Kockelman, 2015)</ref>. Here, we present research aimed at the eventual development of automatic control systems that enable AVs (and other AI-driven machines) to behave like responsible moral agents in unpredictable crash scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moral decision-making in vehicle crash scenarios</head><p>Previous research has often focused on programming that would predetermine AVs' behavior in crash scenarios by optimizing deontological constraints (following programmed rules, obligations, or social norms regardless of the outcome) or consequentialist optimization (programming desired outcomes assuming some ideal mapping of the consequences of actions).</p><p>However, no single set of rules or unified models regarding vehicle spacing, speed, or lane changes can cover all possible scenarios that can make a crash unavoidable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Virtuous Vehicles 4</head><p>Moral judgments regarding appropriate crash outcomes vary considerably <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Meder et al., 2019)</ref>. Even in seemingly obvious driving situations (e.g., choosing to collide with an animal versus a human), there is often a lack of consensus on ideal crash outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Awad et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bonnefon et al., 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, deontological and consequentialist ethical systems often conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kuipers, 2016)</ref> and thus cannot generally be combined to address each other's shortcomings. For example, people agree that self-driving cars should never drive on sidewalks (deontological). Given the classic trolley dilemma, empirical studies show most people agree that a child's life should be spared over an adult's (consequentialist)-at least in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Awad et al., 2018)</ref>. However, it is unclear whether a self-driving car should drive onto a sidewalk and incidentally kill an adult to avoid killing a child darting into the street <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bergmann et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, combining deontological and consequentialist programming can lead to more opportunities for ethical dilemmas, not fewer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dubljević et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We view the philosophical debate over deontological versus consequentialist ethics for AVs as neglecting the possibility of programming virtue ethics. Virtue ethics is concerned with the internal characteristics of an agent and how those characteristics influence positive behaviors across diverse situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bright et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fowers et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">MacIntyre, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Yang, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In the Aristotelian tradition, virtuous character traits are developed (cultivated) by repeated practice in different situations over time. For instance, patience is not innate but, instead, can be cultivated by practicing delayed gratification in multiple circumstances over a lifetime.</p><p>We posit that previously cultivated character traits, moral priorities, and values-which we will refer to as a Values Profile-will, in turn, influence the development of an individual's driving style, which varies along a continuum as being prosocial (i.e., a positive and cooperative driving style) or competitive (i.e., an aggressive, dominant, or aberrant driving style) <ref type="bibr">(Basu et al., Virtuous Vehicles 5 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Özkan &amp; Lajunen, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Xu et al., 2015)</ref>. Rather than explicitly codifying rulesets and maneuvers a priori that are deemed to be ethical (from a deontological perspective) or ideal (from a consequentialist perspective), our goal is to eventually be able to design AV controllers that will function as implicit "virtues" -a moral compass, so to speak-that are flexible enough to mimic or align with the instantaneous decisions of responsible human drivers in uncertain, complex, and dynamic traffic environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicting Human Decision-Making in Crash Scenarios</head><p>Studies aimed at evaluating moral decision-making in crash scenarios often leverage the classic trolley dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Awad et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bergmann et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bonnefon et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bostyn et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gao et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Geisslinger et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Malle et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Malle &amp; Scheutz, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Radun et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rhim et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Skulmowski et al., 2014)</ref>. The trolley dilemma is a thought experiment in which the participant is asked to imagine a run-away trolley on a track headed toward a group of people. The participant must decide whether the trolley should be intentionally diverted to an alternate track with only one person. Participants often prefer the utilitarian option (i.e., saving the many versus the one; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Navarrete et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Skulmowski et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In a first-person version of the trolley dilemma, the participant is asked to imagine that she is riding in the vehicle and encounters a situation where the only two options are to plow through a group of pedestrians or to swerve intentionally and hit an immovable obstacle, thus self-sacrificing but saving the pedestrian(s). People often claim they would self-sacrifice and want AVs to be programmed to self-sacrifice <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bergmann et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Frison et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sachdeva et al., 2015)</ref>-that is, unless they would be the one injured in the crash <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnefon et al., 2019)</ref>. Indeed, in driving simulations, when there is far less time for deliberation, Virtuous Vehicles 6 participants' self-sacrifice decisions on surveys often switch to self-preservation in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bostyn et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lucifora et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Samuel et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Despite convincing arguments for the utility of trolley dilemma research in programming ethical AVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bonnefon et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Geisslinger et al., 2021)</ref>, there has been very little work investigating the underlying psychological predictors of trolley dilemma decisions. For example, what are the psychological characteristics of drivers who self-sacrifice versus self-preserve?</p><p>What role might personality traits, character strengths, and virtues play in predicting in-themoment decisions in crash scenarios? Are those crash decisions further explained by driving styles as traits developed over years of driving practice?</p><p>In the present research, we draw on social psychological research and propose that basic values <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Schwartz et al., 2012)</ref> can potentially influence prosocial and competitive driving styles, which, in turn, predict human crash behaviors. Our conceptual model is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of Driving Style</head><p>Driving styles have been well-documented in the transportation literature, and the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Reason et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sullman et al., 2019)</ref> has been updated (Positive-DBQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Özkan &amp; Lajunen, 2005)</ref> and used to differentiate prosocial or aberrant driving styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Basu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Özkan &amp; Lajunen, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Xu et al., 2015)</ref>. Indicators of a prosocial driving style include both courteous behaviors (e.g., thanking a driver with a friendly wave) and cooperative behaviors (e.g., avoiding following other cars too closely). In contrast, an aberrant or</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Values Profile</head><p>Driving Style Crash Behavior competitive driving style involves driving errors (e.g., hitting something when reversing), lapses (e.g., failing to see a cyclist), violations (e.g., disregarding a speed limit), and aggression (e.g., driving slowly to annoy another driver).</p><p>A competitive driving style may sometimes be beneficial (e.g., emergency vehicles) but has also been identified as a predictor of vehicle collisions. For example, speeding and traffic citations are often associated with an increased number and severity of car crashes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Benfield et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Elander et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Factor, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">French et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sullman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sümer, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zhao et al., 2012)</ref>. However, we are unaware of any studies investigating the influence of driving styles on specific crash behaviors. For example, imagine a driver coming around a curve and unexpectedly encountering a pedestrian crossing the street while another vehicle blocks the opposite, oncoming lane. How might individuals with different driving styles respond?</p><p>One possibility is that an aggressive, competitive-style driver would be more likely than a prosocial driver to hit the pedestrian in this trolley-style, self-sacrifice scenario, perhaps due to the increased speed that characterizes competitive driving styles. Thus, we hypothesized that a competitive driving style would be associated with self-preservation (H1a), whereas a prosocial driving style would be associated with self-sacrifice (H1b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Values Profiles as Predictors of Driving Styles</head><p>We were specifically interested in identifying the psychological characteristics that influence ethical decision-making. Therefore, we employed Basic Values Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schwartz, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schwartz et al., 2012)</ref> to identify the components of a Values Profile capable of predicting driving styles and, in turn, crash behaviors in self-sacrificing versions of the trolley dilemma. <ref type="bibr">Schwartz and colleagues (1992;</ref> have assessed the structure and content of values and found groups of values that are sometimes in tension and have Virtuous Vehicles 8 competing goals. For example, the self-conserving values of safety and security sometimes conflict with self-expansive values of stimulation and self-expression; the self-transcendent value of benevolence contrasts with the self-enhancing value of power. Based partly on previous research (above), we hypothesized that the values of benevolence (H2) and security (H3) would be associated with prosocial driving styles and, in contrast, the values of power (H4) and stimulation (i.e., sensation seeking) (H5) would be associated with a competitive driving style.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Values Theory.</head><p>Further, we hypothesized that drivers with a (self-transcendent) Benevolent Values Profile would be more likely to self-sacrifice compared with drivers with a (self-enhancing) Power Values Profile (H1) in trolley-dilemma situations.</p><p>Overview of studies. We conducted three studies. In Studies 1 and 2, we administered surveys investigating the influence of Benevolent versus Power Values Profiles on diverse driving styles and, in turn, the ability of Values Profiles and driving styles to predict moral decisions in hypothetical crash scenarios. However, crashes normally involve spontaneous, inthe-moment responses without time for deliberation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Samuel et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, in Study 3, we investigated the ability of Values Profiles and driving styles to predict self-sacrifice (hitting a barrier and saving pedestrians) versus self-preservation (hitting pedestrians and saving oneself) in a driving simulator environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Exploring Morals and Values as Predictors of Driving Style</head><p>We first conducted an exploratory survey to investigate the clusters of values that might predict prosocial and competitive driving styles in an undergraduate sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We surveyed 663 psychology undergraduates at a large public university who completed the study for partial course credit during the fall semester of 2018. All participants were 18 years or older (Mage = 18.96, SD = 1.74) and had a driver's license (valid or suspended). The study was approved by Arizona State University's IRB #00008637 and the Department of the Army Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) ARL 18-141.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Driving practices. We adapted 26 items derived from the Positive Driver Behavior Questionnaire (P-DBQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Özkan &amp; Lajunen, 2005)</ref>, which assesses positive driving practices, driving errors, aggressive driving (e.g., following too closely to annoy another driver), and violations (e.g., speeding). Participants rated their frequency of each type of behavior in the previous year on a Likert scale of 1 = never to 6 = almost always.</p><p>We assessed eight positive driving behaviors (e.g., "adjusted your speed to help a nearby vehicle trying to pass"; α = .69), five errors (e.g., "turned right, nearly hitting a cyclist"; α = .71), five aggressive behaviors (e.g., "yelled or made derogatory gestures toward another driver"; α = .70), and five violations (e.g., "disregarded the speed limit on a residential road"; α = .67). We also asked how often the participant had been in a minor and a major vehicle accident.</p><p>Values. We used 57 statements from the Schwartz Values Instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref> to assess value priorities. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which each value is "a guiding principle of your life," where 1 = opposed to my principles and 7 = supreme importance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Virtuous Vehicles 10</head><p>Other measures. Other exploratory measures included personality, moral foundations, fundamental social motivations, aggression, cooperation, and a benevolent self-identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The descriptive statistics and correlations between the four measures of driving practices are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, along with the participants' self-reported accident frequency. Consistent with previous research, we found that prosocial driving practices (α = .69) were negatively correlated with aggression and accidents. Errors (α = .71), aggression (α = .70), and violations (α = .67) were all positively correlated. Assuming the eventual competence of AVs, we were mainly interested in aggressive driving and violations as a predictor of crash behavior. Therefore, we computed a composite score for competitive driving style as the mean of all items for aggression and violations, α = .78, M = 2.30, SD = .62. Next, we conducted multiple regression models to assess the ability of the hypothesized morals and values to predict positive driving style, competitive driving style, and the number of accidents, controlling for gender. The means, standard deviations, bivariate correlations, and standardized beta coefficients are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. We found that basic values were able to differentiate prosocial driving, R 2 = .12, F (5, 565) = 15.50, p &lt; .001, competitive</p><p>Virtuous Vehicles 11 driving, R 2 = .12, F (5, 565) = 6.55, p &lt; .001, and accident frequency, R 2 = .06, F (5, 565) = 7.26, p &lt; .001. In support of H2 and H4, and consistent with the values circumplex <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schwartz, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schwartz et al., 2012)</ref>, we found that a prosocial driving style was positively predicted by the self-transcendent value of benevolence and negatively predicted by the self-enhancing value of power, suggesting that the values of benevolence and power may have a direct or indirect effect on trolley-dilemma crash decisions via prosocial driving style. In support of H4, the value of power was a positive predictor of competitive driving (and accident frequency).</p><p>In partial support of H3, security was positively correlated with prosocial driving.</p><p>However, security was not a significant predictor of prosocial driving in the regression model, suggesting that benevolence plays a more important role. Notably, security was negatively associated with competitive driving. This is consistent with research showing that aggressive driving and violations are associated with greater risk-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fischer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">French et al., 1993)</ref>. Likewise, and in support of H5, the value of stimulation (i.e., sensation-seeking) was also positively associated with a competitive driving style.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of Study 1 demonstrate the potential of using the values of benevolence, power, stimulation, and security to predict prosocial and competitive driving styles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Morals and Values as Predictors of Traffic Citations</head><p>In Study 2, we sought to replicate and extend the results of Study 1 in a community sample to investigate individual differences in Values Profiles as predictors of driving styles and crash decisions. We used six crash scenarios with diagrams adapted from the Moral Machines project <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Awad et al., 2018)</ref>, which present "trolley-problem" crash scenarios that pose ethical dilemmas. We investigated whether participants' Values Profiles and driving styles could predict these crash decisions. The study was approved by the Arizona State University IRB #00008637 and the Department of the Army HRPO ARL 18-141.</p></div>

One week after completing Part 1, participants were invited to complete Part 2, which involved judging appropriate actions in diagrams of various crash scenarios adapted from the Moral Machines project <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Awad et al., 2018)</ref>. Participants were asked to imagine driving the car shown in the diagram. In each scenario, a trolley-type dilemma was illustrated and then described in the text with a statement that there would not have been enough time to stop the car.</p><p>Participants were asked how they would respond in each scenario. Notes: 1 Self is the driver of a car with passengers, and participants are asked to imagine they are the driver; Self is always moving forward in Lane 1 and would need to actively swerve to Lane 2 to avoid obstacles or pedestrians; Ped = Pedestrians in the roadway; Green (Red) Light indicates whether the pedestrian is law-abiding (law-breaking); Crim = Criminals; XXX = road barrier Four scenarios involved the choice to self-preserve by (1) passively continuing forward to avoid a barrier but hitting two law-abiding pedestrians (SaveSelf1), (2) actively swerving to Virtuous Vehicles 14 avoid a barrier and thereby hitting three law-abiding pedestrians (SaveSelf2), (3) passively continuing forward to avoid a barrier and thereby hitting three law-breaking pedestrians illegally crossing on a red light (SaveSelf3), and (4) actively swerving to avoid a barrier and hitting three law-breaking pedestrians (criminals; SaveSelf4). Scenario 5 involved continuing forward and injuring a law-breaking child running into the street versus actively swerving and hitting a lawabiding adult male (SaveChild). Scenario 6 involved continuing forward and injuring five pedestrians versus actively swerving, thereby injuring only three pedestrians (Save5Ped).</p><p>Representations of the six scenarios are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.  Competitive driving style. In contrast to Study 1, stimulation (H5) was not a significant predictor of competitive driving in the community sample. Furthermore, although security was a negative predictor of competitive driving in the student sample, security was also non-significant in the adult sample. The differences in security and stimulation between the two samples may reflect a greater tendency for risk-taking and stimulation among younger drivers.</p><p>Predicting crash decisions. The percentages of participants saying they would save the Self, a child vs. a man, or five vs. three pedestrians in the crash scenarios is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>Virtuous Vehicles 16 </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N = 291</formula><p>We added the number of decisions to self-preserve vs. self-sacrifice in each of the four self-sacrifice scenarios to create a composite score which we refer to as Save Self (a decision that the participant would self-preserve if they were the driver). There were 53 participants who said they would save others rather than saving themselves in all four scenarios (coded '0'), 69 who saved others in three of four scenarios (coded '1'), 44 who saved others in two of the four scenarios (coded '2'), 35 who saved others in one scenario (coded '3'), and 90 who never saved others (coded '4'). In other words, a high score indicated a high tendency to self-preserve, and a low score indicated a tendency to self-sacrifice.</p><p>The correlates of the composite Save Self variable revealed that benevolence, r (291) = -.27, p &lt; .001, security, r (291) = -.13, p = .026, and prosocial driving style, r (291) = -.25, p &lt; .001 were negatively correlated with the decision to self-preserve (Save Self). In contrast, power, r (291) = .15, p = .009, was positively associated with self-preservation. Competitive driving was positively correlated with Save Self but did not reach conventional levels of significance, r (291) = .11, p = .065. The value of stimulation, p = .172, was non-significant.</p><p>Next, we regressed the composite Save Self variable on the significantly correlated variables (i.e., benevolence, security, power, prosocial driving style, and competitive driving style), controlling for age and gender. The model accounted for 13.8% of the variance, F (7, 283)</p><p>Virtuous Vehicles 17 = 6.46, p &lt; .001. In the full model, only benevolence (β = -.29, p &lt; .001) and prosocial driving (β = -.14, p = .019) were significant negative predictors of Save Self. The value of power was reduced to non-significance, suggesting that a positive driving style may attenuate the influence of the value of power on self-preservation. Said another way, benevolence and a prosocial driving style seem to have a greater (positive) influence on the decision to self-sacrifice compared with the value of power. The normal and biological tendency may be to self-preserve.</p><p>However, individuals who value benevolence may be more likely to overcome their selfpreservation instincts in the moment, in certain trolley-dilemma crash decisions.</p><p>Finally, we conducted two binary logistic regression models to investigate the ability of benevolence versus power and prosocial versus competitive driving styles to predict the other two crash decisions, controlling for age and gender.

We conducted a summary path analysis using Mplus statistical software to summarize our significant findings. We regressed Save Self on positive and competitive driving styles, and driving styles on benevolence and power, controlling for sex and age. In the path model, we did not include the non-significant predictors from the regression models (i.e., security and stimulation). We also specified the direct paths regressing Save Self on the exogenous variables. The path model and standardized beta coefficients are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Benevolence had both a negative direct effect, p = .005, 95% CI [-.30, -.08], and a negative indirect effect via positive driving, p = .028, 95% CI [-.07, -.01], for a total significant negative effect on Save Self, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.33, -.12]</ref>. In contrast, power had an indirect positive effect on Save Self via a reduction in prosocial driving style, p = .044, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.01, .05]</ref> and, therefore, a significant positive total effect on Save Self, p = .032, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.03, .20</ref>]. Post hoc analysis. We had included self-reported measures of cooperative behaviors (e.g., "I try to take care of those who are in need"), cheating behaviors (e.g., "How justifiable is cheating on your taxes?"), and aggressive behaviors (e.g., "How would you react if some spilled a drink on you and refused to apologize?") in the survey. The correlations between these similar but non-driving-related behaviors are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>. The results suggest that benevolence as a self-transcendent value and power as a self-enhancing value may reflect life-long types of responses across diverse situations and predict a wide range of moral decisions. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>To summarize, we found that the values of power (negative influence) (H4), benevolence (positive influence) (H2), and prosocial driving practices (positive influence) (H1b) were the best predictors of self-sacrifice in crash scenarios involving pedestrians; that is, when the decision was either self-sacrifice or self-preservation at the expense of the pedestrians. Our ultimate goal is to use this information to develop controllers that govern the dynamics and decision-making of AVs so that the behaviors of self-driving cars will align with those of human drivers in an unavoidable crash situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3: Crash Decisions in a Driving Simulator</head><p>In Study 3, we investigated whether the values of power and benevolence are associated with moral decision-making in real-time crash scenarios using a driving simulator. We designed a virtual urban driving environment using the open-source driving simulator CARLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dosovitskiy et al., 2017)</ref>. Further details on the simulator are provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kankam (2019)</ref>, with improvements described by <ref type="bibr">Ulhas and colleagues (2019;</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>There were 105 undergraduate participants (61.9% males; 50.5% European-American; Mage = 19.72, SD = 2.42) who completed both the simulation and an exit survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>To learn the driving route in the simulator, participants first completed two practice drives with no crash scenario. Then, at the end of a third driving experience, participants turned a corner and discovered a pedestrian in their lane walking toward a stopped or oncoming car in the opposite lane, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Participants were faced with the decision to (a) continue driving straight and hit the pedestrian, (b) veer to the left and hit the car (or pedestrian and car), Virtuous Vehicles 20 or (c) swerve to the right and hit a barrier. Decisions (a) and (b) were scored as self-preservation (Save Self; Coded 1), and decision (c) was scored as self-sacrifice (Coded 0).</p><p>Following the driving experience, participants completed an online survey assessing values <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Schwartz et al., 2012)</ref> and the Driver Behavior Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Özkan &amp; Lajunen, 2005)</ref> used in Studies 1 and 2. During the exit survey, participants were presented with diagrams of four of the trolley-problem crash scenarios from Study 2, with one scenario that was conceptually the same as the simulated scenario shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> (i.e., continuing straight to self-preserve or swerving into a barrier to avoid injury to others). Participants were also asked whether they agreed with their crash decision in the simulator. Note: The survey diagram was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Awad et al. (2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>The crash decisions were reported through the survey and then verified through visual inspection of the screen recordings of the driving experiences. Of the 105 participants who completed the study, 31 self-sacrificed and avoided injury to others by swerving right and crashing into the barrier, 51 hit the pedestrian who was walking toward the car, and 23 veered to the left and crashed into the car (or car/pedestrian). chose self-preservation (Save Self) in both cases, and 6.7% chose self-sacrifice in the simulator but self-preservation (Save Self) on the survey. However, 54% chose self-preservation (Save Self) in the simulator (i.e., hitting the pedestrian or pedestrian and car) but, with more time to reflect, chose self-sacrifice (i.e., swerving and hitting a barrier) on the survey. When explicitly asked if they had made the right decision in the simulated crash scenario, none of the drivers who hit the barrier or car said they should have hit the pedestrian. Additionally, only 17 of the 51 participants who hit the pedestrian said they had made the right choice.</p><p>These results are consistent with research showing that, although people often report that self-sacrifice is the "right" moral decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bonnefon et al., 2016)</ref>, self-preservation often reigns in the moment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lucifora et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Malle et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sachdeva et al., 2015)</ref>; hypothetical dilemmas and real-time reactions do not always agree <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bostyn et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Samuel et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Driving Simulator Predictors</head><p>We were primarily interested in the predictors of the simulated crash decision. Therefore, we used logistic regression and bootstrapping (K = 1,000; 95% asymmetric confidence interval) to investigate whether individual differences in the values of power, benevolence, and security and driving style could predict self-preservation at the risk of harming others (Save Self) in the driving simulator. Lucifora (2021) has shown that risk assessment can be an important predictor in driving simulations. Additionally, our measure of competitive driving combines both interpersonal aggression (e.g., angry horn-blowing) and traffic rule violations (e.g., speeding, disregard for stop signs). Therefore, we conducted our analysis to control for risk assessment and parsed competitive driving into the aggressive and aberrant (i.e., violations) subscales. The model explained 9.1% (Cox and Snell R 2 ) to 12.9% (Nagelkerke R 2 ) of the variance, p = .066.</p><p>The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with the results of Study 2, the value of benevolence was a significant negative predictor of Save Self in the simulator, p = .045, with an odds ratio of .40, indicating that people who value benevolence were less likely to injure others and more likely to selfsacrifice by hitting the barrier in the simulator. Additionally, self-reporting driving violations (e.g., speeding) was a significant (positive) predictor of Save Self in the simulator, p = .030, with drivers who regularly disregard traffic rules being 2.99 times more likely to Save Self. The values of security (personal safety) and power were not significant. citations. Save Self = Self-preservation in the driving simulator crash scenario; N = 105.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The primary purpose of this research was to investigate the crash decisions of good drivers and to identify the underlying values that might inform those decisions. In three studies, we found that the values of benevolence (i.e., caring for others, helpfulness, forgiveness, loyalty, dependability, and responsibility) and power (i.e., dominance, influence, status, wealth, and authority) can be used to predict whether human drivers are likely to have a prosocial versus a Virtuous Vehicles 23 competitive driving style. Furthermore, when evaluating diagrams of crash scenarios involving pedestrians, high scores on a measure of prosocial driving style were associated with the decision that it is better to self-sacrifice-for example, hitting a barrier or other obstacle-rather than hitting pedestrians. However, in a driving simulator, competitive driving came more into play.</p><p>Participants who self-reported frequent traffic violations (see Appendix A) were more likely to self-preserve and hit the pedestrian in the moment. Notably, many of these participants reported on the exit survey that they should have self-sacrificed.</p><p>Additional studies are currently underway to: (1) replicate our findings from the driving simulator using a larger sample and an improved simulation with a matching small-scale physical testbed <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ulhas et al., 2022)</ref>, and (2) conduct a second survey using a nationally representative sample to further investigate the relative influence of diverse ethical systems, values, and driving styles on crash decisions across various subpopulations in the U.S. Whether or not AVs are deemed to be true moral agents, our goal is to be able to provide a proof of concept that virtuous decision-making can be programmed in autonomous systems. In the remainder of this paper, we discuss the conceptual links between driving style and virtue and the implications for "programming virtue" in other autonomous systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-sacrifice vs. self-preservation</head><p>We have been mostly agnostic about whether AVs (or humans) should choose selfsacrifice or self-preservation. There is no "right" answer; this is the nature of ethical dilemmas.</p><p>People can and do provide legitimate, solid arguments as to why one decision is more ethical or moral than the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Awad et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Basu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bergmann et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Frison et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Radun et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sachdeva et al., 2015)</ref>. From a deontological perspective, the vehicle driver should always self-sacrifice because a cardinal rule is Do No Harm-which is, Virtuous Vehicles 24 incidentally, a fundamental principle in Asimov's prime directives. But should a young mother self-sacrifice to save a dog or a criminal? Considering the outcome (i.e., the utilitarian approach) seems preferable. But how will we all agree on the ideal outcome? Our alternative approach has been to ask, "What should a virtuous person do?"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Virtuous Driving Styles</head><p>There is no general theory of virtue in the psychological sciences. However, Fowers et al. In many ways, driving styles are analogous to virtues in that driving styles can also be evaluated as scalar traits developed over time with repeated practice (while driving). Further, driving styles reflect a person's values, as we have shown here. Also, like virtues, the expression of driving styles is situation dependent. For example, even the kindest, most patient drivers may become annoyed in some situations.</p><p>We have also tried to remain agnostic as to whether prosocial and competitive driving styles are equally virtuous. The two styles map onto notions of warmth and competence familiar to social psychologists, and there is social value in both dimensions. Indeed, people who are perceived as both warm and competent are perceived as more reliable, skillful, intelligent, and practical <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fiske et al., 2007)</ref>. A warm, prosocial driving style is measured by friendliness, kindness, and forgiveness, classic Aristotelian virtues or character strengths. Although they may not come to mind as readily, traits such as zest, courage, leadership, and creativity are also virtues and character strengths, which seem more closely aligned with a competitive driving style. In short, both prosocial and competitive driving styles may contribute to well-being and human flourishing. For instance, a friendly wave on a side street is prosocial and appropriate.</p><p>However, freeway driving in a metropolitan area requires traits like courage, alertness, and quick problem-solving skills over and above benevolence. Efficiently traveling to one's destination is the central task <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gerdes &amp; Thornton, 2015)</ref>. Thus, it seems that neither prosocial nor competitive driving is inherently amoral.</p><p>However, in virtue theory, a critical aspect in evaluating traits as virtues is whether they lead to "right action," and right action is evaluated as meeting the test of all virtues <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Russell, 2009)</ref>. For example, being generous is a virtue, but not if it creates an injustice. In the present research, we found that competitive driving styles were associated with frequent traffic citations (technically, civil disobedience), aggression in social situations, cheating, and a lack of cooperation <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 7)</ref>. Therefore, our inclination is to conclude that prosocial driving styles are virtuous, whereas competitive driving styles are not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programming Prosocial Driving in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)</head><p>To date, automotive engineers and car manufacturers have been working diligently to improve the competence and competitiveness of AVs. As a result, AVs now have a rich toolkit for perceiving the environment, calculating probabilities, and computing real-time decisions at a faster, potentially safer rate than humans. However, accidents will still occur. What is needed now is to develop AV controllers that emulate a virtuous (i.e., prosocial) driving style that produces flexible responses in uncertain, dynamic, complex situations.</p><p>We plan to translate our findings here into machine controls, reformulating AVimplementable control-theoretic models to reflect the psychological processes and value profiles of prosocial human drivers. In controller design problems (e.g., choosing the structure and ranges of gains of feedback controllers), after the safety and stability of automatic controllers are ensured for nominal operation, there are often remaining degrees of freedom left for the designer to choose (i.e., there are wide range of feedback controllers that meet safety and stability constraints). Optimal control techniques fix these degrees of freedom by computing control parameters that optimize a particular selection of criteria (e.g., fuel use, an acceleration budget) or a weighted combination of criteria where the weights are chosen based on some subjective hyper-criteria. We aim to characterize this design space along explicit ethical dimensions to help better guide AV design. For example, specific control parameters could be selected to produce driving behaviors that a human observer would classify as being consistent with "pure benevolence" (e.g., prioritizing sensor detection performance over speed)-or, in some cases, "pure power" (e.g., prioritizing speed over sensor accuracy). To determine precisely how control parameters map to this "virtue space," we will first produce best-fitting controllers for autonomous vehicles that replicate the driving behaviors of human participants in different driving platforms in the laboratory. That will allow us to define these pure-virtue dimensions in control space. Then, using these dimensions, the programmer of an AV could create combinations of these pure-virtue parameters to form what we call value-governed parameters that are consistent with the desired driving ethos of real drivers.</p><p>The desired set of value-governed parameters (and their corresponding balance of virtues) might vary depending on the type of vehicle. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gerdes &amp; Thornton (2015)</ref> suggest, an automated rideshare may prioritize benevolence for the comfort of the passengers. In contrast, an ambulance may prioritize power, manifested as speedy travel, to respond quickly to an emergency. Of course, the value-governed parameters will be constrained by legal limits, liability concerns, overriding goals of avoiding collisions, and the prime directive not to harm humans. Indeed, Gerdes and Thornton recommend that an AV operate according to a hierarchy of constraints based on the vehicle's priorities (a deontological ethics system) until a dilemma, such as a crash scenario, occurs. In the event of a dilemma, certain constraints may be violated, according to their predetermined hierarchy, if the predicted outcome is sufficiently beneficial to justify their violation (a consequentialist ethics system). Our approach focuses on dilemmas that occur at sufficiently small time scales that deliberative reasoning or even control authority cannot be taken for granted. In other words, our approach focuses not on event-based responses but instead the general ethical timbre of a driving algorithm. We aim to reduce the occurrence of event-based ethical dilemmas and to ensure that when an inevitable driving failure occurs, the outcome will be consistent with those of human drivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Directions and Study Limitations</head><p>Autonomous systems (AI software agents, robots, AVs, etc.) are becoming increasingly prevalent in all sectors of society. Therefore, it will be imperative to ensure that these systems behave as responsible moral agents even if they are incapable of ethical reasoning per se. As an initial effort, in the present research, we used a well-established measure of values with a view toward developing AV controllers that are capable of producing driving and crash behaviors that would align with the behaviors of responsible human drivers. However, we acknowledge that humans have an extensive range of values and motivations (e.g., reputation concerns) that should be explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Virtuous Vehicles 28</head><p>Another challenge is that there may not be a one-size-fits-all set of value-governed parameters for AV controllers. For instance, although passengers seem to prefer AVs with a defensive driving style <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Basu et al., 2017)</ref>, and although we recommend a prosocial driving style, AV owners may prefer vehicles programmed to match their values, personality, or motivations.</p><p>Other essential road users to consider are pedestrians <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Domeyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Domeyer et al., 2020)</ref>, public-policy makers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders who must agree on different options for value-governed parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Regardless of the intent of automation systems engineers, all automation systems (e.g., driver assistance systems, elevators, garbage disposals, washing machines, etc.) take implicit ethical stances that become very apparent after accidents that lead others to judge the "appropriateness" of how and why the system failed. Thus, whether AVs are ever deemed to be truly responsible moral agents, they are implicit moral agents in that, while AVs may be unable to explicitly justify or explain their actions, their behaviors and behavioral outcomes can and will be interpreted in terms of moral integrity. We believe that AVs can eventually be programmed to behave as moral, ethical, responsible, virtuous human drivers and, when needed, to fail gracefully, avoiding unethical outcomes. We hope that developers will consider the balance of the values of benevolence and power in AV programming as we drive toward a future with selfdriving cars.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Power statements were Social Power, Being a Leader, Being in Authority, Power from Wealth, Being Wealthy, and Having Status (α = .90); in contrast, Benevolence statements were Loyalty, Being Responsible, Being Reliable, Helpfulness, Forgiveness, and Caring (α = .84).

Virtues are scalar; there is not an absence or a presence of virtue but rather, virtues can be measured in degrees. Virtues are motivated by one's values and developed over time through intentional and repeated behaviors that reinforce a given virtue.</figDesc></figure>
