			<abstract>
				<p>Mass media extensively inform societies about events threatening the global food supply (e.g., pandemics or Brexit). Consumers exposed to such communication may perceive food resources as becoming scarcer. In line with the evolutionary account, these perceptions can shift decision-making in domains such as food preferences or prosociality. However, the current literature has solely focused on actual and past food insecurity experiences threatening mostly low-income families, thus neglecting the future-oriented perceptions among the general population. This paper broadens the food insecurity research scope by developing a new construct-anticipated food scarcity (AFS)-which is defined as the perception that food resources are becoming less available (in the future). We have developed and psychometrically validated the 8-item Anticipated Food Scarcity Scale (AFSS) in eight studies (N = 1333). The 8-item AFSS is unidimensional and has good psychometric qualities. The scale is sensitive to food scarcity cues and, therefore, can be used in experimental research. Moreover, the scale&apos;s relatively narrow set of items makes it an exceptionally potent tool for use in online surveys, field settings, and lab studies. Taken together, the AFSS presents an alternative approach to food scarcity measurement in affluent societies and, consequently, can foster novel research on food waste, sustainability, prosocial behaviors, and other similar topic areas.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world have been panic-buying food <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Benker, 2021)</ref>. According to a BBC report <ref type="bibr">(Lufkin, 2020)</ref>, in Singapore, consumers grabbed up lots of rice and instant noodles, leading to shortages of these products in supermarkets. In Auckland, shoppers spent 40% more on groceries than they did a year ago. Similar behaviors have been observed in the past, such as during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and in preparation for Y2K, when Americans stockpiled canned foods in their basements <ref type="bibr">(Lufkin, 2020)</ref>. Experts have warned that Brexit may trigger even more intense panic buying among consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Casalicchio, 2020)</ref>. These shopping sprees often result in excessive food waste. Crucially, the United Nations Development Programme <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(UNDP, 2020)</ref> points at limiting unnecessary consumption as one of the foremost steps in achieving sustainable development.</p><p>Despite the pervasiveness of this phenomenon and the importance of its consequences, predictors of food hoarding behaviors amidst pandemics or political disputes are not fully understood. Although such events usually do not cause actual food shortages in developed countries, it is plausible that receiving information about such turmoil may nonetheless induce consumers to anticipate food scarcity. As a result, consumers may purchase, consume, or waste more food than usual due to unjustified food stockpiling (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Nettle et al., 2017</ref>, for an overview of the role that cues to food scarcity play in food decision-making) and consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Folwarczny et al., 2021)</ref>. To investigate this possibility, a scale measuring anticipated food scarcity (AFS) is vital. Existing tools used in affluent countries are typically retrospective and focus on the actual insufficiency of food resources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ashby et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nettle et al., 2019)</ref>. For example, an established tool for measuring food insecurity-HFIAS-focuses on the frequency of experiencing food unavailability in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Coates et al., 2007)</ref>. In other words, these tools focus on the THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 4 actual experience of food shortages in specific populations. What is missing is a tool to measure expectations of impending food shortage. Accordingly, we developed the Anticipated Food Scarcity Scale (AFSS) to capture perceptions of food resources becoming less available in the future among the general population.</p><p>Our focal construct differs from the existing literature (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ashby et al., 2016)</ref> in that it focuses on an increasing scarcity of food resources rather than on food insecurity, which tends to denote emotions such as fear and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Merriam-Webster, 2021)</ref>. Indeed, the results presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> suggest that AFS and affective states are only weakly related.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anticipated food scarcity (AFS)</head><p>Major global concerns such as climate change, water scarcity, or resource depletion will have more severe consequences for food resources in the future than in the present <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hanjra &amp; Qureshi, 2010)</ref>. Hence, our construct of interest is future-oriented. When defining the construct, we draw from work on past experiences of food insecurity by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Coates et al. (2007)</ref>. As such, in the remainder of this article, we define AFS as "the perception of future food resources becoming insufficient in terms of accessibility and availability (e.g., certain foods might disappear or become less affordable)." Availability refers to the physical existence of food resources (e.g., food production), whereas accessibility refers to individuals' ability to obtain food (e.g., having enough money for groceries). <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Webb et al. (2006)</ref> discuss how these dimensions are understood in the literature on food insecurity.</p><p>This current perception of future food scarcity relies on past experiences of food unavailability, beliefs concerning the influence of various worldly events and factors, and beliefs in wielding power over others. As AFS is a perception, its magnitude can vary over time. In sum, whereas AFS is informed by top-down processes such as present knowledge about future food production or beliefs that one can control what happens in politics, it is also informed by bottom-up processes such as exposure to cues related to food scarcity.</p><p>Importantly, food scarcity cues may influence our immediate reactions regardless of whether they suggest food scarcity that is distant in time and space or more proximate THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 5 (e.g., neighbors who have to rely on food stamps).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceivable cues related to food scarcity</head><p>To understand why this is so, we need to consider basic principles of evolutionary mismatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Li et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1990)</ref>. That is, the mechanisms that comprise human psychology evolved to cope primarily with immediate threats and opportunities (e.g., a lion approaching, a drought that leads to famine, an attractive person who appears available). Because our ancestors did not routinely face technology-induced processes such as global warming that have consequences many years later, our threat-handling mechanisms did not evolve to differentiate cues that indicate immediate dangers versus those that suggest much more distant dangers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Griskevicius et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ornstein &amp; Ehrlich, 2000)</ref>. Hence, psychological mechanisms respond to most threat cues as if they were indicating an impending danger. Accordingly, cues related to evolutionarily novel threats that are distant in time (e.g., food scarcity occurring this year vs. food scarcity occurring in three decades) or space (e.g., one's local neighborhood vs. a country in another continent) may similarly activate mechanisms that produce immediate responses to mitigate those threats in the current environment (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Li et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this regard, exposure to content describing food scarcity in the distant future may shift decision-making processes in humans in a manner similar to the experience of either impending or actual food unavailability. Crucially, whereas actual food unavailability always entails the physical experience of food insufficiency such as hunger, anticipated food scarcity induced by, for instance, reports about Brexit does not necessitate physical experiences. As such, AFS is distinct from food insecurity as it is defined in the current literature. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), "Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(FAO, 1996)</ref>. This definition does not encompass any form of anticipation and perceptions about future food availability. Hence, any tool THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 6 based upon this definition will inevitably capture a different construct than AFS and will not be predictive of responses to future food scarcity cues.</p><p>In line with this reasoning, a recent study has suggested that exposing participants to videos showing food scarcity induced by climate change occurring in distant parts of the world increases their current preferences toward energy-dense foods while decreasing their preferences toward low-calorie alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Folwarczny et al., 2021)</ref>. These results support the view that psychological mechanisms have not evolved to differentiate between current and future threats and imply that exposure to any cues related to food scarcity may shift food preferences toward energy-dense products. However, tools measuring related constructs, such as the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Security Survey Module (FSSM), are typically retrospective and primarily capture food insecurity defined as the physical unavailability of food resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashby et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, these tools cannot predict a shift in food preferences resulting from exposure to food scarcity cues, especially if these cues are related to scarcity distant in time (i.e., happening in two decades) and space (i.e., happening on another continent).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Media exposure and AFS</head><p>Many events can serve as perceivable cues to upcoming food scarcity, especially when mass media vividly show them. People across the globe have been extensively informed about lockdowns imposed as a response measure to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. These lockdowns have triggered labor deficiencies and thus insufficient food production <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Galanakis, 2020)</ref>. Climate change-another issue causing heated debates in media-threatens the global food supply chain, but its effects are much slower than the effects of pandemics <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Wheeler &amp; Von Braun, 2013)</ref>. Brexit is yet another prominent event that can make consumers perceive future food resources as scarcer, at least in the United Kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lang &amp; McKee, 2018)</ref>. In short, numerous events pose a risk of upcoming food scarcity over time. Notably, people who are not at risk of direct exposure to such events may overestimate related threats (in particular, their immediacy) due to, for THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 7 instance, media communication with photographs depicting large crowds or diminishing food supplies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Garfin et al., 2020</ref>). However, as described above, the current literature lacks a scale that can gauge the extent to which events such as trade wars affect the perceptions associated with future food scarcity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research aims and overview of the studies</head><p>Thus far, no scale has been developed to capture the perception that future food resources are becoming scarcer. We address this critical shortcoming by developing and psychometrically validating the 8-item AFSS.</p><p>Studies 1a-1c aimed to develop the preliminary items' pool for subsequent psychometric evaluation. Study 2 was conducted to shorten the scale to a desirable length and to assess its psychometric properties. Studies 3a and 3b confirmed the scale's unidimensionality and examined its convergent and discriminant validity to rule out the possibility that AFS is a ramification of general anxiety or other emotional states. In line with the evolutionary account, Study 3b revealed that AFS might be linked to prosociality.</p><p>We conducted Study 4 to confirm that the specific, distant timeframes mentioned in the instructions do not affect the scale's psychometric properties or averaged scores. Although several items in the final AFSS (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) refer to predictability rather than mere scarcity of food resources, analyses reported in Studies 2-4 clearly show that the scale is unidimensional; hence these items capture the same construct. Finally, as the scale was developed primarily for experimental research, Study 5 showed that the AFSS is sensitive to experimentally manipulated food scarcity. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1 depicts an overview of the scale   development process.</ref> THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical approach</head><p>We applied nonparametric item response theory to evaluate the AFSS psychometric properties. The advantage of nonparametric item response theory over parametric item response theory is that nonparametric item response theory makes fewer assumptions about the distribution of latent variables and requires smaller sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sijtsma &amp; Molenaar, 2002)</ref>. Parametric models assume that latent variables are continuous, and this may not always be the case in social sciences.</p><p>For nonparametric item response theory, we performed a Mokken scale analysis (MSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Van der Ark, 2007</ref>. A Mokken scale analysis investigates whether responses to scale items correspond to an increasing level of the latent variable of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Van Schuur, 2003</ref>). Specifically, we tested the scale unidimensionality, monotonicity, local independence, and invariant item ordering. If the first three criteria are met, then the tested set of items meets the requirements for a monotone homogeneity model and can be considered a scale, whereas meeting the invariant item ordering criterion (nonintersecting item response functions) is required for the double monotonicity model to hold <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mokken, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Van der Ark, 2007</ref>. We investigated unidimensionality-which is the quality of a set of items that enables them to be located on a continuum of the hypothesized latent variable according to the probability of obtaining high total scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Van Schuur, 2003)</ref>-by evaluating the coefficients of homogeneity H that range from 0 to 1. The former number suggests no association between the items, whereas the latter number suggests a perfect association between them (Van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Ark, 2007)</ref>. We also applied the automated item selection procedure (AISP) to further explore scale unidimensionality. This algorithm positions items into scales at increasing homogeneity thresholds <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hemker et al., 1995)</ref>. If several items start forming another scale at a particular homogeneity threshold, this suggests that a scale may have more than one dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dima, 2018)</ref>. Monotonicity, local independence, and invariant item ordering were scrutinized separately with tools provided THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 9 in the " <ref type="bibr">Mokken" package (Van der Ark, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> illustrates the scale development process across all the studies.</p><p>We performed all the analyses in R. Clean data sets, the data analysis code, the R markdown files, Supplementary Information, and additional analyses following the recently developed-and modified for this research-six-step psychometric protocol in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dima, 2018)</ref> have been made publicly available through the Open Science Framework (OSF; https://osf.io/kqf3g/). All the studies have been programmed in PsyToolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Stoet, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Stoet, , 2017</ref>, and the source code has been made available therein.</p><p>We collected data in full compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the American Psychological Association's guidelines on research involving human subjects.</p><p>The studies complied with the local regulations, and a formal Institutional Review Board's approval was neither needed nor sought. However, all participants approved an informed consent form before the studies. Data were collected between March 2020 and February 2021. Only participants whose Prolific submission acceptance rate was 99% and higher and who had not taken part in any of our earlier experiments were included to ensure high data quality. We have performed and reported several data exclusions in Studies 2 and 3a, but including all participants in datasets yielded similar results. THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 10  <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Sova et al., 2019)</ref> served as a basis for item generation. We chose these reports because they focus on threats to future food supply worldwide. Crucially, we assume that threats to the global food supply are necessary for AFS to occur. Whereas threat is not the subject of our study, AFS would not emerge without factors threatening the availability and access to food resources. This process yielded 32 items. Next, we recruited ten native English speakers through Prolific. Their task was to read the AFS definition and propose three items that measure this construct. After removing the items deemed irrelevant and those that depicted unlikely situations in developed countries (e.g., "mass starvation" or "availability of grocery stores"), we added 16 items to the pool. In total, both steps generated 48 items. We did not develop negatively worded items, as such items may bias the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Finally, the items were analyzed with the "Hemingway Editor" software <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Long, 2020)</ref>. This software is used for assessing text difficulty, and it indicated that U.S. pupils in the second grade should be able to understand our item pool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1b: Face validity</head><p>We conducted a face validity study on a target sample to increase the chance that the items were deemed relevant to the construct of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Haynes et al., 1995)</ref>. This study also aimed to reduce the pool of items to those that were the most relevant for measuring AFS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedure</head><p>We recruited 26 native English speakers through Prolific. A similar sample sizes are used in face validity studies involving non-experts recruited online (e.g., Umanath &amp; THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>Coane, 2020). The participants first accepted a consent form and read a definition of AFS.</p><p>Then, they answered three questions regarding each item ("How relevant is each statement to anticipated food scarcity?"; "How easy is the statement below to understand?"; and "Is the statement below grammatically correct?"). They gauged each item's relevance to AFS on a four-point scale ranging from 0 = Not at all relevant to 3 = Very relevant. The participants evaluated how easy the items were to understand. We were not interested in the item difficulty index, which is commonly used in psychometrics, but rather in the participants' impressions of how much effort it took to comprehend the statements. Hence, the participants responded on a five-point scale ranging from 0 = Very difficult to 4 = Very easy.</p><p>Finally, the participants had to state whether the items were grammatically correct on a binary scale, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes. We randomized the order of the items. In the end, the participants were provided with a blank space in which they could suggest improvements. The study ended with the participants providing their demographic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Shrout &amp; Fleiss, 1979)</ref> to assess the agreement between the raters. The intraclass correlation coefficient was obtained by computing a mean-rating, consistency, two-way mixed-effects model (ICC [3,k]) with 26 raters across 48 items measuring the perceived relevance to the AFS. The results (ICC = .79, 95% CI = [.71, .86]) suggested moderate-to-good reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Koo &amp; Li, 2016)</ref>. We removed the items situated below the median scores in the task, where the participants evaluated the relevance of the items to the AFS. This process yielded a 22-item pool. Items that were found to be difficult or grammatically incorrect were reworded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1c: Pretesting</head><p>We conducted a pretest study to primarily examine the performance of the 22-item pool and to further reword the worst-performing items before conducting the main study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 13</head><p>Participants and procedure A sample of 52 native English speakers was recruited through Prolific. The participants first read and completed a consent form. Then, they read the instructions ("The statements below concern food security by 2050</p><p>1 . Indicate how strongly you disagree</p><p>(1) or agree (7) with each statement") and stated how much they agreed with each item.</p><p>We randomized the order of the items. After filling out the scale, the participants were provided with a blank space in which they could suggest improvements. Finally, they provided their demographic information.</p><p>We asked participants about food security rather than food scarcity in instructions because studies on sentence comprehension show that positive sentences are generally easier to understand (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sherman, 1973)</ref>. Moreover, people infer the effort needed to complete the task from the difficulty of its instructions, and they are willing to engage less in tasks deemed difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Song &amp; Schwarz, 2008)</ref>. The word "scarcity" receives 50 times fewer hits in the Google search engine than the word "security." Thus, we deemed the latter term as more straightforward to understand due to its more frequent use. Hence, we instructed participants to think about "food security" to facilitate comprehension and effort put into the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>We first visually inspected the data. Most of the items, with a few exemptions, produced a full range of responses. Skewness and kurtosis outcomes indicated a normal distribution of responses. However, item 5 ("Groceries will be more expensive") produced highly skewed responses (skewness = -1.65; kurtosis = 3.6). Indeed, the statement in this item represents a truism; i.e., due to inflation, it is rational to expect all products to become more expensive over time. This item's mean and standard deviation also suggested a ceiling effect (M = 5.81, SD = 1.24). Therefore, item 5 was flagged for further inspection and rewording. The correlation matrix indicated that some items correlated poorly with the others. Thus, we computed corrected item-scale correlations (each item was correlated with the full scale except with itself). The mean item-scale correlation was .395. Two items did not meet the minimum item-scale correlation of .3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boateng et al., 2018)</ref>; thus, item 3</p><p>(item-scale correlation = .271) and item 21 (item-scale correlation = .200) were flagged for further inspection and rewording. Due to low discrimination and potential ceiling effects, we decided to reword seven items. These items were truisms in most cases (for instance, "Some foods will be more expensive"); thus, most of the respondents strongly agreed with them. Based on this process, we then made the items discussed above more specific (for example, "Food prices will rise faster than wages"). No item was removed from the pool after the pretest study; hence, the 22-item AFSS was psychometrically validated in Study 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Psychometric validation</head><p>Study 2 was conducted to refine and shorten the 22-item pool and to evaluate its psychometric properties. Study 2 left nine items in the pool for further inspection in Study 3a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedure</head><p>We recruited 303 native English speakers through Prolific. The participants were mostly from the United States and the United Kingdom. Sixteen participants failed the first attention check question (instructional manipulation check) and were thus removed from analysis; three participants failed the second attention check question (a question regarding the number of siblings; two-digit answers to this question were considered a failure) and were therefore removed from further analysis. This process yielded a final sample of 284 participants (178 women, M age = 33.8, SD = 12.7).</p><p>The participants first read and accepted a consent form. Then, they read the instructions ("The statements below concern food security by 2050.

Apart from filling out the scale items, THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 15 the participants responded to two attention checks and provided their demographic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>We performed a Mokken scale analysis. The 22-item scale homogeneity (H = .461, SE = .026) indicated a moderate scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mokken, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Van der Ark, 2007</ref>. We used the automated item selection procedure algorithm to see how the items performed at increasing homogeneity thresholds. The items that fell below the threshold of .55 were removed from further analyses. Although this threshold was above the recommended minimum of .3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hemker et al., 1995)</ref>, we decided to increase it to achieve a satisfactory scale length.

Thus, the 9-item solution fulfilled the criteria for the double monotonicity model, and its homogeneity level (H = .656, SE = .025) indicated a strong and unidimensional scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mokken, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Van der Ark, 2007</ref>.</p><p>We explored the unidimensional model fit with a confirmatory factor analysis using the "lavaan" package <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rosseel et al., 2012)</ref>.

Similar to Study 2, the participants were mostly from the United States and the United Kingdom. One participant failed an attention check, which asked about the name of the prime minister or president located in the same country as the participant. This process yielded a final sample of 211 participants (148 women, M age = 32.3, SD = 12.3).</p><p>The procedure and instructions to the AFSS were similar to those used in Study 2.</p><p>Before filling out each questionnaire, we provided separate instructions to ensure that the participants noticed the changing response formats throughout the study (in some cases, the highest agreement rating was the leftmost response, whereas in other cases, it was the rightmost response).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Aside from the AFSS, the participants completed the questionnaires described below. We purposely avoided using the popular USDA Food Security Survey Module in this validation study, as this tool primarily captures the lack of financial resources needed to obtain enough food; thus, it may not cover the whole spectrum of factors contributing to food security <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashby et al., 2016)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Radimer et al., 1990)</ref>. This tool has four items that encompass worry about food resources in various situations. Furthermore, it allows respondents to state how often such events happen in their lives. The participants responded to each of eight statements on a scale ranging from 1 = No, never to 5 = Yes, always. Higher scores correspond to higher levels of food insecurity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES</head><p>Mini-K. The life-history strategy was measured with the Mini-K, which is a short, 20-item version of the Arizona Life History Battery <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Figueredo et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>According to theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hill &amp; Kaplan, 1999)</ref>, humans adopt either a fast or slow life history strategy as a response to the low or high availability of resources in their environment to solve trade-offs between somatic effort (saving energy for growth and survival) and</p><p>reproductive effort (investing energy in reproduction). Life-history strategies can determine variations in human behaviors such as risk-taking, temporal orientation, or proneness to approach temptations. Consequently, studies have found that people who grow up in areas of resource deprivation (environments facilitating fast life-history strategies) are more impulsive and risk-taking, and they approach temptations more quickly than other individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Griskevicius et al., 2013)</ref>. We hypothesized AFS to be positively related to fast life-history strategies, because a shortage of resources favors fast over slow life-history strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Figueredo et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Griskevicius et al., 2013)</ref>.

We measured one personality dimension from the HEXACO-60 short personality inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009)</ref>. Considering that environmental threats have been linked to higher anxiety levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Twenge, 2000)</ref>, we THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 18 hypothesized that more emotional people perceive future food resources as being scarcer compared to the perception of less emotional people. The participants responded to the 10-item measure of emotionality on a five-point scale ranging from 1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree. Higher scores correspond to higher levels of emotionality.</p><p>Generalized Sense of Power Scale. The 8-item Generalized Sense of Power Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson &amp; Galinsky, 2006)</ref> was used to test the prediction that people who believe that they can wield power over others perceive future food resources as more secure as such people may see more ways of obtaining food and other resources than those who have a lower sense of power. Participants responded on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 = Disagree strongly to 7 = Agree strongly. Higher scores represent a higher sense of power.</p><p>Locus of Control Scale. The 29-item Locus of Control Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rotter, 1966)</ref> measures the external versus internal locus of control among participants. Locus of control determines whether people perceive their actions as having an impact on the outcomes from many facets of their daily life. We hypothesized that people with a more external locus of control would score higher on the AFSS, as these individuals believe they do not have control over events such as agricultural turmoil. There are 29 items in total, with two alternatives. The participants had to choose one of the two alternative statements that they agreed with the most. High scores correspond to an external locus of control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>One item lowered the scale's alpha value, and its coefficient of variation was the highest; thus, this item was flagged for further inspection. This item also had a much lower item discrimination coefficient than the rest of the items (these indicators combined suggested that this item could have failed to differentiate well between the participants at different levels of the latent variable).</p><p>We performed a Mokken scale analysis, as described in Study 2. The 9-item AFSS homogeneity coefficient (H = .742, SE = .026) indicated a strong scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mokken, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Van der Ark, 2007</ref>. The automated item selection procedure algorithm suggested THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 19 that the scale was unidimensional; we did not find any group of items "departing" at a certain homogeneity level. No item violated the monotonicity or local independence. One item exceeded the suggested critical value of 80 for invariant item ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Van Schuur, 2003)</ref>, but this violation was not significant. Therefore, the 9-item scale was found to meet the criteria for the double monotonicity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mokken, 1971)</ref>. The item flagged for potential removal in the earlier step contributed to the lowest homogeneity coefficient and violated monotonicity at lower rest score group sizes (Van der Ark, 2007). Thus, this item was removed from further analysis, yielding the 8-item AFSS.</p><p>We explored the unidimensional model fit with a confirmatory factor analysis. The and standard deviation (SD = 1.47) indicated a lack of ceiling or floor effects (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> for the final items included in the scale). Scale skewness (-0.53) and kurtosis (-0.29), as well as a visual inspection of the histograms, indicated a normal distribution of the responses.</p><p>The 8-item AFSS showed low but statistically significant correlations with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (Kendall's τ = .12, p = .017) and the Radimer/Cornell Measure of Hunger and Food Insecurity (Kendall's τ = .14, p = .006). These results provide evidence that anticipated food scarcity is a different construct than the food insecurity studied in the existing literature that refers to retrospective/actual experiences of food unavailability. Interestingly, the AFSS did not correlate with the Mini-K (r = -0.01, p = .867), suggesting that life-history strategies and anticipated food scarcity are unrelated constructs. As predicted, the AFSS correlated positively with the Locus of Control Scale (r = .21, p = .002) and with the emotionality dimension of the HEXACO THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 20 Personality Inventory (r = .19, p = .005). These outcomes suggest that people with an external locus of control and those who are more emotional perceive future food resources as being scarcer. Finally, we found a negative correlation between the AFSS and the Generalized Sense of Power Scale (r = -0.16, p = .018). This result is in line with our prediction that people who believe that they can convince others to do what they want to perceive future food resources as more secure, perhaps because they are more capable of finding ways to access food and other resources. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> provides a summary of the correlations between the 8-item AFSS and the other included scales.</p><p>Studies 2 and 3a jointly confirmed the good psychometric properties of the 8-item AFSS. Although we found significant correlations according to our predictions, the AFSS was only correlated weakly with the scales mentioned above. This means that anticipated food scarcity is a new construct that warrants future investigation. To further support this notion, we performed additional analyses where we controlled for the two existing food insecurity measures that we described above. These analyzes revealed that the AFSS was positively related to emotionality (p = .010). However, both the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and the Radimer/Cornell Measure of Hunger and Food Insecurity were not related to this dimension (both ps &gt; .549). Similarly, only the AFSS (p = .003) was related to locus of control, but the remaining two scales were not (both ps &gt; .401). Further, both the AFSS and the Radimer/Cornell Measure of Hunger and Food Insecurity were marginally related to the Generalized Sense of Power Scale (both ps &lt; .082), as opposed to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (p = .771). Interestingly, the existing tools were related to life-history strategy (both ps &lt; .079), but the AFSS was not (p = .712).</p><p>The low correlations between the AFSS and scales described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009)</ref>, it is justified to expect that AFS, to some extent, captures affective reactions (e.g., anxiety triggered by cues related to food scarcity).</p><p>Indeed, Studies 3a and 5 partially supported this notion. Study 3a provided evidence that people who believe that they have little influence over what happens in the world around them (i.e., having an external locus of control and a low sense of power) score higher on the AFSS. These results align with our definition of this construct and the items capturing it.</p><p>People who believe they can wield power over others and those who have an internal locus of control likely also think that they can obtain access to food resources despite these becoming scarcer. This access depends on their decisions rather than on external circumstances. In sum, Study 3a showed that the AFSS is a construct distinct from the existing food insecurity measures.</p></div>

In contrast to the existing measures-such as HFIAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Coates et al., 2007)</ref>-that focus on past experiences of food insecurity threatening relatively few people living in developed countries, the AFSS captures future-related perceptions among the general population.</p><p>The 8-item AFSS forms a strong, unidimensional scale that meets the criteria for the double monotonicity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Van der Ark, 2007</ref>. The low correlations between the AFSS and Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FAO, 2014), as well as the Radimer/Cornell Measure of Hunger and Food Insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Radimer et al., 1990)</ref>, indicate that AFS and food insecurity, as treated in the current literature, are qualitatively distinct but presumably interrelated constructs. We also found that people with an external locus of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rotter, 1966)</ref>, a lower sense of power <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson &amp; Galinsky, 2006)</ref>, and higher levels of emotionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009)</ref> perceive future food resources as being scarcer.</p><p>Life-history strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Figueredo et al., 2006)</ref> and positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Watson et al., 1988)</ref> were unrelated to AFS scores. Although the AFSS shows positive correlations with negative affect and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Marteau &amp; Bekker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Watson et al., 1988)</ref>, these correlations were weak. More importantly, Study 5 shows that people exposed to food scarcity content score higher ion the AFSS, and these results remain significant even when controlling for negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Thompson, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, it is unlikely that the AFSS captures merely general anxiety or negative affect associated with fear of losing access to food resources.</p><p>Building on the literature postulating that people facing difficulties keep resources to themselves rather than sharing them with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>, we predicted and found that AFS was positively related to support Universal Basic Income <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Nettle et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>However, the scale was not predictive of attitudes toward welfare recipients <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Petersen et al., 2014)</ref>. Taken together, these findings show that AFS may be linked to prosocial behaviors and food preferences.</p><p>The AFSS is sensitive to food scarcity cues. In Study 5, we exposed participants to either an article describing globally rising food scarcity, a video about COVID-19-related food scarcity, or control stimuli. The participants exposed to textual and visual food scarcity content reported higher AFS levels. This outcome suggests that the AFSS can be used in experimental work where researchers may be interested in manipulating AFS.</p><p>The results reported above support the evolutionary mismatch hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Li et al., 2018)</ref>. A mismatch occurs when our psychological mechanisms, which are largely adapted to savannah-like environments (within which our ancestors resided and adapted for millions of years), interact with evolutionarily novel stimuli from our modern world, thereby producing maladaptive outcomes. As a consequence, our evolved mechanisms are often outdated and no longer help us maximize our adaptiveness in the modern world. The environments that fashioned the adaptations that protected our ancestors against periods of food unavailability are vastly different from the current environments.</p><p>Nonetheless, psychological mechanisms did not evolve to distinguish between current and impending threats and those that might occur decades later because such distal threats are largely caused by technological developments that have only taken place in recent years. Thus, the evolutionarily outdated mechanisms may still respond to the same types of threat stimuli in similar ways that are now maladaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Li et al., 2018)</ref>. For instance, recent research suggests that watching climate change-induced food scarcity videos immediately increases preferences toward energy-dense foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Folwarczny et al., 2021)</ref>. Consistently, Study 5 revealed an increase in AFS scores after exposure to food scarcity content. Together, these findings provide convergent support for the evolutionary THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 34 mismatch framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>Although our participants were primarily from developed countries, half of them reported having a college degree, and only 18% reported being unemployed; it remains uncertain how many of them were the recipients of food stamps or related programs. One study found all parents receiving food parcels worried about food insufficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Harvey, 2016)</ref>. Thus, it is plausible that these participants react to food scarcity differently than other individuals. Therefore, future studies should investigate more diverse populations.</p><p>Likewise, the mean AFSS scores reported herein may not indicate the magnitude of the latent variable in less-developed countries.</p><p>The degree to which people may experience food scarcity differs dramatically between developed and less-developed countries. Due to potential habituation, the latter may not respond to the same manipulations used in Study 5. Thus, we cannot claim that our scale is sensitive to food scarcity cues found in countries where people are frequently threatened by actual hunger. Future research should investigate samples in which the experience of actual food scarcity is prevalent. Furthermore, we used overt cues to food scarcity in Study 5 (i.e., even the titles of the articles and videos used in Study 5 mention food unavailability). It is vital to determine whether the scale is sensitive to more subtle cues to food scarcity, such as reports showing rising global temperatures.</p><p>Aside from investigating how severity influences AFS, it would be interesting to test whether the scale is sensitive to the likelihood of food scarcity. For instance, studies could test whether imminent food scarcity yields the same responses as food scarcity that may or may not occur. It is also unknown whether people react similarly to lower levels of food stocks in general as they do to the disappearance of specific foods.</p><p>Finally, the AFSS has not been validated with behavioral measures. Study 4 showed that it could predict food preferences and calorie judgments, and Study 5 showed that the scale is sensitive to food scarcity cues. Although these results are promising, the present THE ANTICIPATED FOOD SCARCITY SCALE (AFSS) 35 findings do not imply that the scale has been validated comprehensively. More studies should establish the scale's predictive validity by, for instance, testing whether high AFS scores correspond to choosing energy-dense over low-calorie foods in laboratory and field experiments. Likewise, it is vital to investigate whether AFS scores can predict the rate of obesity or overweight in populations of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Existing measures have been developed primarily to gauge the prevalence of food insufficiency among low-income populations. However, societies worldwide are consistently informed about publicized events in mass media, such as Brexit, climate change, or pandemics, which pose a threat to the food supply chain. As a result, social groups other than low-income populations may also perceive that food resources are becoming scarcer.</p><p>Although numerous scientific tools exist to measure actual food insecurity (i.e., hunger), none of these tools capture anticipated food scarcity. To address this shortcoming, we developed and psychometrically validated the 8-item AFSS, which was found to be unidimensional and to have good psychometric qualities. Because the scale is sensitive to food scarcity cues, it can be used in experimental research. Its relatively narrow set of items makes it an exceptionally potent tool for use in online surveys, field settings, and lab studies. In sum, the AFSS presents an alternative approach to food scarcity measurement in affluent societies. Consequently, it can help foster novel research on food waste, sustainability, and a multitude of prosocial behaviors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>= 67.515, p &lt; .001, comparative fit index (CFI) = .978, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = .971, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) = .073, 90% CI = [.051, .095], and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .027.
