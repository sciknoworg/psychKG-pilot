			<abstract>
				<p>Theory and research suggest that objective features of a threatening situation and individual differences influence threat responses. We examine three ways individual traits may relate to a threat response: (1) directly and independent of objective threat features, (2) indirectly through relationships with threat perception, or (3) as moderators of the relationship between objective threat features and responses. Using Integrative Data Analysis (IDA; Curran &amp; Hussong, 2009), we aggregated data across three studies examining hurricane preparation intentions. Analysis supported two of the potential pathways. Supporting the first path, both openness and extraversion had direct, positive relationships with preparation likelihood. Supporting the second path, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and social conservatism positively related to preparation likelihood through a positive relationship with threat perception, whereas impulsivity and sensation-seeking negatively related to preparation likelihood through a negative relationship with threat perception. This work shows the pivotal role individual differences play regarding responses to uncertain threats.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Politics, Personality, and Impulsivity Can Color People's Perceptions of-and Responses to-Hurricane Threats of Varying Severity</head><p>Researchers agree that risk and threat perceptions are informed not only by objective risk (e.g., actuarial data like fatality rates or other situational characteristics like windspeed), but also by subjective factors (e.g., feelings of dread; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Slovic, 1992)</ref>. Indeed, compared with experts, lay people viewed their lives as more at risk from a nuclear weapon (only two have been used in war) than from being in a car accident (two have likely occurred since you started reading this paper; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Slovic et al., 1980)</ref>. Since discovering subjective risk perception, researchers developed numerous theories and experiments to understand what influences it. The present research contributes to this larger literature by examining how individual differences like personality and political orientation can explain some of the variance in subjective risk and threat perception, threat-related intentions, and behavior in the context of hurricanes.</p><p>Hurricanes present people with an uncertain threat. Although advances in storm-tracking allows us to now have numerous days to anticipate a hurricane's arrival, many aspects remain unclear until the storm's landfall. Facing this threat means deciding whether preparation is necessary, and if so, how much is needed. These decisions involve determining the level of threat the storm presents and weighing the costs associated with both over-and underpreparing for it.</p><p>As climate change progresses and disasters increase in intensity and frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gutmann et al., 2018)</ref>, developing a psychological understanding of how people make decisions under these uncertain threats is crucial. Further, examining people's responses to uncertain weather threats can illuminate how psychological factors like individual differences in personality and political orientation might relate to the perceptions, intentions, and behaviors related to other types of uncertain threats like health and gun violence. Importantly, although the current paper focuses on personality and political orientation differences, we expect that other individual differences (e.g., income or social network characteristics) might also relate to uncertain threat perceptions and responses.</p><p>Regarding threat and subjective perceptions of that threat, extensive negativity bias research shows that people attend to and recall negative events and information more easily than positive ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baumeister et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rozin &amp; Rozyman, 2001)</ref>. Similarly, research on attitudes shows that negativity's influences on behavior are stronger and last longer than those of positivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cacioppo, Gardner, &amp; Berntson, 1997)</ref>. When making decisions under uncertainty, research on loss aversion shows that people weigh losses more heavily than gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1991)</ref>. Other research shows that severe events tend to seem more probable than non-severe events with similar base rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Weber &amp; Hilton, 1990)</ref>. In research on perceptions of hurricane threats, people tend to overestimate the probability that a severe, Category-5 storm (vs. a less-severe, Category-1 storm) will strike in a given location <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Wu et al., 2014)</ref>. Even as hurricane forecasts change, if people hear at some point that a hurricane was a severe, Category-5 storm, they show an anchoring-like bias whereby they fail to sufficiently adjust their expectations and intentions to prepare for the storm based on updated information that the storm is less severe <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Losee, Naufel, Locker, &amp; Webster, 2017)</ref>. Studying variation in threat perception is important because it leads to differences in threat-related intentions. For example, people are more likely to prepare for hurricanes that they believe pose legitimate threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dash &amp; Gladwin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Whitehead, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Despite a large body of evidence supporting negativity bias and demonstrating negativity bias in hurricane perception and intentions, people sometimes remain unprepared even for severe threats. Thus, theories developed both in weather <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lindell &amp; Perry, 2012)</ref> and health <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rogers, 1975</ref>) research explain the importance of additional personal and situational factors that influence noncompliance, risk reduction, and threat perception. These theories explain that people form impressions of the threat and the potential actions they could take; these impressions then influence what people do. Prior research covers factors influencing people's perceptions and actions such as demographics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DeYoung et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lazo, Bostrom, Morss, Demuth, &amp; Lazrus, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Petrolia &amp; Bhattcharjee, 2010)</ref>, location <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Reininger et al., 2013)</ref>, and access to quality information <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Liu et al., 1996)</ref>. Indeed, the number of personal and situational factors examined in prior work is large <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sorenson, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential Responses to Threat</head><p>The present research extends prior theorizing by presenting yet another possibility-that individual differences also relate to people's threat perceptions and threat-related intentions and behaviors ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Specifically, we propose that differences in personality and political orientation may influence threat-related intentions and behaviors via three possible paths: (1) directly and independent of objective features of the threat like its severity, (2) indirectly through their relationship with threat perception, and (3) as moderators of the relationship between an objective threat feature like severity and threat-related intentions and behavior. In the following sections, we outline the theoretical reasons why these pathways might exist and identify clusters of individual differences that correlated with threat-related variables in previous researchimpulsivity and sensation-seeking, Big-Five personality traits, and political orientation. difference variable may relate to threat-related intentions and behavior either directly and independent of an objective threat feature or indirectly through its relationship with threat-related perception. Bottom panel: An individual difference may also moderate the relationship between an objective threat feature and threat perception and/or threatrelated intentions and behavior.</p><p>As stated above, many theories that explain responses to various threats implicate perception of the threat as an important step in the threat decision-making process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lindell &amp; Perry, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rogers, 1975)</ref>. Thus, for an individual difference to relate to a threat-related intention or behavior, it may do so directly or indirectly through a relationship with perception.</p><p>The current work contributes to these general models of threat response that stress the importance of individual differences in the threat-response process. Yet these general models often fail to show which specific individual differences are important and how they influence the threat-response process. Further, although some research suggests that risk preference in and of itself is an individual difference (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blais &amp; Weber, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Frey, Pedroni, Mata, Rieskamp, &amp; Hertwig, 2017)</ref>, we opted to examine the role of specific individual differences-Big Five personality traits, impulsivity and sensation-seeking, and political orientation-in the threatresponse process for which prior research sets a precedent.</p><p>Previous theorizing about Big Five traits-agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and neuroticism-in relation to threat, such as the Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T; DeYoung, 2015) suggest that researchers should observe reliable relationships between Big Five traits and threat responses. CB5T (DeYoung, 2015) posits that personality represents a cybernetic system or reliable pattern of behavior that constantly receives, interprets, and acts on feedback from the environment. Specifically, CB5T describes how personality should influence responses to "anomalies" or events that disrupt the use of one's typical characteristic adaptations (i.e., the behaviors that emerge as a result of one's traits). When an anomaly like a hurricane or some other uncertain threat approaches, CB5T argues that people's traits guide the process of "exploration" in which people will develop characteristic adaptations to this new situation. Thus, this theory argues that personality traits should give some reliable indication of the adaptations a person will select during one of these anomalies.</p><p>In a similar vein, the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST), which outlines approachavoidance systems guiding behavior, identifies personality as important in responses to and interpretations of aversive versus appetitive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Corr, 2004)</ref>. This perspective focuses on the dimensions of neuroticism (vs. stability) and extraversion (vs. introversion) as the dimensions on which people differ in their interpretations of and responses to aversive versus appetitive stimuli but is not limited to these traits. In the context of uncertain threats like hurricanes, this theory supports the assertion that traits relate to both how a person might construe the threat and how they may respond to it.</p><p>The current research follows previous research establishing specific relationships between Big Five traits and responses to a variety of threatening stimuli. For example, high neuroticism is associated with increased risk-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Merritt &amp; Tharp, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Terracciano &amp; Costa, 2004)</ref>. In health contexts, conscientiousness relates to health intentions and perceived risk of severe consequences of not completing intended health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Conner &amp; Abraham, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hampson, Andrews, Barckley, Lichtenstein, &amp; Lee, 2000)</ref>. Further, agreeableness (the Big Five trait most likely to have developed as an adaptation to an increasingly social world; DeYoung, 2015) positively correlates with perceiving social threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(White et al., 2012)</ref>. Alternatively, some research finds that agreeable people have more positive attitudes toward diversity <ref type="bibr">(Strauss, Connerley, &amp; Ammermann, 2003)</ref> and immigrants <ref type="bibr">(Dinesen, Klemmensen, Norgaard, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vecchione, Capara, Schoen, Gonzalez Castro, &amp; Schwartz, 2011)</ref>, which can represent social threats. In the context of hurricanes, however, the relationship between agreeableness and threat perception and intentions may depend on the facet of agreeableness assessed. For example, the agreeableness facet of compliance may especially influence hurricane-related perceptions and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Costa, McCrae, &amp; Dye, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Beyond Big Five traits, previous research sets a precedent for examining the relationship between impulsivity and sensation-seeking and threat responses. For example, people high in impulsivity and sensation-seeking-behaviors characterized by greater risk-taking-often have lower levels of threat perception and tend to ignore or dismiss approaching threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arnett, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lauriola, Panno, Levin, &amp; Lejuez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nicholson et al., 2005)</ref>. Even though some research suggests a general inclination to weigh losses more heavily than rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1991)</ref>, research on impulsivity and sensation-seeking shows that people high in these traits weigh rewards and losses differently <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kruschwitz, Simmons, Flagan, &amp; Paulus, 2012)</ref>. Importantly, the link between sensation-seeking and risk-taking behavior appears to be driven by weaker threat avoidance (rather than stronger reward approach; <ref type="bibr">Zheng, Tian, Li, &amp; Liu, 2018)</ref>. In the case of the current work, however, it is less clear how sensation-seeking and impulsivity may relate to threat responses when preparing is neither inherently nor immediately rewarding.</p><p>Another line of inquiry sets a precedent for examining political orientation-the values, personality traits, and motivations related to a liberal or conservative orientation-in relation to threat responses. The Uncertainty Avoidance model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jost et al., 2007)</ref> posits that greater uncertainty and threat avoidance predicts greater levels of political conservatism. Research also links political conservatism to individual differences in negativity bias, suggesting that being more conservative relates to being more threat sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hibbing, Smith, &amp; Alford, 2014)</ref>, especially for social conservatives and particularly when the threat is physical <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Crawford, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Other research suggests that conservatives (vs. liberals) tend to be more conscientious <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carney, Jost, &amp; Gosling, 2008)</ref>, resistant to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jost et al., 2007)</ref>, and avoidance-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Shook &amp; Fazio, 2009)</ref>. Again, it is also possible that individual differences may directly relate to threat-related intentions and behaviors such as hurricane preparation because such behaviors represent direct expressions of those traits. For example, willingness to persevere and complete difficult tasks, like preparing for a hurricane, is characteristic of people high in conscientiousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Costa et al., 1991)</ref>. Greater risk taking is also characteristic of people scoring high on impulsivity and sensation-seeking measures <ref type="bibr">(Zuckerman, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>A third possibility is that an individual difference may moderate the relationship between an objective feature of the threat and that feature's relationship with intentions and behaviors.</p><p>Related to negativity bias, although people may perceive negativity more readily than positivity, there are likely meaningful individual differences in how readily people perceive negativity. For example, age may moderate negativity bias. As people age, negatively framed messages exert less of an impact on judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sparks &amp; Ledgerwood, 2019)</ref>. Although we did not examine age as a moderator in the current work, it is possible that Big Five personality traits interact with severity to either augment or diminish the links between severity and hurricane-related intentions and behaviors. For example, people scoring high on neuroticism may not necessarily encounter more negative situations, but they do tend to construe the positive situations they encounter as less positive than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rauthmann, Sherman, Nave, &amp; Funder, 2015)</ref>. Similarly, people who report higher daily neuroticism report fewer positive and more negative social events, likely based on their perceptions of social situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hadden, Smith, Osborne, &amp; Webster, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, personality traits may interact with severity in relation to risk or threat perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the Present Research</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we propose that individual differences covary with differences in risk and threat perception along with threat-related behaviors. Individual differences may relate to hurricane-related behavior via one of three paths. First, individual differences may correspond to hurricane-related behaviors because they also relate to risk and threat perception, which correlate on their own with hurricane-related behavior. Second, individual differences may relate to hurricane-related behavior directly and independent of perception. Third, individual differences may moderate the relationship between an objective threat feature like severity and perception and intentions. We collected data to test these pathways in three separate studies.</p><p>However, because these studies largely overlapped in terms of design and content, we decided to conduct an integrative data analysis (IDA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Curran &amp; Hussong, 2009)</ref>. IDA aggregates the data across all three studies, increasing sample size while controlling for study-level differences.</p><p>Below we describe the method for each study or sample, the process we used to aggregate the three datasets, and the results from this single, aggregated dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>Participants. We recruited 209 adult participants via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Buhrmester, Kwang, &amp; Gosling, 2016)</ref>; 199 were Florida residents. Ten non-Florida residents completed the survey in error. Sampling hurricane-prone Florida residents was important because they have a stake in hurricane decision-making. We excluded from analyses three participants who responded "no" to the question, "In your honest opinion, should we use your data in our analysis of this study?" We also excluded one participant for incomplete responses, leaving 196 participants for analyses.</p><p>Design and measures. Participants completed (a) the measures described below in a randomized order, (b) an inventory of their past and expected future hurricane-related behaviors, (c) measures of their perceived likelihood of experiencing a hurricane, and (d) demographic items. The measures examined were part of a larger dataset (see OSF page for full survey; blind review link: https://osf.io/qh2z8/?view_only=98693044dfee42c0b8eca0eda728d7ed).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impulsivity and sensation-seeking.</head><p>The 19-item Impulsivity and Sensation Seeking Scale (ImpSS; Zuckerman, 1999) measured impulsivity and sensation-seeking with true-or-false items (e.g., "I often do things on impulse" for impulsivity; "I like doing things just for the thrill of it" for sensation-seeking).</p><p>Political orientation. Two measures assessed participants' political orientation. The first was a single item (-3 = mostly liberal to 3 = mostly conservative). The second was the Social and Economic Conservatism Scale (SECS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Everett, 2013)</ref>. Twelve items on a scale from (0 = Negative; 100 = Positive) separately measured people's feelings about social (e.g., "traditional values") and economic (e.g., "fiscal responsibility") conservative issues.</p><p>Big-Five personality traits. Using a response scale from 1 (Very Inaccurate) to 5 (Moderately Accurate), the 20-item International Personality Item Pool (Mini-IPIP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Donnellan et al., 2006)</ref> measured the Big-Five personality traits: agreeableness (e.g., "I feel others' emotions"), conscientiousness (e.g., "I like order"), neuroticism (e.g., "I get upset easily"), openness (e.g., "I have a vivid imagination"), and extraversion (e.g., "I am the life of the party").</p><p>Behavior likelihood inventory. To measure hurricane-related behavior likelihood, participants completed a behavior inventory comprised of items from Ready.gov, the U.S.'s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's weather preparedness website (NOAA, 2014), such as "cover windows" or "learn evacuation routes," using a response scale of 0 (Not Likely) to 100 (Likley). Focal items for this analysis were the eight that formed a single factor representing preparedness intentions (see Supplement on OSF page for factor-analytic results; blind review link: https://osf.io/qh2z8/?view_only=98693044dfee42c0b8eca0eda728d7ed).</p><p>Threat perception. To measure perceived threat, participants used a 15-item checklist to indicate the safety concerns they had about hurricanes (e.g., mold, looting, fire); we summed the number of checks. Participants then indicated the extent to which a list of 10 words (e.g., thrilling, terrifying) described hurricanes using a scale of 0 (Not accurate) to 100 (Very accurate). We took the average rating of the five threat words (i.e., terrifying, scary, alarming, distressing, something to avoid) as descriptive of hurricanes to obtain a composite threat perception score.</p><p>Risk perception. Using a scale from 0 (not likely) to 100 (highly likely), participants rated their perceived likelihood of being in the path of a hurricane. For income (USD), participants answered on scale from 1 ($0-$9.9k) to 11 ($100k-above) in equal increments of $10k (Mdn = 4 [≈ $35k], M = 4.31, SD = 2.53). For dwelling type, participants selected from "mobile home" (6.1%), "single-family home" (61.2%), "duplex"</p><p>(4.1%), "apartment building" (21.9%), "townhouse complex" (5.1%), "motor home" (0.5%), or "other" (1%). Participant zip codes were classified as coastal (or not) depending on whether they bordered either the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico; 68.4% resided in coastal zip codes and 31.6% did not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>Participants. We recruited 328 adult Florida residents via MTurk. We excluded participants for one or all of three reasons: (1) responding "no" to the instructional manipulation check asking if we should keep their data, (2) not being a Florida resident, and (3) having incomplete data. Although all participants responded "yes" regarding keeping their data, excluding participants who had non-Florida zip codes (n = 30) reduced our sample to 298 participants. No participants were excluded for missing data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and measures. Study 2's design was the same as Study 1 except that it included</head><p>an experimental manipulation of threat. Specifically, before participants completed the behavior likelihood inventory, they watched a hypothetical hurricane warning for either a Category 1, 3, or 5 storm (see videos on OSF page using blind review link: https://osf.io/qh2z8/?view_only=98693044dfee42c0b8eca0eda728d7ed). The warning videos were black-and-white, with scrolling white text that included a computerized voice reading the text. Participants then completed the risk and threat perception measures and the behavior likelihood inventory in relation to the hurricane in the video. Thinking of this storm, people estimated how likely they were to perform the behaviors in the behavior inventory. All measures for Study 1 were also used in Study 2.</p><p>Participants also answered demographic questions such as sex (56.4% female, 42.6% male, 0.3% other), age (M = 35.05 years, SD = 11.99), income, dwelling type, and zip code of residence. For income (USD), participants answered on a scale from 1 ($0-$9.9k) to 11 ($100kabove) in equal increments of $10k (Mdn = 4 [≈ $35k], M = 4.31, SD = 2.53). For dwelling type, participants selected from "mobile home" (4.4%), "single-family home" (64.4%), "duplex"</p><p>(3.7%), "apartment building" (16.8%), "townhouse complex" (9.4%), "motor home" (0.7%), or "other" (0.7%). Participant zip codes were classified as coastal (or not) depending on whether they bordered the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico; 68.4% resided in coastal zip codes, 31.6% did not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Participants. We recruited 1,089 adult participants from southeastern coastal states (i.e., Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas) via Amazon's MTurk. Sampling hurricane-prone coastal residents was important because they have a stake in hurricane decision-making. We excluded from analyses 114 participants who did not finish the study (n = 83), responded "no" to the question, "In your honest opinion, should we use your data in our analysis of this study?" (n = 24), had a survey duration &gt; 14 SDs above the mean duration of 32.6 minutes (n = 2), and who we suspected of being a "bot" for responses like "good" for all open-ended responses (n = 5). After excluding these participants, we had a sample of 975 participants.</p><p>Design and measures. Study 3 was largely similar in design to Study 1 and 2, but did have some notable differences. First, to measure Big-Five personality traits, Study 3 used the 44item Big Five Inventory (BFI-44; John &amp; Srivastava, 1999) rather than the Mini-IPIP <ref type="bibr">(Donellan et al., 2006)</ref> used in Studies 1 and 2. Participants responded to BFI items used a response scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Second, this study measured the individual difference variables last whereas Studies 1 and 2 measured them first. Third, Study 3 was a larger study than Studies 1 and 2 in that it included several other individual difference measures, perceptual variables, and a tornado task in addition to the hurricane task. It also included only two (vs. three) conditions for the severity manipulation (Category 1 vs. 3; see OSF blind review link for full survey: https://osf.io/qh2z8/?view_only=98693044dfee42c0b8eca0eda728d7ed).</p><p>The sample was composed of 60.8% women and 39.1% men (0.1% preferred not to respond) with a mean age of 38.48 years (SD = 12.22). In this sample, 76.6% of participants identified as White, 13.3% identified as Black/African American, 9.23% identified as Hispanic, 5.54% identified as Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.64% identified as Native American, Eskimo or Aleut, and 0.2% identified as Middle Eastern or Arab American.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrative Data Analysis (IDA)</head><p>IDA is a framework for analyzing data from multiple studies in which the investigator has access to the raw data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Curran &amp; Hussong, 2009)</ref>. IDA, which uses raw or primary data, contrasts with meta-analysis, which relies on summary or secondary data (e.g., effect sizes; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Webster, 2019)</ref>. In this way, IDA allows one to analyze data from all studies as a set while controlling for between-study differences. Using IDA, we aggregated the data from our three studies (N = 1,469) and created two contrast codes that controlled for study-level differences.</p><p>The first code (Code 1) compared the average of Studies 1 and 2 to Study 3. The second code (Code 2) compared Study 1 to Study 2. Although Study 1 did not include a manipulation of severity like Studies 2 and 3, Study 1's participants were asked to imagine a Category 3 hurricane as they completed the hurricane perceptions items and their behavior likelihood inventory. Thus, when we aggregated, the severity manipulation-Categories 1, 3, and 5-varied across the three studies, with all participants from Study 1 receiving the Category-3 condition.</p><p>Because of the increased sample size (and hence, statistical power) that IDA affords, we only interpret effects that have (partial) correlations ≥ .10 in absolute magnitude. With a pooled sample of 1,469, we had &gt; .95 power to detect effects of |r| = .10 or greater. Thus, we have chosen to consider effects of |r| ≥ .10 as "significant," which, given our pooled sample size, roughly corresponds to setting  = .0001 (two-tailed).</p><p>In addition to differing in study design (e.g., correlational vs. experimental), the three studies differed in other ways. For example, Studies 1 and 2 were conducted with only Florida residents, whereas Study 3 included participants from coastal counties in eight southeastern U.S. states (including Florida). Because the studies differed in multiple overlapping ways that would be difficult to disentangle, we will not directly interpret any significant effects of the two between-study contrast codes; however, we have included them in our IDA to control for any between-study differences-variance that does not directly concern our hypotheses.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the spirit of transparency, we describe study-level differences in the Discussion to provide possible insights for future research. Finally, a major strength of IDA is that it combines data from multiple studies yielding greater power to detect effects and greater confidence in the observed relationships. This strength is particularly important for the current research, which, although theoretically supported, is largely exploratory in its focus on specific individual differences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Severity Mediation</head><p>We first examined the previously theorized relationship between a threat and threat response by testing whether the effect of the severity manipulation on preparation likelihood was mediated by the three perceptual variables (i.e., threat-word ratings, safety concerns, and risk perception; <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Because the severity manipulation had three levels (Category 1, 3, or 5), we examined its linear (-1, 0, 1) effect as the main predictor while controlling for its quadratic (1, -2, 1) effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Judd, McClelland, &amp; Ryan, 2017)</ref>. We also controlled for the two study-level differences contrast codes (Code 1 and Code 2). The linear and quadratic effect of severity positively related to threat-word ratings and only the linear effect of severity related to preparation likelihood. Regarding threat-word ratings, the significant linear effect of severity indicates that people endorsed greater threat as severity increased from Category 1 to Category 5. The significant linear and quadratic effects of severity indicated a steeper increase in threat perception between Category 1 and Category 3 than between Category 3 and Category 5.</p><p>Combined, the three perceptual variables partially mediated the relationship between linear severity and preparation likelihood. This total indirect effect was driven largely by threat-word ratings and safety concerns, whereas risk perception failed to reach significance by our |r| ≥ .10 standard. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zero-Order Correlations</head><p>First, using a data-driven approach to model building, we examined the zero-order correlations between the individual differences and preparation likelihood to examine which variables played a significant role in the threat response process. We then used those significant correlates as predictors in subsequent models. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows correlations between the two codes for the severity manipulation (linear and quadratic severity), the three perceptual variables (threat word ratings, safety concerns, and risk perception), the individual difference variables, and preparation likelihood. We observed seven significant correlations (i.e., |r|s ≥ .10) between individual differences and preparation likelihood: agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, social conservatism, impulsivity, and sensation-seeking. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation Analyses</head><p>Using the seven individual difference variables that had significant correlations with preparation intentions (i.e., conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, openness, social conservatism, impulsivity, and sensation-seeking), we conducted seven separate mediation tests (Process Model 4; Hayes, 2017; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). Controlling for severity and between-study differences, models examining the direct relationship between each focal individual difference variable and preparation intentions revealed support for Path 1 (individual differences relate to threat response independent of severity) for all seven individual difference variables. Preparation intentions related positively to conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, openness and social conservatism, and negatively to impulsivity and sensation-seeking, independent of the effects of the severity manipulation and between-study differences. Note that most estimates remained consistent from the severity mediation model <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref> to each of the seven individual difference models <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3)</ref> indicating that these individual difference variables can relate to preparation likelihood independent of an objective threat feature such as hurricane severity.</p><p>Supporting Path 2 (individual differences relate to a threat response through their relationships with cognitions and perceptions), five of these relationships with preparation intentions were partially mediated by the total indirect effect comprising the three perceptual variables (threat-word rating, safety concerns, and risk perception; <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>). Although all three perceptual variables comprised the total indirect effect, risk perception did not account for a significant amount of variance in any model. For agreeableness, conscientiousness, and social conservatism, the total indirect effect was driven by threat-word ratings and safety concerns. For impulsivity and sensation seeking, the only threat-word ratings contributed significantly to the indirect effect. Further, sensation-seeking's relationship with preparation intentions was fully mediated by the indirect effect, of which threat-word ratings was the only significant contributor.</p><p>Although not the focus of our hypotheses in these models, hurricane severity and between-study differences had some significant effects (i.e., |r|s ≥ .10) on the perceptual variables and preparation intentions. As in the original severity mediation model <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>, the linear and quadratic effects of severity were significant for threat-word ratings, but not safety concerns and risk perception. The significant linear and quadratic effects of severity for threatword ratings suggested a steeper increase between Category 1 and Category 3 than between Category 3 and Category 5.</p><p>Significant study-level differences emerged across all seven models for risk perception and preparation likelihood. Regarding risk perception, the code comparing the average of Studies 1 and 2 to Study 3 (Code 1) indicated that risk perception scores were higher in Studies 1 and 2 than in Study 3. Regarding preparation likelihood, both Code 1 and Code 2 (comparison between Studies 1 and 2) were significant showing that people reported being more likely to prepare in Study 3 compared to Studies 1 and 2, and that people reported being more likely to prepare in Study 1 than in Study 2. Because the three studies differed in multiple ways, it cannot be known if this variation is meaningful or systematic. Including these predictors was, however, necessary for (a) testing the hypothesized linear effect of severity and (b) controlling for between-study differences, thus allowing us to run an appropriate IDA. Each mediation test was run separately for each individual difference variable. The rows called "ID" refer to the individual difference listed at the top of the column. Code 1 refers to the variable controlling for differences between the average of Study 1 and 2 vs. Study 3. Code 2 refers to the variables controlling for the difference between Study 1 and Study 2. N = 1,469. Partial correlations (rps) ≥ .10 in absolute magnitude are significant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderated Mediation Analyses</head><p>To test whether individual differences moderate the relationship between severity and preparation likelihood (Path 3), we examined seven moderated mediation models for each of the focal individual differences (Process Model 59; Hayes, 2017; <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>). Across the seven models, none of these interactions had partial correlations ≥ .10 in absolute magnitude (they ranged from .05 to .07). Thus, because we only considered effect sizes of |r| ≥ .10 to be meaningful, we did not interpret these interactions further. Additionally, we examined whether the indirect effects of the perceptual variables on the relationship between severity and preparation likelihood were moderated by the individual difference variables ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>).</p><p>The indirect effect of severity to preparation likelihood through the threat word ratings remained significant at all levels of all individual difference variables with two exceptions-the 84 th percentiles of impulsivity and sensation-seeking. (Process <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Hayes, 2017]</ref> tests simple effects at the 16 th , 50 th , and 84 th percentiles of the moderating variable, which roughly corresponds -1, 0, and 1 SDs from its mean, assuming a normal distribution.) The indirect effect of safety concerns was only significant by the |r| ≥ .10 standard in a few cases-at the 16 th and 50 th percentile of agreeableness and the 16 th percentile of social conservatism. Because these differences do not appear systematic, we hesitate to interpret them as meaningful. The indirect effect of risk perception remained non-significant by the |r| ≥ .10 standard. Importantly, the indirect effect of threat-word ratings, which made up the largest portion of the total indirect effect of severity on preparation likelihood, remained stable across the individual difference variables.  <ref type="bibr">[-.16, -.06]</ref> Note. Each test was run separately for each individual difference variable. The rows called "ID" refer to the individual difference listed at the top of the column. Code 1 refers to the variable controlling for differences between the average of Study 1 and 2 vs. Study 3. Code 2 refers to the variables controlling for the difference between Study 1 and Study 2. N = 1,469. Partial correlations (rps) ≥ .10 in absolute magnitude are significant. Note. N = 1,469. Partial correlations (rps) ≥ .10 in absolute magnitude are significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this research, we proposed that individual differences should relate to people's responses to uncertain threats. We found that higher agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, sensation-seeking, impulsivity, and social conservatism each related positively to people's perceptions of hurricanes and preparation intentions. The studies presented here collectively provide novel evidence in support of two of the three potential pathways we tested between individual differences and threat responses: (1) individual differences relate to threat response directly and independent of objective threat features (e.g., threat severity), and</p><p>(2) individual differences relate to threat responses through their relationship with threat perception. Supporting the first path, both openness and extraversion had direct relationships with preparation likelihood. People who were higher in either openness or extraversion reported being more likely to prepare for a hurricane independent of the severity of the hurricane.</p><p>Supporting the second path, we found that agreeableness, conscientiousness, and social conservatism positively related to preparation likelihood through a positive relationship with threat-word ratings, whereas impulsivity and sensation-seeking negatively related to preparation likelihood through a negative relationship with threat-word ratings. We discuss each individual difference below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Individual-Differences Perspective on Threat Perception and Behavior</head><p>Agreeableness, conscientiousness, and social conservatism all positively related to preparation likelihood, relationships that were partially mediated by threat perception. Thus, people who are more agreeable, conscientious, or conservative are more likely to perceive threat, and thus more likely to report intentions to prepare for a hurricane. These relationships are largely consistent with prior literature. Regarding agreeableness, agreeable people are more compliant which in its original meaning suggested an increased tendency to defer rather than fight in a conflict. Agreeable people are also more trusting, which in its original meaning indicated an increased tendency to see benevolent intent in other <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Costa et al., 1991)</ref>. Thus, in the situation of a hurricane, a person who is agreeable, and thus, more trusting and compliant, likely has a stronger tendency to perceive a situation and take action in line with what official sources recommend. In addition, research shows positive relationships between agreeableness and other threat perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(White, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Strauss et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dinesen et al., 2011)</ref>. Regarding conscientiousness, preparation is a behavior that is often characteristic of highly conscientious people (e.g., someone who is orderly, responsible, and dependable; John &amp; Srivastava, 1999).</p><p>Preparation allows conscientious people to be responsible and dependable because it can reduce the burden of recovery efforts that must be spent on those unwilling or unable to prepare.</p><p>Previous research has also hypothesized and observed relationships between conservatism and threat sensitivity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hibbing et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jost et al., 2007)</ref>. One caveat, however, is that emerging research also suggests that correlations between political ideology and threat are context dependent. For example, researchers discovered that conservatives were more likely to demonstrate an avoidant learning style for novel stimuli when they learned about beans <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Shook &amp; Fazio, 2009)</ref>, but liberals exhibited an avoidant learning style in the context of novel stimuli described as stocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fiagbenu, Proch, &amp; Kessler, 2019)</ref>. As such, although the current data are more in line with findings that conservatism is related to threat sensitivity, there may be other threat contexts where the relationship is the opposite or does not exist-a possibility we discuss later.</p><p>In addition, impulsivity and sensation-seeking negatively related to preparation intentions. Further, these relationships were mediated by negative relationships with threat perception. People higher in impulsivity and sensation-seeking perceived less threat, and were thus less likely to report intentions to prepare. This finding is consistent with existing research showing that highly impulsive and sensation-seeking people are less sensitive to losses and more likely to take risks <ref type="bibr">(Lauriola, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2018)</ref>. The relationships linking sensation-seeking and impulsivity with preparation intentions also suggest that people higher in sensation-seeking may have different goals regarding hurricane threat. It may be more important for high-sensation-seekers to experience the hurricane than it is for them to avoid it or prepare for it.</p><p>Finally, extraversion and openness positively related to preparation intentions, but these relationships were not mediated by threat perception. Both Big Five traits directly related to preparation intentions, independent of the severity effect. This relationship likely emerged because something about preparation is characteristic of openness and extraversion. Indeed, both extraversion and openness are described as active and approach-oriented traits (DeYoung, 2015; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Corr, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">John &amp; Srivastava, 1999)</ref>. According to theorizing based in CB5T, uncertain threats or anomalous events create psychological entropy, which is a state of confusion that occurs when a situation does not match expectations. Traits influence the strategies one takes to reduce that entropy. Specifically related to extraversion and openness, increased psychological entropy may indicate one has an opportunity to transform an uncertain situation into one that is more predictable. And for this reason, people who are higher in these traits may be more willing to test different strategies to reach that goal (DeYoung, 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Implications</head><p>The present studies have multiple limitations. Aside from the severity manipulations, most variables were self-report and the study designs were correlational. In other words, the usual biases of self-report data <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Paulhus &amp; Vazire, 2007)</ref> and the limited causal claims regarding correlational data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kenny, 2004)</ref> clearly apply here. As with any study, there is a chance that some of the results are false positives (Type-I errors). Using IDA, however, afforded a much larger sample than each individual study alone, allowed for fewer tests (reducing the risk of multi-study Type-I errors), and offered some limited insight regarding whether differences in research design contributed to variability across the studies. Importantly, with this larger sample and controlling for these between-study differences, we observed stable effects. But our IDA did show some substantial variation in threat perception and preparation intentions across studies.</p><p>Because the number of differences between studies exceeded the number of studies themselves (i.e., k = 3), we were unable to isolate and identify the precise source of the between-study variability. Nevertheless, below we describe each contrast code and the potential between-study differences each could represent. experimental (Study 2). Further, Study 1 included verbal instructions for imagining a Category 3 hurricane, whereas Study 2 participants were randomly assigned to watch a video of a warning for a Category 1, 3, or 5 hurricane before completing the behavior likelihood inventory.</p><p>In conclusion, the number of between-study differences make it difficult to determine the source of the between-study differences. Although these differences are difficult to interpret, they provide paths for future investigations. For example, future research could systematically vary each of these potential differences while holding the others constant. Despite these limitations, the IDA analysis allows for a high-powered test of our focal variables while controlling for the effects of between-study differences, increasing our confidence in the results.</p><p>In addition to possible research-design influences, the present results may differ in other threat contexts. For example, our research failed to observe an often-theorized relationship between neuroticism and threat response (e.g., DeYoung, 2015). It is entirely possible that different personality traits predict responses to different threats. Perhaps a trait like neuroticism differentiates or predicts responses to health or social threats rather than to weather threats like hurricanes. Future research could examine how the relationships linking personality traits and threats might be context-dependent.</p><p>That our results may be context-dependent need not make our findings any less important. Indeed, this particular research can provide insights for weather researchers, who tend to focus on factors such as the severity of the storm <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Whitehead et al., 2000)</ref>, people's previous experience with hurricanes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Demuth, Morss, Lazo, &amp; Trumbo, 2016)</ref>, and how people process information about hurricanes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lindell &amp; Perry, 2012)</ref>. The present research provides a creative and theoretically novel advancement: People's individual characteristics may influence the way that they see themselves at risk or under threat, and these perceptions may explain why some people prepare for severe threats while others do not. This research is also unique because it uses an experimental manipulation of severity to compare the effects of these internal, subjective processes against more objective factors like storm severity.</p><p>Further, our research shows that individual differences in personality and political orientation have real consequences for people's health and survival. Indeed, our research suggests that people who are more agreeable, conscientious, extraverted, open, and socially conservative are more likely to survive a hurricane with less damage than those who are lower in these traits or more socially liberal. Indeed, the possible implications of our findings are becoming increasingly clear as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. For example, early research shows that political ideology is an important predictor of adherence to social distancing recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (Pew Research Center, 2020).</p><p>Speaking to the context-dependency of our findings, people in more conservative U.S. counties were less likely to comply with state-issued social-distancing orders, and thus may be at a greater risk of both contracting and spreading the virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Painter &amp; Qiu, 2020)</ref>. Although speculative, this context dependency may relate to causal beliefs. For example, U.S. conservatives who believe conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being a hoax were less likely to avoid crowds and wash their hands, whereas those who believed it was a bioweapon were more likely to stock food and wear masks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Imhoff &amp; Lamberty, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Further, because social distancing requires that people spend more time in their homes and avoid other people, it is likely more difficult to adhere to recommendations for people who are higher in action-oriented traits like extraversion and openness. Thus, people who are more open or extraverted may face and pose a greater risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The present study clearly shows that personality traits can be critical in understanding why some people react differently to the same information about hurricanes and threat severity.</p><p>The current work corroborates and advances existing theories about hurricane threat responses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lindell &amp; Perry, 2012)</ref> that account for the social and environmental factors that influence people's judgments and decisions about uncertain threats. Adding an individual-differences component to these theories can improve our ability to anticipate that people's judgment and decision-making process may not work the same way for every person. Practically, this work</p><p>shows that some people-like those high in agreeableness and conscientiousness-need little convincing that a threat is imminent and that they should prepare. But this work also suggests that others-like those high in sensation-seeking-may need much more encouragement to both see a threat for what it is, and to take the necessary steps to protect themselves from harm.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Top panel: An individual</figDesc></figure>
