			<abstract>
				<p>A large body of work has shown that a group of individuals can often achieve higher levels of intelligence than the group members working alone. Despite these expectations of group advantage, many examples of collective failure have been documentedfrom market crashes to the spread of false and harmful rumors. To reconcile these results, a major effort in the study of collective decision making has been focused on understanding the role of group composition and communication patterns in promoting the &quot;wisdom of the crowd&quot; or, conversely, leading to the &quot;madness of the mob.&quot; In the past decades, much of this effort has been devoted to inferring the importance of a particular attribute, in isolation, by its capacity to explain the accuracy of collective judgments. In this thesis, we argue that such a perspective can lead to inconsistent conclusions: an &apos;incoherency problem.&apos; We assert that the importance of an individual-level or structural attribute may change as a function of the environment in which the group is situated. Hence, we propose a research agenda to investigate the relative importance of the group composition and the structure of interaction networks under an environment-dependent framework. We show that under such a framework, we can reconcile previously conflicting claims from the collective intelligence literature and motivate a future research program to identify stable principles of collective performance. Although implementing such a program is logistically challenging, &quot;virtual lab&quot; experiments of the sort discussed in this thesis, in combination with emerging &quot;open science&quot; practices such as pre-registration, data availability, open code, and &quot;many-labs&quot; collaborations, offer a promising route forward.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 1 Introduction</head><p>A substantial body of work has shown that a group of individuals can often achieve higher levels of intelligence than their members working alone. For example, the classical concept of the "wisdom of crowds" articulates how-in a startlingly wide range of settings-the aggregate (e.g., average) estimate of a group is better than the estimate of the best-performing individual. Examples include financial markets, which provide a mechanism for revealing investors' private information in order to arrive at a global estimate of value, and democracy, which aggregates differences of opinion to reach a collective decision on who should lead us.</p><p>The use of these (e.g., teams, markets, polls, and votes) and related modern mechanisms is on the rise, finding applications in areas as diverse as problem-solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108]</ref> technological and economic forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">215]</ref>, crowdsourcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">194]</ref>, product rating <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[192,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">144]</ref>, public policy design <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">176]</ref>, and mapping natural disasters <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>-just to mention standouts. At the same time, there are many instances of collective failure-from market crashes to the spread of false and harmful rumors.</p><p>Such collective decision systems are central to the way society organizes and allocates resources; hence, providing a sound understanding of and useful design guidelines for improving the performance of collective decision systems is of paramount importance.</p><p>Although recent availability of massive digital traces on human behavior and the ubiquity of computational approaches have both extended and changed classical social science inquiry <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref> bringing the era of computational social science <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> and the emergence of network science <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">209]</ref> (see Section 1.1). These advances have allowed scientists to generate a tremendous number of studies on collective intelligence, but they have been much less successful at reconciling some of the many inconsistencies and contradictions amongst them. For instance, studies have shown that the same attribute of interest (e.g., social interaction via communication networks, cognitive style diversity of team members, etc.) can either promote the "wisdom of the crowd" or, conversely, lead to the "madness of the mob." In general, for the same social context being studied and for the same global feature of interest, different theories have disagreed on which attributes are most relevant, and empirical studies offered an overwhelming lack of consistent evidence (see Section 1.2 on the incoherency problem).</p><p>However, I argue that many of the studies on this topic only consider, explicitly or implicitly, static and stable environments, offering at best a partial view of human collective decision making (see Section 1.3 on the need for an environment-dependent framework ).</p><p>In this dissertation, I address the question of the determinants of collective intelligence using an illustrative example (see Section 1.3.1) and a series of human experiments and supporting simulations (see Chapters 2 and 3). The results show that what is optimal always depends on the environment, and that groups provided with appropriate learning mechanisms can adapt to biased and non-stationary information environments, significantly improving both individual and collective judgments.</p><p>The findings presented in this thesis can help reconcile some previously conflicting claims from the collective intelligence literature and motivate a future research program to more systematically identify stable principles of collective performance (see Chapter 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Premise: A Unifying Theory</head><p>Many scientists continuously aspire to discover universal principles that are valid across many different systems. While the domain of physical systems has offered examples of such widely applicable "laws," social phenomena have tended to be less fruitful in terms of generating such generalizations. This desire to build models of social phenomena that are as predictive as those in physics, as well as the pursuit of unifying principles and operationally meaningful theorems in the social sciences, has has been termed "physics envy" in the social sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. While physicists can explain most of all observable physical phenomena using Newton's three laws of motion, social scientists (probably) wish they had 99 laws that explain 3% of human behavior. It is not only that social science has one theory for one thing and another theory for another thing <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, but rather that it has many theories for the very same thing <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>.</p><p>The unfavorable comparison of social sciences to the natural sciences (and physics in particular) has a long <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref> and quite unproductive history (e.g., see Watts argument against it in <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>). However, is it possible that this state of affairs has changed with the study of computational social science and complex networks emerging into prominence?</p><p>The Era of Computational Social Science. Recent widespread adoption of electronic and pervasive technologies, the development of e-government, and open data movements have enabled the study of human behavior at an unprecedented level and helped uncover seemingly universal patterns underlying human activity.</p><p>Lazer, Pentland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> formally introduced computational social science (CSS)</p><p>as a new field of research that studies individuals and groups in order to understand populations, organizations, and societies using big data 1 , i.e. phone call records <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, GPS traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>, credit card transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[184,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, web page visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, emails <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, and data from social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Driven by the ubiquitous availability of data and inexpensive data storage capabilities, the concept of big data has permeated the public discourse and led to surprising insights across the sciences and humanities. Such understanding can answer epistemological questions on human behavior in a data-driven manner, and provide prescriptive guidelines for persuading people to undertake certain actions in real-world social scenarios. In particular, this availability of data over the past fifteen years has shed light on the important role networks play in human society.</p><p>The Emergence of Complex Networks. At least for half a century now, there has been a surge in data availability and the ability to represent different systems (e.g., physical, biological, social, and technological) as a collection of nodes (or entities) connected with each other according to specific link topologies. Examples range from the tiny intracellular system, which consists of different molecules signaling each other via chemical reactions, that determines our biological existence, to the enormous cosmic web composed of discrete galaxies held together by gravity that determines the fundamental structure of our universe. We also see networks between these two scales, from food webs that represent the who-eats-whom (or interdependence) between species in ecology to social actors-be they individuals, organizations, or nations-exchanging ideas and favors in a social system. Indeed, recent research efforts have revealed a number of distinctive structural properties that many networks seem to share across many domains. Such properties include the "small world" effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[211,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">208]</ref>, the right-skewed degree distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>, and community structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Considering the ubiquity of networks and their structural properties, much effort has been made to understand the relationship between network structures and a system's function. This is a topic that is of utmost rele- "Should social science be more solution-oriented?" highlighted that for any topic of which he has undertaken a great amount of studying-be it cooperation mechanism, organizational performance, collective action, network dynamics, systemic risk-one would likely encounter the problem of irreconcilable results <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>. In this dissertation, I argue that the topic of collective intelligence is no exception.</p><p>For instance, studies that focused on the patterns of social interactions on collective intelligence found that social influence can promote the "wisdom of the crowd" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and, conversely, lead to the "madness of the mob" <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>. Inefficient communication structures simultaneously enhance <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref> and hinder <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> collective performance. Weak bridging ties are advantageous for innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">165,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">168]</ref>, as well as the opposite-strong cohesive ties are more advantageous <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">203,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">164,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">204]</ref>. Other studies have found that network structures can affect (i.e., promote or hinder) cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, while others report no relationship between network structure and cooperation levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref>. Homogeneity of tie strengths have been found to be beneficial for coordination and also can derail it <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">157,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">158]</ref>.</p><p>The issue of incoherency exists in many modeling and empirical settings, not just in those that focus on social network phenomena mentioned in the previous paragraph. For instance, when it comes to the composition of the group (i.e., the attributes of the constituents), some studies have identified the individual ability of the group members as an important predictor of collective performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[187,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, while others report no or at best a weak relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">154]</ref>. Skill diversity (i.e., variance in group members' ability) has been shown to both enhance <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> and handicap collective performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. Similar inconsistencies arise for cognitive style diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">150,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, social perceptiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120]</ref>, and even the relative performance of teams versus individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">190,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">219]</ref>.</p><p>In general, for the same social system being studied and for the same global  <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">185,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">191,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">169,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">172]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, I hypothesize that in order to systematically reconcile these contradictory results, we need to understand the relative importance of the determinants of collective dynamics under an environment-dependent framework. If the actors are the subjects, then the environment is the object (i.e., the stimulus). Therefore, the environment itself is system-dependent (e.g., may vary from one social system to another). In the case of problem-solving and collective intelligence, the environment may be characteristics of the task (e.g., complexity, type, information distribution across agents, etc.); in a product diffusion setting the environment may be characterized by the thing being diffused (e.g., product characteristics); and in cooperation or coordination games the environment may be characterized by the incentives (the payoff matrix, the rate of interaction, mutation, etc). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">Illustrative Example</head><p>To illustrate how paying little attention to the environmental conditions can lead to inconsistent conclusions, I will use a structural stability approach common to the study of ecological communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">+1 = ( − )</formula><p>In this model, the strength of beliefs in a community about some topic (e.g., the existence of supernatural agents) is represented by the -dimensional vector ,</p><p>where , corresponds to the strength/level of belief of individual at time .

Note that the confirmation bias rates are inherently linked to environmental conditions-in other words, the events that the individuals encounter in their environment.

Now, for simplicity (and to be able to depict the system graphically), let us assume that we have two types of In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">Figure 1</ref>-1, it is easy to see how three different investigations can reach different conclusions about the role of social network structure in the persistence of beliefs in a community. For instance, if the first investigator sets the confirmation bias values to 1 then the conclusion that will be reached is that social structure 1 is superior to 2 when it comes to the persistence of beliefs. On the other hand, another investigator that sets the confirmation bias to 2 will reach exactly the opposite conclusion. A final investigator choosing 3 (or implicitly assuming no confirmation bias i.e., = [0, 0]) will find no relationship between network structure and the persistence of beliefs.</p><p>In this example, one might be tempted to come to the general conclusion that network structure 1 is superior to 2 when it comes to persistence of beliefs because of the relative sizes of the feasibility domains of these two networks 4 -i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( ( 1 )) &gt; ( ( 2 ))</formula><p>. This can be interpreted as follows: if the en- vironment values were uniformly sampled from the parameter space, then it is more likely to achieve the desired collective behavior under network structure 1 than 2 .</p><p>However, this conclusion has no conceptual support, as the environmental conditions we care about are usually characterized by a distribution (e.g., set of environmental conditions over a period of time), rather than any particular point in the parameter space-that is, in the field, it is virtually impossible to measure the environment exactly. Therefore, what we care about is the overlap between the environmental conditions in a given setting/time and the feasibility domains defined by social network structures. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">Figure 1</ref>-2, we can see that under different environmental conditions, what network structure is "best" can vary. Therefore, independent of the environment, there is no conceptual support of either a positive, negative, or no association between network structure and function, even when we can fully characterize the feasibility domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">Conceptual Reflections and Dissertation Organization</head><p>Overall, this simple conceptual analysis demonstrates that the association of a given attribute of interest (i.e., network structure, in this case) with global outcome depends on the environment. Therefore, without an environment-dependent framework from which to draw hypotheses and tune our intuitions, it is difficult to distinguish results that are unusual and interesting from results that are unusual and probably irrelevant (i.e., wrong or not generalizable).</p><p>Additionally, in some areas where there is a premium on slick studies with surprising results, 'surprising' should occur with reference to the particular region in the parameter space, and not in absolute terms. For instance, if a counterintuitive result can only emerge under very specific environmental conditions that are narrow and not</p><p>representative of the conditions we care about or only occupy a small region in the parameter space that we rarely encounter, then how much does this result matter?</p><p>In the rest of this dissertation, I will continue to illustrate the importance of the environment-dependent approach by conducting human experiments and simulations where we explicitly manipulate the environment (i.e., task characteristics in Chapter 2 and information distribution in Chapter 3). In order to conduct those studies, we built an experimentation platform that allows for conducting behavioral experiments of a scale, duration, and realism that far exceed what is possible in brick-and-mortar facilities and blur the line between lab and field experiments (see Chapter 4).</p><p>One of the main contributions of those studies is having a framework where the environment in which groups are situated is explicitly defined and manipulable (e.g.,</p><p>to simulate the non-stationarity of the environment). For instance, by manipulating the environment (and keeping everything else fixed), we can show how some of the seemingly contradictory results in the literature can be obtained as a function of the environmental conditions (i.e., whether nominal teams are better than real teams as in Chapter 2; or whether efficient network structures are more advantageous as in Chapter 3). Therefore, this allows us to reevaluate the importance of some of these attributes from the point of view of the environment (i.e., the conditions under which those attributes are of relative importance).</p><p>In particular, In the first study (i.e., Chapter 2), we focused on how different individual level attributes and group compositions (e.g., skill, cognitive style diversity, social perceptiveness) can affect collective performance, and examined whether those effects are robust to environments (i.e., tasks) of variable complexity. In this study, we asked two main research questions: 1) Do groups perform worse than comparable individuals on simple tasks but better on complex tasks?; 2) Do the effects of group composition on group performance vary with task complexity?</p><p>In the second study (i.e., Chapter 3), we focused on the role of dynamic communication structures on promoting collective intelligence. In recent years, both theoretical and experimental work has been limited mainly to frameworks where agents are placed in static social structures in stable environments. Yet, it is increasingly recognized that most natural and social systems are best described as "dynamic" networks, with links existing only intermittently in response to environmental variations (i.e., the different environments the group can be situated in). In Chapter 3, we shift the focus on the role of communication networks from the purely structural aspects of the topology to the role environmental changes play in determining the dynamical processes defined on it. This would mean changing the usually ill-defined question "Which network structure is best to promote collective intelligence?" to "What mechanisms should we provide the social system to enhance its ability to adapt in a changing environment?" In the context of collective intelligence and group problem-solving, this dissertation overcomes some of the common limitations of prior studies by considering dynamical social influence networks where individuals can actively choose and dynamically rewire their social connections in non-stationary environments, which narrows the gap between stylized experiments and real-world social contexts.</p><p>In order to operationalize the "environment" in our lab settings, we built an experimentation platform (Empirica.ly). The platform forces the investigator to explicitly define the space of the environment in which the group of participants is situated, and therefore, the exploration of the interactions between the environments and the attributes of interest becomes more systematic (as opposed to having isolated and non-comparable studies). It is necessary to acknowledge that this remains a simplistic view of real social system environments. In real-world social systems (e.g., health, education, inequality, cultural norms, economic policies) environments are high-dimensional and interact in much more complicated ways in order to produce particular individual and group outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Representative Design</head><p>There is little technical basis for telling whether a given experiment is an ecological normal, located in the midst of a crowd of natural instances, or whether it is more like a bearded lady at the fringes of reality, or perhaps like a mere homunculus of the laboratory out in the blank. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> Egon Brunswik developed an innovative methodological framework called representative design, where he wondered why the logic we demand for generalization (i.e., sampling theory) over the subject side 7 is ignored when we consider the object side (i.e., conditions, stimulus, input, or environment)? In particular, he highlighted that one may only generalize the results of observations and experiments to those environmental conditions (or objects) that have been sampled in the experiment-in the same way that scientists apply this principle to the subjects (i.e., the participants) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. That is, to study the agent × environment relations, the environmental conditions should be sampled from the agent's natural environment in order to be representative of the population of environments to which it has adapted and to which the experimenter could generalize. Therefore, Brunswik called for an explicit theory of the environment in experimental psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. Similar to the discussion (in Section 1.3.1) on feasibility regions, Brunswik argued that experimenters should avoid oversampling highly improbable conditions (or conditions that do not exist in the population), because even if the results from those conditions are interesting, are they really relevant?</p><p>5 I have already demonstrated how tools borrowed from the study of ecological communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">173,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">169]</ref> are valuable for viewing communities through the lens of their environmental variations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Interested readers should also refer to the No Free Lunch Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">216]</ref> and the Contingency Theory of Organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In actuality, as Henrich <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> pointed out, most participants in psychological experiments are WEIRD; also see Chapter 4.</p><p>Since Brunswik's time, the idea that human behavior is shaped by the environment structure has been generally accepted (e.g., ecological rationality, evolutionary psychology/game theory, ecological psychology) and the concerns with the limited generalizability of research findings have been expressed periodically. Nonetheless, there were two mainstream criticisms of the representative design approach that I want to highlight here. First, there are concerns regarding the associated difficulty of implementing representative designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. How can one possibly sample situations?</p><p>However, I would argue that the difficulty of sampling situations 8 can be overcome with modern technologies, such as the Web, to effectively reproduce and explore environments (see Chapter 4 on high-throughput social science using virtual labs).</p><p>The second objection argues that, even if we could define and sample the environment, there is no need to do so. After all, the goal of the social scientist is not to generalize the results from the experiment to situations 'outside' the experiment, but to test hypotheses and advance particular theories. This criticism is brought on by the strong emphasis on ensuring internal validity for the sake of replicability, at the expense of external validity. In other words, this objection presupposes that the purpose of social science experiments is not to solve practical problems in the real world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solution-Oriented Social Science</head><p>Duncan Watts has argued in a recent article that social science should be more "solution-oriented" in order to reconcile the competing claims in the literature (i.e., the incoherency problem in Section 1.2). That is, the research community needs to place more emphasis on solving practical problems-the sort with direct engineering analogues <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>-rather than the advancing of particular theories. For instance, in the article Watts suggests asking questions like:</p><p>• "How do I maximize the impact of my advertising spending?"</p><p>• "How do I increase productivity in my organization?"</p><p>• "How do I increase pro-social behaviour in my community?" I want to argue that Watts's perspective is akin to the environment-dependent framework proposed in this dissertation. In all of these questions, the locust of activity (e.g., "in my organization") is limiting the generality of the answer to the objective (e.g., "how to increase productivity"). In other words, the answer to the first part of the sentence is dependent on the conditions specified in the second part. Hence, the answer will be relative, not absolute, which-I will argue-will lead to reliable and coherent results, not falsely conceived as universally valid.</p></div>

In particular, the approach focuses on explaining how emergent market attributes (e.g., prices) are related to the interaction of distinct groups of market participants within a specific environmental conditions (e.g., regulations, number of competitors, magnitude of profit opportunities).</p><p>In particular, the Adaptive Market Hypothesis asserts that market behavior adapts to a given financial environment, and an efficient market (the dominant theory of markets) is merely the steady-state limit of a market in a static financial environment; an idealized market is unlikely to ever exist in practice.</p><p>The Adaptive Market Hypothesis is specifically studying the individual-level investor (i.e., economic agent) as well as the larger market (i.e., macroeconomy). However, I think the adaptiveness to environmental conditions approach applies to other collective social phenomena, more generally, and for the same reasons (i.e., evolutionary processes working in a non-static environment). In this work, we see how similar ideas can expand beyond the domain of financial markets.</p></div>

Therefore, what is considered rational under the rational choice account that focuses on agent characteristics (e.g., preference consistency) might not be considered rational under the 'ecological rationality' account, which also considers the structure of the environment.</p><p>This approach to decision-making is inspired by earlier work by Herbert A. Simon on heuristics and bounded rationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>. In particular, he explored how heuristics (a decision strategy that partially ignores available information) in appropriate context can achieve higher intelligence than other more complex approaches. The ecological rationality focuses on individual-level decision making, while in this dissertation we investigate the emergent phenomenon of collective behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 2 Varying Environmental Complexity</head><p>Recent work on teams has emphasized the counterintuitive claim that the absolute skill level of team members matters less to collective performance than other factors such as skill diversity, cognitive style, and social perceptiveness. Through a novel two-phase experiment (phase one = 1200, phase two = 828; pre-registered 1 ) in which individual on-task skill, cognitive style, and social perceptiveness were measured ex-ante and then systematically varied in team composition, we show that the effect of skill on team score is larger than all other factors across environments (i.e., tasks) of widely varying complexity. More importantly for practical applications, skill predicts twice as much out-of-sample variance as all other factors combined. We also show that while teams outperform comparable individuals on average, when compared with the best member from a same-sized group of individuals, teams score worse but compensate with faster completion time and higher efficiency when the task environment is complex. Our results help to clarify inconsistencies in the existing literature on the relationships between team construction and performance; they highlight the value of online experiments capable of supporting large sample sizes and complex, multifactorial designs; and they motivate a future research program to identify stable principles of collective performance (see Chapter 4).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>Specifically, participants were asked to solve a "room assignment" problem in which they had to assign "students" to "rooms" where each student had a specified utility for each room. Participants' objective was to maximize total student utility while also respecting constraints (e.g., "Students A and B may not share a room or an adjacent room"). Task difficulty (or the "environment complexity," therefore, could be varied systematically by changing the number of students ( ), the number of rooms ( ), and the number of constraints ( ). After completing five such tasks, each participant also completed a standard "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" (RME) test <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which is commonly used as a measure of social perceptiveness (see   perceptiveness level, and cognitive style. Then, in phase two (see Section 2.2.3), we deployed a block randomization scheme to randomly assigning participants into one of six blocks based on their phase one measurement results. Within each block, we randomized whether the participants will work as individuals or in teams (i.e., teams of three randomly selected participants) to solve another set of room assignment problems. Teams were also provided with a chat box, enabling them to communicate freely with each other and scores were now assigned to teams not individuals. See Finally, we used the ex-ante measurements from phase one to construct the inde-pendent variables (i.e., whether the participants were assigned to individual or team condition as well as different influencing factors of team performance) and used the actual performance in phase two as the dependent variables, which together allowed us to examine the performance effects of being in a team versus an individual and the effect of different team compositions (see Section 2.2.4).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H H H ML block L L L H L L L H MH block H L H H H L H H LL block L L L L L L L L LH block H L H L H L H L</formula><p>The experiment was developed using Empirica (https://empirica.ly/), an opensource "virtual lab" framework and a platform for running multiplayer interactive experiments and games in the browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>.</p><p>The source code for the Room Assignment Tasks can be found at here, and the source code for the Reading the Mind in the Eye Test can be found at here .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Room Assignment Problem</head><p>In our experiments, we asked participants to solve room assignment problems, first individually and then within a team. A room assignment problem is a type of Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization Problem (CSOP, that is, an optimization problem on top of a constraint satisfaction problem) <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">200]</ref>. We chose this task for three reasons. First, CSOPs are an abstraction of many resource allocation and optimization problems; thus, they capture important features of real-world team problem solving exercises without requiring participants to have specialized skills. Second, the payoff function for CSOPs can be described as a "rugged landscape" characterized by many locally optimal but globally suboptimal solutions. Correspondingly, CSOPs are amenable to potentially many solution strategies and styles, where no single strategy is universally superior. Third, the complexity of CSOPs can be systematically varied by adjusting a few key parameters; in our case, by changing the number of students , the number of rooms , and the number of constraints .</p><p>In our operationalization of this problem, participant(s) were tasked with assigning each of "students" to one of "rooms," while also respecting constraints on their choices (e.g., students A and B must be neighbors, must not share a room, etc.). In each room assignment problem, a "utility table" was presented, providing participant(s) with the information on students' ratings (between 0 and 100) to each of the rooms indicating how satisfied they would be if being assigned to the room.</p><p>The participant(s) was then asked to find a room assignment plan that maximized satisfaction across all students without violating any constraints.</p><p>To incentivize the search for an optimal solution (i.e., the optimal room assignment plan) we provided participant(s) with additional bonuses based on how good their submitted solutions for the problem were. In particular, we defined the "score" of a room assignment plan as the following:</p><p>= The sum of students' ratings of their assigned rooms − 100 × the number of violated constraints</p><p>By submitting a complete plan (that is, each student got assigned to one room) with a positive score in a room assignment problem, participant(s) could earn a "performance-based bonus" using a 500 points:$1 USD conversion rate to exchange scores into payments. Moreover, if the submitted plan was indeed the optimal one, an additional $0.5 USD "optimal assignment bonus" would be given 2 . We determined these values for the payments by conducting a series of pilot studies and observing how participant behavior responded to different payment schemes.

Each participant was then given a sequence of five room assignment tasks, to be completed independently, where the maximum amount of time a participant could spend on a task was 5 minutes. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 2</ref>.1 summarizes the main properties of the five task instances used in phase one. As shown in the table, we intentionally included 3 easy task instances and 2 hard task instances in the sequence.

The participant could then drag the icons of students and drop them to different boxes to adjust the room assignment plans. Assistive information such as the score of the current room assignment plan, the list of violated constraints, and the amount of time left in the task was also displayed and updated on the interface while the participant changed the solution. At any time during the allotted 5-minute period for a task, the participant could push a button to submit her solution and move on to the next task (or to the end of the room assignment task sequence), or the participant would be automatically redirected to the next task when the 5-minute timer was up.

Participants of one particular block could only find and work on the HIT corresponding to their block, but not the other five HITs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 2</ref>.2 provides a summary of these six blocks.</p><p>For each individual of a particular type (e.g. "high skill, low social perceptiveness" or HL), with 50% probability we assigned her to the block in which all individuals were of the same type (e.g., the "HL" block), and with 50% probability we assigned her to the block in which all individuals had the same social perceptiveness label as her, but may have different skill labels (e.g., the "ML" block, meaning "mixed skill levels, low social perceptiveness"). Within each block, we further randomly assigned participants either to the individual condition (31% of the time) or to the team condition (69% of the time). The individual condition was identical to phase one except that the five room assignment tasks were different (and generally more difficult) and that the maximum time allotted per task was ten rather than five minutes. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 2.3</ref> summarizes the main properties of the 5 task instances we used in our phase two experiment (the task sequence used in the individual condition is the same as that used in the team condition). In the team condition, participants worked in teams of three members from the same block.</p><p>The main effect of the block randomization scheme was to oversample statistically less frequent combinations (e.g., all team members had high skills or high social perceptiveness), which helped us to increase the statistical power of our experiments (a secondary benefit was that it allowed us to match the distributions of participant types in phases one and two; see Appendix A.5). To illustrate, the frequency of HH individuals in the population is when one team member was moving a student icon, that particular student icon was "locked" and other team members could not move it until it was released. We provided a chatbox on the task interface, enabling team members to communicate freely with each other during the tasks. We also presented an event log on the task interface to help team members make sense of all movements that had been made within the current task. At any time during a task, each team member could indicate whether she was satisfied with the current solution using a toggle button. Once all three members of a team indicated they were satisfied with the solution, the team would move on to the next task (or to the end of the experiment). If the team had never unanimously suggested they were satisfied with the solution, the team would automatically be redirected to the next task when the 10-minute timer was up.</p><p>At the end of phase two of the experiment, while participants in the individual condition were asked to were asked to complete an exit survey that is identical to the one in phase one, participants in team condition were asked the following:</p><p>• How would you describe your strategy in the game?</p><p>• Do you feel the pay was fair?</p><p>• How satisfied are you with the outcome of the game?</p><p>-Extremely satisfied (1) -Extremely dissatisfied <ref type="formula">7</ref>• Do you think your team worked well together?</p><p>-Strongly agree (1) -Strongly disagree (7)</p><p>• How valuable do you think your perspective was to the end results?</p><p>-Extremely valuable (1) -Extremely invaluable (7)</p><p>• How comfortable were you in sharing your perspective with the team through the chat?</p><p>-Extremely comfortable (1) -Extremely uncomfortable (7)</p><p>• Feedback, including problems you encountered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Details of Analysis</head><p>In this work, we are interested in comparing the effect of being in a team (i.e., teams vs individuals) as well as examining the several factors (e.g., skill level, skill diversity, social perceptiveness level, cognitive style diversity, etc.) that determine the team performance. In the case of the first question (i.e., team vs individual) or independent variable is a binary indicator that specifies whether the observation in phase two is generated by an individual or a team. For the second question (i.e., different team compositions), we defined a number of measures as our independent variables to capture various possible influencing factors of team performance:</p><p>• • Normalized score: the score a team obtained in a room assignment task divided by the maximum score of that task, i.e., normalized score = score on Task max score for task</p><p>• Duration: the amount of time a team spent on solving a room assignment task</p><p>• Efficiency (not pre-registered): Acts as a useful summary of the two other metrics, i.e., efficiency = normalized score on task duration on task Task Difficulty B A C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 2</ref>-2: The five task difficulty levels in phase two were characterized by the different number of students to be assigned, the number of dorm rooms available, and the number of constraints. Increasing the task difficulty (i.e., environment complexity) reduces the normalized score and increases the time it takes participants to submit an assignment. Data is combined across both individual and team conditions across all 6 blocks. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The effective normalized score of a feasible solution is 80% and the minimum time required for a solution to be submitted is one minute, hence the starting points of the Y axes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5">Results</head><p>Performance as a Function of the Environment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Complexity   Fig 2-2</ref> shows how overall performance varied as a function of task complexity, where we use two independent definitions of performance. First, we define performance as normalized score (i.e., score on Task max score for task ) thereby allowing us to compare performance across tasks of different complexity which may have widely varying maximum possible scores. Second, we also define performance as duration (i.e., time elapsed from the start of a task until a solution is submitted) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . In addition, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 2-</ref>2 also shows our third metric, efficiency, which acts as a useful summary of the two other metrics (i.e., efficiency = normalized score on task duration on task ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig 2-2 shows that higher complexity led both individuals and teams (see also</head><p>Appendix A.6) to score a lower fraction of the maximum possible score (2A) and work for longer (2B). Efficiency, therefore also decreased with task complexity (2C).</p><p>Although the direction of these results is unsurprising, the large and roughly linear dependency of two separate performance measures on complexity validates our design, in which overall complexity is manipulated by varying one or more task/environment parameters ( , , ).</p><p>Moreover, the ability to vary human-experienced complexity by such substantial margins (on average, individuals and teams spent roughly three times as much work time on "super hard" as "easy" tasks, but obtained normalized scores that were roughly ten percentage points lower) allows us to test for interaction effects between optimal team composition and task complexity where theories of collective performance have been largely silent, i.e., to what extent does the optimal composition depend on the characteristics of the task being performed? Alternatively, one can view varying complexity as a robustness check on findings obtained for any single task <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In other words, systematically varying task/environment complexity is informative with respect to our main research questions regardless of whether optimal team composition depends on it.</p><p>Groups are Superior; Only when the Environment is Complex <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 2-3</ref> compares overall team performance with that of "comparable individuals," which we define in two ways: first, a randomly drawn individual from the same block;</p><p>and second, by constructing a "nominal team," drawing three individuals randomly and without replacement from the same block, and then choosing the individual with the highest score from phase one. Nominal teams, therefore, simulate a situation in which teams simply nominate their best performer to do all the work while the others contribute nothing. For all levels of task complexity, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 2-3A</ref> shows that teams score higher than randomly selected individuals but lower than nominal teams, consistent with longstanding findings that nominal teams outperform real teams under various circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[197]</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, however, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 2-3B</ref> shows that teams complete the most complex tasks-but not simpler ones-faster than either random individuals or nominal teams, suggesting that for tasks with many components (students and rooms) and many constraints the benefits of distributing work to a team outweigh the process losses (e.g., motivation loss, coordination cost) associated with groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 2-</ref>3C shows that for complex tasks the gains in speed exceed the deficits in score, resulting in a striking interaction between task complexity and configuration with respect to efficiency: for easy tasks teams are considerably less efficient than either random individuals or nominal teams, yet they are considerably more efficient than either for the most complex tasks. This result is reminiscent of group decision making among social insects where a study have found that colonies outperform individuals when the discrimination task is difficult but not when it is easy <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 2-4</ref> shows the absolute and relative effects of all pre-registered independent variables on collective performance, which is quantified as score <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig 2-4A)</ref>, duration of completion <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig 2-4B)</ref>, and efficiency <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig 2-4C</ref>) respectively (and all three metrics are standardized within each task complexity level as per our pre-registration). Across      <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 2-4A</ref> shows that average skill had the largest effect on teams' scores, and was both positive and highly significant (Table 2.4). In addition, the effect of skill is consistently and significantly larger than that of social perceptiveness (Wald chi-square test; 2 = 6.35, = 0.012; see Appendix A.7 for additional "relative importance" analysis), which was also positive and significant (Table 2.5). In contrast, skill diversity (i.e., variance in team members' ability) has consistently and significantly negative effects on the score (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 2</ref>.6) while no measure of cognitive style diversity has any consistent and significant effect (see Table2.7 and Appendix A.7).</p></div>

To illustrate, recall our hypothetical manager who wishes to compose a team for some task, and who has prior information about the skill, cognitive style, and social perceptiveness of prospective team members. In essence, the manager's task is to predict which combination of traits will yield the best collective performance. More specifically, the manager cares about two <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 2</ref>.5: Relation between team's average social perceptiveness and team performance.

Overall, the 2 was approximately 0.24, meaning that the model "explained" about 24% of the observed variance in held- duration is a much harder task: almost no variance can be explained either by skill or by any combination of measured attributes (see Appendix A.8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Discussion and Chapter Reflections</head><p>These results provide mixed support for previous studies and also help to clarify some inconsistencies between them. First, our results help to reconcile conflicting prior findings regarding the effectiveness of teams vs. individuals: whereas we find that teams clearly outperform comparable individuals selected at random, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[219]</ref>, we also find that teams score worse than the best individual selected from a nominal team of the same size, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">197]</ref>. Interestingly, even as teams underperform nominal groups in terms of score, for the most complex tasks-but not for simpler tasks-they attain higher efficiency by completing their work faster.</p><p>Second, our finding that the effects of average individual skill and social perceptiveness are positive and highly significant is consistent both with the aforementioned meta-analytical studies that favored ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">187,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, and also with the more recent experiments that emphasized social perceptiveness work <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110]</ref>. However, our ability to compare effect sizes and predictive performance across multiple effects resolves the apparent inconsistency between the two sets of results: skill dominates social perceptiveness by an order of magnitude.</p><p>Third, our findings of that skill diversity is negatively associated with team performance is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> but directly contradicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. Even if the latter claim is interpreted as implicating cognitive diversity more generally rather than skill per se, we find no evidence that any of several measures of skill or cognitive style diversity is positively associated with performance. Naturally, teams can be diverse with respect to attributes other than skill and cognitive style (e.g., demographics, political ideology, worldview etc.) and diversity can affect outcomes other than performance on task (e.g., satisfaction, legitimacy, social equity, etc.); thus our results should not be construed as finding any effect of diversity writ large. Nevertheless, they do reinforce recent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref> which also concludes that unambiguously positive effects of diversity are more difficult to detect in carefully controlled empirical studies than what would be expected from theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, team composition and team performance are multifarious constructs each of which can be operationalized in many ways; moreover, the relationship between the two may be contingent on numerous other mediating variables related to the nature of the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[186,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138]</ref> and the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Finally, the literature on team performance comprises a mixture of simulation, observational, and experimental studies; thus it is hardly surprising that it exhibits inconsistencies. In this paper we have introduced an approach to studying team performance that leverages a unique combination of (a) class of tasks with variable environmental complexity (i.e., the complexity parameters, , , and ) to increase the robustness of our results and allows us to test for interaction effects; (b) two-phase design which allows us to measure individual on-task skill and cognitive style as well as social perceptiveness prior to team assignment; (c) large sample size and block randomization to increase power;</p><p>and (d) a pre-registered analysis plan to constrain researcher degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that on-task skill of team members far outweighs other factors, such as skill diversity, cognitive style diversity, and social perceptiveness, that have been emphasized in recent years, accounting for roughly three-quarters of explained variance. Although this result is robust to task complexity, which we varied widely, a major limitation is that we only studied one type of task. We, therefore, hope that future work will apply a similar approach to qualitatively different tasks as well as varying other parameters of interest (e.g., team size, communication patterns, division of labor, leadership, etc.). Naturally a research program that explores many parameters while still running large-N samples is logistically challenging;</p><p>however, we propose that "virtual lab" experiments of the sort that we have described here, in combination with emerging "open science" practices such as pre-registration, open data and code, replication, and "many-labs" style collaborations <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, offer a promising route forward. Finally, our emphasis on predictive accuracy seeks to move studies of team performance away from tests of theoretical conjectures (e.g., "does X correlate with performance?") and toward tests of practical significance (e.g., "how much observed variance can be explained an in terms of what?"). </p></div>

Figs. 3-6A and 3-6B</p><p>show that participants in dynamic networks consistently used peers' past performance information as success cues to guide their peer choices. As rounds elapsed, performance information accrued, and social networks evolved from fully distributed into networks that amplified the influence of well-informed individuals. Upon receiving an information shock, the networks slightly decentralized, entering a transient exploration stage before finding a configuration adapted to the new distribution of information among participants (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">Fig. 3-7</ref>).  A centralization mechanism alone could suggest that group members may merely follow and imitate the best individual among them, hence bounding collective performance by that of the group's top performer. However, research on the two-headsbetter-than-one effect indicates that, in the simpler case of dyads, even the best individual can benefit from social interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">114]</ref>; and that the critical mechanism enabling this effect is a positive relationship between individuals' accuracy and their confidence. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">Fig. 3-7C</ref> shows that participants in dynamic networks had, overall, a positive correlation between the accuracy of their initial estimates and their selfconfidence (measured in terms of resistance to social influence).

Moreover, even the best individual derived substantial benefits from social interaction, averaging 32% lower error and 38% less variability when forming and revising social connections rather than working in isolation (dynamic top-1 vs. solo top-1 ; &lt; 10 −2 ). Top-12 estimates correspond to the full-group mean, and top-1 to the group's best individual.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Science</head><p>Behavioral labs have long played an important role in all social science disciplines.</p><p>The "Behavioral Lab" approach is a useful tool that offers a great degree of control and allows for the identification of causal effects. However, many social phenomena of interest to researchers and policy makers alike involve large populations interacting in complex non-stationary environments over extended periods of time. By contrast, behavioral experiments have historically been restricted to small samples of WEIRD 1 subjects interacting in highly simplified environments over very short (i.e., up to 1 hour) intervals. Consequently, the results of even well designed and run lab experiments suffer from severe external validity problems.</p><p>Another related problem, which is even more relevant to the framework of this dissertation, is that social theories are rarely precise enough to estimate exact parameter values from empirical data; thus, a robust test of even a single theoretical claim may require many experiments, each corresponding to a different set of parameters.</p><p>Unfortunately, the costs and logistics involved in running lab experiments typically restrict researchers to exploring a tiny fraction of the relevant parameter combinations, thereby leading to fragile and inconsistent findings that in turn lead to the problem of incoherency discussed in Chapter 1 (in particular, Section 1.2).</p><p>We propose to address both sets of problems by dramatically scaling up and speeding up the current state of the art in virtual lab technology. Specifically, we intend to ease three main bottlenecks to existing research capabilities:</p><p>• Size. Alleviate scaling and replication difficulties by recruiting and maintaining a large and diverse pool of subjects (see Section 4.2.1). Achieving these goals will require virtual lab software (e.g., Empirica.ly <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>)</p><p>that is optimized for reducing the overhead associated with building and running experiments (see Section 4.1), and in return, it will allow research teams to coordinate research designs by recruiting a community of researchers to collaborate on a single research program (e.g., optimal team composition, increasing cooperation in realworld scenarios, influence maximization on networks) to explore the parameter space of social theories and maximize cumulative knowledge (see Section 4.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The Interactive Environment</head><p>The idea of web-based "virtual labs" to create experiments with rich interactive environments and crowdsourced labor from the internet has started to gain popularity.</p><p>Although the number of synchronous online experiments is on the rise <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">132,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">133]</ref>, most of them make use of customized implementations, leaving a large number of open methodological challenges yet to be solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. So far, researchers trying to pursue this approach get side-tracked mostly by the tedious logistics of randomiza- while non-commercial (open-source or free) products include jsPsych <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and Psy-Toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[189,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">188]</ref>. However, these are designed to support questionnaires and singleparticipant reaction-time experiments (i.e., no group interactions or multiplayer types of games). Experimental software like Breadboard <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>, Z-tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, and oTree <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> do support group interactions, but they are originally designed for sequential interactions (not continuous) and for an insufficient number of highly constrained settings (e.g., stylized economic games or studies of social networks). Finally, nodeGame <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> 3</p><p>and TurkServer <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref> are flexible and support real-time group interactions; however, they require relatively substantial programming expertise.</p><p>Therefore, we decided to build our own platform, Empirica </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Towards Expanding the "Lab Experiment" Design Space</head><p>As we have discussed in the beginning of this chapter, the "virtual lab" approach is intended to lift the historical barriers along three major conceptual dimensions: (i) size, (ii) time, and (iii) complexity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_44">Figure 4</ref>-1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Size: In Complex Systems, Large is Different</head><p>Morris Zelditch in 1969 argued in his paper "Can you really study an army in the laboratory?" that it is neither possible nor necessary to study large human organizations in the lab <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[221]</ref>. Zelditch asserted that it is sufficient to test social theories in smallgroup experiments and then use theory to generalize the results to the larger group.</p><p>Today, we know that this perspective is inadequate. In complex systems, the collective behavior is not merely the sum of the individual components. We cannot understand how an ant colony operates by studying individual ants. In the same way we cannot understand social systems-such as markets, organizations, institutions-by studying individuals or small groups in the lab setting. Groups behave differently at different scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[212,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">196]</ref>. For example, Elinor Ostrom 4 found empirically a non-linear relationship between community size and its ability to protect the commons <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. Also,  experimental work has shown some interesting relationships between group size and collective performance such as generating complex cultural artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> 5 , mapping disasters <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>, and disrupting science and technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[218]</ref>. This explains why the municipal is different from the national and why the United States is not just ×1, 000</p><p>Singapores.</p><p>Therefore, when it comes to social theories, the size of a group is an important parameter that can change the qualitative behavior of interacting individuals. It seems that we do need to study the army in the lab, after all.</p><p>Unlike the physical lab, which is constrained by the behavioral lab space at a university, the virtual lab-in theory-has no limit to the number of participants.</p><p>In particular, shifting the meaning of a "large group" from a couple of dozens to hundreds of participants has been enabled by the availability of a large and cheap labor market for research. The ability to crowdsource participants has had a large impact on human subjects research, from the computational sciences to the behavioral sciences. For instance, crowdsourcing labor from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)</p><p>is an increasingly popular tool for conducting behavioral studies. There have been efforts to systematically replicate classic results from the social sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, with outcomes that in many cases appear to be as reliable as data obtained via traditional methods.</p><p>The use of crowdworkers has had a profound influence on the nature and pace of data collection and has opened new avenues to cost-effective replication and extension of familiar research paradigms. This shift has had special impact in areas such as studies of cooperation and conflict, person perception, intergroup attitudes and stereotypes, and group behavior, where cumbersome interactive multi-participant experiments can be conducted much more easily via online platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>The advances in scale offered by online labor markets for crowdsourcing participants, though significant, are not without limitations. In particular, there are at least</p><p>three challenges yet to be solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>: 1) recruiting simultaneous participants (i.e., availability at the same time to study interaction between participants); 2) participants' uniqueness (i.e., avoiding learning affects <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>, where prior exposure to a task affects subsequent experimental results on similar tasks); and 3) large sample size (i.e., at any given time there are only around 2K active high-effort workers on</p><p>MTurk <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Timescale: Social Interactions Evolve Over "Time"</head><p>Social interactions between individuals evolve over time (as we have discussed in</p><p>Chapter 3), and the nature of time-be it simultaneous or sequential; real-time or offline; continuous or discrete; fast or slow; one-shot or repeated-can fundamentally change group-level outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">170,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>A notable example is the dynamics of cooperation (i.e., paying a personal cost for a shared benefit). In Prisoner's Dilemma, where defection is the prevailing action in one-shot interactions, cooperation can be sustained when interactions are repeated and participants can remember previous actions of their peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>. Moreover, cooperation can be further sustained in long-run experiments (i.e., lasting for 20 consecutive weekdays <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>) and real-time interactions (i.e., going from discrete-time to continuous-time increases cooperation from 40% to 90% <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>).</p><p>Virtual lab experiments grant great flexibility to experimenters to study human interactions at different time intervals, from one-shot real-time (i.e., seconds) to very long sequential (weeks and months) interactions-thereby allowing for more "immersive" environments.</p><p>Despite the opportunities virtual labs can bring to studying human behavior, behavioral research online has so far remained largely limited to offline decisionmaking tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> or one-shot interactions with simultaneous decisions. This is partly because of the lack of an established software that is widely used for conducting synchronous online experiments, which leaves a large number of open methodological challenges yet to be solved by the experiment designer. • The researcher asks the "framework" what experiment to run, specifying what parameters to hold fixed (e.g., task characteristics) and which are allowed to vary (e.g., team compositions).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Reflections and Conclusions</head><p>In conclusion, group attributes (e.g., network structure, team composition, individuallevel attributes) and collective performance are multifarious constructs each of which can be operationalized in many ways. Moreover, the relationship between the two may be contingent on numerous other mediating variables related to the nature of the environment. Therefore, without an environment-dependent framework from which to draw hypotheses and tune our intuitions, it is difficult to distinguish results that are unusual and interesting from results that are unusual and probably irrelevant.</p><p>Although the idea that the environment shapes human behavior has been generally accepted, there are two mainstream criticisms of this approach. First, there are concerns regarding the associated difficulty of manipulating and measuring environment (i.e., how can one possibly sample situations?). In this dissertation, we showed that focusing on the formal properties of the environment (i.e., defining the universe of possible environments) and the use of modern virtual lab technologies can effectively overcome this limitation. The second objection argues that, even if we could define and sample the environment, there is no need to do so. After all, the goal of the social scientist is not to generalize the results from the experiment to 'outside' situations but to test hypotheses and advance particular theories. However, recent movements in social science have argued that social science should be more "solution-oriented" to reconcile the competing claims in the literature. That is, the research community needs to place more emphasis on solving practical problems-the sort with direct engineering analogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>-rather than the advancing of particular theories. In this dissertation, we have followed a "solution-oriented" approach by advancing our fundamental understanding of collective intelligence in the course of solving applied problems.</p><p>In future work, we hope to apply the same approach to qualitatively different availability, open code, and "many-labs" style collaborations, offer a promising route forward. In order to operationalize the "environment," we built an experimentation platform (Empirica.ly). The platform forces the investigator to explicitly define the space of the environment in which the group of participants is situated, and therefore, the exploration of the interactions between the environments and the attributes of interest becomes more systematic (as opposed to having isolated and non-comparable studies). We hope that our emerging ability to conduct virtual lab experiments-of a scale, duration, and realism that far exceed what is possible in brick-and-mortar facilities-will blur the traditional boundary between "lab" and "field" experiments and revolutionize our understanding of human behavior, not only for the design of social science experiments but for rebuilding society as a whole.    In our experiment, we defined an individual participant's skill score as the sum of her scores on the two hard tasks in phase one experiment, and we further labeled the participant as "high" or "low" on skill by examining whether her skill score was larger or smaller than the median score obtained among all participants. To illustrate the validity of this measurement of skill level, <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>-5 contrasts the normalized scores (i.e., actual score obtained in a task instance / the maximum possible score for that task instance) obtained by "high skill" participants with those obtained by "low skill" participants, on each of the six tasks in phase one, including one practice task (hard) and five actual tasks (3 easy and 2 hard). Clearly, on all task instances, participants that are determined as "high skill" outperformed those participants that are determined as "low skill." In other words, participants' scores on the two hard task instances are highly correlated with their scores on any single task instance, regardless of whether it is easy or hard, which suggests that it is valid to use participants' scores on the two hard tasks to measure skill levels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5 Comparing participants in phase one and two</head><p>One natural concern regarding the two-phase experimental design is whether different participants' experience in the phase one experiment will lead to a varying tendency to participating in the phase two experiment, implying potential self-selection that may result in biased experimental results. To examine whether self-selection bias would be a substantial concern, we first conducted a pilot study, in which 42 participants (these participants were not allowed to participate in the actual study) were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk to complete the first version of our two-phase experiment.</p><p>In this pilot study, we asked each participant to complete a sequence of 5 room assignment tasks of varying difficulty levels as well as 36 RME questions in phase one. Two hours later, we invited all participants who had completed phase one to join the second-phase experiment, in which they would be randomly grouped together into teams of three members and they were asked to solve another sequence of 5 room assignment tasks together with their teammates. the pilot study, with respect to their skill levels (i.e., the cumulative score a worker got in the 5 room assignment tasks of the phase one experiment; top row) and their social perceptiveness levels (i.e., the number of RME questions a worker answered correctly in the phase one experiment; bottom row). Visually, it is clear that during the pilot study, participants who decided to take the phase two experiment had both higher skill levels and higher social perceptiveness levels, compared to the entire pool of participants who had completed the phase one experiment. In other words, the experimental design and procedure that we adopted during our pilot study indeed led to a degree of self-selection bias. To decrease the level of self-selection bias, we made three changes during our main experiment. First, we altered the mix of tasks that we included in the phase one experiment to 3 "easy" tasks and 2 "hard" tasks. We hypothesized that with a higher fraction of easy tasks in phase one, participants would have a higher perceived self-efficiency in the room assignment tasks, and thus more Figure A-6: Comparing the distributions of phase one participants and phase two participants with respect to their skill (i.e., scores obtained in room assignment tasks) and social perceptiveness levels (i.e., scores obtained in RME tests).

Gaussian kernels are used for kernel density estimation. likely to come back during phase two to complete more such tasks. Second, we adopted a block randomization scheme rather than a simple randomization scheme during our real experiment. Each block corresponded to a particular mixture of participants with high/mixed/low skill and high/low social perceptiveness (see Section 2.2.3 for more details), and we set the target number of workers to recruit at the block level.</p><p>Doing so allowed us to effectively oversample the subgroups of participants who were potentially underrepresented in phase two, compared to the pool of participants in phase one (e.g., participants who had a lower skill and social perceptiveness levels) 1 .</p><p>Finally, we extended the gap between the two phases of our experiment from two hours to six days, conjecturing that a longer gap would refresh participants' memory and potentially lead more of them to find it enjoyable to take similar types of tasks again in our phase two experiment. <ref type="figure">Figure A-</ref>6 (right panel) shows the distribution comparisons between participants who completed phase one and phase two of the real experiment. Here, we find there is no clear difference between the two groups of participants in terms of either their skill or their social perceptiveness. In other words, with the three changes that we made, we managed to minimize the self-selection biases between the two phases in our real experiment.  <ref type="figure">Figure A-7</ref>: Varying the room assignment task difficulty vs normalized score.

Serguei's 1.873 Fundamentals of Network and Community Ecology class taught me how to question my most fundamental assumptions and helped in forming much of the balance and direction of this dissertation. Serguei's unique approach to research and teaching set an example that I will try to follow.

Of the 197 teams formed, the data for 1 team was incomplete, hence the effective number of teams is 196. In the absence of block randomization, therefore, we would expect to have 196/64 = 3 All-HH teams. With block randomization, we guaranteed at least 22 All-HH teams (because of random assignment in the MH block it is possible that one or more additional All-HH teams would result). Put another way, to generate 22 All-HH teams with simple random assignment we would have required 22 × 64 = 1408 teams or over 4,000 participants just for the teams condition (6,000 in total). In summary, the number of teams formed in HH, MH, LH, HL, ML, LL blocks were 22, 55, 18, 21, 56, 24, respectively. Note that we did not block on participants' cognitive styles, as doing so would require a much larger sample size. During the experiment, each individual (or team) first completed one practice task ( = 9, = 6, = 8). Then, they could proceed to complete the sequence of room assignment tasks of various levels of difficulty; each task had a maximum time limit of 10 minutes (unlike phase one, which had a time limit of 5 minutes), and the task order was randomized (to account for any ordering effects). While participants in a an individual condition were presented with a set up that is identical to phase one, participants assigned team condition were presented with an interface where all team members can drag any icon of students to any room cell simultaneously as they wish (see Appendix A.1 for an example of task interface).

Such findings highlight the role of adaptive social networks as prime mechanisms for refining individual judgments and inducing the collective 'wisdom of the network.'We acknowledge that the results of laboratory experiments and numerical models do not translate directly into the real world, the evidence presented here suggests that details of interpersonal communications-both in terms of the structure of the social interactions and the mechanism of its evolution-can have an effect on the ability of the system to promote collective intelligence. This is an evidence that dynamism of the network has profound effects on the processes taking place on them, allowing them to be more efficient, stable against perturbations, and able to adapt to nonstationary environments. This can help/motivate the design of field experiments in a real system, which would narrow the gap between stylized experiments and real-world social contexts.The insights here provided suggest design guidelines germane to real-world collective intelligence mechanisms, in contexts such as commodity markets, social trading platforms, crowdfunding, crowd work, citizen science, prediction markets, and online education (e.g., MOOCs). We expect the adaptive systems view on collective intelligence to further sprout connections with fields such as evolutionary biology and artificial intelligence, advancing an interdisciplinary understanding and design of social systems and their information affordances.</figDesc></figure>

Section 1.3).For instance, the collective intelligence literature can be mapped into a very high-dimensional parameter space, where each dimension represents what the investigator thinks is a relevant attribute. A non-exhaustive list of potentially relevant variables for team composition and performance is: scale (2 individuals -10 4 individuals), problem dimensionality (estimation tasks -complex problems), problem difficulty (easy that anyone can solve; hard, or no one can solve alone), interdependence between task components, means of communication (slider, language, cursor, price, wager, probability judgment), communication structure (fully connected -chain -nominal), information access and feedback, goal (forecasting, searching, estimating, acting, transferring information), timescale (one-shot, iterative), etc. The parameter space of these theories has been sparsely investigated with ad hoc experiments, each solving specific problems with custom operationalization and often reaching simplistic conclusions that are in contradiction with each other and hard to reconcile (cf. Section 1.2 on the incoherency problem). A common language between researchers is missing and the results remain isolated rather than cumulative. With a virtual lab framework, researchers could solve the problem of exploring the parameter space 7 empirically in at least two ways: The Exhaustive Exploration. Due to the lower cost associated with running virtual lab experiments, researchers could test multiple combinations of parameters of behavioral theories and generate empirical "phase diagrams," where the collective outcome of interest is observed against all the possible combinations of model parameters The Coordinated Exploration. The exploration of this massive space can potentially proceed in a distributed and guided fashion 9 . The following would be a possible iteration, where a community of researchers collaborate on a single research program (e.g., optimal team composition, increasing cooperation in real world scenarios, influence maximization on networks) coordinate research designs (e.g., define the relevant variables and outcomes) to maximize cumulative knowledge:</figDesc></figure>

However, the existing literature exhibits two important limita- tions that undermine the practical relevance of these findings. First, the difficulty of executing large-scale experiments with complex multifactorial designs means that individual studies typically focus on single effects rather than comparing multiple effects directly; thus, it remains unclear which of many hypothesized relationships matter most in practice.</note></figure>

In phase one we measure all relevant attributes for individual workers (see Section 2.2.2); then in phase two we use this information to construct teams with desired combinations of individual attributes (e.g. "high skill but low social perceptiveness," "mixed skill but high social perceptiveness," etc.; see Section 2.2.3). In this way, all individual attributes are measured before assignment to teams or individuals.3. Rather than relying on generic metrics for ability and cognitive style we measure them on the task itself, thereby improving reliability. . Finally, we directly address the practical problem outlined above by expressing our team-level results in terms of their individual and combined predictive accuracy.The goal of our experiment was to examine which of several factors (e.g., skill level, skill diversity, social perceptiveness level, cognitive style diversity, etc.) predicts team</figDesc><table><row><cell>2.2 Experiment: Optimal Team Construction for a</cell></row><row><cell>Complex Task</cell></row></table><note>4. The combination of the two-phase design and the ability to recruit large sam- ples online facilitates a relatively complex multifactorial design which in turn improves our ability to compare multiple effects directly (see Chapter 4).5performance. To answer this question, we used a novel "two-phase" experimental de- sign in which we recruited the same group of participants (recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk; see Section 2.2.1) twice to solve a sequence of Constraint Satis- faction and Optimization Problems (CSOPs)-a class of complex problems that are widely studied in artificial intelligence and operations research as abstractions of var- ious real-world resource allocation and scheduling problems (see Section 2.2.1).</note></figure>

However, most studies overlook the dynamic nature of social networks, and its role in fostering adaptive collective intelligence. It remains unknown (1) how network structures adapt in nonstationary environments, and (2) whether this adaptation promotes the accuracy of individual and collective decisions. Here, we answer these questions through a series of behavioral experiments and supporting simulations. Our results reveal that social network plasticity (i.e., dynamic networks) when provided with feedback can adapt to biased and non-stationary information environments. Moreover, we show that groups in dynamic networks when provided with feedback can significantly outperform their best-performing member, and that even the best member's judgment substantially</figDesc><table><row><cell>Chapter 3</cell></row><row><cell>Non-Stationary Information</cell></row><row><cell>Environments</cell></row></table><note>benefits from group engagement.
