To determine whether this colour entered VWM, we measured its interference in an orthogonal shape change detection task. Experiment 2 used a 700 ms ISI, while in Experiment 3, we reduced the ISI to 100 ms. Unlike Zhu et al., who only reported trials where shape was consistent between displays, we included trials where shape changed between displays in our analysis and included trials in which the shape probe matched the memorised fixation colour. In Experiments 2 and 3, we found evidence that the target colour had entered VWM, consistent with a dimensional memory filter. However, we also found that the fixation colour had a stronger impact on shape change detection than the target colour, a finding that was not explicitly predicted by <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al. Overall, our</ref> results align more closely with predictions from object-file theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kahneman et al., 1992)</ref> and event-file theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hommel, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hommel, , 2004</ref>, which propose object-specific binding occurs during encoding, and object-specific costs and benefits emerge during object retrieval and review. The facilitation we observed when features were consistent between displays could reflect object-specific repetition benefits, while the interference we observed when features partially changed between displays may indicate partial repetition costs.</p></div>

However, VWM is constrained by a severely limited capacity, and can only accurately retain information that is equivalent to approximately three to four objects at one time <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cowan, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fukuda et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Vogel et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>Extensive research has been conducted into the nature of this limitation. Initially, several influential studies proposed that VWM stores discrete objects within a set number of slots <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cowan, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pashler, 1988b)</ref>. However, more recent evidence suggests that VWM representations are not all-or-none, but can vary in strength. These results suggest a continuous resource model, in which VWM capacity is restricted by both the number of objects held in VWM and the precision, or fidelity, of their representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bays et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bays &amp; Husain, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fougnie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hardman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Luck &amp; Vogel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">van den Berg et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Wilken &amp; Ma, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The limited capacity of VWM raises important questions about the selectivity of visual processing towards sensory information as it is entered into VWM. Some researchers have proposed that VWM consolidation is not selective towards features, and visual objects enter VWM intact, with all their component features represented (T. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gao et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Huang &amp; Pashler, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Luria &amp; Vogel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Shen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Vogel et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Xu &amp; Chun, 2006</ref>. In contrast, other researchers have proposed that task-relevant features are prioritised for VWM entry, and irrelevant features either are excluded from VWM or are encoded with weak precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Awh et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chen &amp; Wyble, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fougnie &amp; Alvarez, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Olivers et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Wegener et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>One approach to investigating the selectivity of VWM is to use experimental paradigms that measure the explicit recall of visual features through surprise memory tests. An influential example is the attribute amnesia (AA) paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chen &amp; Wyble, 2015</ref>. In a typical AA experiment, participants perform repeated trials of a simple VWM task, such as reporting the location of a red-coloured letter.</p><p>Critically, on a surprise trial, participants are unexpectedly asked to report a second feature of the same object, such as the identity of the letter. Performance on reporting the unexpected feature is typically at or close to chance level, even though they recently attended it. However, in subsequent post-surprise trials, participants can typically report both the unexpected feature and the target feature with much higher accuracy.</p><p>The findings of AA experiments suggest that features destined for report are prioritised for VWM entry, while features used in peripheral tasks, such as target selection, are selectively excluded from VWM. However, AA experiments have two major limitations. First, the critical impairment in the report of the unexpected feature is only observable in a single surprise trial. In the subsequent post-surprise trials, participants have changed their expectations about the task relevance of features, and are able to report the previously unexpected feature accurately. This means that the 8 phenomenon can only be observed momentarily, and therefore, that the sensitivity of available analyses is highly restricted.</p><p>A second limitation of the AA paradigm is that unreported features may still be held implicitly in VWM during AA tasks. In a subsequent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Jiang et al. (2016)</ref> asked participants to report the location of a target number defined by its parity (odd or even) on repeated pre-surprise trials. In the subsequent surprise trial, participants were asked to report the identity of the target number <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Jiang et al., 2016</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr">Wyble &amp; Chen's, 2017 response)</ref>. While participants completed this explicit memory test at chance levels of accuracy, the experimenters found that the unreported number primed responses across consecutive trials. Specifically, repeating the target identity facilitated memory for both its identity and location. This finding of intertrial priming implies that the unreported target number was retained implicitly in VWM, despite being unavailable for explicit report.</p><p>Other paradigms have assessed the contents of VWM implicitly through its effects on attention, rather than requiring explicit report. The VWM-driven attentional bias paradigm exploits the finding that information held in VWM automatically biases attention toward matching sensory items <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dowd et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Downing, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Olivers et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Olivers et al., , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Soto et al., 2008)</ref>. In a typical trial, participants memorise a feature of a target object (e.g., the location of a distinctively coloured object), perform an unrelated visual search task, and then complete a memory test in which they report the memorised feature. Critically, the search task display either includes or does not include a distractor singleton with a feature of the target object (e.g., its red colour). If responses in the visual search task are slower when a distractor singleton matching the feature 9 (e.g., a red object) appears than when it matches a novel feature (e.g., a green object), this demonstrates that the feature is held in VWM <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Soto et al., 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Soto et al., , 2008</ref>.</p><p>Another approach to assessing the contents of VWM using an implicit task is to assess whether the probe feature elicits an irrelevant-change distracting effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Treisman &amp; Zhang, 2006)</ref>. In a typical trial, participants complete a change detection task in which they report whether a target feature is the same or different between two displays (s1 and s2). Critically, a task-irrelevant feature of the same object is orthogonally manipulated to either change or remain the same. If the irrelevant feature is held in VWM, changes to it interfere with change detection performance for the target feature. This irrelevant-change distracting effect has been replicated across a range of visual features and displays, including those that manipulate colour, shape, orientation, and set size <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ecker et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">T.

During the retention interval of the memory task, participants completed a speeded visual search task in which they reported the orientation of a line segment within a diamond-shaped search target. In the final location task, participants reported the location of the target square by selecting from a four-item fixed-choice array. Critically, in two-thirds of experimental trials, a distractor colour singleton (i.e., a unique colour among uniformly coloured stimuli) appeared on the search task display. In the key-related condition, the distractor singleton matched the colour of the target square. In the unrelated condition, the distractor singleton was a novel colour. The remaining one-third of trials were in the no singleton condition, in which a colour singleton did not appear on the search task display. The duration of the interstimulus interval (ISI) between the offset of the memory display and the onset of the search task display was set to either 0, 100, or 700 ms on each trial.</p><p>One of the most important findings reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> was that there was no difference in search times between the key-related condition and the unrelated condition. This finding suggests that even though the target colour was fully attended, it did not produce a VWM-driven attentional bias, and by deduction, it had not entered VWM. <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.</ref> argued that this finding supports their proposal that attention on its own is not sufficient for an item to be selected for VWM entry, that an additional process called VWM reselection exists, and that this process selectively promotes attended items to enter VWM. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.</ref> proposed that VWM reselection operates using a mechanism called a dimensional memory filter. According to their account, when a feature value (e.g., red) is selected for entry into VWM, all attended feature values that share the same feature dimension (e.g., all other colours) are also automatically entered into VWM.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> Experiment 5a, participants completed a speeded shape change detection task while holding a colour in VWM. The authors evaluated the effect of a task-irrelevant colour change on shape task performance. They reported a taskirrelevant-change distracting effect, in which changes to the irrelevant colour dimension affected shape task performance, and this was cited as support for a dimensional memory filter. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a typical trial. On the rehearsal display, participants were shown two randomly selected letters to vocalise as they completed the trial. On the memory display, participants saw a coloured fixation cross and four simple geometric objects.</p><p>Participants were instructed to memorise both the shape of the distinctively-coloured target object and the colour of the fixation cross. In the shape task, participants reported whether a shape probe matched the memorised shape of the target object. Critically, the shape probe also varied in the irrelevant colour dimension, either matching the colour of the target object (the target colour) or appearing as a novel colour. Finally, in the colour task, participants reported the memorised colour of the fixation cross by selecting an option from a six-item forced-choice array.</p><p>On trials in which shape matched, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> reported that shape judgement was slower when the colour of the memorised shape changed than when it stayed the same. The authors argued that this irrelevant-change distracting effect demonstrates that memorising the colour of the fixation cross resulted in all attended colours automatically entering VWM, and therefore supports the operation of a dimensional memory filter.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Overview of the Present Study</head><p>The present study aimed to investigate <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Introduction</head><p>In their Experiment 1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> proposed that a reselection process determines which attended features enter into VWM. In their study, they reported that search times did not differ between trials on which a colour singleton distractor matched the target colour or on which it matched a novel colour. They cited this as evidence that the target colour was not maintained in VWM, and therefore, as support for reselection.</p><p>However, we identified two methodological concerns that we believe may challenge their interpretation of the results. Our first concern was that the search target on their memory display was a uniquely-coloured square among uniform distractors, and therefore met the definition of a colour singleton (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Pashler, 1988a</ref>). As the memory task required participants to memorise and recall the location of the colour singleton, participants could use singleton detection mode to locate the target <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bacon &amp; Egeth, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Pashler, 1988a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Theeuwes, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Theeuwes, , 1992</ref>. The use of this mode would have allowed the target square to be located and the search to be completed before other features of the square, including its colour, were processed and entered into VWM. Therefore, in Zhu et al.'s (2022) Experiment 1, features of the target object other than its location may never have been truly attended and may not have been available for use in the VWM search task. Furthermore, because singleton detection mode requires less effort than feature search mode, the participants in this experiment would have been incentivised to favour its use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Awh et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Irons &amp; Leber, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our second concern was that <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> used consistent one-to-one spatial mapping between the four possible target locations and their corresponding response keys. This allowed participants to begin to prepare a motor response on each trial immediately after viewing the stimulus presentation, before performing the search task.</p><p>As this would reduce the effort of holding the location of the target object location in VWM, participants would have been incentivised to favour this as a strategy to complete the memory task. This concern was validated when, during early pilot testing of our experiment, we observed participants moving their hands towards the correct response key before the location response array appeared.</p><p>To address these concerns, we modified both the memory display and the location response task in our experiment. First, to ensure that participants used feature search mode (i.e., determining the location of the target square by processing its actual colour), rather than singleton detection mode (i.e., determining the location of the target square based on its oddball colour), to locate the target square, we introduced a second coloured square to the memory display. Evidence suggests that when two items compete within the same feature dimension, observers cannot use singleton detection mode and instead must use feature search mode to distinguish between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bacon &amp; Egeth, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Folk et al., 1992)</ref>. Second, instead of recording the location task responses using a fixed-item forced-choice array, we used a change detection task. This ensured that each location response could only be determined following the appearance of the location probe, and therefore that participants could not begin to prepare a response before completing the search task.</p><p>We predicted two effects in our experiment. First, we expected to see a singleton distractor effect, in which search responses would be slower on displays that included a colour singleton distractor than on displays that did not. This effect was found in  and has been routinely reported in visual search studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bacon &amp; Egeth, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Theeuwes, 1992)</ref>. It indicates that task-irrelevant colour singletons capture attention, even when they are not held in VWM.</p><p>Second, in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref>, we expected to see a matched colour effect in which searches are slower on displays that include a colour singleton matching the colour that defines the target object than on displays where the singleton is a novel colour. The observation of this effect would indicate that the target-defining colour is represented in VWM. We expected to see this effect because the contents of VWM are known to guide visual attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Downing &amp; Dodds, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Olivers et al., 2006)</ref>, and experiments on object-based encoding have also demonstrated that consolidating a target feature binds other features of the same object into VWM (Z. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Shen et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Participants</head><p>We recruited 30 first-year University of Canterbury psychology students (24 females, 6 males) aged between 16 and 34 years (M = 19.9 years, SD = 3.9). The participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and received course credit as an incentive for participating. For the matched colour effect, we assumed that the target colour would cause a medium-sized interference effect in the search task (d = 0.5). An a priori power analysis using G*Power 3.1.96 with α = .05 and 80% power recommended a sample size of 27 participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Faul et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore, we decided that a recruitment target of 30 would suffice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Apparatus</head><p>Participants were tested individually in two quiet, dimly lit rooms at the University of Canterbury's visual perception laboratory. Stimuli were presented and responses were recorded using E-Prime 3.0.3.82 on a 61 cm diagonal LCD monitor with a resolution of 1,680 x 1,050 pixels. Displays were viewed from approximately 600 mm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Stimuli</head><p>Stimuli were presented against a medium grey background <ref type="bibr">(RGB: 150,</ref><ref type="bibr">150,</ref><ref type="bibr">150)</ref> with a fixation cross measuring 0.88° in width and height. At the start of the experiment, each participant was randomly assigned a target colour and a distractor colour from the following options without replacement: red (RGB: 255, 0, 0), green (RGB: 0, 255, 0), yellow (RGB: 255, 255, 0), magenta (RGB: 255, 0, 255), and cyan (RGB: 0, 255, 255). The selected colours were consistent for each participant for the duration of the experiment. This consistency allowed us to add a second coloured distractor square to the memory display, while still allowing the participant to readily identify the target square. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The memory display consisted of four squares with sides of 1.70°, each positioned on the corner of an invisible central square with sides measuring 7.68°. One of the four squares was randomly selected to match the participant's assigned target colour (the target square), one to match the distractor colour, while the other two squares were black.</p><p>On the search task display, eight outline objects with white borders were evenly distributed around the circumference of an invisible central circle with a diameter of 5.44°. The objects included a diamond-shaped search target (a square with 1.70° sides, rotated 45°) and seven distractor circles (each with a diameter of 1.70°). Each object contained a 1.32° long white line segment, which was equally likely to be horizontally or vertically oriented. The location task display contained a single location probe square with 1.70° sides that matched the colour of the target square. The location probe square was equally likely to match or not match the location of the target square.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Design</head><p>This experiment used a 2 x 3 repeated-measures design with two orthogonally arranged independent variables: ISI and colour. The first variable, ISI, referred to the duration of the interval between the offset of the memory display and the onset of the search task display, and was equally likely to be short (i.e., 100 ms) or long (i.e., 700 ms) on each trial. The second variable, colour, referred to the presence and colour of a distractor colour singleton on the search task display. In two-thirds of trials, one distractor circle was randomly selected to be a colour singleton. The trials that included a colour singleton were equally likely to be in the key-related condition, in which the colour singleton matched the target colour on the memory display, or in the unrelated condition, in which the colour singleton was a novel colour randomly selected from the three unused colours. The remaining one-third of trials were in the no-singleton condition, in which a colour singleton did not appear on the search task display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5">Procedure</head><p>After providing informed consent, participants received brief instructions about the experimental tasks. On the memory display, they were told to memorise the location of the square matching their target colour. In the search task, they were told to find the 20 diamond-shaped object and report whether it contained a horizontal or vertical line segment. Finally, in the location task, they were told to report whether the location probe matched the memorised location of the target square. Participants were told to emphasise both speed and accuracy in the search task, but to focus solely on accuracy in the location task. After being informed of their assigned target colour, the participants began the experiment. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows a typical trial of Experiment 1. Participants first saw a 1,000 ms central fixation cross. The memory display was then presented for 100 ms, followed by either a short (100 ms) or long (700 ms) ISI. On the search task display, participants pressed the '4' key on the numeric keypad (labelled '-') if the line inside the target diamond was horizontal, or the '5' key on the numeric keypad (labelled '|') if the line was vertical. In the first 12 practice trials, the search task display remained visible until the participant pressed a response key. In the subsequent practice trials and all experimental trials, the display remained visible until either a response key was pressed or, if no response was made, for 2,500 ms. Following a 300 ms retention interval, participants saw the location task display. Participants reported whether the location probe matched the memorised target object location by pressing either the 's' key (labelled 'SAME') or the 'd' key (labelled 'DIFF'). The location task display remained visible until the participant pressed a response key. A fixation cross was present on all trial displays but was absent during the 1,000 ms intertrial interval. Participants completed two blocks of 12 practice trials and six blocks of 48 experimental trials, for a total of 288 experimental trials.</p></div>

In the trial depicted, the target colour is red and the distractor colour is green. On the memory display, participants memorised the location of the target square and retained it for the later location task. During the retention interval of this memory task, participants performed a speeded search task in which they reported the orientation of the line segment inside the diamond-shaped search target. In the key-related condition, the search display contained a distractor colour singleton matching the target square colour. In the unrelated condition, the search display included a distractor colour singleton with a novel colour. In the no-singleton condition, a distractor colour singleton did not appear on the search display. The search display appeared either 100 ms or 700 ms following the offset of the memory display. A 1,000 ms blank interval preceded the start of the following trial. The response keys used are shown in parentheses under the search task and location task displays.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Results and Discussion</head><p>Overall, participants were highly accurate in the location task (M = 92.42% before exclusions), indicating that they successfully memorised the location of the target square as instructed. Three participants were excluded from the analysis because they responded incorrectly on 30% or more of the trials in either the search task, the location task, or both. Search task response times (RTs) were analysed for non-outlying trials in which participants responded correctly on both the search and location tasks.</p><p>Outliers were defined as trials with a location task RT exceeding 10,000 ms or a search task RT at least 2.5 SD from that participant's condition mean. In total, 13.0% of trials were excluded from RT analysis. The mean search task RT and accuracy for each condition are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> shows mean search task RTs in each colour condition. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> A 2 x 3 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the search task RT data. This revealed a significant main effect of ISI, F(1, 26) = 123.40, MSE = 11,938, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = 0.826, in which responses were slower in the short ISI condition (M = 1,380.8 ms, SD = 44.6) than in the long ISI condition (M = 1,190.1 ms, SD = 44.6).</p><p>There was also a significant main effect of colour, F(2, 52) = 19.72, MSE = 4,217, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = 0.431.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Matched Colour Effect</head><p>Our second comparison assessed whether there was a matched colour effect by comparing RTs in the key-related and unrelated conditions. A paired samples t-test</p><p>revealed that search responses were slower in the key-related condition (M = 1,315.8 ms, SD = 162.1) than in the unrelated condition (M = 1,292.3 ms, SD = 164.2), t(26) = 2.02, p = .027, d = 0.388. The finding of a significant matched colour effect indicates that the target colour in the key-related condition was represented in VWM and captured attention when it appeared as a colour singleton on the search task display. This provides evidence against <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> proposal that a reselection process determines which attended items enter VWM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Accuracy</head><p>We assessed search task accuracy with a 2 x 3 repeated-measures ANOVA.</p><p>Mirroring the RT data, accuracy was lower in the short ISI condition (M = 93.83%, SD = 0.06) than in the long ISI condition (M = 96.30%, SD = 0.04) F(1, 26) = 14.31, MSE = 0.002, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = 0.355. There was also a significant main effect of colour, F(2, 52) = 5.67, MSE &lt; 0.001, p = .006, ηp 2 = 0. t(26) = 1.16, p = .872, d = 0.224.

We did not find any evidence that a speed-accuracy trade-off compromised our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">Discussion</head><p>In Experiment 1, we investigated <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> proposal of a VWM reselection process. Zhu et al. argued that attended sensory information is not automatically entered into VWM, but instead a reselection process restricts which attended items enter VWM. We conceptually replicated Zhu et al.'s paradigm but made changes to address methodological issues that we were concerned may have compromised their results. First, we introduced a second coloured square to the memory display. This ensured that participants would use feature search mode instead of singleton detection mode, and therefore would determine the location of the target square by processing its actual colour, not just allowing its oddball colour to select the target location. Second, we replaced the fixed-choice array for the location response with a change detection task. This ensured that participants would hold the target square in memory instead of completing the task without VWM by preparing a motor response before completing the search task.</p><p>We tested the hypothesis that participants retained the target colour in VWM during the visual search task. We predicted that if the target colour was held in VWM, we would find a matched colour effect, in which a colour singleton distractor that matched the target colour would interfere with performance of the search task. Our findings supported this prediction. Search RTs were slower when a colour singleton distractor matched the target colour than when it was a novel colour. These findings suggest that even though the target colour was irrelevant to the search task, it entered VWM. This contradicts the evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> presented as support for reselection.</p><p>We also found that searches were slower and less accurate on trials with a short ISI than on trials with a long ISI. A short ISI likely did not provide sufficient time for participants to fully encode the target location in VWM before attention was allocated to the search task. The division of cognitive resources between encoding the target location and the visual search task may explain why we saw poorer search performance in the short ISI condition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Introduction</head><p>In their Experiment 5a, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> presented evidence that VWM entry is gated via a dimensional memory filter. Specifically, they proposed that when an individual feature value (e.g., red) is selected for entry, all attended feature values within the same feature dimension (e.g., all colours) automatically enter into VWM.</p><p>Recall that on each trial, participants memorised the colour of the fixation cross and the shape of the distinctively-coloured target object. After a short interval, participants judged whether the presented shape probe matched the memorised shape of the target object. Critically, in the task-irrelevant colour dimension, the probe either matched the target colour or was a novel colour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> only reported findings from the same-shape condition, in which the shape probe matched the shape of the target object. They found that on trials where the colour of the shape probe had changed from the memory display, responses were slower on the shape change detection task. Previous studies have established that this irrelevant-change distracting effect indicates a feature is held in VWM (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ecker et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">T. Gao et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hyun et al., 2009)</ref>. According to Zhu et al., the presence of the target colour in VWM supports a reselection process with a dimensional memory filter, such that memorising the fixation colour resulted in all attended colours, including the task-irrelevant target colour, entering VWM.</p><p>We modelled our experiment after Zhu et al.'s (2022) experiment but made two key changes. First, we added a condition in which the shape probe matched the colour of the fixation cross. This allowed us to compare the impact of a feature that participants were instructed to memorise (the fixation colour) to a feature that may have entered VWM as a result of the dimension being selected for entry (the target colour).</p><p>Second, in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref>, who restricted their reporting to the same-shape condition, we analysed and reported data from both the same-shape and different-shape conditions. Within the same-shape condition, we anticipated that we would replicate Zhu et al.'s finding of slower responses in new-colour trials than in same-colour trials. However, because Zhu et al. did not report or make predictions for the different-shape condition, we had no a priori expectations for effects in this condition in line with their dimensional memory filter proposal.</p></div>

The shape probe was equally likely to be in one of six conditions based on the factorial combination of the shape and colour variables. The conditions are described in the design section below. The colour task display consisted of a centrally-located colour probe measuring 3.51° x 0.88°. The colour of this probe was equally likely to match the colour of the fixation cross, or a colour randomly selected from the four unused colours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Design</head><p>This experiment used a 2 x 3 repeated-measures design with two orthogonally arranged independent variables: shape and colour.

In the same shape-same colour condition (SSSC), the shape probe matched the shape and colour of the target object.</p><p>2. In the same shape-fixation colour condition (SSFC), the shape probe matched the shape of the target object and the colour of the fixation cross on the memory display.</p><p>3. In the same shape-new colour condition (SSNC), the shape probe matched the shape of the target object, and it was a novel colour.</p><p>And there were three different-shape conditions:</p><p>1. In the different shape-same colour condition (DSSC), the shape probe did not match the shape of the target object, but its colour matched the target object.</p><p>2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.5">Discussion</head><p>In Experiment 2, we investigated <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> proposal that entry to VWM is gated with a dimensional memory filter. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a conceptual replication of Zhu et al.'s experiment but made two key changes. First, we added a colour condition in which the shape probe matched the memorised fixation colour. This new condition allowed us to compare the impact of a colour that participants were instructed to hold in VWM with interference from the target colour, which Zhu et al. proposed had entered VWM as the result of the dimensional memory filter. Second, we analysed data from both the same-shape and different-shape conditions. Examining the same-shape condition allowed for a direct comparison with Zhu et al.'s Experiment 5a, whereas analysing the different-shape condition allowed us to further evaluate the dimensional memory filter account.</p><p>In the same-shape condition, our results were consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref>, providing support for the proposal of a dimensional memory filter. Participants were slower to make shape judgements when the shape probe was a novel colour than when it matched either the target colour or the memorised fixation colour. This suggests that memorising the fixation colour facilitated the entry of the target colour into VWM, despite it being task-irrelevant.</p><p>However, this pattern was reversed in the different-shape condition, where RTs were slower for the same-colour trials than the new-colour trials. Despite being in the opposite direction to the same-shape condition, the significant difference between these colours still indicates that the target colour influenced shape change detection, and by deduction, entered VWM. Therefore, these results remain broadly consistent with the dimensional memory filter, although the reasons for the reversed pattern warrant further discussion. Potential explanations will be explored in the General Discussion.</p><p>In addition to the results reported above, we found that RTs were slower for the fixation-colour trials than for the same-colour trials, in both the same-shape condition and the different-shape condition. While this result may invite the conclusion that the memorised fixation colour is held in VWM with greater strength than the irrelevant target colour, an alternative explanation grounded in theories of object-based encoding and retrieval may better account for this pattern of data.</p><p>Within the same-shape trials, participants likely showed a same-object benefit when they retrieved the same object in the SSSC condition, as reported in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kahneman &amp; Treisman, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hommel, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hommel, , 2004</ref>. In the different-shape condition, the pattern is consistent with a stronger binding between colour and shape in the fixation-colour trials than in the same-colour trials. This would have resulted in a larger partial-repetition cost within the DSFC condition. We will discuss object-based effects in more detail in the General Discussion.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that there was a speed-accuracy trade-off in the main effect of shape. Specifically, responses in the same-shape condition were both faster and less accurate than in the different-shape condition. This makes it difficult to compare participants' performance between the same-shape and different-shape conditions.</p><p>However, the primary focus of our study was to examine the effects of colour, not shape, on shape change detection. Therefore, further investigation of this speed-accuracy Chapter 4: Experiment 3 -Reduced Interstimulus Interval</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Introduction</head><p>In Experiment 2, our results were generally consistent with <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> proposal that VWM entry is gated with a dimensional memory filter. Our results indicated that in same-shape trials, shape change detection was slower when the shape probe matched either the memorised fixation colour or the target colour, compared to when it was a novel colour. This suggests that both the fixation colour and the target colour were retained in VWM. Furthermore, while Zhu et al. did not make specific predictions about the relative strength of features that entered VWM in their reselection model, we found that the fixation colour had a greater impact on shape change detection than the target colour. This could be explained by the binding of object features, with retrieval of the same object in the SSSC condition facilitating performance in the shape task, and stronger binding between colour and shape in the fixation-colour condition resulting in slower responses in the DSFC condition.</p><p>However, another potential explanation could be the long 700 ms ISI between the memory display and the shape change detection task. Over longer delays, taskirrelevant information can passively decay or be actively removed from VWM <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Logie et al., 2011)</ref>. Therefore, the 700 ms ISI may have allowed time for the task-irrelevant target colour to begin to decay or be removed from VWM before its interference on shape change detection was assessed. This could potentially explain the reduced impact of the target colour, rather than variability in the strength of the binding between object features in the shape probe.</p><p>In Experiment 3, we reduced the ISI from 700 ms to 100 ms for two purposes.</p><p>First, we wanted to test whether we would still observe evidence for the dimensional memory filter with a shorter delay between encoding and retrieval. If the dimensional memory filter account is correct, we expected the same pattern of results as Experiment 2. Second, having almost eliminated the possibility of decay or removal of the target colour from VWM, we wanted to test whether it would still have a lower impact on shape change detection than the fixation colour. If the two colours showed an equivalent impact on shape change detection, then decay or removal could potentially explain the reduced impact of the target colour in Experiment 2, rather than variability in the strength of the binding between features.</p></div>

To explore this interaction, we examined the accuracy data in each shape condition separately. In the different-shape condition, the pattern of accuracy results was consistent with the RT data.

Although accuracy in the fixation-colour condition (SSFC; M = 93.4%) was numerically higher than in the new-colour condition (SSNC; M = 92.8%), a paired samples t-test revealed that this difference was not significant, t(29) = 0.51, p = .308, d = 0.093. Thus, there was no evidence of a speed-accuracy trade-off.</p></div>

Shape and colour were loaded as within-subjects factors, and ISI was loaded as a between-subjects factor. There was no significant main effect of Experiment or any interaction involving Experiment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.6">Discussion</head><p>As in Experiment 2, within the same-shape condition, we found slower RTs in the shape change detection task when the irrelevant colour of the probe matched either the target colour or the memorised fixation colour compared to when it was a novel colour.</p><p>This supports the view that memorising the fixation colour caused the target colour to enter VWM via the proposed dimensional memory filter. Importantly, reducing the ISI to 100 ms did not reduce or eliminate this irrelevant-change distracting effect. This 47 suggests that differential decay or removal of the target colour cannot explain its reduced impact on shape detection relative to the fixation colour in Experiment 2.</p><p>The pattern of greater interference from the fixation colour than the target colour is consistent with an object-based encoding account grounded in theories of object file binding and retrieval. In the same-shape trials, faster responses when the probe matched the target object in SSSC likely reflected facilitation due to objectspecific repetition benefits. In different-shape trials, stronger binding between the fixation colour and shape would produce greater partial repetition costs when they are mismatched, slowing responses.</p><p>The combined analysis of the results of Experiments 2 and 3 revealed that reducing the ISI did not change the interaction between colour and shape in the shape task. This suggests that the shorter interval in Experiment 3 did not substantially alter the way in which task-irrelevant colour information influenced shape change detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 8</head><p>Mean Shape <ref type="table">Task Response Time</ref>  They interpreted this as evidence that attention on its own is not sufficient for sensory information to automatically enter VWM. However, we identified two methodological concerns that could potentially compromise their interpretation of the results. First, the target square on Zhu et al.'s memory display was a colour singleton. This allowed participants to select the target location using singleton detection mode before the colour of the target square was fully processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bacon &amp; Egeth, 1994)</ref>. Second, each target location was consistently mapped to a specific response key. This allowed participants to begin to prepare motor responses before completing the search task.</p><p>To address these concerns, we conducted a conceptual replication of <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> experiment but incorporated two modifications to the experimental task. First, we added a second coloured distractor square to the memory display. This ensured that participants selected the target square using a full feature search, rather than relying on singleton detection mode. Second, we replaced the forced-choice location response array with a location change detection task. This ensured that participants held the target location in VWM during the search task.</p><p>In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref>, who found no difference in search times between the relevant conditions, we found a robust matched colour effect. Specifically, searches</p><p>were significantly slower when a distractor singleton matched the target colour than when the singleton was a novel colour. This finding suggests that the task-irrelevant target colour was represented in VWM and captured attention when it reappeared as a distractor singleton. Critically, this result counters the key finding that Zhu et al. cited as evidence for a reselection process. Instead, our findings suggest that, at least under some conditions, multiple features of attended objects, even those irrelevant to the current task, can enter VWM without undergoing reselection.</p><p>In Experiments 2 and 3, we investigated <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> proposal that VWM consolidation operates via a dimensional memory filter. Zhu et al. reported that on same-shape trials, responses were slower when the irrelevant colour changed than when it remained the same. This irrelevant-change distracting effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ecker et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> T. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gao et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hyun et al., 2009)</ref> purportedly demonstrated that memorising the fixation colour caused the task-irrelevant target colour to enter VWM via a dimensional memory filter. However, Zhu et al. only analysed and reported data from the sameshape condition.</p><p>We modelled our experiments after <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> experiment but made two key changes. First, we added a condition in which the colour of the shape probe matched the colour of the memorised fixation cross. This allowed us to directly compare the impact of a colour that participants were instructed to memorise (the fixation colour) on shape change detection to a colour that may have entered VWM incidentally as a consequence of the dimensional memory filter (the target colour). Second, in contrast to Zhu et al., who only reported data from the same-shape condition, we analysed data from both the same-shape and different-shape conditions, both in Experiment 2, in which we used a 700 ms ISI, and in Experiment 3, in which we used a reduced 100 ms ISI.</p><p>In Experiment 2, we found evidence consistent with a dimensional memory filter in the same-shape condition. Consistent with <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> findings, responses were slower when the target colour changed across displays in the new-colour condition than when it was unchanged in the same-colour condition. We also found a VWM effect indicative of a dimensional memory filter in the different-shape condition, even though Zhu et al. did not report or predict effects in this condition.</p><p>Our results also revealed that the memorised fixation colour had a greater impact on shape change detection than the target colour in both the same-shape and different-shape conditions. This effect is not explicitly predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref>, suggesting that their model may need to be expanded to accommodate our effects. With a reduced ISI in Experiment 3, we again found evidence indicative of a dimensional memory filter. Importantly, despite the shorter interval, we continued to find that the fixation colour had a greater impact on shape change detection than the target colour.</p><p>In the same-shape condition of both Experiments 2 and 3, we found a typical irrelevant-change distracting effect, in which shape change detection was slower when the colour changed in the new-colour condition, than when it did not in the same-colour condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ecker et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">T. Gao et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hyun et al., 2009)</ref>. However, in the 52 different-shape condition, we found a reversal of this typical effect. Shape change detection was slower when the target colour was repeated in the same-colour condition, than when it changed in the new-colour condition. While the significant difference in RTs between these conditions indicates that the target colour was still held in VWM, the reason for the reversal of the typical effect is not immediately clear.</p><p>However, the pattern of object-specific costs and benefits observed in the samecolour and different-colour conditions aligns with the predictions of two influential theories of object-based perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hommel, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hommel, , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kahneman &amp; Treisman, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kahneman et al., 1992)</ref>. According to object file theory, when a visual object is first seen, an episodic representation called an object file is created to store information about its features <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kahneman et al., 1992)</ref>. If the object is seen again in close spatiotemporal proximity, its features are automatically retrieved through a reviewing process, and the processing of the object is facilitated. This enables faster responses to an object that remains consistent across displays than an object that changes across displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gordon &amp; Irwin, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Henderson &amp; Anes, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mitroff &amp; Alvarez, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, event file theory proposes a predictable pattern of object-specific benefits and costs that depend on the consistency of object features across displays <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hommel, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hommel, , 2004</ref>. Object-specific repetition benefits facilitate responses when all object features are matched across displays. In our experiment, an object-specific repetition benefit offers an explanation for the effects observed in the same-shape condition. Specifically, we observed an object-specific repetition benefit in the SSSC condition, where the shape probe matched both the shape and colour of the target object. Responses were faster in this condition than in the SSNC condition, in which shape but not colour matched across displays.</p><p>Furthermore, when some, but not all, object features are matched across displays, partial-repetition costs slow responses, relative not only to completely matched features, but also to completely mismatched features. In contrast to the proposed dimensional memory filter, partial-repetition costs offer an explanation for the reversed direction of the effect we observed in the different-shape condition.</p><p>Specifically, we observed a partial-repetition cost in the DSSC condition, in which the shape but not the colour of the shape probe matched the target object. Responses in this condition were slower than in the DSNC condition, in which the shape probe completely mismatched the target object. As the pattern predicted by object-file and event-file theories explains the effects we observed in both the same-shape and different-shape conditions, these theories appear to offer a more parsimonious explanation than <ref type="bibr">Zhu et al.'s (2022)</ref> dimensional memory filter.</p><p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> cited their Experiment 5a as an example of the irrelevant-change distracting paradigm, the task used in both their and our experiments differs in important ways from previous studies that have demonstrated this effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ecker et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">T. Gao et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hyun et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In classic irrelevant-change distracting experiments, participants memorise all of the objects shown on the memory display for a later change detection task. In contrast, on our memory display, participants distinguished a target object from several distractor objects and memorised its shape. The requirement to distinguish the target from distractor objects may have enhanced the perception of the memory target as a distinct and coherent object, and resulted in stronger binding between its features.</p><p>Furthermore, previous experiments demonstrating irrelevant-change distracting effects have presented the same number of objects on both the memory and test displays. However, in our experiment, the memory display had five objects (the target object, three distractor objects, and the fixation cross), while our test display only had one (the shape probe). The appearance of just one item on the probe display may have resulted in more thorough processing of the probe object because fewer items were competing for available attention resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Desimone &amp; Duncan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Treisman &amp; Gelade, 1980)</ref>.</p><p>A second limitation of our experiment is that the use of simple shapes as stimuli may limit the generalisability of our results, as evidence suggests that object encoding mechanisms differ for more complex, ecologically valid objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brady et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>While the simpler shapes used allowed for tight experimental control, object comparison and review processes may function differently for objects with pre-existing semantic or contextual representations, and this could modulate effects relating to their encoding and maintenance in VWM Investigating selectivity across different feature dimensions and levels of stimulus complexity could help to elucidate whether consolidation operates via general mechanisms that apply broadly across feature types or whether separate featurespecific mechanisms are in operation. Evaluating the selectivity of VWM consolidation using more complex, ecologically valid stimuli would also help to establish the realworld relevance of our findings.</p><p>Third, it is worth considering that our experiments focussed solely on the selectivity of consolidation with visual stimuli. Attention and consolidation may operate differently for information in different sensory modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cocchini et al., 2002)</ref>. In future research, it could be valuable to directly compare visual and verbal working memory with the aim of determining whether our findings reflect processes that are general to all modalities or are specific to the visual modality.</p><p>Finally, the implicit paradigms we used assessed the contents of VWM indirectly by measuring their effects on attention. This contrasts with the explicit surprise memory tests used in some other paradigms, such as those used in studies of attribute amnesia or inattentional blindness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chen &amp; Wyble, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mack &amp; Rock, 1998)</ref>. While implicit methods can detect more subtle effects, they do not assess whether information in VWM is accessible for report. Further research using explicit memory tests in conjunction with implicit paradigms would help clarify the relationship between implicit VWM representations and those that can be explicitly accessed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Jiang et al., 2016)</ref>. This research direction could offer insights into the relationship between implicit VWM representations and conscious access and the influence of implicit representations on behaviour.</p><p>In conclusion, this thesis highlights the importance of sound methodology and the comprehensive analysis of data across all experimental conditions. Our findings indicate that multiple features of one object, including those that are task-irrelevant, can automatically enter VWM, challenging the proposal of a reselection process that plays a critical gatekeeping role in determining the contents of VWM. While we found some evidence consistent with VWM entry being gated by a dimensional memory filter, this mechanism failed to offer a full explanation for our pattern of results. Explanations grounded in object-based encoding and retrieval processes offer a more complete and parsimonious account of our findings. Future research should investigate whether comparable effects occur with more complex, ecologically valid stimuli and explore the</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Mean Search Task Response Time in Experiment 1 Plotted as a Function of ColourNote.

Mean shape task response times are plotted for each colour, shape, and ISI condition. The upper panel shows response times in 100 ms ISI condition; the lower panel shows response times in 700 ms ISI condition. Error bars show the within-subjects standard error of the mean. ISI = Interstimulus Interval.This thesis investigated two hypotheses proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> on the selectivity of VWM feature consolidation. First,Zhu et al.  proposed that attended sensory information does not automatically enter VWM, but undergoes an additional process called reselection prior to consolidation. Second, they proposed that this reselection process operates via a dimensional memory filter, such that selecting one feature value (e.g., red) for entry into VWM causes all attended feature values that share the same feature dimension (e.g., all colours) to automatically enter VWM. To investigate these claims, we conducted three experiments that conceptually replicated and extendedZhu et al.'s paradigms.    In Experiment 1, we evaluated the evidence that<ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhu et al. (2022)</ref> presented in support of VWM reselection. Zhu et al. reported that a target colour did not show VWMdriven attentional capture and argued that this demonstrated it had not entered VWM.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>49</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="3">Chapter 5: General Discussion</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="3">Experiment 2: Long Interstimulus Interval (700 ms)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>800</cell><cell></cell><cell>Same Shape</cell></row><row><cell>Response Time (ms)</cell><cell>700 725 750 775</cell><cell></cell><cell>Different Shape</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>675</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>650</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Fixation Colour</cell><cell>Same Colour</cell><cell>New Colour</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Colour</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="3">Experiment 3: Short Interstimulus Interval (100 ms)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>850</cell><cell></cell><cell>Same Shape</cell></row><row><cell>Response Time (ms)</cell><cell>750 775 800 825</cell><cell></cell><cell>Different Shape</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>725</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>700</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Fixation Colour</cell><cell>Same Colour</cell><cell>New Colour</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Colour</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
