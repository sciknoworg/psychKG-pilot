			<abstract>
				<p>Play is important in many cultures and species, but the basic motivations behind play remain unclear. In two preregistered experiments, we presented 5-to-10-year-old children (n = 124) with a novel game. We compared their choices about how to best configure the game when either playing for fun or playing to win, exploring: 1) how sensitive children are to the factors that are most relevant for playing to win; and 2) how their preferences when playing for fun relates to their preferences when playing to win. We found that for &quot;win-relevant&quot; features, children chose easier settings when playing to win than when playing for fun. By contrast, for &quot;win-irrelevant&quot; features, children generally preferred similar settings across conditions. Children also judged &quot;win-relevant&quot; factors as more important to winning than &quot;win-irrelevant&quot; factors, and judged both as irrelevant to having fun. These results suggest that playing to win and playing for fun are distinct motivational contexts to which children can appropriately adapt their decisions during play.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D R A F T Introduction</head><p>Many creatures play. Lion cubs mock-hunt, otters juggle rocks, dolphins blow bubbles to swim through, and human children spend hours building block towers, swarming playgrounds, and exploring for dinosaurs, dragons, and aliens.

E. Kidd, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sidéra &amp; Vornicu, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Despite its prevalence, play remains difficult to characterize. It is the sort of behavior that people readily recognize, and its utility can be characterized in specific contexts. However, it has been difficult to provide a general theoretical account of play. Descriptive accounts generally agree that play is: structured; often repetitive; most common in youth; most likely when individuals are healthy, relaxed, or bored; irrelevant to immediate survival; and thus intrinsically motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Burghardt, 2010)</ref>. Despite these shared features, play manifests in many different behaviors, each with different benefits for development: rough and tumble play leads to more social bonding <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Pellis &amp; Pellis, 2007)</ref>; pretend play improves counterfactual inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buchsbaum et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Wente et al., 2022)</ref>; exploratory play leads to discoveries about causal structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bonawitz et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schulz &amp; Bonawitz, 2007)</ref>; and guided play often improves educational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Skene et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Weisberg et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Weisberg et al., , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yu et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Due to the diversity of play behaviors, theoretical accounts often aim to explain only particular kinds of play <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chu &amp; Schulz, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Rubin et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Zosh et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Because the theoretical understanding of play is so fractured, many basic questions about play remain unanswered. One prominent such question has to do with the motivations underlying play, which remain obscure. While nearly all theories of play assume that children are motivated by an intrinsic desire to "have fun", very little work has characterized "fun" or examined how competing extrinsic factors may D R A F T interact with the pursuit of fun in play. Here, we investigate the rewards and motivations underlying play by using a game design task in which children are prompted to manipulate the features of a game to make it more appropriate either for playing for fun (i.e. optimizing for intrinsic, self-motivated reward), or playing to win (i.e. optimizing for extrinsic, externally-defined reward) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2020)</ref>. Children's decisions in this task thus provide a window onto the ways that changes in motivation affect goal selection during play. Using this paradigm, we consider the following two questions. First, we ask how sensitive children are to the task features that are most relevant for playing to win. Second, we use this improved understanding of playing to win to ask how the motivations underlying playing for fun differ (if at all) from those underlying playing to win. These questions are important because they may shed light on one of the fundamental unknowns regarding play: what motivates agents to play in the first place.</p><p>We built our paradigm around structured game play for two reasons. First, rule-based games are a significant part of play for school-aged children <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Opie &amp; Opie, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Taylor, 1999)</ref>. Games are thus part of what theories of play need to explain, and any theory of play should apply to them. Second, games are a particularly good place to look for systematic variation between different motivations to play. Unlike the complex, improvisational, and highly varied forms of pretense, motor, and exploratory play that are common in preschoolers, game playing derives structure from the requirement to follow the rules of the game itself (whether well-established or invented spontaneously). Games often come with systems of reward and punishment and, critically, clear conditions for winning. These structural features of games have recently been explained as a way for players to explore various kinds of agency-different constellations of goals, abilities, and constraints-in a relatively controlled environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Nguyen, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>What is important for our purposes is that the relatively restricted degrees of freedom inherent to structured games enable us to more directly assess children's decision-making given different motivational contexts, rather than trying to infer it from spontaneous behavior.</p><p>Our first research question builds on existing work to better understand how sensitive children are to the task features that are most relevant for playing to win. Motivations lie on a continuum from those which are purely extrinsic to an individual to those which are purely intrinsic <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2020)</ref>. The</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D R A F T</head><p>introduction of extrinsic motivators can lead to lower intrinsic motivation and, in some situations, reduce the performance they are intended to reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ryan &amp; Koestner, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. Cameron et al., 2001)</ref>. For example, one study prompted sixth graders to choose a series of anagrams to solve. When the task was framed as an assignment graded based on performance rather than as an ungraded educational game, children chose less challenging anagrams and showed fewer signs of enjoying them <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Harter, 1978)</ref>. It remains unclear, however, to what extent the motivation to win leads children to selectively manipulate task difficulty as compared to other aspects of the task which may have no bearing on winning.</p><p>By better characterizing how children understand playing to win, we can then consider our second question-namely, how the motivations underlying playing for fun might differ from those underlying playing to win. One possibility is that playing for fun ultimately is playing to win: maximizing fun is merely maximizing the likelihood of winning. This possibility might seem unlikely, however, as children seem to challenge themselves more when playing without performance pressure than when participating in the same activity with performance pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Harter, 1978)</ref>. Similarly, optimal challenge (e.g. playing a moderately superior opponent in chess) strongly predicts task enjoyment, even more so than skill, when adults are intrinsically motivated and goal-directed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abuhamdeh &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2012)</ref>. A second possibility is that playing for fun is a kind of playing to win that relies on maximizing success for a specific type of goal or metric, such as earning a high score or setting a personal record. A third possibility is that playing for fun is different from playing to win. That is, playing for fun may change the relative significance of motivations other than winning, such as: information gain, mastery, autonomy, meaning-seeking, social connection, self-signaling, novelty, visceral pleasure, and aesthetic experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berridge &amp; Kringelbach, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chater &amp; Loewenstein, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Churchland, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fishbach &amp; Woolley, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Haber et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">C.

Changes in motivation might effectively downweight winning or, equivalently, upweight other motivations. By contrasting children's choices when playing for fun and playing to win, we can better understand the relationship between these two types of play.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D R A F T</head><p>To address these questions, we contrasted children's choices about how to set up exactly the same game when it was framed in a way that emphasized playing for fun (Fun, i.e. "have as much fun as you can"), or instead focused on playing to win (Win, i.e. "win stickers"). In our activity, "Beach Bowling" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1a)</ref>, participants try to knock down blocks by throwing bean bags and batons. We introduced children to eight ways of changing the task. Critically, some changes were win-relevant and others were win-irrelevant. Win-relevant changes affect the likelihood of success (e.g. throwing distance), while win-irrelevant changes did not (e.g. color of batons): they instead varied dimensions commonly associated with play, such as novelty, randomness, autonomy, and dressing up as a different character. We then asked children how to best design Beach Bowling either for winning stickers or for having fun by adjusting these variables. We also collected participants' explicit judgments about how important each feature was in achieving these ends. This allowed us to test both how sensitive children are to the features that matter for playing to win and also in what ways playing for fun might go beyond playing to win. This game design paradigm provides a tractable way to reveal whether and how changes in motivation affect the fine-grained details of goal and action selection. We tested a broad age range of young children (i.e. 5-10 years old) to identify possible developmental changes. In particular, we consider the possibility that younger children care less about difficulty or struggle to assess difficulty, perhaps overestimating their abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chu &amp; Schulz, 2023b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Using this approach, our primary focus is to better understand children's motivations during play-particularly to better characterize children's motivations when playing for fun by contrasting it with playing to win. We begin, however, by examining their understanding of playing to win. We expect that if children can reason selectively and explicitly about the factors that influence the probability of winning, then they will: 1) choose easier settings for win-relevant variables in the Win Condition than in the Fun condition; and 2) judge win-relevant variables as more important than win-irrelevant variables in the Win Condition. By contrast, if their judgments are largely implicit, they may still choose easier win-relevant settings when playing to win but may not be able to judge these variables as more important than win-irrelevant variables. Finally, if they choose equivalent win-relevant settings and judge them equally D R A F T important in both conditions, this would provide evidence either that they do not understand which factors affect the probability of winning or that playing for fun is perhaps the same thing as playing to win. This latter hypothesis would be further strengthened if children also set win-irrelevant variables equivalently and judge them as similarly important across conditions. By contrast, differences across conditions, particularly in judgments about which variables matter, would provide evidence that playing for fun differs from playing to win in important ways.</p><p>We conducted two preregistered experiments to test these hypotheses. In Experiment 1, children configured each aspect of the game for both the Win and the Fun Conditions. We found that for win-relevant features, children chose easier settings during the Win Condition than during the Fun Condition. Similarly, children also chose lower settings for two of four win-irrelevant features. In addition, children judged that win-relevant variables mattered in the Win Condition but that no variables mattered in the Fun Condition. To test if these findings result from an artificial contrast between conditions due to a within-subjects design, Experiment 2 assigned each child to only one condition.</p><p>Replicating Experiment 1, we found that children chose significantly easier settings for win-relevant variables during the Win Condition than during the Fun Condition. By contrast, children chose similar settings for win-irrelevant variables across conditions, even though these variables manipulate dimensions commonly associated with play. We also found that children judged win-relevant variables as more important than win-irrelevant variables in the Win Condition but judged both kinds as equally irrelevant in the Fun condition. These results suggest that children are able to explicitly reason about which features of a task affect the likelihood of winning and set them appropriately both when playing to win and when playing for fun. They also show that playing for fun does in fact differ from playing to win in that children make different decisions under the two conditions and judge the importance of win-relevant variables differently across conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D R A F T Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, we asked children how to best configure a novel activity under two conditions: Win and Fun. We used a within-subjects design: each participant answered the same questions about both conditions, with condition order counterbalanced across participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were n = 80 English-speaking children (45 female) aged 5-10 years (M age = 7.68, SD = 1.41) from summer camps and children's museums in a major US city. Condition order was counterbalanced (n=40 Win-first and n=40 Fun-first), and we aimed to sample across the age range by recruiting similar numbers of younger 5-7-year-olds (n=43) and older 8-10-year-olds (n=37). Demographic data such as ethnicity were not collected, although museum visitor statistics suggest a predominantly White (49%) and Asian (17%) sample. The sample size was chosen to yield 80% power to detect a medium difference between the Win and Fun conditions, based on an estimate from pilot data collected with n = 34 participants. Five additional children were excluded for incomplete responses (n=2) or experimenter error (n=3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task design and materials</head><p>In our "Beach Bowling" activity, participants tossed bean bags and batons to knock down blocks on a rectangular court (2.7 meters long x 1.7 meters wide). Children modified the activity by setting eight variables: four win-relevant variables that affected the likelihood of knocking down blocks, and four win-irrelevant variables that did not affect game difficulty but are common features of children's everyday play (e.g. colorful objects, dressing up, rolling dice, spinning a wheel), emphasizing lighthearted engagement and autonomy of choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mukherjee et al., 2023)</ref>. Each variable could be set at one of three possible values (e.g. 1, 2, or 3 sharks to avoid); win-relevant variables all included one "easy", "medium", and "hard" value, determined by pilot testing. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a</ref> shows the activity and possible settings for each variable; see Supplemental Materials: A for additional details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D R A F T Procedure</head><p>Our procedure complies with all relevant ethical regulations and was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at [omitted for peer review] where the study was conducted. Participants and/or guardians provided informed consent. Two experimenters tested children in an outdoor area. The primary experimenter introduced children to the task and then asked about their game design preferences ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b</ref>; see full script at https://osf.io/uz49n?view_only=3fcdc7408cd14e1a91aa52da8e9ba94e). where participants toss batons from different positions on the yellow runway. Participants earn points for knocking down rectangular blocks, but incur penalties for landing batons inside the sharks. Participants can modify the game along four Win-Relevant variables (#1-4, in red) which affect task difficulty, and four Win-Irrelevant variables (#5-8, in blue) which do not affect task difficulty. Each variable offers three possible settings, listed low to high. (B) Overall protocol for Experiment 1 (E1) and Experiment 2 (E2). An experimenter introduces the Beach Bowling task and two conditions: to win stickers (WIN) or have as much fun as possible (FUN). Then, participants answer three questions about each variable. Condition was manipulated within-subjects in Experiment 1, but between-subjects in Experiment 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D R A F T</head><p>Introduction Phase. First, Experimenter 1 described Beach Bowling as an activity where "we try to knock down some blocks". Children then watched Experimenter 2 demonstrate Beach Bowling while Experimenter 1 narrated their actions. Experimenter 2 made three tosses, making sure to always land one bean bag in a shark's mouth as Experimenter 1 commented, "Uh oh! Not good… Now they can't get it back!" Next, Experimenter 1 introduced the two game conditions (Win and Fun), saying (critical manipulations underlined): "Now that you know what it looks like to play Beach Bowling, let me tell you something. There are actually two different ways to play this game. One way to play this game is to play to win stickers. If we play to win stickers, then the rule is that you need to knock down all six blocks in order to get some stickers. If you don't knock down all six blocks, then you don't get any stickers at all.</p><p>The other way to play this game is just for fun. If we play for fun, there are no prizes for knocking down the blocks, and the rule is that you need to have as much fun as possible." For each variable, children first learned about the three choices. The choices were presented in either randomized order (for win-irrelevant variables) or in increasing order of difficulty (for win-relevant variables). Because we can clearly identify the impact a change is likely to have on winning, all win-relevant choices were described as "easy," "medium," and "hard," so that children did not need to make this inference themselves. We cannot do the same for win-irrelevant choices, as they do not affect the likelihood of winning (by design), and we do not know what exactly children are optimizing for when they seek to have fun. Higher settings for these dimensions are intended to provide more of the feature associated with the dimension (e.g. the highest setting of randomness injects more randomness into the game than the middle setting, which injects more than the lowest setting), but we do not claim that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D R A F T</formula><p>children should optimize them in a given direction. We therefore opted not to bias children's judgments by labeling the win-irrelevant choices in any particular way.</p><p>After the variable was introduced, children answered three questions in fixed order. We prefaced every question with a reminder of the relevant condition, saying, "If you were playing to make sure that you [knock down all the blocks to win stickers / have as much fun as possible]..." First, Experimenter 1 asked children whether that variable "mattered" for the condition (i.e. for having fun or knocking down blocks). Next, Experimenter 1 asked for children's first preference. Options were presented in the same order as when first introduced. Finally, Experimenter 1 prompted children for their preference among the remaining two options. These three questions were then repeated for the other condition (Win or Fun), before moving to the next variable.</p><p>The entire sequence (variable introduction and six questions) was repeated for the remaining variables such that children answered 48 questions in total. The order of the variables was randomized for each participant by shuffling the cue cards, and children were randomly assigned to always receive either Win or Fun questions first (Supplemental Materials: B analyzes condition order effects). After these questions, Experimenter 1 concluded the procedure by asking whether children would rather play for fun, or try to win. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open Practices</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To understand the effect of motivation context on task selection, we examined three aspects of children's decisions. First, we examined children's preferred game settings. Second, we examined which variables</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D R A F T</formula><p>children explicitly judged to be important. Finally, as an exploratory analysis, we examined correlations between children's preferred game settings and these importance judgments.</p><p>We initially preregistered a series of ANOVAs and pairwise t-tests to examine how children's choices varied by condition, and how the effect of condition might be moderated by variable type and age.</p><p>However, after data collection, we realized that taking a mixed effects regression approach would more appropriately account for the correlational structure in our repeated measures design. This change in analytical method resulted in no change to conclusions. Thus, for each analysis below, we first report the best fit model and any significant model-estimated coefficients. We then report pre-registered tests on the raw data, as well as descriptive statistics, to aid in interpreting the regression coefficients.</p><p>We fit models using the lme4 R package (Bates, 2024). For models including age as a covariate, we first transformed age (in months) into z-scores to aid model convergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Game Setting Choices</head><p>Our primary research questions center on whether participants will choose different game settings when prompted to try to win versus play for fun. For each variable, we assigned one point for choosing the lowest or easiest setting and three points for the highest or hardest setting. For win-relevant variables, a higher score indicates a preference for more difficult challenges. For win-irrelevant variables, a higher score indicates a preference for greater amounts of autonomy, novelty, randomness, or playing as a different character. We computed children's preference score for each variable by calculating a weighted average of their first and second choice preference (score = ⅔ × first + ⅓ × second). By including both responses, these results capture more information about children's preferences and thus strongly test the hypothesized condition effect.

In an exploratory analysis, we examined if children's game preference would explain variability in their responses to earlier questions. However, adding game preference as a covariate to the earlier regression models did not significantly improve model fit for predicting either children's preferred game settings ( 2 (1) = 3.06, p = .08) or their relevance judgments ( 2 (1) = 0.01, p = .93) (see Supplemental Materials: D for details). Thus, children did not choose harder settings when playing for fun just because they thought fun is more rewarding than winning, or judge that win-relevant variables matter just because they prefer winning to having fun. Instead, the differences in their choices reflect differences in the underlying motivational context, showing both that children can reason accurately and explicitly about factors influencing the probability of winning and that there is an important sense in which playing for fun goes beyond playing to win.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D R A F T Experiment 2</formula><p>In Experiment 1, children preferred easier win-relevant settings when playing to win than when playing for fun. They also judged that win-relevant variables were important when playing to win but not when playing for fun. In contrast, children were less likely to distinguish win-irrelevant variables by condition:</p><p>children chose similar win-irrelevant settings in both conditions for two out of four variables, and judged that all four win-irrelevant variables were not important under both motivations. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that children can flexibly reason about and manipulate tasks along multiple dimensions to suit different motivations. However, there are at least two limitations. First, the within-subjects design may artificially inflate condition differences: because children heard both options, they might have assumed that they were supposed to respond differently across conditions for all questions. Second, participants lacked personal experience with Beach Bowling prior to making their judgments. Experiment 2 addresses both concerns: it uses a between-subjects design in which children try the activity (with all settings at "medium") before responding. Thus, children are familiarized with the task mechanics, and we can analyze how children in different conditions would modify the game relative to this common baseline.</p></div>

Children in Experiment 2 thus answered 24 questions compared to 48 in Experiment 1. </p></div>

As in Experiment 1, we calculated each participant's preference score as a weighted average of their first and second choices for each variable, before aggregating by variable type (win-relevant or irrelevant) within each condition. We modeled children's preference score using mixed effects linear regression with fixed effects of condition, variable type, age, and their interactions, as well as random intercepts for subjects and items. Model comparison using likelihood ratio tests found that none of the interaction terms involving age improved model fit, so D R A F T these were excluded from the final model.

This score ranged from -1 to +1. For example, a child who chose the highest difficulty setting ("3") as their first response would be coded as making a +1 shift from baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D R A F T</head><p>Overall, children chose the lowest setting as their first choice more often when playing to win (M Win = 3.12 of 8 variables) than when playing for fun (M Fun = 1.65;  2 (5) = 17.1, p = .004). Critically, these choices differed by variable type. On win-relevant variables, children preferred significantly easier settings than baseline when playing to win (mean shift = -0.47, t(23) = -5.48, two-tailed p &lt; .001) but significantly harder settings than baseline when playing for fun (mean shift = +0.3, t(19) = 2.90, p = .009), reflecting a strong condition effect (t(38.8) = 5.72, two-tailed p &lt; .001). On win-irrelevant variables however, children preferred significantly higher settings than baseline in both conditions (mean shift in Win = +0.38, t(23) = 6.04, p &lt; .001; Fun = +0.21, t(19) = 2.90, p = .009), with no difference in shift magnitude across conditions (t(39.8) = 1.78, p = .083). In summary, these results replicate Experiment 1 in finding that children selectively modify win-relevant variables to optimize for ease when playing to win but not when playing for fun, but treat win-irrelevant variables similarly in both conditions.</p><p>"Does it matter" judgments Children in Experiment 2 also recognized that the importance of win-relevant and win-irrelevant variables depends on the game condition (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). The best fit mixed-effects logistic regression model predicting children's relevance judgments in Experiment 2 included fixed effects of condition, variable type, age, and all two-way and three-way interactions, as well as random intercepts for subjects and items (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table S5</ref>).</p><p>A significant condition by variable type interaction (β = 1.56, OR = 4.78, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[1.19, 19.22]</ref>, p = .03) revealed that when playing to win, children judged win-relevant variables (M Win,Win-relevant = 62%) to matter more than win-irrelevant variables (M Win,Win-irrelevant = 31%; d = 0.84, paired t(22)= -3.37, p = .003).</p><p>Conversely, children in the Fun condition judged all variables to be unimportant, with no difference between win-relevant (M Fun,Win-relevant =19%) and win-irrelevant variables (M Fun,Win-irrelevant =16%; d = 0.08, paired t(19)= 0.33, p = .75).</p><p>Replicating Experiment 1, here we also found a significant three-way interaction between age, condition, and variable type (β = 2.65, OR = 14.16, 95% CI [2.91, 68.95], p = .001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>This study investigated the structure of play by examining how differences in motivation affect children's choices in a game design task. In particular, we sought to investigate: 1) how sensitive children are to the factors that affect winning a game (according to the extrinsically specified rules of the game); and 2) the ways in which their decision-making when playing to win differs from their decision making when playing the game simply to have fun. We thus introduced children to a novel task that could be modified along eight dimensions. We then asked children to choose the best settings for these dimensions to either have fun or to win the game, a contrast we manipulated both within subjects (Experiment 1) and between subjects (Experiment 2). In both experiments, children chose easier settings for win-relevant factors-those affecting the likelihood of winning-when playing to win than when playing to have fun.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we found no differences across conditions for win-irrelevant dimensions as a whole (though children chose lower settings when playing to win for two of four win-irrelevant dimensions), and no differences for win-irrelevant dimensions (collectively or individually) in Experiment 2. In addition, children in both experiments judged that win-relevant variables mattered in the Win Condition but that no variables mattered in the Fun Condition. Finally, Experiment 2 compared children's choices to a baseline version of the game and showed that children preferred higher than baseline settings for all factors when playing for fun, while preferring lower settings for win-relevant factors and higher settings for win-irrelevant factors when playing to win.</p><p>For our first question, these results suggest that children are explicitly sensitive to which variables are win-relevant. More importantly, children also preferentially manipulate win-relevant variables as D R A F T motivations change, while generally preferring the same settings for win-irrelevant variables across conditions. One caveat is that children in Experiment 1 showed mixed responses on win-irrelevant factors, though the within-subjects design of Experiment 1 may have artificially exaggerated differences between conditions. It is best to consider these results alongside the between-subjects results of Experiment 2, where children's judgments about all factors were more consistent with the idea that children understand how well each feature fits different motivations and choose accordingly. The relative lack of differences across conditions for win-irrelevant variables could be partly due to lack of attention to the relevant variables, leading to struggles in judging the appropriate changes. This difficulty could explain why an effect for win-irrelevant variables only appears in Experiment 1, where the contrast between conditions was more evident. This scenario seems unlikely, however, given that children in both experiments judged that win-relevant factors mattered for winning but not for having fun, and that win-irrelevant factors mattered in neither condition. Overall, our results suggest that children can recognize which task factors are relevant in a given motivational context and set them accordingly.</p><p>In answer to our second question, our results suggest that playing for fun is distinct from playing to win in that children make different decisions across conditions and judge the importance of win-relevant variables differently across conditions. We have not shown, however, that any particular optimization occurs when playing for fun. Looking at win-relevant variables, our results are consistent with children optimizing for ease, efficiency, and achievement when playing to win and simply relaxing the optimization when playing for fun. Nonetheless, challenge strongly predicts task enjoyment, even more so than skill, in play-like activities in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abuhamdeh &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2012)</ref>, so it seems likely to us that children are challenge-seeking in some way when playing for fun. Looking at win-irrelevant variables, children generally chose elevated settings both when playing for fun and when playing to win. Because these features were not related to winning in any meaningful way, children must have been intrinsically motivated to choose these settings. 2 Thus, while children's choices during play can</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D R A F T</formula><p>be modified by a desire to win or have fun, they are also strongly driven by a consistent (but as yet, largely unspecified) set of intrinsic motivations.</p><p>Continuing our discussion of win-irrelevant variables, we found that across experiments and conditions, children chose high levels of randomness, novelty, and autonomy. Playing as a different character was the only win-irrelevant variable where children generally preferred the lowest setting (i.e.,</p><p>to play as themselves instead of dressing up). This finding is curious because pretense is important to play in many cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boyette, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Carlson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Taylor &amp; Carlson, 2000)</ref>. Perhaps pretense is sufficiently demanding that adding it to an unfamiliar and complex task is overwhelming. It could also be that pretense adds little value to our task's salient goal of knocking down blocks, compared to other contexts where pretense is itself the core activity. Moreover, pretend play is more prevalent in younger children, especially preschoolers, and the school-aged children in this study may see the game's rules as sufficient pretense on their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Taylor, 1999)</ref>, or may have found the particular costumes too "juvenile".</p><p>Whatever the case, further studies can explore additional win-irrelevant dimensions to better understand what children optimize for when playing for fun.</p><p>Our findings leave open several other avenues for future research. First, it is an interesting open question whether children, who differentiate "play for fun" and "play to win" in this paradigm, might also differentiate both conditions from "playing to learn" or even simply "playing". Play comprises an extraordinarily flexible class of behaviors, and comparing the various motivations children bring to play may help better understand its underlying structure. Second, it would be interesting to examine how children's challenge-seeking for fun is affected by individual differences in in persistence <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Leonard et al., 2021</ref>; J. (Jenny) Wang &amp; Bonawitz, 2022), grit <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Duckworth et al., 2007)</ref>, mindset <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dweck, 2006)</ref>, or social inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bass et al., 2021)</ref>. Third, our experiments offer insight into children's judgments of fun, but did not explicitly assess children's opinions of how much fun each feature setting might be and intentionally did not measure children's experience of fun. People necessarily make decisions based on what they think will happen, rather than based on what actually does happen. Additional studies might investigate how children's experiences of fun shape their beliefs about what they expect to be fun-perhaps by examining how children's play judgments change over time. Finally, while we found a weak correlation between age and difficulty preferences, future work might explore potential developmental changes in children's play decisions, including how they estimate and weigh task difficulty into their play decisions, especially in novel tasks where the relations between environment variables, player skills, and the likelihood of different outcomes can be more opaque or complex.</p><p>While we have focused on interactions between motivation and goal selection in this work, these are not the only factors driving decision-making. Among other things, people must balance ends and means to create goals which they can accomplish while also seeking means that make it possible to accomplish valuable goals. These interactions pose a challenging learning problem, and it remains poorly understood how children solve it. In particular, we do not know how children learn about the space of possible goals, which goals are most appropriate to a particular intrinsic motivation, how to value individual goals, or how to judge a goal's feasibility.</p><p>We speculate, however, that this learning problem is deeply related to play. In particular, children in Experiment 2 reliably chose harder than baseline settings for all variables when playing for fun. While play has been notoriously difficult to define and explain <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chu &amp; Schulz, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Rubin et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Zosh et al., 2018)</ref>, its challenge-seeking orientation-the willingness to relax commitments to ease, efficiency, and achievement-may help children learn the complex relationships involved in effective decision making. For example, play may be primarily about proposing goals and pursuing them to learn about the structure of problems and their solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chu &amp; Schulz, 2023a)</ref>. If so, children may pursue goals with a problem-directed curiosity, focused on exploring what kinds of problems can be posed and how they can be solved. In this case, challenge-seeking may be a particularly easy method for devising new goals.</p><p>Alternatively, children at play may express competence-directed curiosity, placing more emphasis on learning about their own abilities than about the structure of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(White, 1959)</ref>. In this case, challenge-seeking may be a particularly efficient way for children to learn and extend the limits of their</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D R A F T</formula><p>competence. Similarly, play may optimize for empowerment gain. 3 Empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Klyubin et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Salge et al., 2013)</ref> and related measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Liljeholm, 2018)</ref> assess how well the effects of an agent's actions can be predicted from the actions themselves; empowerment gain measures improvements in an agent's ability to control the world through their actions. In this case, children might seek challenges to improve their ability to control the world. These alternatives are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive; play may instead be better formulated in terms of other frameworks such as optimizing free energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buckley et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Friston et al., 2006)</ref>, pursuing novelty <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Stanley &amp; Lehman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">R. Wang et al., 2020)</ref>, or exploring rare action-state combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ramírez-Ruiz et al., 2024)</ref>. Future studies can explore all these hypotheses using the approach we took here. Asking children to make choices about tasks along dimensions separating these hypotheses, perhaps with a revised version of the paradigm used here, would both test various theories of play in a fine-grained way and illuminate how play relates to decision making more broadly. More generally, because our paradigm can be adapted to offer choices along a wide variety of dimensions, it offers a well-controlled and adaptable window into how intrinsic motivations-typically opaque-affect everyday decision making.</p><p>Continuing to explore the intrinsic motivations behind play through these and other sorts of experiments would also be valuable because of the critical role play has throughout developmental and educational psychology. Many experiments in developmental psychology are framed as games for children to play. If play draws on specific intrinsic motivations that affect goal selection and other aspects of decision making, having a detailed understanding of those effects would help experimenters to both interpret their results and to design experiments compensating for those effects. Similarly, guided play-which marries children's impulses toward free play with scaffolding toward specific learning goals-has emerged in educational psychology as a powerful learning tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Weisberg et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Weisberg et al., , 2016</ref>.</p></div>

Many issues remain open, such as: how people manage a much more complex set of motivations than those explored here; what the space of possible goals is like; and how adopting a goal affects other aspects of decision making. To answer these questions, we need to study decision making using a broader range of possible motivations and goals. Doing so is challenging, but will enable a better understanding of human action and of intelligent behavior. In other words, science can be hard, but it is possible both to win and to have fun doing it.</p><p>Competing Interests The authors declare none.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">D R A F T D R A F T D R A F T D R A F T D R A F T D R A F T D R A F T D R A F T 1</formula><p>Supplemental Materials for Fun isn't easy: Children selectively manipulate task difficulty when "playing for fun" vs. "playing to win"</p><p>In section (A) we provide more details on the materials used and the design of the task.

Here, we detail what the three choice options were for each variable. In Experiment 1, we manipulated game condition (Win or Fun) within subjects, and counterbalanced across participants which condition was presented first.

In contrast, age did not predict children's choices in the Fun condition, whether collapsing across all variables (r(18) = 0.17, p = .48) or for each variable type separately (win-relevant: r(18) = 0.015, p = 0.95; win-irrelevant: r(18) = 0.25, p = 0.29).

We ran a linear mixed effects regression to assess potential interactions between age, condition, and variable type.

Specifically, the three-way age by condition and variable type interaction significantly improved model fit over the model with only main effects ( 2 (4) = 46.3, p &lt; .001) and also the model with two-way interactions ( 2 (1) = 4.58, p = .032).</p><p>When inspecting the simple slope of age for each combination of condition and variable type, we found that the only significant age trend was on win-relevant variables in the Win condition, with older children preferring more difficult settings (β age_z = 0.10, t(100) = 2.54, p = .01). In summary, these findings replicate the results reported in the main text. When controlling for age, children chose different settings on win-relevant variables depending on condition, but made similar choices on win-irrelevant variables in both conditions.

As predicted, children's preferences differed between the two conditions (β Fun-Win = 0.39, 95% CI [0.32, 0.46], p &lt; .001). On average, children chose higher settings when playing for fun (M Fun =2.11, SD = 0.25) than when playing to win (M Win = 1.85, SD=0.23; Cohen's d = 0.82, paired t(79)=7.37, two-tailed p &lt; .001). However, this condition difference was greater for win-relevant variables than win-irrelevant variables, as revealed by a significant condition by variable type interaction (β Fun*Win-irrelevant = -0.26, 95% CI [-0.36, -0.16], p &lt; .001).On win-relevant variables, children chose higher difficulty settings when playing for fun (M Fun =2.06) than when playing to win (M Win =1.67; d = 0.73; paired t(79) = 6.51, two-tailed p &lt; .001), with significant condition differences on all four win-relevant variables (ps &lt; .001, paired two-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction). Children's choices also differed on win-irrelevant variables (d = 0.39, paired t(79)= 3.51, p &lt; .001), though this was driven by a subset of variables. When setting up the game to maximize fun, compared to winning, children chose slightly higher levels of novelty (M Fun = 2.48, M Win = 2.15, t(79)</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
