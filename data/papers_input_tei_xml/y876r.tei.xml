			<abstract>
				<p>A critical component of theory-of-mind is the ability to adapt to the hidden and fluctuating nature of cooperative or competitive intentions. Yet, the computational mechanisms underlying this ability and how it develops during childhood remain unclear. Here, we tested children aged 3 to 9 in which they presumed to play with another child in a strategic task. In fact, they played with an algorithm that alternated between cooperative and competitive strategies without warning. Most children were able to mentalize their influence on other&apos;s decisions and adapted to other&apos;s changing intentions at 8 years old. Computational modeling revealed a developmental milestone at 8 years of age when simulation of one&apos;s influence on others and arbitration between cooperative and competitive strategies determine choice. Overall, our findings characterize how computations required to adapt to fluctuating intentions of others develop during childhood. Teaser Mechanisms underlying adaptation to fluctuating intentions of others account for development of mentalizing abilities in children.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Often considered as an essential requirement for sophisticated social interactions, Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states, such as emotions, beliefs, or desires, to other individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Different milestones have been proposed in the development of ToM from birth to early adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Its most basic form, also known as perception-goal psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> emerges from around 9 months of age and allows individuals to represent that others may have different perceptual perspectives of the world and act accordingly. Later, meta-representations emerge from around 4 years of age, in the form of belief-desire psychology, and involve an appreciation that others subjectively represent the world in finegrained aspectual ways that may be false or incompatible with one's own view <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . At around 7 years of age, children's meta-representational understanding can be further refined to the so-called Advanced Theory-of-Mind (AToM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . AToM describes multiple aspects of an advanced understanding of the minds of others, including social reasoning that involves understanding of others' intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . The ability to track how others' behavior might change, and to adapt to others' cooperative/competitive intentions that fluctuate over time is essential to keep an advantage in social interactions. In such unsignaled changing contexts, understanding other's intentions requires not only to represent the beliefs about other's intentions, as in cooperative or competitive contexts alone, but also to adapt to whether the other is competing or cooperating, in order to deploy an appropriate behavioral response <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . We specifically focus on the ability to adapt to fluctuating cooperative versus competitive intentions of others, which may be an important cognitive component required for understanding others' intentions.</p><p>To investigate adaptation to fluctuating cooperative/competitive intentions of others in children, we built on a recent literature that uses economic games to test children's decision abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</p><p>The computational mechanisms underlying this ability to adapt to the fluctuating cooperative or competitive intentions of others remains unknown during children development. Characterizing these computations is important because it should help build a mechanistic understanding of how this component of AToM develops in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , and should also help build Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems able to seamlessly interact with humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> . Formal computational models of ToM functions have been proposed in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> . More specifically, we have proposed the Mixed-Intention Influence Learning (MIIL) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , which accounts for the influence of one's choice on another's decisions and also arbitrates between competitive and cooperative opponent's decision strategies using two experts and a controller. One expert assesses the competitive intentions and the other assesses cooperative intentions whereas the controller determines the relative weights of these experts on choice based on their relative reliabilities. This model outperforms other learning models in predicting social choice behavior in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , when they have to alternate between unsignaled cooperative and competitive games. Below, we introduce our MIIL model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed-Intentions Influence Learning (MIIL) model</head><p>The Mixed-Intentions Influence Learning model extends the Influence model described by Hampton et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . The original influence model considers how one's own actions influence the other's future actions. Thus, to compute the probability of updating of the other's strategy, we replaced update of opponent strategy ( . 1) in the player decision rule ( . 2). Then, with a Taylor expansion taking close to 0, we added the influence terms (Δ : influence update signal of the participant, Δ : influence update signal of the other):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Δ ≈ + 2 (1 − )( − * ) ( . 3) ≈ + 2 (1 − )( − * ) ≈ − 2 (1 − )( − * ) ( . 4)</formula><p>Thus, in the competitive mode, there is only a sign difference between the term of influence of the two players which is not the case in the cooperative setting. A player can thus incorporate the influence of his/her action on the strategy of the other player: The Influence model update rules. * Is the predicted opponent strategy. is the opponent choice and then ( − * ) is the action prediction error. The influence update is due to the ( − * * ) term. Thus is the player's own action and * * the inferred probabilities that the opponent has of the player themself (second-order beliefs). Thus, in the cooperative and competitive modes the influence will occur in the opposite directions. In the mixed-intention influence model, we decline +1 * in +1</p><p>* and +1 * .</p><p>To compute the * * and * * , we invert the decision function ( . The influence learner uses the inferred probability that the other chooses a, the payoff matrix and the other temperature to compute a decision value: The Mixed-Influence model makes a difference between the Cooperative and Competitive modes. The mixed-intentions model makes the assumption that the cooperative expert and the competitive expert come from the same influence model, because, from the point of view of the participants, there is no indication that there are two modes of interaction. Therefore, it is more parsimonious to assume that a single process (i.e. same computational model for both experts) is engaged along the task. For the mixed-intentions setting, we ran the competitive and cooperative models in parallel, avoiding the need for the payoff matrix to be learnt. On the first trial, each expert gives a prior probability that the other would choose the "action a" (p coop,0 * = p comp,0 * = 0.5), then each expert follows its own walk in generating on each trial the probability that the other will choose option a for each possible mode of interactions, P comp a and P coop a . We then transformed the probability with the inverse sigmoid function to have values ranging from −∞ to +∞. We have a binomial choice configuration thus = − in both competitive and cooperative settings. Thus, as and get close to zero, uncertainty for i, the other's intention, increases. We defined the reliability of the intention i as the absolute value of and the probability that the other intention is cooperative as the sigmoid function of the difference in reliability between the two modes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">=</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">= 1 1 + (| |−| |− ) ( . 9)</formula><p>where is the inverse temperature controlling for the stochasticity of the mode of interaction and is the bias towards cooperative mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Then, with</head><p>, and , we computed the decision value given the Competitive and Cooperative payoff matrix, and respectively and weighted them by the probability of the corresponding mode of interaction to compute the total decision value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= * + (1 − ) * ( . 10)</formula><p>We call * the cooperative component of the model and (1 − ) * the competitive component of the model. The sigmoid function s generated the probability of selecting choice a at trial t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">, = ( ) ( . 11)</formula><p>Finally, the reward prediction error was defined as the reward at trial t for action a: Two influence models (one cooperative and the other competitive, resp. Pcoop in green and Pcomp in red) compute a value for choosing one specific target (P in black). A controller uses the difference between the absolute value of the value of each expert (called reliability) to compute a probability that the other is cooperating (blue). Then, the model weights the value of each expert according to the probability of being in cooperative or in competitive modes to produce a final decision value. Then it compares its predictions to the actual reward and computes again a new value for each expert.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= , − , (<label>. 12</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>'Tracking fluctuating intentions' Task</head><p>We tested the MIIL model and other models (see supp. Mat) in children. To do this, we used the 'tracking fluctuating intentions' task <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , that requires children to detect fluctuating cooperative/competitive intentions of others. Pairs of children completed this task in which they played a card-matching game on two tablets (one tablet for each child) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>). Each child from these pairs played facing a same-gender child <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2a&amp;b</ref>). Both were told that they were playing with each other, but were not allowed to communicate. Unbeknownst to them, they were in fact playing with an Artificial Agent (AA) that switched between cooperative and competitive modes of interaction (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2d</ref>). The goal of the game was to score as many points as possible by finding the same card as the other player (i.e. AA) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2c</ref>). The rules to earn points were not explicitly given to the children, rather they had to infer them by trial and error. Therefore, this task allowed us to investigate the computations used by children to adapt to fluctuating cooperative and competitive intentions of the other and to identify at what developmental age they are able to do so. Importantly, the specific mode of interaction (i.e., cooperation vs competition) was not indicated to children. They played facing each other, so each could see the other, but not the other's tablet. They were told that their tablets were connected, that the other player represented on their tablet was the child sitting opposite, and that each of them had to maximize their own score to maximize their final reward. In reality both children were actually playing with an Artificial Agent (AA). Males were paired with males and females with females. (c) Experimental protocol. The two players both chose one card among two cards presented. When both children had chosen, the chosen cards were revealed, and if the card they had chosen was the same as that chosen by the AA, they scored points. If their card was not the same as that indicated for them by the AA, that child was not rewarded. (d) Payoff matrix for the two possible modes of the Artificial Agent (AA). The AA that decided which choice was rewarded for the participant operated in either a competitive or a cooperative mode, based on the payoff matrices depicted above. (e) Snapshots of the game on tablets. The player chose one of the two cards presented on the lower part of the screen. The jewels on the right represent the score of the child. The goal of the game was to score as many points as possible, by selecting the correct card among the two cards of the player (displayed at the bottom of the screen), knowing that the other player's cards were displayed on top of the screen.</p><p>It is unclear whether the mixed-Intentions model, or simpler models of ToM, apply to children and how different computational models of ToM may develop during childhood. Here, we sought to identify whether, and when, these specific computational mechanisms appear during children's development. To identify the computational mechanisms used to adapt to others' intentions, we fit individual's choice data using each of the candidate models to determine the best/winning model for each age groups. We also analyzed the learning parameters of the winning models to characterize the evolution of their hidden states in different age groups. This allowed us to describe, at a mechanistic level, how adaptation to changing intentions of others develops and evolves between different age groups. We expected the ability to differentiate between the competitive vs cooperative modes of interaction to increase with age. Based on the literature about strategic games <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and AToM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , we expected children around the age of 7-8 to adapt to the hidden cooperative or competitive intentions of their partners. At the computational level, we hypothesized that younger age groups of children should be better fitted by simpler computational models, whereas the most sophisticated model (the MIIL model) could be the winning model only in the oldest age group. Alternatively, if the same model fits all age groups best, the evolution of the learning parameters of that model with age should explain better performance corresponding to better adaptation to competitive vs cooperative intentions in older children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Behavioral signature of tracking intentions. To study possible signature of tracking other's intentions, we considered multiple variables that could affect choice behavior. These included the previous stay vs switch choices of the child player and the artificial agent (AA) over the previous three trials (at t-1, t-2, t-3), the three previous outcomes (i.e. whether the previous three trials were won or lost), the age and sex of the child, decision time, the hierarchical condition (i.e., if they were paired with a child in the same school grade, an older child, or a younger child), the number of trials within a session of the experiment, the strategy of the AA at that time (competitive or cooperative), the previous cooperativity signatures at t-1 and t-2 (see below), and finally the interactions between age and cooperativity signatures as regressors. We first investigated the probability to "stay", i.e., to select the same target as that from the previous trial, for the three different age groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3a)</ref>. We examined how children used the history of previous interactions to make their choices.</p><p>To measure cooperation, we defined the "cooperativity signature" as a binary variable that is equal to 1 if: (a) the participant won on the previous trial and the artificial agent (AA) stayed on the same target for the next trial, or (b) the participant lost on the previous trial and the AA switched to the other target for the next trial. Otherwise, the cooperativity signature was set to 0. Indeed, from the perspective of the participant, if the AA is a cooperative partner, then when both players win by choosing the same target, they should choose to keep the same target. Instead, if they lose due to choosing different targets, the AA's switch can be seen as its willingness to conform to the participant's choice. Cooperativity signature equal to 1 corresponds to the AA following win-stay/lose-switch strategy. Behavioral results. (a) Mean probability for the children to choose the same target as the one they chose in the previous trial ("stay"). The mean frequency to "stay" is represented in green, blue and red for children in mid-primary school (MPS), early primary school (EPS), and kindergarten (KG) respectively, with their respective standard errors (ribbons). The purple bar represents the first 4 initial trials in which the Artificial Agent (AA) played randomly for initialization purposes. The green bars represent the cooperative blocks and the red bars the competitive blocks. (b) Generalized Mixed Effects (GLME) models, marginal effects. Left: predicted probability for the subjects to choose the correct target in trial n, rewardn, plotted against the trial number (x-axis), after a positive cooperativity signature (blue) vs after a negative cooperativity signature (red) for different ages. Right: predicted probability for the subjects to choose the same target at trial n as previously (at trial n-1), stayn (right). The older the child, the better they succeed in coordinating with the AA after a positive cooperativity signature and the more stable they behave in the cooperative blocks.</p><p>Overall, participants' performance improved with time and within a session of the experiment. Children tended to stay more frequently over time in the cooperative blocks. Moreover, the average probability of "stay" (i.e., to select the same target as that from the previous trial) over time revealed that older children tended to stay more during the cooperative blocks <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3a)</ref>. Examining how children used the history of previous interactions to make their choices, we found that the outcomes of the previous three trials, i.e., the decisions of both the participant and the AA to stay and whether the participant was successful, significantly predicted the probability that the participant would stay and win, independently of all other factors ( <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, the cooperativity signature at t-1 predicted a higher probability for the children to stay with their choice. This indicates that children tracked whether the other agent was cooperating during the previous trial. More specifically, the marginal effects of the interaction between cooperativity signature and age <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3b left)</ref> indicated that older children performed significantly better after a positive (vs zero) cooperativity signature from the AA. In comparison, after controlling for other independent variables, younger children did not show such improvements in performance after trials with a positive cooperativity signature. This indicates that older children identified signatures of cooperativity better. In contrast, younger children also tended to stay less in the cooperative blocks, independently from other factors. However, taking into account the marginal effects of the interaction between the age of the child and the mode of the AA (cooperative vs. competitive) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3b right)</ref>, we observed that stay behavior was more frequent in cooperative blocks compared to the competitive blocks for older children, whereas, surprisingly, it decreased in cooperative blocks compared to competitive blocks for younger children. These results point towards an evolution of the learning process for intention adaptation and coordination strategy. We found no effect for sex or hierarchical condition. Our findings hold after a step-by-step drop-term procedure or addition of a random effect of time (see Supp. Mat., section GLM and GLME for further details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model-free analysis based on information theory reveals emergence of new strategies in older children.</head><p>To examine whether and how children continuously adjust their behavior across cooperative and competitive blocks and reveal different choice strategies across age groups, we next computed several metrics based on information theory to measure consistency in children's responses to the AA's choice and reward feedback. More specifically, we computed the entropy in participant's choice strategy in terms of stay or switch on the previous target (H(Str)), mutual information in reward-dependent strategy (MIRS), and conditional entropy of reward-dependent strategy (ERDS) over the time course of the experiment. We computed these quantities using a running average (with window size of seven trials) and separately for each of the three age groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4</ref>, see Methods for more details).</p><p>We found that during the cooperative blocks, better performance ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4a</ref>) in older children was accompanied by lower H(Str) (Spearman's correlation; r = -0.718, p = 7.15e-32), suggesting that older children were overall more consistent in their stay or switch between trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4b</ref>, Wilcoxon rank sum test on H(Str); KG vs. EPS: p = .0169; EPS vs. MPS: p = .0203). The lower H(str) observed in older children was mostly due to a decrease in ERDS (r = 0.852, p = 1.53e-55; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4d</ref>), corresponding to more consistent responses to reward feedback, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in MIRS (r = 0.438, p = 1.98e-10; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4c</ref>) corresponding to a weaker link between choice and previous reward outcome. These results indicate that the superior performance of older children during the cooperative blocks was due to two factors: (1) older children were able to choose more consistently across trials (less stochasticity in choice); (2) older children based their choices on reward outcome less strongly.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . During the cooperative blocks, both MIRS and ERDS decreased in older children, showing that older children chose less randomly, and that they were also able to base their choice strategy less strongly on reward outcome. In contrast, during the competitive blocks, larger MIRS in 8-9 yo compared with 6-7 yo was accompanied by smaller ERDS in 8-9 yo compared with 6-7 yo. (Shaded error bar = S.E.M.)</p><p>In contrast, the differences between the three age groups were smaller during the competitive blocks. More specifically, there were no significant differences in their consistency in strategy (H(Str)), even between the youngest (KG) and the oldest (MPS) age groups (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = .582; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4b, inset</ref>). Yet, we observed that the oldest (MPS) age group responded more strongly to the outcome on the previous trials, as indicated by significantly larger MIRS than the younger EPS group (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = .0285; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4c</ref> inset) or KG group (p = .038). Similarly, the randomness in strategy after accounting for the effect of reward outcome (ERDS) was significantly smaller for the oldest group (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = .00205; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4d</ref> inset), but not significantly different between KG and EPS children (p = .311). The smaller ERDS for the oldest group compared to the younger group (EPS) was accompanied by a larger MIRS <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4c)</ref>. This indicates that during the competitive blocks, only children in the oldest group were able to learn better from reward feedback and this made them more consistent in their responses to rewards.</p><p>Overall, these results suggest that only the oldest group of children (MPS) were able to adjust their strategy appropriately when the intention of AA changed between the cooperative and competitive blocks. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed that the MPS group showed the largest overall increase in MIRS from cooperative to competitive blocks <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4c</ref>; mean increase = 0.0788; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = .00127), whereas there were no significant differences for two younger age groups in MIRS between these two conditions (KG: mean increase = -0.00286, p = .891; EPS: mean increase = -0.0438, p = .634). These results indicate the development of additional strategies in older children that allow them to learn from reward feedback differently depending on the nature of the interaction with the other agents.</p><p>Computational models track children's evaluation of the "other player's" intentions. To elucidate the computations underlying the children's strategic decision-making, we compared the ability of a variety of computational models in fitting choice data of individual children on a trial-by-trial basis. We sought to examine their ability not only to mentalize the other agent, but also to adapt to its intentions. Therefore, we fitted different Influence models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , including the Mixed-Intentions Influence Learning (MIIL) and classical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . Classical influence models rely on mentalizing mechanisms that account for the influence of one's own choice on the other's choice. We tested a competitive as well as a cooperative version of the classical influence model. However, they did not eventually pass the model confusion analysis (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Materials)</ref>. In contrast, the MIIL model computes one decision value according to a competitive expert and another according to a cooperative expert. It then arbitrates between the two, based on the difference in their relative reliability, defined as the difference in unsigned value functions for the two choices determined by specific learning algorithms (see Supplementary Materials). We also compared these models to other models that did not rely on mentalizing mechanisms. Specifically, we fitted a Win-Stay/Lose-Switch (WS/LS) heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , a Q-Learning (QL) model based on reinforcement learning, and Bayesian models of different complexity, (Bayesian Sequence Learners of depth 0 and 1 (BSL0 and BSL1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> (see Supplementary Materials for more details on the models).</p><p>We found that the best fitting model for the majority of children in groups KG and EPS was the BSL0 model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 5a-b)</ref>, which is a Bayesian learning model that computes the mean and variance of the probability of the correct choice for the next trial (KG: Estimated Frequency Ef=0.605, protected Exceedance Probability pEP=0.999; EPS: Ef=0.530, pEP=0.986). This result shows that a majority of the children from 3 to 7 years old neither tracked the intentions of the other agent, nor relied on any mentalizing process for their decision in this task. They rather tracked with a simple Bayesian strategy which card was the most probable at each trial. In mid-primary schoolers (MPS), the MIIL model fitted the majority of the children best (MPS: Ef=0.483, pEP=0.956, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5a-b)</ref>. This indicates that the ability to mentalize and to track the intentions of others for strategic decision-making actually appears around the age of 8 years old, when children are in the third year of primary school (in China). Furthermore, this ability to mentalize and track intentions, with an un-signaled alternation between cooperative and competitive blocks, appears gradually among children starting from kindergarten (KG: Ef=0.122, pEP=10e-11; EPS: Ef=0.278, pEP=1.36e-2; MPS: Ef=0.483, pEP=0.956, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5a-b)</ref>. These suggest that children progressively develop the ability to mentalize and update their beliefs about future chosen targets, and arbitrate between the predicted intentions of another to compete or cooperate. This ability appears earlier in some children (at kindergarten) but the majority of mid-primary schoolers apply this decision process which remains the most common strategy in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . x-axis: model names; y-axis: age group; Color-scale: (a) estimated frequencies (Ef), i.e., the frequency at which one model fitted one subject best in the group population compared to the other tested models; (b) protected exceedance probabilities (pEP), i.e., the probability that measures how likely it is that any given model is more frequent than all other models in the comparison set, corrected for the possibility that observed differences in model evidence (over subjects) are due to chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . In the Kindergarten (KG) and Early Primary School (EPS) groups, the model that best fitted most of our group of participants is the BSL0. In Mid-Primary School, the MIIL model best fitted most of the participants. (c) Mean estimated cooperation probability computed from the MIIL model. x-axis: trial number. y-axis: wMIIL, the mean probability, according to the MIIL model, that the participant attempts to cooperate (left) across all participants (group by group) and (right) across only those participants that were best fitted by the MIIL model for the 114 trials (group by group). This indicates that children in kindergarten fail to use sophisticated MIIL computations. The initial purple area shows the 4 random initializing trials, green areas are the Cooperative blocks, and red areas are the Competitive blocks.</p><p>The sophistication of children's decision process increases with age. The BSL0 model best accounted for the behavior of the majority of younger children, but was almost entirely absent as the best model in the oldest group. Thus, the model frequencies of the oldest (MPS) vs youngest (KG) groups of children differed significantly. The posterior probability that the two groups had the same model frequencies was p = 6.7e-3 (uncorrected). Although there was no significant difference between the frequency of the different models in the KG and EPS groups (p=0.995) or in the EPS and MPS groups (p=0.990), there was a general trend towards an increase in the sophistication of the strategies such that the BSL1 model best accounted for the behavior of more EPS and MPS students than the BSL0. The WSLS heuristic remained a marginal strategy for some EPS and MPS participants, although its representation increased among the other models with age (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5a-b)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, analysis of the arbitration parameters of the MIIL model for the children that were best fitted by this model, revealed how the model attributes the cooperative vs competitive tendency of the children <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 5c)</ref>. In general, the children showed a low tendency to cooperate in the game. This was the case across the three age groups. Their tendency to cooperate increased during the cooperative blocks, and interestingly, in the older age group, children became more likely to cooperate than not during the cooperative blocks. Furthermore, for the MPS group, the tendency to cooperate in cooperative blocks increased progressively over consecutive cooperative blocks. This indicates that the older children improved their ability to decipher the cooperative intentions of the artificial agent during the cooperative blocks of the task. Thus, our results indicate differences in both model frequency between the age groups, but also that the children best fitted by the MIIL model were also more capable of recognizing cooperative intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Learning to adapt one's own decisions to those of another facilitates social interactions. This skill is required for both competitive or cooperative interactions that happens in the playground and classroom at school. Here, we examined how children across age groups adjust their choice behavior across cooperative and competitive blocks and moreover, we characterized the computations required to adapt to such changes in the intentions of others. The strength of our approach was to compare different computational models to assess how children learn to adapt their decisions to those of another. This allowed us to accurately captures, at a mechanistic level, the development of AToM abilities during childhood, avoiding issues of interpretation that can be encountered when relying only on behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</p><p>Overall, we found that by the age of 8 years old, most children used a computational mechanism relying on a mixed-intention influence learning model that arbitrates between cooperative and competitive intentions to adapt their decisions. Moreover, most children in mid-primary school exploit a cooperativity signature (i.e., intention to cooperate with their partner) better than younger children. Measures of entropy and mutual information based on information theory indicate that older (vs. younger) children performed especially well in cooperative blocks due to two reasons: (1) higher choice consistency, and (2) weaker reliance on the previous outcome to decide. As a result, the oldest group of children discriminated between competitive vs cooperative blocks more efficiently and behaved more predictably in the cooperative rather than competitive blocks. This may reflect willingness to signal coordination to the other by taking the outcome of previous trials less into account.</p><p>From the computational point of view, we found evidence that most children in midprimary school are able to track variations of another individual's hidden cooperative/competitive intentions. This was reflected in their behavior being best explained by a MIIL model 15 that exploits a control mechanism that gives a higher weight to the strategy with the most reliable prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . In contrast, the best fitting model for the majority of children in KG and EPS groups (children from 3 to 7 years old) was a learning model that computes the mean and variance of the probability of the correct choice for the next trial. Children in this age group neither tracked the intentions of the other agent, nor relied on any mentalizing process for their decision in this task. They rather tracked which card was the most probable at each trial using a simple inference-based strategy.</p><p>We found that the tendency of older children (MPS group) to cooperate or compete can be captured by arbitration mechanism proposed by the MIIL model. Moreover, the relative weight of cooperation vs. competition was adjusted over time depending on the competitive vs cooperative blocks. More specifically, the intention to cooperate during cooperative blocks grows stronger with time over the course of consecutive blocks. This suggests that children that understand the intentions of the other player (in this case the AA) improved their performance in this task by realizing that the other player could both cooperate or compete. This indicates that older children (MPS group) can actively learn and adapt to the intentions of the other player. Most children in the younger (KS and EPS) groups did not show this ability except for a few children in the intermediate EPS group. However, the ability of such children to learn and adapt to the AA, as captured by the arbitration weight factor, was far lower than that of children in the oldest group. Note that in all three age groups, there was a strong bias towards competition. This might be because most videogames played on tablets by children at this age, and also in their daily experience, involve competition in one way or another. The competitive bias might also have been fostered by the experimental setup in which children were placed facing each other, which, by default, might encourage a competitive, rather than a cooperative or neutral context, for children.</p><p>Our computational modeling analysis indicates a shift in nature of the algorithms, from Bayesian inference model (BSL0) to MIIL, used by children between early primary school (EPS) and mid-primary school (MPS). This is consistent with behavioral reports that core aspects of AToM develop nonlinearly, with children reaching a milestone at the age of 7 years, at which time they attain the conceptual insight that mental states can be recursive <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Indeed, it has been proposed that a distinct conceptual development occurring in middle childhood at around 7-8 years old could explain improved performance concerning social reasoning and reasoning about ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . In contrast, a simple and general increase in informationprocessing capacities might predict a change from Bayesian Sequence Learners of depth 0 to depth 1 (i.e. BSL0 to BSL1) during development, and would not explain such conceptual development in reasoning. Our findings therefore confirm that a conceptual development occurs in children between early primary school (EPS) and mid-primary school (MPS) age. We characterize this change at the computational level, by showing that it is underlined by algorithms of distinct nature. According to this model, most children in the oldest group have achieved the insight that: a) their own previous choices can influence others' behavior and, b) that others can change their intentions during interactions and consequently switch strategies. We find that this conceptual insight occurs at around the same age, 8 years old, as reported in large-scale studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , that, however, lack characterization of computational mechanisms. This is an important period of cognitive development that might be linked to other complex forms of reasoning, such as scientific reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</p><p>The MIIL model that fits most MPS children best is also the model that fitted most of adults best during the same task <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . Children above 8 years old are, in this sense, more similar to adults than younger children. A similar behavioral trend was observed for other repeated economic games (stickers game and sender-receiver game), where children older than 6.5 years of age become more similar to adults than children younger than 6.5 years old <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . Our results therefore indicate that most 8-year-old children have developed the computational mechanisms that they will probably maintain in adulthood to adapt to others' fluctuating intentions or to solve similar decision tasks. This corroborates the findings that rapid changes in decision process occur during childhood, plateau, then get optimized across adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</p><p>In summary, our work provides evidence that important conceptual developments occur in children at around 8 years old that can be accounted for by the Mixed-Intentions Inference Learning model. We establish that, from mid-primary school onward, most children develop the abilities to adapt to the fluctuating intentions of others to cooperate or compete, and learn to adapt their own strategy as a consequence. They become able to mentalize the influence of their own choices on another's decisions and to arbitrate between cooperative and competitive strategies in a decision game that encourages adaptation to the hidden and fluctuating intentions of others. We identified the computational mechanisms involved and the period when specific aspects of AToM for social reasoning develop during childhood. These involve a conceptual change in the decision-learning process between the younger groups and the oldest group of children, suggesting that conceptual developments fuel some aspects of AToM development in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . Previous studies have addressed diverse consequences of AToM, e.g., children's everyday social experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , their self-understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , as well as their epistemological beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> or their academic abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> . These abilities are fundamental for children's psychological well-being and their success in life. Therefore, understanding the computational mechanisms underlying components of AToM during childhood has practical relevance to optimize educational and social environments, especially for e-learning applications that model children as computational agents.</p><p>We believe that our findings may help build a common computational framework which ties together specific psychological concepts of ToM and computational processes for cognitive science and artificial intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> . Such computational framework should not only make specific, falsifiable predictions about the dynamic interplay between representations of self and other across age groups, but also account for group mentalizing i.e., how we reason about collective beliefs in large groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>192 participants (aged 3.4 -9 years old, M = 6.5, SD = 1.5, 100 females) were recruited from one primary school and one kindergarten in China. 114 participants (aged 6-9, M = 7.5, SD = 1.1, 60 females; 58 aged 6-7, M = 6.5, SD = 0.3, 30 females; 56 aged 8-9, M = 8.5, SD = 0.3, 28 females) were recruited from one primary school in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China. These participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were naive with regard to the purpose of the experiment. They and their parents gave written informed consent prior to participation. 78 participants (aged 3.4-6, M = 5.0, SD = 0.8, 40 females) were recruited from a kindergarten in Guangzhou city, Guangdong province, China. These participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were naive with regard to the purpose of the experiment. Their parents gave written informed consent prior to participation. The study was approved by a local Ethical Review Board (NJUPSY202111001). We categorized all above participants into three age groups: Kindergarten (KG) from 3 to 5 years old, Early Primary Schoolers (EPS), 6-7 years old, and Mid-Primary Schoolers (MPS), 8-9 years old.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed intentions task and Artificial Agent</head><p>Participants performed a task comprising 154 trials on computer tablets (MS Surface Pro). They were led to believe that they were interacting with another child sitting in front of them, and who was playing the same game with them. In fact, both were playing against an artificial agent (AA) managed by a computer program. This simulated social interaction and allowed us to investigate the dynamics and mechanisms arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms. The experimenter conveyed a hierarchy to the 2 children when they first presented them to each other because, in addition to their names, the experimenter also clearly stated the school grade of each of them. Males played with males, and females with females. The tablet screens showed each participant four cards, two face-down (the other player's cards) and two face-up (their own cards). Participants were informed that to win, they had to choose the card of the same color as that chosen by the other person.</p><p>Critically, experimenters were careful not to specify whether the other player was an opponent or a partner i.e., whether the other player had the same victory condition (to match cards) or whether they would win if the cards did not match. Participants were also told that both they and the other player had to make their choices in two seconds. If the Artificial Agent (AA) played before the participant, one of the two face-down cards was removed from the playing field. If the participant chose first, only the selected card remained on the playing field. Then, when both had chosen, the cards were revealed. The participant scored points if the card colors matched, otherwise they received nothing. Participants were led to believe that their final payoff would be increased if they scored more points. No information about the other's payoff was given to the participants, they only knew that after an interaction, the other 'participant' would see the same screen but with their own outcomes which could be different for each of them.</p><p>Importantly, unbeknownst to the participants, the AA alternated between Competitive and Cooperative trial blocks. During this mixed-intentions task, the AA's strategy was determined by alternating between a Cooperative block of 20 trials that aimed to coordinate between the computer and the player, followed by a Competitive block of 10 trials that aimed to choose the opposite card as the player. The AA algorithm was designed to predict the color that would be chosen by the participant on the basis of a probabilistic analysis of the two previous choices and outcomes. More specifically, the AA calculated the probability p for the participant to select a particular target color based on the history of the two previous choices and their outcomes. It then chose the target that it deemed the most probable to be chosen by the participant in the cooperative mode, and the target that was the least probable in the competitive mode (see Supplementary Materials for more details about the AA's algorithm). We defined a competitive choice, made by the AA, as choosing the card of the color the participant was expected not to play, and a cooperative choice as choosing the card with the same color that the participant was expected to play. Thus, the AA exploited the bias of the participants, such that the more predictable the participant was, the more the algorithm made correct competitive or cooperative choices. Participants were not informed of the switches between cooperative and competitive interaction by the AA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral analysis</head><p>Logistic regression. For the logistic regressions, we reported significant marginal effects of a given variable under the name "estimate" (for example: Cooperativity signaturet-1 : estimate).</p></div>

The marginal effect of the variable X1 is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 = ( −1 ( 1 ))</formula><p>The mean is computed across all observed data. Thus, the marginal effect called "estimate" can easily be interpreted as the discreet change of the dependent variable given a unitary change of an independent variable. For the linear regressions, reported "estimate" represents xi, i.e., the regression coefficient. Indeed, in a linear regression, the marginal effect of a variable is equal to the estimated coefficient.</p><p>Information theoretic metrics. To quantify the consistency of the adopted strategy in response to reward feedback, we utilized our previously developed metrics based on information theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> . These include entropy of choice strategy (H(Str)), mutual information between reward outcome and strategy (MIRS), and conditional entropy of reward-dependent strategy (ERDS). Intuitively, the entropy of choice strategy (H(Str)) captures the randomness or uncertainty of the adopted strategy, trial-by-trial. Thus, it signals the overall stochasticity in the choice behavior. MIRS and ERDS values further aim to constrain the extent to which the agent's choice strategy can be predicted by the reward outcome prior to that decision. Importantly, in our dyadic game settings, the reward feedback is directly predicated upon the other player's action and therefore could signal additional social value.</p><p>Specifically, the Shannon entropy of choice strategy, H(Str), is computed using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">( ) = −( ( ) ⋅ log 2 ( ) + ( ℎ) ⋅ log 2 ( ℎ)),</formula><p>where Str is the agent's adopted strategy, coded as stay (1), if the agent selects the same target as the previous trial, or switch (0) otherwise. Therefore H(Str) measures the level of uncertainty or surprise choice behavior in terms of stay or switch.</p><p>Mutual information between reward and strategy (MIRS) is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= ( ; ) = − ∑ ∑ ( ( , ) ⋅ log 2 ( ( , ) ( )⋅ ( ) )) ∈{ , } ∈{ , ℎ} ,</formula><p>where Rew is the reward outcome (1= win, 0 = lose) on the previous trial.</p><p>Finally, the entropy of reward-dependent strategy (ERDS), is the remaining uncertainty in the strategy after accounting for the information given by previous reward outcome:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">= ( | ) = ( ) − ( ; ) = − ∑ ∑ ( ( , ) ⋅ log 2 ( ( , ) ( ) )) ∈{ , } ∈{ , ℎ}</formula><p>. These metrics are model-free in the sense that they do not assume any underlying structure or model in the learning and decision-making processes. As such, these measures can be computed directly from any segment of the task, making them especially useful for quantifying behavioral adjustment over time in dynamic, changing environments. For the running average plot, we computed the metrics for each individual using a moving window of 7 trials, such that the data point for trial t was computed from trials between t−6 and t. The values were then averaged for each age group. For calculating the bar plots in the inset, we calculated the metrics for each phase in each subject by compiling the last 10 trials of each Cooperation block and the last 5 trials of each Competition block (i.e., last half of each block) to reduce the contaminating effect of the preceding phase. These values were then averaged across subjects by age groups.</p></div>

The MIIL model involved theory of mind and has been found to best account for detecting mixed-intentions in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .This MIIL model is constructed based on a controller that arbitrates between cooperative and competitive experts of the RL influence models, according to their reliability, before making the decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .

The other four models did not include the ability to adapt to changing intentions of others, and thus could not differentiate between cooperation and competition.

These parameters control the exploitation vs exploration ratio of the agent, and capture choice randomness. Q-learning models simply assume that subjects update the value of possible actions. In its simplest form, the Q-learning algorithm expresses the change in value Q(t+1)-Q(t) from trial t to trial t+1 as being linearly proportional to the prediction error. This yields the following learning rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">+1 =</formula><p>+ * ( +1 − ) Where rt is the reward delivered to the subject at trial t, and α is the (unknown) "learning rate" of the subject.</p><p>The Q-learning evolution function thus takes the agent's previous action and the feedback received for the previous action as data inputs. We complement with a softmax decision rule in the Q-learning observation function. As a reminder, this is an equation that expresses the probability Pt(ai) of the subject to choose action ai at trial t:</p><p>( ) = exp( * ( )) ∑ * ( ) Where β is the (unknown) temperature.</p><p>Fitting the above Q-learning model to behavioral data means finding estimates of the learning rate α, the inverse temperature β, and the initial values Q0 that best explains the observed choices.</p><p>Influence Learning model. This mentalizing model was described by Hampton et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , who also found neural correlates with this model in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . The influence model relies on a Taylor expended reinforcement learning. This model describes computations underlying the capacity to mentalize (in the context of a strategic game). Let = ( = 1) be the agent's prediction of the other's next move, i.e., the probability that the other will pick the first alternative option. The "influence learning" rule can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">+1 = + * ( − ) − * 1 * * (1 − ) * ( − * − 2 1 ) (1)</formula><p>where o is the other's last move, a is the agent's last move, is the weight of the agent's prediction error, is the weight of the other's prediction error, k1 &amp; k2 are derived from the game's payoff table, is the tracked log-odds of , is the other's temperature, i.e. the tendency of the other to explore vs exploit information (the closer it is to 0, the more it explores by choosing randomly without using previous information, and the closer it is 1, the more it exploits previous information and chooses deterministically). Note that for all subjects, the tested models fitted better than chance.</p><p>Mixed-Intentions Influence Learning (MIIL) model. The 'mixed intentions' version of the influence model computes one decision value according to a competitive expert and another according to a cooperative expert and then arbitrates between the two, based on the difference in their respective reliability. We defined reliability as the difference in unsigned value functions for two choices given by particular learning algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control analyses and model checks</head><p>We ran several control analyses. We first conducted a Confusion Analysis (CA) as a model check to ensure that the compared models that we tested, given our data, were not confused between each other and that our model selection was indeed reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> . We therefore generated data multiple times with Monte-Carlo simulations (approx. 2800 in total) for each of our tested models with different sets of parameters, and conducted the same analysis as presented previously on the simulated data. This meant fitting the data with all of the tested models, then performing a BMS on the models to select the one that fitted best. If this analysis is reliable and the models are distinguishable, then the model that we simulated at the beginning should also be that selected by our analysis. The confusion matrix (Supp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1a)</ref> showed that the final selected model was the one which most of the time initially generated the data.</p><p>Next, we checked if the learning parameters of the MIIL model could be identified from observed data. To do so, we generated simulated data with multiple Monte-Carlo simulations (approx. 9800 in total) from the influence model using different sets of learning parameters sampled from a uniform distribution. The sampling was done (uniformly) between the most extreme empirical values found in our data analysis for each of our seven learning parameters. We then fitted the generated data with the influence model with the same method as previously. We then regressed the estimated parameters on the simulated parameters. We found for each learning parameter a positive correlation between estimated and simulated parameters (Supp <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">. Fig. 1b)</ref>. The regression indicates that the estimated parameters were actually underestimated compared to those used to generate simulated data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary analyses</head><p>We initially fitted and compared other models than those presented in the main results: 2 influence models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , one in a purely competitive setup and one in a purely cooperative setup (see Supp <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">. Fig. 2, top)</ref>. However, they did not pass the confusion analysis (see Supp <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">. Fig. 2,  down)</ref>, i.e., they were confused with the BSL0 model when simulated, then tested through our analysis. This implies that, for our main results, the overrepresentation of the BSL0 model in the younger groups might actually hide the presence of cooperative and competitive Influence models among them. However, this does not change the main result that a transition in model representation occurs around age 8 in MPS when the MIIL model becomes preponderant. Still, the results of the comparison between all tested models is given here for readers' information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Artificial Agent</head><p>The AA calculated the probability p for the participant to select a particular card color based on the history of the two previous choices and their outcomes. It then chose the card that it deemed the most probable to be chosen by the participant in the cooperative mode, and the card that was the least probable in the competitive mode. The artificial agent (AA) selected its card according to the probability for the player to choose a specific card after a given sequence of events. By sequence of events, we mean a specific set of two consecutive choices and outcomes. If we consider two choices, A and B, and two possible outcomes, win (W) and lose (L), an example for a sequence of events could be: player chose A and won at trial n-2, then chose A and lost at n-1. We will sum up this sequence as: AWAL.</p><p>To determine its choice at trial n, the AA will check in its memory table what choice the participant usually followed with after such sequence of events, based on the previous history of actions of the player. For example, let's assume that the sequence of events AWAL just occurred. The AA must now decide its move at trial n. Let's also assume that this sequence of events already happened four times in the past, and that the player chose to play card A 75% of the time and card B 25% of the time. Then, the algorithm in the cooperative mode will decide to play card A with a 75% probability for its next move, and card B with a 25% probability. Viceversa in the competitive mode, i.e. card A with 25% of probability and card B with 75% of probability. If we assume that the AA as well as the player choose card A for trial n, then the updated history of choices for the specific sequence of events AWAL would become: card A chosen at 80%, and card B at 20%. Also, the current sequence of events will become ALAW.</p><p>Let's assume that the current memory table is the one shown in Supp. Tab. 1. If we take the same example as described in the previous paragraph, the current history of events is "…AWAL…". After the AA and participant choose A, the history of events becomes "…AWALAW" and the memory table becomes Supp. Tab. 2. Now let's assume that the sequence history is "…AWALAWBLBLAWBW…". The sequence of the subject's choices in this example would be "…AAABBAB…". Consequently, in this example, the AA's choices would be "…ABAAAAB…". Following the same reasoning as presented in the previous paragraph, we can update the memory table. It will become at the end of this sequence of event the memory table shown in Supp. Tab. 3.</p><p>For the AA, in the cooperative mode, the sequence of choices and probabilities would be "…A(/)B(/)A(75%)A(100%)A(100%)A(100%)B(50%)…", where the percentage of probability of the choice of the algorithm is given in parentheses and where "/" are undefined probabilities in this example because they depend on previous events before this sequence occurred and that we did not define. For this study in children, we used a greedy version of this algorithm. It means that probabilities strictly greater than 50% were rounded at 100% while any probability strictly lower than 50% was rounded at 0%. This choice of implementation was made to adapt and simplify the difficulty of the task to children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GLMs &amp; GLMEs.</head><p>We first modeled our GLMs based on the following formulas: </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">~ 1 + −1 + −2 + −3 + −1 +<label>−</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">_ −2 ) + ( : _ )</formula><p>After applying a dropterm() process based on the AICs of the models successively, the final models were:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">~ 1 + −1 + −2 + −3 + −1 + −3 + _ −1 + _ −2 + _ −3 + _ −1 + _ −2 + + + ( : _ −1 ) ~ 1 + −1 + −3 + −1 + −2 + −3 + _ −1 + _ −2 + _ −3 + _ −1 + _ −2 + + + _ + ( _ : ) + ( : _ −2 ) + +</formula><p>To control for random effects and the interaction and autocorrelation between effects of each variable over time, we used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects (GLME) models implemented with the glmer() function of lme4 package in R with a binomial family. We ensured that we had good estimates of random effects and accounted for variability in behavior using Bound Optimization by Quadratic Approximation. GLME1 assessed the children's tendency to select the same target as that in the previous trial ("stay") and GLME2 assessed their performance in successfully finding the same card as the AA ("reward"). We proceeded to further simplifications through another dropterm() process which led to the following formula: We then proceeded to an addterm() process with the regressors that were previously removed from the GLMs. This led to the following formula: The final results and outputs of the GLMs and GLMEs are summed up in Supp. Tab. 4.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">~ 1</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">~ 1</formula><p>Supp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1.
