			<abstract>
				<p>Across two experiments, we examined the effect of physical fatigue on moral decision-making. A total sample of N = 303 participants was subjected to acute physical exercise. Half of the participants were presented with moral dilemmas before the physical exercise, and the other half after the exercise. We measured moral judgement using a shortened version of the Process Dissociation procedure, allowing us to investigate: (1) decisions in the traditional sacrificial dilemmas and (2) deontological and utilitarian moral inclinations. The results showed that physical fatigue had no significant effect on moral judgements in nine out of ten statistical tests. This suggests a unique resilience of moral judgments to physical fatigue, in contrast to what is known about cognitive fatigue. All data and materials, data are available at https://osf.io/musc8/?view_only=328aee8087dd4203a9a576e350b12327.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moral judgments are (most probably) robust to physical fatigue: evidence from Process</head><p>Dissociation analyses in athletes and firefighters.</p><p>Moral decisions often require balancing harm to individuals against broader societal benefits. Educational institutions may fail students to maintain academic standards; justice systems incarcerate individuals to protect society. These decisions reflect two philosophical traditions: deontology, which emphasizes inviolable moral rules, and utilitarianism, which focuses on maximizing overall benefits. People's moral decisions can be classified along those philosophies so that their actions can be seen as deontological or utilitarian. However, moral decision-making is context-dependent; a person acting consistently with utilitarianism does not have to consciously endorse utilitarian philosophy or does not necessarily make similar judgments in analogous differences in the future (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gawronski et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schein, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Rather, to understand and predict moral decision-making, research identifies nonphilosophical factors affecting it.</p><p>One such factor is fatigue. One famous study showed that tired and hungry judges in Israeli parole boards tend to provide fewer favourable decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Danziger et al., 2011)</ref>. It has been later heavily criticised for methodological reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Glöckner, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Weinshall-Margel &amp; Shapard, 2011)</ref>, but this is not the point here. Rather, the mainmuch broader -point is the appealing idea that our (moral) decision-making is easily malleable, context-dependent, and out of our full control. Many such claims are based on weak and often non-replicable evidence from priming studies, where subtle cues are reported to have large effects on human judgment and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mac Giolla et al., 2024)</ref>. For example, a now-retracted study reported that participants standing on a higher stage vs. ground poured less hot sauce on meals prepared for other participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sanna et al., 2011)</ref>. This change in the dosing of hot sauce was interpreted as evidence that the vertical position of an agent cues elevated moral judgments . However, lay observation suggests otherwisepeople tend to reveal similar preferences not only throughout the day but often across their entire lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Urminsky, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>So, what is the experimental evidence for fatigue effects on moral judgments? And, more</p><p>broadly, to what extent is moral decision-making malleable by accidental contextual factors?</p><p>Conflicting evidence emerges from studies focused on the relationship between fatigue and moral judgments. Experimentally induced fatigue led to a greater aversion toward utilitarian choices in a subset of moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Timmons &amp; Byrne, 2019)</ref>, while long-term, environmentally-induced fatigue led to a greater preference toward utilitarian choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zheng et al., 2023</ref>). Yet, in another study, <ref type="bibr">Weippert and colleagues (2018)</ref> had their participants perform an acute physical exercise, and subsequently, in a state of fatigue, made moral decisions. They found fewer utilitarian choices in tired participants.</p><p>Participants writing a paragraph without using letters a or n changed their moral behaviour: they became more inclined to engage in unethical behaviour of low societal consensus, but less inclined to engage in unethical behaviour of high societal consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Yam et al., 2014)</ref>. So, fatigue can increase or decrease dishonesty. In a longitudinal study of Marine Corps martial arts training the authors found the soldiers had significantly impaired decision-making immediately after the extremely demanding (thus, tiring) training <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Siedlik et al., 2022)</ref>. Furthermore, they found the marines' moral intention and moral judgement to worsen throughout the training programme, pointing out that it may lead to impaired ethical decision-making in real-life combat.</p><p>Why would one even expect fatigue to affect moral judgments? At least two mechanisms were proposed: limited cognitive resources and increased testosterone levels.</p><p>Fatigue compromises cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abd-Elfattah et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Almonroeder et al., 2020)</ref>. Tired people have fewer cognitive resources they can invest in decision-making, leading to shallower processing of available information, which in turn leads to sub-optimal choices, functioning, and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cao et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Harris &amp; Bray, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kunrath et al., 2020)</ref>. Being cognitively fatigued is linked with deteriorated physical exercise-related decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fortes et al., 2023)</ref>, or greater difficulties in making decisions generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Killgore et al., 2007)</ref>. For instance, fatigued individuals avoid risky decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jia et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lu-Lu &amp; Yong-Juan, 2012)</ref>, and their economic decision-making may become less consistent, and thus less accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mullette-Gillman et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Another reason to expect that fatigue may affect moral judgments, is that acute physical exercise elevates testosterone levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Crewther et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kowal et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kowal et al., , 2021</ref>, which in turn can be related to more utilitarian decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Armbruster et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Carney &amp; Mason, 2010)</ref>. However, also this evidence is mixedother studies report testosterone administration increased sensitivity to moral norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brannon et al., 2019)</ref>, or no effects at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Arnocky et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Reynolds et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>On top of mixed evidence across studies reporting the effects of fatigue, many of them have small sample sizes. For example, the two experiments directly studying physical fatigue had samples of N = 55 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Siedlik et al., 2022)</ref>, and N = 32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Weippert et al., 2018)</ref>. Critically, the accuracy of the operationalisation of moral decision-making is questionable <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kahane, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>That is, moral dilemmas used in prior research pit deontological against utilitarian solutions, artificially making them negatively correlated. For example, a famous trolley dilemma used in this line of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Foot, 1967)</ref> asks people whether it is permissible to redirect a trolley from tracks with five people to side tracks, where there is a single person. Deontology suggests harming people is never permissible, thus this action is immoral. Utilitarianism suggests five lives are more valuable than one, thus, the action is moral. A person who decided for one solution is classified as opposing the other one. Although depicted as contradictory, both of those motives are independent and often consistent and often both cue the same behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>. For example, moral identity positively correlates to deontology and utilitarianism <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>. Both inclinations negatively predict investment in sin stocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Niszczota et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Niszczota et al., , 2024</ref> and positively predict willingness to self-sacrifice for the benefit of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Muda et al., 2024)</ref>. So, if fatigue decreases or increases both inclinations we would miss this in traditional moral dilemmas since these changes would cancel each other out.</p><p>To solve this issue, we adopted a Process Dissociation procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>, which allows us to estimate both moral inclinations independently, along with the traditional score of utilitarian choices made in incongruent scenarios, i.e., where deontological and utilitarian motives are antithetic. The battery designed to test the two inclinations consists of two types of sacrificial scenarios: congruent (where deontological and utilitarian inclinations cue the same decision of rejecting the action), and incongruent (where utilitarian inclinations cues endorsement of an action but deontological inclination rejects the action). For example, one is asked whether it is permissible to torture a person suspected of planning a terrorist attack that may kill hundreds of people (incongruent), or a person suspected of planning a prank with bombs filled with paint (congruent). The idea is that deontological considerations always prevent torture, whereas utilitarian considerations permit torture only in the former case because only there the benefits justify the means. Details of the computational procedure can be found in the Supplementary Materials, but in short, we first calculate the average endorsement rates in congruent (Actcon) and incongruent dilemmas(Actincon). The U-parameter, conceptualised as capturing the inclination to make decisions consistent with utilitarian (i.e., outcome-maximizing) principles is estimated with a simple formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U = (1-Actincon) -(1 -Actcon).</formula><p>So, a person who endorses all actions where the sacrifice is beneficial (Actcon = 1), but endorses no actions where the sacrifice is not beneficial (Actincon = 0), has the U-parameter equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U = (1-0) -(1-1) = 1-0 = 1.</formula><p>The D-parameter, conceptualised as capturing the inclination to make decisions consistent with deontological principles is calculated by the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D = (1-Actincon) / (1-U).</formula><p>Note, that this formula does not allow calculating the D-parameter for a fullyutilitarian person, because for them the denominator is equal to zero. Both D and Uparameters are standardised. In most studies, the D and U-parameters are either not correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Białek et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Byrd &amp; Conway, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>, or weakly positively correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Muda et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Niszczota et al., 2024)</ref>, challenging the claim of their contradictory nature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency and Openness</head><p>We report how we determined our sample sizes, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study, and we follow JARS from quantitative research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Appelbaum et al., 2018</ref> We report two experiments, testing the effects of acute physical fatigue on moral judgments.</p><p>Experiment 1 reports a sample of N = 107 physical academy students, and Experiment 2 N = 196 firefighters during their annual physical exam. Both times, participants were randomly assigned to fill the PD battery before or after an acute physical exercise procedure. In both experiments, we jointly conducted 10 statistical tests (for both PD parameters and traditional utilitarian scores). We observed a significant change in only one of the tests, specifically</p><p>Experiment 2 showed a decrease in the D-parameter. Bayesian analysis either favours the null hypothesis compared to the alternative hypothesis or suggests inconsistent findings due e.g. limited statistical power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>To test the hypothesis that physical fatigue is a predictor of certain shifts in moral decisionmaking, we implement the procedure from the previous studies that elicited testosterone through acute physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kowal et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kowal et al., , 2021</ref>, and provide the participants with a Process Dissociation measure of deontological and utilitarian choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>. By recruiting a homogenous group of participants, our analyses narrow down possible effects of uncontrolled variables and provide decently powered results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited and analysed the data from 107 volunteering male students 1 ( Mage=21.00, SD = 1.56) of a physical education academy. We remunerated them for their participation with a voucher worth the equivalent of ~10 USD in the local currency. A medical authority examined all participants and considered them physically healthy. The participants were obliged not to smoke or drink energetic or alcoholic beverages for 24 hours before entering the study. Feeling ill on the day of the study, having chronic diseases, and taking hormonal treatment or supplements were exclusion criteria. We did not determine the exact target sample size a priori but rather aimed for as much data (but aimed to recruit at least 100 participants) as possible within the lab availability time window. A sensitivity analysis indicated our sample (N = 107) provided 80% power to detect effects of d ≥ 0.55 at α = .05</p><p>(two-tailed). While this allows detection of only moderate-to-large effects, our sample was nearly triple that of previous studies in this area (e.g., N = 32 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Weippert et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, to account for limited statistical power, we additionally report Bayesian analysis, which weights the observed effect size and its estimation accuracy when comparing the support for the hypothesis against the null <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dienes &amp; Mclatchie, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Moral judgments. To measure utilitarianism/deontology, we used the Process Dissociation procedure with 16 of the 20 original scenarios from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Conway &amp; Gawronski (2013)</ref>. Following our preregistration, we omitted the four scenarios relating to abortion and animal testing, as in our prior studies, they showed unexpected patterns of responses. For example, Poles tended to not allow for abortion but to allow for animal testing in both congruent and incongruent scenarios (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Muda et al., 2018)</ref>. We also wanted to shorten the experiment to increase its feasibility. This change to the procedure can somewhat limit the power to reliably establish the parameters, yet some other experimental work on the topic also used shortened versions of the PD-battery, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gawronski et al., (2017)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lee &amp; Gino, (2015)</ref>.</p><p>Fatigue. As a manipulation check, we measured participants' heart rate prior to, during, and after the acute physical exercise with a Polar RS400 cardio frequency meter strapped to the participants' chests.</p><p>Additional measures. We also measured two other variables unrelated to this research: risktaking (using a self-created set of lotteries) and disgust sensitivity (using a self-created Sounds of Disgust Scale, Disgust Scale- <ref type="bibr">Revised, Olatunji et al., 2007, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Three Domains of Disgust Scale, Tybur et al., 2009)</ref>. The order of the implemented tools was as follows: risk-taking assessment, Sounds of Disgust Scale, and then, depending on the group, either 16 Process Disassociation scenarios and the two remaining disgust sensitivity scales, or the other way round).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study took place in a laboratory, with all participants being tested between 8 and 11 a.m.</p><p>Each participant was randomly selected into one of two groupsthey either provided their answers to the moral dilemmas before the physical exercise or a few minutes after finishing exercising. The order of presentation of the dilemmas was randomized. We opted for a between-subject design because we wanted to avoid problems with memorizing the answers provided prior to the manipulation (e.g., participants may be inclined to consistify their responses). Moreover, because the scale involves multiple dilemmas, we thought answering them again could be tedious for participants.</p><p>In this study, we followed the exact procedure that previous studies of similar design <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Crewther et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kowal et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kowal et al., , 2021</ref>. We used a Monark cycle ergometer (824E, Sweden) for a sprint cycling exercise. The exact steps of the procedure were as follows: i) 5minute warm-up with a load of 2 kilograms, ii) one minute of resting, iii) 10-second sprint with a load of 7.5% of one's body mass, iv) 50 seconds of slow cycling without a load. Points iii) and iv) were then repeated four more times. Ultimately, after five cycles of 10-second sprints and 50-second slow cycling, the participants again cycled slowly for one minute without a load. This procedure is extremely exhausting, and the study was conducted in the presence of a qualified paramedic. Participants used tablets to respond to the Qualtrics questionnaires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>First, we confirmed prior findings that the D and U-parameters are independent or only weakly correlated. Specifically, here r(105) = 0.20, p = .044. We also tested whether the cycling was in fact demanding and tiring by comparing heart rate prior and after the exercise.</p><p>We observed a large increase in the experimental group Mpre = 81.30 SD = 12.90; Mpost = 127.0, SD = 13.60, t(51) = -20.50, p &lt; .001, d = -2.84 <ref type="bibr">[-3.45, -2.22]</ref>, showing that our manipulation did influence the physiological state of the participants. We then proceeded with testing the main hypothesis that physical fatigue will affect moral judgments.</p><p>As preregistered, we compared the deontological and utilitarian parameters between the pretreatment and post-treatment groups, using two two-tailed between-subject t-tests 2 . These parameters were calculated using a Process Dissociation procedure and standardised <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013)</ref>. For exploratory reasons, we also analysed the traditional score, i.e., utilitarian decisions made in incongruent sacrificial scenarios.</p><p>In all cases, we observed no significant differences <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1</ref>). Because non-significant results of a statistical test are never an evidence of the absence of an effect (e.g., we could have lacked statistical power, or the true effect is smaller than assumed), we decided to follow up this analysis with a Bayesian t-test. This approach allows us to compare relative evidence for the null against the alternative hypothesis. Using the default prior of Cauchy = 0.707 3 , we found moderate support for the null. In other words, it is about 5 times more likely to observe the current data if the null hypothesis is true, compared to when the alternative hypothesis is true. Note, however, that some statisticians claim the default prior is conservative and biased against small, true effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tendeiro &amp; Kiers, 2019)</ref>. Thus, some caution is advised when interpreting the Bayesian analysis. Note: Bayesian interpretation based on criteria developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lee and Wagenmakers (2014)</ref>.</p><p>Study 1 showed moral judgments to be robust to physical fatiguewe did not find any differences in the D-parameter, U-parameter, and traditional scoring. However, given the relatively modest sample size, we conducted a follow-up study for a more robust conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited and analysed the data from 221 professionally active firefighters of the State Fire Service in Poland. They were not remunerated for their participation. They were all considered physically healthy by a medical authority, and they did not suffer from any chronic disease. The participants were obliged not to drink alcoholic beverages for 24 hours before entering the study. Feeling ill on the day of the study, failing a physical activity test (described in detail below) or having any missing values in the survey were the exclusion criteria. Although we preregistered to collect at least 200 records applicable for the analysis,</p><p>after the exclusions, we ended up with 196 individuals ( Mage=23.50, SD = 4.55). Our sample size had 80% power to detect the effects of fatigue of d = 0.40. To account for limited statistical power, and to repeat the exact analyses we performed in Study 1, we additionally report Bayesian analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Moral judgments. Moral judgments were measured in the same way as in Experiment 1.</p><p>Fatigue. Due to the differences between the two experiments, in evoking the physical fatigue procedure (see below), in Experiment 2 it was not feasible to repeat the heart rate using the Polar RS400 cardio frequency meter. Thus, as a manipulation check, we measured participants' heart rates after the acute physical exercise with a finger Jumper JPD-500F pulse oximeter.</p><p>Additional measures. We also implemented the traditional trolley dilemmas in their indirect (pulling a lever) and direct versions (a push on a footbridge). Following Bostyn <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bostyn &amp; Roets, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Xu et al., 2024)</ref>, we aimed to approximate deontological inclination with a question about the permissibility of inaction, and utilitarian inclination with a question about the permissibility of action.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Half of the participants completed the 16-item Process Dissociation inventory, and then proceeded to the fitness test described below (pre-test group), while the other half first performed the fitness test and then completed the questionnaire (post-test group).</p><p>As part of the multi-stage fitness test, also known as the BEEP test, participants repeatedly cover a 20-meter-long and 1.5-meter-wide distance. Their task is to reach the end of the track before hearing a sound signal. Upon reaching the end, participants turn around and, after hearing the subsequent sound signal, run back along the same distance.</p><p>In the first iteration, participants must cover this distance seven times, each time in less than 9 seconds. Then, they must complete the distance eight times in 8 seconds, followed by eight times in 7.5 seconds, nine times in 7.2 seconds, nine times in 6.8 seconds, ten times in 6.5 seconds, ten times in 6.2 seconds, eleven times in 6 seconds, eleven times in 5.7 seconds, eleven times in 5.5 seconds, twelve times in 5.4 seconds, and finally five times in 5.1 seconds.</p><p>This consisted of at most about 12 minutes of running. If a participant fails to complete the distance within the required time twice in a row, the test is terminated. Importantly, passing this test was mandatory for participants to receive a positive evaluation in their professional assessment. In the State Fire Service in Poland, the minimum passing grade for men is achieved by running the distance five times in 6.2 seconds without committing two consecutive errors at any of the previous stages.</p><p>Participants took part in the test in groups of up to 20 people. As soon as a given participant completed the BEEP test, they approached the experimenter, where their pulse was measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The physical exam produced a large increase in oximeter measures in the experimental group, We then tested the main hypothesis that physical fatigue will affect moral judgments.</p><p>As preregistered and consistent with Experiment 1, we compared the traditional score in sacrificial moral dilemmas and the D and U-parameters between the pre-treatment and posttreatment groups, using two two-tailed between-subject t-tests <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . In all but one cases, we observed no significant differences, with D-parameter showing a slight decrease (t(194)=2.32, p=. <ref type="bibr">022, d=0.33 [0.05, 0.61]</ref>. As for the Bayesian analyses, they showed results ranging from inconclusive support for the effect (B10=1.87) to the conclusive support for the null (B01=5.35 <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>. Exploratory tests on the effects of fatigue on the permissibility of action and inaction also showed no significant effects (ps &gt; .222, BF01 &gt; 3.18).</p><p>Jointly, the results suggest no consistent or strong differences in moral judgments between fatigued and non-fatigued groups. Compared to Experiment 1, we doubled the sample size and supplemented the original procedure with a complimentary one. After these changes, we found null effects in six out of seven statistical tests. Consistently, Bayesian analysis classifies our results as either supporting the null or inconclusive. So, we interpret our results as consistent with Experiment 1, i.e. suggesting no causal effects of physical fatigue on moral judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Our study found that acute physical fatigue does not affect moral judgments. is psychologically framed as a non-decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson, 2003)</ref>, allowing individuals to avoid the psychological burden of active choice.</p><p>A more sophisticated methodological approach that addresses this limitation is CNI modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref> and its derivatives such as pro-CNI <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hennig &amp; Hütter, 2021)</ref> or CAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Liu &amp; Liao, 2021)</ref>. These frameworks, though not without their own limitations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Baron &amp; Goodwin, 2020)</ref>, can quantify preference for inaction independently and potentially reveal effects of fatigue that our method could not detect. Furthermore, while our findings suggest that acute, short-duration physical fatigue does not significantly alter moral judgments, these results may not generalize to more prolonged physical exhaustion-such as that experienced by athletes after completing a marathon or firefighters at the end of a 16-hour shift battling intense fires. Future research should investigate these more enduring forms of physical fatigue, which may have different cognitive and physiological profiles. Additionally, a withinsubject experimental design would provide more direct evidence for the causal relationship between acute exercise and moral judgments by controlling for individual differences in baseline moral inclinations.</p><p>To sum up, we showed that participants who were acutely physically fatigued responded to hypothetical moral scenarios similarly to those who were rested, and display the same prominence of deontological and utilitarian inclinations. From a practical point of view, this is a good thing, because many people who make moral decisions (paramedics, doctors, firefighters, soldiers, police officers, etc.) are often tired. Their moral judgments should be immune to this state. From a theoretical point of view, we show that cognitive processes underlying moral judgments are not vulnerable to physical fatigue. This fits a version of the dual-process theory, in which both moral inclinations are produced intuitively <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bago &amp; De Neys, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Białek &amp; De Neys, 2016</ref>, and reflection is employed only to solve potential internal conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Byrd &amp; Conway, 2019)</ref>. Finally, our results show that human cognition, at least in its moral aspect, is not as malleable as the psychological literature shows.</p><p>In other words moral judgments seem robust to the state of fatigue. In principle, we believe that the psychological literature may have been biased to show successful incidental manipulations on a wide range of behaviours, and in reality, the effects are smaller or do not exist at all <ref type="bibr">(Simmons et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Simonsohn, 2015)</ref>. This is, however, only a speculation which warrants larger empirical research and replication projects <ref type="bibr">(Zwaan et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>You find a time machine and travel back to the year 1920.

This is consistent with prior literature that reported mixed effects of experimental manipulations inducing physical or cognitive fatigue.Of course, our findings are not definitive. Every experiment has a probabilistic chance of detecting a true effect, contingent on both the effect size and sample size. Our samples, while larger than previous studies in this domain, still had limitations. Both experiments comprised primarily fit, athletic males, which may have diminished the impact of acute physical exertion compared to individuals unaccustomed to regular exercise. Additionally, participants completed other measures (e.g., disgust sensitivity assessments) before responding to moral dilemmas. Although the presentation order was standardized within each experiment, it</figDesc><table><row><cell>differed between studies, potentially introducing confounding variables. Furthermore, while</cell></row><row><cell>our Process Dissociation approach represents a significant methodological advancement over</cell></row><row><cell>traditional moral dilemma paradigms by separating deontological from utilitarian inclinations,</cell></row><row><cell>In most of the we did not account for action aversion-a third critical factor.

In other</cell></row><row><cell>words, Bayesian analyses in the two studies never supports the alternative model. This holds</cell></row><row><cell>for traditional measures (such as trolley problem scenarios), for distinct deontological (D) and</cell></row><row><cell>utilitarian (U) parameters, and for exploratory measures of moral inclinations. The estimates</cell></row><row><cell>of D and U-parameters broaden our conclusion, overcoming the limitations of traditional</cell></row><row><cell>scoring which cannot separately assess deontological and utilitarian responses (Conway &amp;</cell></row><row><cell>Gawronski, 2013). For example, a scenario causing a slight decrease in deontological</cell></row><row><cell>inclination and a greater decrease in utilitarian inclination would, under traditional scoring,</cell></row><row><cell>erroneously appear as an increase in deontological choices due to the scoring's emphasis on</cell></row><row><cell>the relative strength of the two inclinations.</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">As suggested by the reviewer, repeated-measures ANOVA may be more suitable for that type of analysis. However, also this approach yielded non -significant main effect of fatigue F(1,104) &lt; 1, p = .790, and of fatigue by moral inclination type interaction, F(1,104) &lt; 1, p = .950.3  These priors correspond to a probability of 50% that the effect size (in Cohen's d) under the null hypothesis being true lies between -0.707 to +0.707. This is a conservative test, often supporting null hypothesis when the true studied effect is small<ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Simonsohn, 2015)</ref>.</note>
