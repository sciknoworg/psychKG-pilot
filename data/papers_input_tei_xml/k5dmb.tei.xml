<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Peer review is a critical step in the assessment of research articles for publication. Although sometimes criticized for being flawed and biased (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huber et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sun et al., 2023)</ref>, it still represents the "gold standard" in research quality control. Recent studies emphasize that peer reviewer's experience and greater knowledge of the topic can be critical in distinguishing between poor and good research <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Zheng et al., 2023)</ref>. Deeper insight into the content of peer review reports is critical to improving both the process of peer review, as well as informing about areas to target to improve the reporting of research results <ref type="bibr">(Garcia-Costa et al., 2022a)</ref>. Indeed, such information would be beneficial to all stakeholders in the publishing process, including authors, reviewers, publishers, and organizations that fund and perform research. For example, it could indicate the most common topics on which reviewers need to be educated. Due to the ever-present difficulty in attracting enough researchers to perform peer reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fox, 2017)</ref>, ensuring high quality among reviewers available for this work, and training new ones to handle the burden, is critical to keep the system sustainable.</p><p>In our approach, we limit our assessment to only quantitative studies. Building on the findings of our previous study <ref type="bibr">(Garcia-Costa et al., 2022b)</ref>, we conducted a study that would assess the content of peer reviews about quantitative research methods and statistics. In this study, due to the nature of peer review feedback, we assumed that the occurrence of specific words in a peer review reflected issues related to those words being critiqued by reviewers. Our dictionary-based approach therefore focused on counting words in the text, as a proxy measure for concepts, as used in previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Reveilhac &amp; Moreselli, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jacobucci, Ammerman &amp; Wilcox, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Atteveldt, van der Velden &amp; Boukes, 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Reagan et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Meng, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Availability of peer reviews</head><p>To reach valid conclusions, scientific studies must be appropriately designed. An important task for reviewers is to assess whether the design of a study was suitable for its aim, and suggest possible improvements when they identify weaknesses in the method. The content of peer review reports in the past was difficult to assess because peer review reports are often confidential, and rarely available for assessment on a larger scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Squazzoni et al., 2020)</ref>. In recent years, there has been an increase in the availability of peer review reports in databases like the PEERE database <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Squazzoni et al., 2020)</ref> and peer review report characteristics like Elsevier's Peer Review Workbench <ref type="bibr">(Petchiappan et al., 2022)</ref>, which provide researchers with opportunities to explore the factors associated with peer review characteristics and patterns. Some journals (e.g., F1000 Research), decided to support transparent peer review by having post-publication review, while others have decided to opt for a consultation approach, where the peer reviewers get together and discuss the article in a panel <ref type="bibr">(Urban et al., 2022)</ref>. This increased availability of peer reviews allows for identifying characteristics of scientific gatekeeping and potential tools for improvement. At the same time, there is a growing need for the development of tools that will help to systematically analyze the vast amounts of very specific and very technical texts like peer review reports.</p><p>Large language models (LLMs) like Chat GPT show a promising direction with automatized processes, but their use is still far from perfect and with still uncleared ethical questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lauer, Constant &amp; Wernimont, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Assessment of peer review quality</head><p>Assessing the content of peer review reports and identifying the issues that reviewers frequently address can be done using a qualitative approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sizo et al., 2019)</ref>. That approach would allow the identification of potential reasons for the acceptance or rejection of an article and give information about what reviewers consider quality research. One of the surrogate approaches is to study comments on preprints. Recent studies of reviewer comments on preprints offer evidence that reviewers mostly comment on issues related to methodology, literature and theoretical sources, and language use <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dimity, 2022</ref>). However, a qualitative approach would be limited to a small number of articles, preventing generalization. The second approach, the adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence for such complex issues, is still in its infancy but is also a promising direction for future research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Checco et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chubb, Cowling &amp; Reed, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Horbach et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ghosal et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sun, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zheng et al., 2023)</ref>. Studying the characteristics of the reviewers without the assessment of the content of the reports would be another approach. However, it would probably result in a biased assessment because it is not focused on the core product (the report), with a potential outcome that reviewers with specific characteristics are biased in their reports (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shopovski et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Assessing methodology and statistics in peer review reports</head><p>Studying how complex concepts related to methodology and statistics are assessed during peer review on a larger scale is difficult without a large sample of peer review reports and a strong methodology to identify those concepts. There is no commonly accepted approach in the assessment of methodological and statistical issues in peer review reports, and there are several potential options. The study using text mining approaches to identify trends in the analysis of openly available published articles employed by different research studies showed that inferential statistical tests were the most prevalent, but were slowly losing ground to machine learning and neural network approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bolt et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Also, while some methodological aspects are extremely prevalent, others are rare and therefore present a problem in training more data-hungry machine learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kilicoglu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Thelwall et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bharti et al, 2022)</ref>. Finally, a mixed methods study on a smaller sample found that there were reporting issues related to different aspects of methodology in quantitative studies, with descriptive statistics parameters most commonly reported, and mention of existing outliers reported the least frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Weiss et al., 2023)</ref>. A potential alternative is the linguistic analysis of peer review reports, focusing on methodological and statistical terms. In a recent study, a conclusion was that reviews from social sciences are longer compared to the medical field, but the study was done on a relatively small sample and with a glossary not specific to the research context <ref type="bibr">(Perković-Palos et al., 2023)</ref>. Currently, there are glossaries for methodology and statistics developed specifically to assess peer review reports, but those are still in need of refinement and expansion <ref type="bibr">(Garcia-Costa et al, 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Garcia -Costa et al, 2022b</ref>).</p><p>To assess the prevalence of methodological and statistical issues addressed in peer review reports, our study consisted of two steps. In the first step, due to the lack of large glossaries related to statistics and methodology, we had to construct a new glossary with words categorized in logical dimensions, so that we could more precisely assess which methodological and statistical terms occur in peer reviews.</p><p>Research aim 1: To construct and validate a glossary of terms related to methodological and statistical aspects used in reviews by using a dictionary-based approach.</p><p>Next, we applied this glossary to the PEERE dataset to identify how often these terms are used to address methodological and statistical issues, and which were the most prominent issues. Besides the identification of issues, we decided to answer practical questions: which review characteristics (e.g., reviewer gender or scientific discipline) are related to addressing methodological and statistical issues, and which issues are predictive of the final review recommendation?</p><p>Research aim 2: Applying the glossary to assess the prevalence and predictors of methodological and statistical issues addressed in the peer review report from the PEERE database.</p><p>The insights obtained from this research could serve as advice to the editors, peer reviewers, and authors in the assessment of research quality and identify targets for training and journal policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Material and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Study design</head><p>This was a two-step study, in which we first created and validated the assessment tool (glossary), and secondly, applied it to the PEERE database to gain insights about common issues related to statistics and methodology raised in peer reviews. In this second step, we conducted a cross-sectional study by applying the newly constructed glossary to a large database of peer-review reports and the result was the number of terms related to various methodological and statistical categories, which was used as a proxy of issues addressed in reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Squazzoni et al., 2020)</ref>. The study was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework, and it is publicly available at: https://osf.io/tzb6n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Construction of the glossary</head><p>In the first part of the study, we constructed a glossary with terms related to statistical and methodological concepts in research. The terms included in the glossary were identified through several sources: The Glossary of Statistical Terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Stark, 2021)</ref>, The Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training Glossary <ref type="bibr">(Parsons et al., 2022)</ref>, and The Pocket Glossary for Commonly Used Research Terms <ref type="bibr">(Hosko &amp; Thyer, 2011)</ref>. We classified the terms into several sub-categories, based on reporting guidelines for methodology and different types of statistical analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Simera et al, 2010)</ref>. The categories falling under Methodology were: "Hypothesis", "Study design", "Sampling", "Procedures", "Biases", and "Reporting guidelines". The categories falling under Statistics were: "Distribution and probability", "Meta-analysis", "Variable characteristics and procedures", "Accuracy and precision", "Parametric descriptive parameters", "Non-parametric descriptive statistics", "Two group comparison statistics", "Multi-group comparison", "Diagnostics" (this section refers to the diagnosis of statistical models and tests), "Association", "Effects", "Data presentation", and "Transparency".</p><p>Three authors (IB, MB, and RK) reviewed the sources to identify all relevant terms for the glossary and classified them under the categories using their judgment. All three authors reviewed the classifications, discussed disputed terms in cases of disagreement, and came to a consensus. The categorization was presented to other members of the team which agreed with terms categorization. In the second part of the study, we expanded the glossary using a semi-automatic glossary-building approach, which ensures similar results to manually built dictionaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Deng, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mpouli, 2020)</ref>. This procedure followed five steps: 1) corpus creation, 2) pre-processing and cleaning 3) vector representation of the corpus, 4) term extraction, and 5) validation. In step 1, we collected and anonymized the text of review reports from our dataset. In step 2, we converted the text into lowercase, removed non-alphanumeric characters, trimmed white spaces and line breaks, tokenized web links and citations, and removed stop words. In step 3, we built an unsupervised Word2Vec model using the H2O API (H2O.ai, 2022) in R (R Core Team, 2021) to create a vector representation of our corpus. In step 4, we used the Word2Vec model to search for near terms in all review texts. We extracted new terms by running the method 'findSynonyms' from the H2O API and selected the most frequent similar ones (i.e., those with a normalized score higher than 0.75) and listed them among list candidates. We set the threshold at 0.75 experimentally, since it was a conservative value that allowed us to extract a moderate number of relevant new terms and that ensured quick convergence in a reduced number of iterations. More concretely, steps 4 (term extraction) and 5 (validation) were repeated three times. The amount of new terms extracted in each iteration was about 600 and manual validation kept about 88% of the proposed terms. In step 5, the same three authors (IB, MB, and RK) manually validated the list of new terms by considering usage in different contexts and deciding whether to drop or retain each new term. This allowed us to use the output list of terms from the previous iteration as the input for the next iteration. Steps 4 and 5 were repeated until all new terms had low-frequency values. The procedure followed to develop our glossary does use NLP techniques (e.g. Word2Vec) to allow for complete, quick, and generalizable dictionary building and it is similar to previously used techniques (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Han et al., 2022)</ref> While they focus on opinion words, we depart from a core of already accepted statistical terms to then enrich our glossary with the support of automatic up-to-date term extraction techniques and manual expert validation. The result of this procedure was a glossary containing 1,036 terms (available at https://osf.io/d34b9/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Database and variables</head><p>The PEERE dataset is the result of a collaboration between publishers and researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Squazzoni et al., 2020)</ref>. It contains over half a million peer review reports and related information from journals published by Elsevier. While we admit that there are other examples of available peer review reports, (e.g.</p><p>PLoS database or the OpenReview website), the PEERE database is the only one that includes reviews from both rejected and accepted papers, The dataset contains peer review report characteristics; reviewer recommendation, reviewer gender, continental region of the reviewer, journal discipline (health and medical sciences-HMS; life sciences-LS; physical sciences-PS; social sciences and economics-SSE) and JIF quartile. The database was filtered to include only review reports from research articles and complete records that contained all of the aforementioned variables, which resulted in a total sample of 496,928 peer-review reports. In the anonymized dataset, we provide (https://osf.io/d34b9/?view_only=), which does not contain texts of peer review, we also describe each statistical glossary word category as a binary variable (if the word from the category was found in the report). Also, we provide data for the two main categories, Methodology and Statistics, again as a binary variable (No/Yes). The methodology is labeled as "Yes" if there was at least one word found from the following categories: "Hypothesis", "Study design", "Sampling", "Procedures", "Biases", and "Reporting guidelines". Statistics is labelled as "Yes" if there is at least one-word present from any of the following categories: "Distribution", "Meta-analysis", "Variable", "Accuracy and precision", "Parametric", "Non-parametric", "Two group comparison", "Multi-group", "Diagnostics", "Association", "Effects", "Data presentation", and "Transparency".</p><p>Finally, the word count of peer review was standardized on a scale from 0 to 100. All of the reports were from the first round of reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Gender of the reviewers</head><p>The PEERE dataset does not contain a gender variable, so we implemented a procedure to estimate gender based on the name. Our procedure for gender guessing followed a two-step disambiguation algorithm validated in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bravo et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Buljan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Squazzoni, 2021)</ref> that has been demonstrated to be &gt;95% accurate when classifying the names of academics from multiple origins. First, we queried the Python package gender-guesser about the first names and countries of origin. For names classified by gender-guesser as 'mostly_male', 'mostly_female', 'andy' (androgynous), or 'unknown' (name not found), we queried GenderAPI (https://gender-api.com/). This procedure allowed us to guess the gender of 95.4% of academics in our sample, the remaining 4.6% of academics were assigned an unknown gender (this proportion refers to the original dataset, we give access to the dataset used in the study). Note that this level of gender guessing is consistent with the nonclassification rate for names of academics in previous research <ref type="bibr">(Santamaria &amp; Mihaljević, 2018)</ref>. This is a standard disambiguation algorithm that can also deal with the complexity of Asian names and that ensures a rate of misclassified names lower than 5%, by applying the optimal values found in benchmark 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Santamaría and Mihaljević, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Length of the reports and deviations from the protocol</head><p>In this study, we decided to include all available reviews of research articles from the PEERE database. The inclusion of all reviews deviates from the pre-registration, where we arbitrarily decided that reviews with less than 50 words were likely, not actual reviews. However, based on our later observations, we saw that the shorter reports also contain issues identified by peer reviews. The proportion of peer review reports with less than 50 words was substantial, and the elimination of those reports would present a significant dropout in the data. However, we also compared the results both with and without the &lt;50-word peer reviews and the results were largely similar. In the final sample, the median length of the reports was 196 words (interquartile range 108 to 330, min-max 16-720). In the analysis, due to the skewness of the distribution, we applied a min-max normalization using the following formula: (S-m)/(M-m)×100, where S is the number of words in the longest report, m is the number of words in the shortest review in the dataset, while M is each specific number of words per review <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Donders et al., 2006)</ref>. After this normalization, we standardized the length of the reports on a scale from 0 to 100.</p><p>The median standardized length was (interquartile range (IQR)=13-45), and we used this normalized variable in the regression models. In the pre-registration, one of the intended predictors was the type of peer review (open vs. blind peer review). However, during the analysis of the data, it was observed that that would lead to a great decrease in the number of reviews since we had information about the type of peer review for about half of peer review reports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Validation of the glossary</head><p>To validate that the glossary is assessing the intended concepts, we extracted anonymized sentences from the peer review reports with low or high aggregated scores. The sentences were extracted separately for the aggregated methodology and statistics variables (see Appendix) across different review characteristics. We extracted sentences across different disciplines, reviewer recommendations, reviewer gender, impact factor quartile, and continental region which would have extremely high methodology/statistics scores and those were qualitatively assessed by the authors for the validity of the glossary. We provided examples in the Appendix as evidence that the texts with high methodology/statistics scores contain text that discusses the mentioned issues, compared to (also provided) reviews where methodological/statistical terms were not contained. We believed that the differences between texts with higher and lower scores would be more recognizable than in cases where the scores are lower and the differences are more nuanced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Comparison of term frequency and prediction of term occurrence</head><p>We analyzed the data on reviewer characteristics (gender, continental region), article recommendation, and journal (journal area, JIF quartile: first, second, third quartile, and Non-Indexed (NI) journals) and presented them as frequencies and percentages. We assessed the prevalence of methodological and statistical issues addressed separately. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze which reviewer and journal characteristics predict the occurrence of methodology or statistical terms, and the results are presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI), while the journal was entered as the random factor. We opted for a binary approach instead of using the frequencies as continuous variables because the distribution of terms was highly skewed and we would not be able to satisfy testing assumptions. Therefore, a binary Aggregated Methodology variable was created (0no terms related to the methodology were mentioned in the peer review report, and 1at least one word related to methodology from the glossary was mentioned in the peer review), as well as a binary Aggregated Statistics variable (0no terms related to the statistics were mentioned in the peer review report, and 1at least one word related to statistics from the glossary was mentioned in the peer review).</p><p>Furthermore, to understand what predicts different reviewer recommendations, ordinal logistic regression was used to assess whether the developed categories predict the different reviewer recommendations (Reject = 1, Major revision = 2, Minor revision = 3, and Accept = 4). The analysis was done using the R statistical program (https://www.r-project.org/) and the JAMOVI package for statistical analysis (https://www.jamovi.org/).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Validation of the glossary</head><p>As the first aim of this study, we constructed and validated a glossary of terms related to methodological and statistical aspects used in reviews by using a dictionary-based approach. The final glossary contained 1036 terms and can be found on the project website on OSF (https://osf.io/d34b9/?view_only). 54 reviews with the high methodology or statistical aggregated scores were selected for validation. A sample of anonymized reviews can be found in the Supplement.</p><p>The reviews with high methodology scores were focused on issues related to research performance and planning, while reviews with high statistical scores focused on issues related to data analysis and graphical presentation.</p><p>This was in line with the results from the complete dataset, as the most prevalent methodology categories were "Study design" and "Hypothesis" <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>.

The journals were predominantly from the first JIF quartile <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref> and PS. Among reviewer recommendations, "accept" was by far the least frequent recommendation ( <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. The smallest discrepancy in the proportion of male and female reviewers was in SSE, while in other areas the proportion of male reviewers exceeded 75% <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. PS had, compared to other research disciplines, the greatest proportion of reviewers coming from Asian countries, and the lowest proportion coming from North America <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. PS also had the lowest proportion of acceptance recommendations compared to the other scientific disciplines, while the lowest proportion of rejected recommendations was from SSE <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Finally, in PS, the vast majority of the journals were from the first JIF quartile, and none were from the third JIF quartile <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. For other disciplines, there was more dispersion across JIF quartiles, although in all research disciplines, most peer review reports were for journals in the first JIF quartile and the least for the journals in the third quartile <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>[Insert <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Methodological terms</head><p>Terms related to the methodological aspects of reported studies were found in 138,404 (26.8%) peer review reports. A review was more likely to use words related to methodological aspects when the reviewer lived in North America or Oceania, and when the recommendation was to reject the article or recommend major revisions. The reports with methodological words were more frequent in HMS and SSE compared to the LS or PS, but JIF quartile was not predictive for the occurrence of methodological words <ref type="table">(Table 2</ref>). An additional descriptive analysis showed that journals from the social sciences had the highest proportion of review reports with words from the subcategories "Procedures" and "Study design" compared to other fields (Appendix, <ref type="figure">Figure A)</ref>.</p><p>[Insert <ref type="table">Table 2 here]</ref> 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.4. Statistical terms</head><p>Terms related to statistics were found in 351,349 (70.7%) of the reviews. The occurrence of statistics-related terms was more likely when the reviewer was female, for reviews recommending major revisions, when the journal was from HMS, and when the review text was longer <ref type="table">(Table 3</ref>). There were also geographical differences, with the lowest occurrence associated with reviewers living in Africa or Asia, compared to other global regions <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. Although general scores indicated that statistical terms were most prevalent in HMS and PS, the analysis of subcategories showed that the distribution of subcategories varied across research disciplines (Appendix, <ref type="figure">Figure B)</ref>. When observing the proportions of the words from different statistical subcategories, HMS did not dominate in any of the compared subcategories. Words from the subcategories "Association", "Meta-analysis", "Parametric descriptive statistics", and "Variable characteristics" were most prevalent in reviews from SSE. "Two-group comparison" and "Multi-group comparison" were most prevalent in reviews from LS, whereas "Data presentation" was most prevalent in reviews from PS (Appendix, <ref type="figure">Figure B</ref>).</p><p>[Insert <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>), but the proportion of explained variance was low (McFadden R =0.015). Review reports that contained words related to study design, hypothesis, sampling, two-group comparison, and transparency were related to less favorable review recommendations. Meanwhile, reviews that contained words related to reporting guidelines, nonparametric statistics, effect sizes, and data presentation were related with more favorable review recommendations <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>.</p><p>[Insert <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Our study showed that an analysis of peer review reports based on a glossary of statistical and methodological terms may be useful for studying the content of peer review reports and for understanding how authors can be helped to write manuscripts in a way to increase the clarity of their methodological and analytic approach. To develop a method that could assess methodological and statistical issues in peer reviews, in the first part of the study, we constructed a glossary of terms that can be used in content assessment when examining the prevalence of methodological and statistical issues in peer review reports.</p><p>We applied the glossary to a large dataset of peer review reports and found that a mention of methodological issues was related to more "reject" recommendations, and longer review reports, and was more common when the reviewer was from North America or Oceania and in journals from the SSE or HMS. On the other hand, a mention of statistical issues was more common if the reviewer was female,</p><p>when the recommendation was a major revision, when the journal was from HMS or PS, and when reviews were longer. However, when entered into the model that predicted a reviewer's recommendation, glossary subcategories explained a very small proportion of variance, indicating that other factors contribute to the final reviewer's recommendation.</p><p>The results of this study should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, when adopting a glossary approach in quantitative textual analysis, the results only indicate the number of specific words used in the reviews. It does not provide the context of the mention, so it is not clear whether the words identified in the reports represent positive (i.e., commending the use of a technique) or negative (i.e., critiquing the use of a technique) feedback. Therefore, it is reasonable to question whether the frequency of these mentions reflects underlying improvements that need to be made to the research. However, due to the nature of the feedback provided in peer review reports and the anonymized reviews we present in the Appendix, we consider that the identification of words that occur in reviews will most often be associated with potential issues in the article. The prevalence of identified words differed between research disciplines, indicating that reviewers from different disciplines focus on different areas when it comes to methodological and statistical issues. In the logistic regression, we found that methodological words in our glossary were most prevalent in the SSE disciplines, while statistical words were more prevalent in HMS. Another potential limitation is that we cannot distinguish whether the reviewers from SSE identified more methodological issues, or whether our glossary was more suited to detecting the specific terms used in the SSE. When constructing the glossary, we tried to implement broad terms, related to different research fields (Appendix <ref type="table">, Table S4</ref>). We also found a relatively high absolute number of terms in all research disciplines explored, suggesting that the glossary is suitable for different research disciplines. Finally, it needs to be acknowledged that our glossary may be suitable for quantitative methodology only, due to the inclusion of words and terms specifically related to that methodological approach, so our glossary may not applicable to qualitative studies and reviews. Also, the terms were categorized initially by the reporting guidelines categories, and refined further by reviewers' experience.</p><p>It is expected that in the future glossary will be further expanded and updated according to the specific user needs, in order to capture more terms from various subfields.</p><p>Despite the limitations, there are several theoretical and practical implications of the results from our study. The first theoretical implication is that we showed that it is possible to create a comprehensive glossary for statistical and methodological terms. In general, we found that more review reports mentioned statistical issues compared to methodological issues. The possible conclusion is that reviewers are either more focused on statistical analysis in the reviews and require additional analyses and revisions, or that authors are simply more fallible when it comes to statistical analysis. As we developed more glossary items related to statistics, it is also possible that our glossary captures a greater range of statistical concepts compared to methodological concepts. Nonetheless, methodological words were related to more "reject" recommendations, while statistical words were more related to revision recommendations. This is intuitive as many statistical issues could be corrected during revisions, while methodological issues may require a full revision of the study plan/protocol, as has been shown by our previous study on a small sample . Also, our model had lower predictive performance compared to a model from a previous study which attempted to predict retractions based on peer reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Zheng et al., 2023)</ref>, but the sample size in that study was small (N=260) and compared only binary outcomes and therefore not suitable for comparison. Consequently, the practical implication of the results from our study is that studies should be reviewed at the protocol stage, to reduce research waste and errors, and increase the probability of acceptance after research has been performed. Examples of such results-free peer review exist in social sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Findley et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chalmers &amp; Tzavella, 2021)</ref>, as well as in evidence synthesis in medical sciences, such as protocols for Cochrane systematic reviews of health interventions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Higgins et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Another theoretical implication is related to the prevalence of the glossary terms. The most frequent categories mentioned under the statistical glossary were related to data presentation, parametric statistics, and variable characteristics. Although it could be expected that the majority of scientific articles would have those statistical concepts included in their analysis, and more specific concepts (e.g. metaanalysis) would be significantly less prevalent in research articles, there is also a potential alternative explanation for this finding. A previous study found that only about one-fifth of biomedical journals use specialized statistical review <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hardwicke &amp; Goodman, 2020</ref>). There is not much evidence for this in other disciplines, and it is possible that this finding could also be different across disciplines since social sciences could be primarily researchers and therefore better versed in statistics, in contrast to medical researchers who may be primarily health, while a lot of biomedical authors are primarily practitioners and less focused on research statistics. However, because the majority of reviewers are not statistical experts, they may focus on only basic aspects related to the data in the reviewed articles. Our study showed significant variation across disciplines in the proportion of review reports with words from different subcategories. The most substantial differences were found in the subcategories "Procedures" and "Study design", with SSE having the highest prevalence of reviews containing words from those categories. A potential explanation is that the reviewers identify more methodological issues in social sciences, or the peer reviewers in social sciences are more focused on the subcategories in question compared to other disciplines. The same applies to statistics. There is a possibility that some aspects of the statistical analysis are more relevant to some fields than in other fields (e.g., data presentation in physics, compared to other disciplines), and therefore the reviewers are more focused on them in their peer review reports.</p><p>From the current results, we can conclude that specific categories were present in different disciplines, like data presentation, parametric statistics, and variable characteristics. However, the prevalence of other categories differed across disciplines, except for HMS where all categories were equally prevalent. It must also be noted that we began with categories related to medical research in the development of the glossary, and there is a possibility that the current version of the glossary is more suitable for HMS. An in-depth analysis of the peer review reports and the actual content of the articles would be needed to address this possibility.</p><p>Another practical implication relates to the glossary itself, which can be modified (expanded or shortened) according to the user's needs, in case users want to adopt the dictionary-based approach in the assessment of a large set of research articles or peer reviews. As previously noted, this method could be a complementary approach to deeper methods of analysis, which are frequently difficult to achieve in large datasets. Furthermore, it is to be seen how AI tools can be utilized in combination with the glossary since those tools progress at tremendous speed, and it remains to be seen how those tools will be integrated into the review process (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Checco et al., 2021)</ref>. Another practical implication was that a higher JIF quartile was not associated with a higher probability of finding methodological or statistical terms in peer-review reports, which means that all categories of JIF had the same probability of methodological and/or statistical issues. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether studies submitted to journals with different JIFs generally differ in quality or whether journals with high JIFs can recruit more expert reviewers.</p><p>Therefore, it is expected that those reviewers would provide more substantial feedback related to the methods and analyses in the study, and potentially hold the articles to a higher standard. This cannot be tested in the current dataset as we have no information about the expertise of the reviewers. However, investigating this association may be a fruitful path for further study. The recommendation is, if possible, also to investigate the review content based on the other characteristics which predict journal impact, like journal h-index <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mingers, Macri &amp; Petrovici, 2012)</ref>. Finally, since the specific glossary dimensions explained a low proportion of variance of reviewer recommendations, future studies should focus on the research of which are factors that have more significant effect on reviewer recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Our study is currently the first to construct a comprehensive glossary of methodological and statistical terms and apply it to a large sample of peer review reports. Some of these results are in line with studies conducted on published articles, which did not include rejected submissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bolt et al., 2021)</ref>. We find that methodological issues mentioned in review reports are more likely to result in a "reject" decision, while reviews mentioning statistical analysis can be corrected as long as methods are well planned. Due to the large discrepancy in the prevalence of different categories, a machine-learning approach would likely not be suitable for the identification of all categories/issues.</p><p>Further studies might apply the glossary in different contexts and fields to increase external validity in the identification of methodological and statistical issues. There are already algorithms that use text mining to determining the risk of unsuccessful completion of a scientific study, for which our dictionary could be complementary <ref type="bibr">(Follet, Gelleta &amp; Laugerman, 2019)</ref>. Potential applications also include the analysis of online discussions, informal communications, and comments in scientific communities, which would present complementary data to the current data on peer review reports.</p><p>The newly constructed glossary can be used in the detection of statistical and methodological words in research-related reports (peer review reports, research articles, conference proceedings). It is also openly available (https://osf.io/d34b9/files/osfstorage), and suitable for future expansion and improvement. Furthermore, as shown here, the most prevalent statistical and methodological categories are equally distributed across disciplines, indicating that reviewers are either more focused on descriptive statistics, or their statistical knowledge is limited to basic statistics. Finally, while methodological issues were predicted by rejection recommendation, statistical issues were better predicted by revisions, indicating that methodological issues were potentially the reason for rejection and statistical issues for revisions, but this needs to be confirmed by an in-depth analysis. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>To dig deeper into what predicts different reviewer recommendations, we performed an ordinal logistic regression with review recommendation as the dependent variable and different subcategories from both Statistics and Methods as the dependent variables.
