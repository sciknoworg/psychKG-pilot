In the only experiment which directly compared facial examiners to super-recognizers, the authors found they were equally accurate to each other <ref type="bibr">(Phillips et al., 2018)</ref>. This opens the questions: are facial examiners a subset of super-recognizers, with training and credentials to testify in legal proceedings? If not, how are they different, and are those differences relevant to their professional duties? By moving beyond accuracy alone, we can study these questions. The answers will inform how to effectively measure facial proficiency and how to interpret judgments from examiners and super-recognizers. Our results point to the need for a more comprehensive assessment of facial recognition ability. In our study, we expanded on data from a prior study <ref type="bibr">(Phillips et al., 2018)</ref> to harness the unique opportunity to juxtapose these highly, and equally, accurate groups whose facial expertise differs in nature. This allowed us to evaluate how they are the same and how they are different, independent of overall accuracy. We moved beyond accuracy to investigate the properties of facial examiners' and super-recognizers' facial comparison performance.</p><p>We build on <ref type="bibr">Phillips et al. (2018)</ref> which assessed the accuracy of facial examiners, superrecognizers, and control groups. For each facial comparison, participants viewed two images.</p><p>Some comparisons depicted the same identity; others depicted different identities. Participants provided two responses for each comparison: an identity judgment and a difficulty rating. In the current study, we used these previously collected data to examine what the distribution of identity FACIAL EXAMINERS VS. SUPER-RECOGNIZERS judgements looked like along a 7-point identity judgment scale (range: -3: "The observations strongly support that this is not the same person" to +3: "The observations strongly support that it is the same person"). We assessed the consistency of identity judgments across participants.</p><p>Ideally, the same facial comparison will result in the same conclusion across individuals. This is important for confidence in the facial comparison process. Finally, we examined how identity judgments and difficulty ratings correlated and how these measures correlated with a person's own accuracy to assess metacognitive ability.</p><p>These findings inform whether these groups are the same, behaviorally and cognitively; if different strategies can underpin equal accuracy; and whether the nature of one's expertise affects performance. These are essential to effectively measure multiple aspects of facial proficiency. On an applied level, these findings support that the nature of one's expertise is related to different underlying behaviors. In our study, to qualify as a super-recognizer, the participant could never have received any forensic training. The facial examiners in our study did receive training.</p><p>Therefore, a history of training (or lack of training) was a defining difference in the backgrounds of facial examiners and super-recognizers. The role of training and/or professional experience could not be tested definitively in this study, but our conclusions suggest that the behavioral properties of examiners are consistent with the goals of forensic training. Usually, the effect of training is measured by changes in accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Towler et al., 2019)</ref>. This work shows that the effect of training and/or professional experience may be assessed with other desired measures of training success. By directly measuring behaviors of interest, we can inform training programs to support forensic applications.</p><p>On a theoretical level, these results show that rather than a single strategy supporting high accuracy, multiple strategies can lead to highly accurate at face matching. Investigating these underlying behaviors reveals how the nature of facial expertise can vary depending on one's background. From this, we can begin teasing apart the cognitive processes supporting superior facial comparison ability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>On each trial, participants compared two facial images and determined whether they depicted the same identity or different identities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an example comparison and the full identity judgment scale. There were 12 same-identity and 8 different-identity trials in the task.</p><p>This imbalance prevented participants from applying a process of elimination strategy to determine identity. All face images were sent electronically to the participants. One of the objectives in the original study was to measure facial comparison ability under conditions that mirrored real-world casework. To accomplish this, facial examiners and super-recognizers were allotted up to three months to submit their responses, and they were able to use any tools and methods of their choice when completing the task. This allowed them to perform the task under their preferred viewing and working conditions, using their tools and methods. Comparisons could be completed in any order. and were instructed to determine identity on the 7-point scale shown above. For each comparison, participants also provided a difficulty rating (not shown in the figure). Facial examiners and super-recognizers were allowed 3 months to submit their responses and could use any tools and methods they had available. All images from the study and correct answers can be viewed in the supplementary information for <ref type="bibr">(Phillips et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FACIAL EXAMINERS VS. SUPER-RECOGNIZERS</head><p>Identity judgments were obtained using a 7-point identity judgment scale (-3: the observations strongly support that it is not the same person; -2: the observations support that it is not the same person; -1: the observations support to some extent that it is not the same person; 0: the observations support neither that it is the same person nor that it is different persons; +1: the observations support to some extent that it is the same person; +2: the observations support that it is the same person; +3: the observations strongly support that it is the same person). This identity judgment scale was developed in consultation with members of the forensic face community and is based on scales used in forensic work (e.g., see Conclusion Scale from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Norell et al. (2015)</ref>).</p><p>These identity judgments were the basis of their accuracy, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).</p><p>In addition to providing an identity judgment, participants rated the difficulty of the comparison on a 5-point difficulty rating scale (1: Easy, The comparison was easier than most facial comparisons; 2: Moderate, The comparison was a typical facial comparison; 3: Difficult, The comparison was more difficult than most facial comparisons; 4: Very Difficult, The comparison was unusually difficult, involving significant photometric illumination, or pose changes, other red flags; 5: Not Possible, The comparison was virtually impossible, due to a lack of detail in the image(s)). This was included to evaluate if the perceived difficulty of each facial comparison provided independent information from the identity judgment.</p></div>

We compared two highly skilled face specialist groups: forensic facial examiners, or facial examiners, (n = 57, 28 females) and super-recognizers (n = 13, 8 females). Facial examiners were defined as those who performed one-to-one facial comparisons as part of their profession. In these types of facial comparisons, only two images are evaluated at a time (as opposed to comparing a face to a gallery of images to judge identity). Super-recognizers were defined as those actively employed as a super-recognizer, or who had completed a face recognition test which categorized them as a super-recognizer (e.g., </p></div>

Difficulty ratings were the responses on the difficulty rating scale.</p><p>Each section of results contains its pertinent methodological information. In what follows, we expand on select analyses for clarity and replicability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identity judgment distributions</head><p>From all identity judgments provided in the test, we produced a distribution of the responses to reflect the frequency of each judgment. First, we computed the number of judgments associated with a given point on the scale relative to the total number of trials, separately for sameand different-identity trials and for each participant group. The result of this was the proportion of responses associated with each scale option across all participants within a participant group and trial type ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). For statistical comparisons, we converted the frequencies of raw identity judgments into cumulative response distributions. These cumulative distributions were submitted to Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests. For each distribution comparison, we conducted a twosample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test between the two distributions of interest. We conducted four comparisons in total: 1) facial examiners vs. super-recognizers for same-identity trials, 2) FACIAL EXAMINERS VS. SUPER-RECOGNIZERS facial examiners vs. super-recognizers for different-identity trials, 3) same-vs. different-identity trials within facial examiners, and 4) same-vs. different identity trials within super-recognizers.</p><p>To compare the frequency of judgments across same-and different-identity trials within each participant group, the judgments associated with different-identity trials were reversed, or mirrored, such that responses of -3 were coded as +3, and vice versa. This reverse coded differentidentity distribution was submitted to the analysis and compared to the same-identity distribution.</p><p>To compare the frequencies of responses at the scale extremes (+/-3) and the scale midpoint (0), we computed the frequency of each judgment for each participant relative to the total number of trials. For each participant, this gives us the proportion of judgments corresponding to a particular decision. Statistical comparisons were conducted with non-parametric, Mann-Whitney U tests with the effect size, r, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= √ ⁄ ( 1 )</formula><p>where Z is the Z score of the test statistic, and N is the number of observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identity judgment agreement</head><p>To evaluate the consistency of responses across facial examiners and super-recognizers, we measured the inter-rater reliability of the identity judgments across all possible unique pairs of individuals within each participant group. For facial examiners, this produced n = 1,596 unique pairs of participants. For super-recognizers, this produced n = 78 unique pairs of participants. Interrater reliability was computed using Cohen's Kappa, weighted for ordinal data (̂! ʹ ) (Jacob <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gwet, 2014b)</ref>.</p><p>We tested for group differences with a bootstrap resampling procedure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Harden, 2011)</ref>. We computed a total of n = 1,000 bootstrap iterations. For each iteration, 20 trials (image pairs) were randomly selected with replacement. The following steps were done separately for each participant group. Pairwise agreement (! ʹ ) for the selected sample of image pairs was computed across all possible, unique pairs of participants within a group. Next, we computed the average ! ʹ coefficient across these pairwise combinations. Finally, we computed the difference between these average ! ʹ coefficient for facial examiners and super-recognizers. We repeated this procedure for the 1,000 bootstrap iterations. This process produced a distribution of 1,000 ! ʹ mean differences between the two groups. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref> in the supplemental materials for a visualization of this distribution. The 95% confidence interval around this distribution was bounded by the top and bottom 2.5% of the distribution. The lower bound of this interval determined whether the distributions were significantly different. We determined that agreement between facial examiners and super-recognizers were different if the lower bound did not intersect 0. The upper bound served to characterize the probable range of agreement level differences between the two groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identity judgment distributions</head><p>We started with the basic question: do facial examiners and super-recognizers use the identity judgment scale differently? Visually inspecting the identity judgment distributions indicates that, yes, judgments between the two groups varied ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). Facial examiners' judgments were distributed across the full scale. Super-recognizers, on the other hand, selected the scale extremes and avoided the midpoint 0 ("the observations support neither that it is the same FACIAL EXAMINERS VS. SUPER-RECOGNIZERS person nor that it is different persons"). This was reflected in the modes of the distributions. The mode judgments for facial examiners were +2 and -2 for same-and different-identity trials, respectively. Super-recognizers, by contrast, selected +3 and -3 most frequently for same-identity and different-identity trials, respectively. Subsequent statistical analyses supported these descriptive observations and visual inferences. For statistical analysis, we compared the distribution of responses from facial examiners and super-recognizers with two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests. We conducted two, separate tests for same-and different-identity trials. We found that for both trial types, facial examiners and super-recognizers used the scale differently (same-identity trials: D = 0.17, p = .002; different-identity trials: D = 0.20, p = .002).</p><p>The second basic question is whether participants in each group approached the scale similarly for the two trial types. As stated, the absolute values of the identity judgments were the same for each trial type, within a given group (facial examiners: +2 or -2; super-recognizers: +3</p><p>or -3). However, the overall distributions paint a more thorough picture of their response patterns.</p><p>Based on a visual inspection of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, the same-and different-identity distributions appeared to be mirrored for facial examiners. This suggests they approach the scale similarly for comparisons of same-and different-identities. However, for super-recognizers, this mirroring was less apparent.</p><p>To test this statistically, we mirrored different-identity judgments to reflect the direction of sameidentity judgments by reversing the scale direction for different-identity trials (e.g., -3 was converted to +3 and vice versa). We then compared the distributions from same-and mirrored different-identity judgments. This process was applied to both participant groups. Results showed that for facial examiners, the distribution of judgments was equivalent for same-identity and mirrored different-identity trials (K-S test: D = 0.04, p = 0.82). For super-recognizers, the distribution of judgments differed depending on the trial type (K-S test: D = 0.19, p = 0.02).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FACIAL EXAMINERS VS. SUPER-RECOGNIZERS</head><p>We next tested how judgments varied at the level of the individual. We focused specifically on the scale extremes (highly confident judgments) and on the scale midpoint (0). First, we evaluated whether participants in the super-recognizer group were more likely to use the most extreme points on the scale (+/-3) compared to facial examiners. We computed the proportion of judgments corresponding +/-3 across all trials, separately for each participant. We found that the proportion of these high-confidence judgments was lower for facial examiners compared to superrecognizers (facial examiners: mean (M) = 0.24, standard deviation (SD) = 0.21; superrecognizers: M = 0.40, SD = 0.25; Mann-Whitney U = 232, p = 0.036, r = 0.25). Next, we replicated this analysis on judgments associated with the scale midpoint (0). The proportion of judgments for this response was higher for facial examiners than for super-recognizers (facial examiners: M = 0.09, SD = 0.09; super-recognizers: M = 0.01, SD = 0.02; Mann-Whitney U = 178, p = 0.002, r = 0.37). See Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref> for corresponding visualizations. These materials also provide difficulty rating distributions (Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2)</ref>. Therefore, equal accuracy was supported by different approaches to the identity judgment scale. We next tested whether these differences appeared in other identity judgments properties: agreement, the relationship between different behavioral measures, and insight into accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identity judgment agreement</head><p>In forensic analysis, reliability is desired. Ideally multiple examiners comparing the same image pair will provide the same identity judgment -they will provide consistent answers.</p><p>Measuring the consistency of judgments assesses the degree to which this ideal is met. To test the extent of agreement, we measured inter-rater reliability of the identity judgments. We modeled the case in which comparisons are completed independently by two examiners. To provide a benchmark, we repeated the analysis with super-recognizers.</p><p>We measured identity judgment agreement on all 20 facial comparisons separately for each participant group. Agreement was assessed using a standard measure of inter-rater reliability,</p><p>Cohen's Kappa, weighted for ordinal data ! ʹ (J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fleiss et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gwet, 2014b</ref>).</p><p>The ordinal weighting was applied to reflect the identity judgment response scale. The possible range of ! ʹ between two participants was +1 (indicating perfect agreement) to -1 (indicating complete disagreement). Agreement was measured between all possible unique pairs of facial examiners. With 57 facial examiners in our sample, this produced 1,596 ̂! ʹ values. Between the 13 super-recognizers in our study, there were 78 unique pairs of participants and corresponding ! ʹ values <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3</ref>).  We tested whether the observed agreement between facial examiners and superrecognizers was statistically significant. Because ! ʹ values were measured between all possible pairs of participants within a group, each person contributed to multiple ! ʹ values. This lack of independence between measures precluded the use of standard statistical tests because the variance of the statistic is not readily available for such dependent measures. Therefore, we implemented a bootstrap resampling procedure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Harden, 2011)</ref> to compare the two groups. For each bootstrap iteration, 20 trials (facial comparisons) were selected randomly with replacement to replicate the number of trials presented in the original experiment. For these selected trials, we measured ! ʹ between all possible, unique pairs of individuals within each participant group, repeating the original procedure described above. Next, we computed the difference between the average ̂! ʹ values for facial examiners and for super-recognizers on that iteration. We refer to this as the ! ʹ difference. We repeated this process for 1,000 iterations which produced a distribution of 1,000 ̂! ʹ differences between the two groups (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S3</ref> in supplemental materials). We determined if agreement was significantly different between the two groups according to a 95% bootstrap confidence interval (CI) around the top and bottom 2.5% of the distribution. If the 95% CI did not intersect 0 (indicating no difference), the differences between the two groups were judged to be statistically significant.</p><p>The 95% CI for this distribution of ! ʹ differences was <ref type="bibr">[0.08, 0.35]</ref>. This indicates that agreement differed significantly across the two groups. While the lower bound of this CI determined significance, the upper bound characterized the probable range of agreement differences between the two groups. Therefore, with 95% confidence, our estimate of the agreement difference range between examiners and super-recognizers extended from a small (0.08) to a large difference (0.35).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between behavioral measures</head><p>The previous analyses focused on differences in identity judgment scale use and agreement between facial examiners and super-recognizers. Next, we conducted a deeper analysis into the behavioral measures obtained in this task: the confidence of the identity judgments and difficulty ratings. This provides insight into the shared and unique information across different behavioral measures. We collected both an identity judgment on a 7-point scale and a difficulty rating for each trial (see Methods). We obtained confidence from the absolute value of the identity judgment.</p><p>For example, a judgment of +3 or -3 implied high confidence. We expect that a high confidence judgment would be associated with a lower difficulty rating. Likewise, low absolute values in the identity judgment (i.e., 0) implied low confidence, and we predicted that these decisions would be associated with greater rated difficulty. By measuring the extent to which these are related, we addressed the question of whether these ratings provided distinct or overlapping information. Note that confidence does not necessarily indicate accuracy: a judgment might be highly confident but erroneous.</p><p>Considering the accuracy of judgments was the second part of this analysis. Identity judgments were the basis of accuracy as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We measured metacognitive ability: the extent to which people were aware of their own ability. To examine the level of this behavioral insight, we tested whether accuracy was associated with confidence and rated difficulty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confidence and difficulty</head><p>We evaluated the relationship between rated difficulty and confidence at two levels of analyses: 1) at the level of the trials themselves to address the question: how much does the rated difficulty of a facial comparison correspond to the confidence in that identity judgment? and 2) at the level of the individual to address: does a person who rated the task to be more difficult overall also respond with less confidence overall? The effect of rated difficulty on performance itself has been well-studied (see Scasserra, 2008 for a review). However, to our knowledge, the relationship between the rated difficulty and confidence of a given response has not been studied. For this analysis, we only considered the confidence itself, not the accuracy of the judgment.</p><p>First, to analyze the relationship between difficulty ratings and confidence at the level of the trials themselves, we plotted every combination of difficulty rating and identity judgment observed across all trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4</ref>). A visual inspection shows that as the difficulty rating increased, the confidence associated with the identity judgment decreased, for both correct and incorrect judgments. For example, there were no cases in which the lowest difficulty rating was provided (1) with an identity judgment at the midpoint (0). Likewise, there were no cases in which a high difficulty rating (5) was provided with a highly confident (+/-3) judgment.</p><p>We examined this relationship statistically with a Kendall's t correlation. We first converted the raw identity judgments to a measure of confidence (the absolute value of the identity judgment). This retained the confidence of the identity judgment regardless of the direction of the decision (i.e., judged to be the same identity or different identities). Results showed that as difficulty ratings increased, confidence decreased for both groups (facial examiners: Kendall's t = -.67, p &lt; .001; super-recognizers: t = -.76, p &lt; .001). This trial-based analysis provided a full-test view of the relationship between confidence and difficulty. However, this does not address whether people who are more confident rate the task to be less difficult. To test this, we computed each participant's average confidence and difficulty rating across the whole task. We then computed the correlation between their average confidence and their average difficulty rating. For both groups, there was a negative correlation between confidence and difficulty: the more difficult they found the task, the lower their confidence (facial examiners: t = -0.56, p &lt; 0.001, super-recognizers: t = -0.70, p = 0.001, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral insight: Confidence, difficulty, and accuracy</head><p>We tested the extent to which face specialists have insight into their own accuracy.</p><p>Previous studies have measured the extent to which super-recognizers can estimate their own accuracy using self-report questionnaires to estimate face recognition ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bobak et al., 2018b)</ref>. Instead of self-estimated ability, our measure of insight was the degree to which a person's confidence and difficulty ratings were correlated with their accuracy on the test. For each participant, we computed their mean confidence and difficulty rating across the entire task. Accuracy was measured using AUC. Detailed analyses of difficulty ratings can be found in the supplemental materials.</p><p>First, we measured the relationship between participants' mean confidence and accuracy with Kendall's t correlation. This was computed separately for facial examiners and superrecognizers. For both groups, participants who were more confident on average tended to be more accurate (facial examiners: t = 0.29, p = 0.002; super-recognizers: t = 0.54, p = 0.01, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>).</p><p>Therefore, those in both face specialist groups demonstrated insight into their own accuracy. The relationship between mean rated difficulty and accuracy was consistent with those of mean FACIAL EXAMINERS VS. SUPER-RECOGNIZERS confidence: people who found the task more difficult overall tended to be less accurate (facial examiners: t = -0.22, p = 0.02; super-recognizers: t = -0.48, p = 0.023, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>). higher values indicate greater difficulty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Are facial examiners and super-recognizers the same? Our answer is: no. Our conclusion required investigating behaviors beyond accuracy. Identity judgment distributions and consistency differed. Super-recognizers preferred judgment scale extremes (+3/-3); facial examiners took advantage of the full identity judgment scale. Facial examiners agreed with each other to a greater extent than super-recognizers. Despite these differences, both groups showed metacognitive insight into their ability. These results provide insight into our cognitive understanding of facial expertise.</p><p>Others propose the "two-routes" hypothesis for facial expertise: one via training for facial examiners and another via natural ability for super-recognizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Towler et al., 2021</ref> For applications, perhaps the most important finding in this study was to show that although these two groups are equally accurate, facial examiners' responses were more consistent. Ideally in forensic practice, an identity judgment would be based on the evidence itself -in this case, the similarity of the faces. By quantifying examiner agreement, we can better understand the degree to which this ideal occurs in practice. The scale in this study was developed in consultation with the forensic community to reflect those in their casework. It is possible that a response scale created with the super-recognizer community would have resulted in high consistency for that group. If so, this would suggest that training and/or experience plays a role in how the judgment scales themselves are interpreted by the person providing the judgment.</p><p>Facial examiners and super-recognizers used the judgment scale differently. However, both groups show metacognitive awareness into the difficulty of a comparison. Confidence and rated difficulty moderately predicted accuracy. Judgments are therefore calibrated to one's own accuracy to some extent. Similar patterns are shown in the general population (non-face specialists) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bruce et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Stephens et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">White et al., 2014)</ref>. For the first time, we show this relationship extends to both facial examiners and super-recognizers. In previous studies, metacognitive awareness in super-recognizers was assessed with questionnaires about broad face recognition ability (e.g., "I can spot familiar people in unexpected contexts."). Their selfassessments were more accurate than the general population, but super-recognizers predicted their ability only at moderate or poor levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bobak et al., 2018a)</ref>. Therefore, this moderate degree of metacognitive awareness is observed for both self-assessed measures from previous studies and the implicit, decision-based measures in this study. Recent work on the general population compared these two types of estimates. They showed that global assessments of ability may not be as informative as decision-based metrics, such as confidence on a trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kramer et al., 2022)</ref>. It would be useful for face specialist recruitment to directly compare the utility of self-reported estimates of ability from questionnaires and implicit, decision-based estimates of accuracy, such as those obtained in the current study.</p><p>Regularly measuring accuracy and behaviors will clarify the effects of training and facial expertise. This practical, applied evaluation informs the underpinnings of facial expertise on a theoretical level. Different, and equally accurate, approaches supported high facial comparison accuracy in this challenging test. This approach deviates from other studies which measured behaviors associated with different levels of accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bobak et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Norell et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tardif et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Towler et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Towler et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">White et al., 2015)</ref>. Those findings showed accuracy in the general population can be predicted by different behaviors. Our work shows among face experts, multiple behaviors, and perhaps cognitive routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Towler et al., 2021)</ref>, lead to equally high levels accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FACIAL EXAMINERS VS. SUPER-RECOGNIZERS</head><p>Pivoting toward directly measuring behaviors of interest can lead to evidence-based development of standards and formalized procedures. Ultimately, a primary goal is to understand which behaviors are influenced by training or experience, and which are not. This will be answered with long-term experiments targeted toward separating the role of nature (natural ability), nurture (training/professional experience), and assessing their overlap. Researchers and practitioners need to continue working together to ensure the findings extend to real-world applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ramon et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>An example facial comparison and the identity judgment scale from this study.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>). Our work supports the existence of these two-routes by showing that facial examiners and super-recognizers have distinct behaviors. However, from the current bodies of work, we do not know the extent to which training influences behaviors. For example, if a super-recognizer takes training, and their FACIAL EXAMINERS VS. SUPER-RECOGNIZERS scale use changes, this suggests behaviors may malleable. Otherwise, if behavior is fixed, this suggest that training filters for individuals who naturally have the behaviors desired for examiners.Differences in scale use carry important, real-world implications. Law enforcement investigations and legal proceedings rely partly on the confidence of facial recognition judgments.A high confidence judgment could carry more weight than one with low confidence. Because super-recognizers have a higher tendency to use the most confident decision point, their judgments have different meanings than a highly confident decision from facial examiners. Interpreting a super-recognizer's decision the same way as a facial examiner's potentially result in miscarriages of justice. This suggests interpretations of identity judgments may need to be tailored to each group.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
