			<abstract>
				<p>The behavioral sciences have long studied how people make risky choices, yet it remains unclear to what degree the choices used by researchers (e.g., to develop and calibrate novel measurement tools) reflect those made by people in real life. To address this question, we compared risky choices in the focus of researchers&apos; and laypeople&apos;s perspectives. In a first study, we examined the overlap between these perspectives by determining how many choices they have in common. Leveraging large language models and calibrating semantic similarities with human judgments, we found an overlap of only 18%. To further examine the implications of this mismatch in terms of the psychological mechanisms that these various choices may tap into, we conducted a second study in which 825 participants rated the perceived relevance of seven classes of psychological mechanisms to their decision making in choices from both perspectives. Bayesian mixed effects models revealed credible differences between the perspectives in five out of seven classes of mechanisms. These findings suggest that current theories of decision making may explain only a narrow scope of choices, underscoring the need for the behavioral sciences to realign their focus to better capture the complexity of real-life decision making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Understanding how people make risky choices has been a central goal of the behavioral sciences for many decades. In doing so, researchers have developed various measurement instruments (i.e., lab tasks, self-report questionnaires; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lejuez et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Weber et al., 2002)</ref> to capture a person's risk preferences and related mechanisms-under the assumption that the respective measurements would allow researchers to better understand and predict decision-making processes and outcomes, develop effective interventions, and inform decision-making policies on relevant societal issues.</p><p>The accomplishment of this goal requires a thorough calibration of measurement instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Araújo et al., 2007)</ref> so that the respective insights from the behavioral sciences generalize to relevant risky choices in real life. To this end, researchers have often used so called frequency measures (e.g."How often do you do...?"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Heatherton et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lesieur &amp; Blume, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Skinner, 1982)</ref>, because these measures may be considered the most direct means of assessing real-life risk taking. For instance and to just mention a few examples, it has been studied whether risk taking as measured by the widely used Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is predictive of smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lejuez et al., 2002)</ref>, whether risk seeking in the Iowa Gambling Task is predictive of substance abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buelow &amp; Suhr, 2009)</ref>, and whether risk-taking propensity as captured by the ethical domain of the Domain-specific Risk-attitude Scale is predictive of buying illegal drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Weber et al., 2002)</ref>. Given the evident relevance of using valid risky choices as benchmarks during the development and testing of such measurement instruments, the question thus arises: What are the risky choices in the focus of the behavioral sciences? COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The researchers' perspective on risky choices</head><p>In a precursory project leading to the current article (see supplemental materials I.a), we addressed this question by assembling an inventory of risky choices commonly studied in the behavioral sciences. We compiled this inventory by means of a literature review of frequency measures of risk taking, through which we identified 896 candidate items. Additionally, we conducted an online study in which we invited researchers to contribute additional frequency measures not captured in our initial search and in which 24 additional items were identified. A systematic procedure of consolidating these items yielded 62 presumably unique risky choices.</p><p>Most of the choices in this inventory were either social (e.g., have an affair) or health-related in nature (e.g., smoke a cigarette), with fewer related to traffic (e.g., drive recklessly), recreation (e.g., engage in a physical activity/sport), occupation (e.g., plagiarize/cheat), or finance (e.g., gamble). This skewed distribution may reflect that many frequency measures were originally developed in clinical or developmental contexts. This, in turn, suggests that the researchers' perspective may be shaped by theoretical frameworks that prioritize a narrow range of stereotypical or maladaptive choices (e.g., drug use, alcohol consumption, smoking; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Duell &amp; Steinberg, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Verschoor et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, many (scales of) frequency measures still commonly used today are now several decades old and may not reflect the rapidly evolving choice landscape of modern society. For example, scales such as the Drug Abuse Screening Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Skinner, 1982)</ref>, the South Oaks Gambling Screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lesieur &amp; Blume, 1987)</ref>, and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Heatherton et al., 1991)</ref>, all of which have several thousand citations and are being used as recently as 2024, seem to be commonly used as frequency measures of people's real-life choice behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdurahman et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Huang et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sirola et al., 2019)</ref>. In short, the researchers' perspective specific and narrow focus on risky choices may directly impact the generalizability of measurement tools that have been developed and calibrated using these choices. But how to best learn about relevant and COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 3 timely risky choices, provided that the status quo, that is, the top-down approach of researchers selecting and using specific risky choices, may not fully succeed in this regard?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The laypeople's perspective on risky choices</head><p>One alternative consists of adopting a more data-driven approach, that is, asking laypeople directly about the risky choices they encounter in their lives. For instance, a recent approach resulted in 100 real-life risky choices reported by representative population samples )-thus representing the laypeople's perspective on risky choices. In this approach, participants were asked to identify a choice in which they had either taken or avoided a risk, with "risk" intentionally left undefined for participants' own evaluation. Unlike the researchers' perspective, the laypeople's perspective contains choices that are predominantly in the occupational (e.g., quit one's job), health (e.g., get surgery), and financial (e.g., invest money) domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of aims and research questions</head><p>Clearly, there is no definitive answer as to whether the researchers' or laypeople's perspective on risky choices is "correct". Yet, it may be important to evaluate the extent to which the choices represented by these two perspectives overlap, to thus identify potential commonalities but also discrepancies. This is important in at least two respects.</p><p>First, to the extent that there might be discrepancies between the risky choices in the focus of the two perspectives, there may be an issue in the behavioral sciences because the field might have developed and calibrated measurement tools on inappropriate benchmarks. In other words, if people (have to) make different risky choices in real life compared to the choices researchers had (or still have) in mind, this could imply that state-of-the-art measurement tools may be unfit to provide adequate explanations and predictions of real-life choices.</p><p>Second and assuming that the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives may not necessarily comprise the exact same risky choices, which does not seem unlikely, in principle the former could still generalize to the latter-provided that they tap into similar COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 4 psychological mechanisms. Whether or not this is the case has not been studied to date, however. Hence it may be relevant to not only examine any discrepancies in terms of the actual choices but also regarding which (classes) of psychological mechanisms these choices tap into.</p><p>In what follows we will report two studies that we conducted with the aim of addressing these possibilities. Both studies, including their design, materials, and analysis pipelines, were preregistered at https://osf.io/f6e7q/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim 1: Comparing and contextualizing choices from multiple perspectives</head><p>The first aim of this article, which we addressed in study 1, was to systematically compare the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives by means of the two inventories of risky choices introduced above. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no in-depth comparison of these two perspectives on risky choices. Therefore, we aimed to identify the degree to which choices typically investigated in the behavioral sciences can be considered the same as those prevalent in people's lives.</p><p>Furthermore, to situate these choices within a broader context we compared them to three additional conceptualizations of relevant choices and risks: big life choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Camilleri, 2023)</ref>, global risks (World Economic Forum, 2024), and health-related risk factors <ref type="bibr">(Murray et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim 2: Analyzing which psychological mechanisms the risky choices from the two perspectives tap into</head><p>The second aim of this article, which we addressed in study 2, consisted of assessing whether the choices in the focus of both perspectives-even if they may not fully overlap-tap into similar or different psychological mechanisms. Specifically, a gap in terms of the concrete risky choices may or may not be an issue: As long as similar psychological mechanisms are relevant to choices represented by both perspectives, the discrepancy on the level of choices may be inconsequential. On the other hand, if there is a misalignment between the perspectives both on the level of choices and on the level of underlying COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 5 psychological mechanisms, this would suggest not only a systematic neglect of choices that people consider important but also a potential failure to understand and predict a substantial subset of real-world choices of modern life. Thus, we examined the perceived relevance of seven classes of psychological mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lob et al., 2024)</ref> in choices represented by the two perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Comparing and contextualizing choices from multiple perspectives</head><p>We addressed our first research question with a large language modeling (LLM) approach. Specifically, we first quantified the semantic similarity of all 162 risky choices in the focus of the researchers' and laypeople' perspectives-hereinafter referred to as the inventories representing the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives (of risky choices).</p><p>Second and upon conducting an empirical calibration study, we determined the overlap of the choices within and particularly across the two perspectives.</p><p>In addition and using the same analytic approach to quantify semantic similarity by means of an LLM, we set these choices into a broader context by examining three additional inventories of choices and risks: big life decisions, global risks, and health risks.</p><p>To illustrate, Camilleri (2023) collected 49 big life decisions from a representative US sample (e.g., whether to get married or move to a new city). Considering that such choices almost inherently contain an element of risk and uncertainty, they allow investigating the cultural generalizability of the choices representing the laypeople's perspective.</p><p>Furthermore, global experts from the World Economic Forum (WEF) have recently published the 34 presumably most pressing systemic risks in their annual Global Risks Report <ref type="bibr">(World Economic Forum, 2024)</ref>. This resource offers a broader context for examining how well the inventories representing the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives align with global and systemic risks recognized by experts. Finally, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) repository provides a comprehensive dataset of 206 risk factors and causes for quantifiable health outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Murray et al., 2020)</ref>. This resource can be used to assess the degree to which the inventories representing the researchers' and and an inventory of 100 choices reported by representative Swiss samples , respectively. For better comparability between choices, we normalized them by wording them in the infinitive form (i.e., "to" + [verb phrase]) and using second-person personal pronouns (i.e., "your" instead of "one's").</p><p>As outlined above, we compared these choices to three additional resources on choices and risks, namely, big life decisions (N = 49 choices; Camilleri, 2023), risks from the WEF's Global Risks Report (N = 34 risks; World Economic Forum, 2024), and health-related risks as identified by the GBD repository (N = 206 risks; <ref type="bibr">Murray et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis plan</head><p>As a way of numerically representing the choices and risks in the different inventories, we obtained their semantic embeddings using a large language model (specificially, a Sentence-BERT model; Reimers &amp; Gurevych, 2019) that we accessed via Hugging Face's API: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2.</p><p>Using the embeddings, we calculated cosine similarities as a measure of semantic similarity between choices and risks across inventories.</p><p>In addressing research question 1, we determined how many of the choices COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 7 representing the researchers' perspective corresponded to choices representing the laypeople's perspective. We determined this overlap between the inventories that represent the perspectives based on a semantic similarity threshold obtained from an empirical calibration study using human judgments of pairs of choices (see "Calibration study" below). The analyses are explained in detail in the preregistration at https://osf.io/f6e7q/.</p><p>We used Python 3.10.12 (Python Software Foundation, 2023) to obtain the semantic embeddings and compute cosine similarities. All further analyses were performed using R version 4.3.3 (R Core Team, 2024).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration study</head><p>In order to establish a threshold of LLM-based similarity above which humans perceive two choices to be the same, we conducted a calibration study. According to the self-evaluation checklist of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Zurich, this study did not require an in-depth review and further ethical approval.</p><p>Following findings from previous research on appropriate sample sizes when applying majority rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kuroda et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wolf et al., 2013)</ref>, we recruited 25 participants via Prolific. They were presented with a random subset of 100 pairs of choices from within and across the inventories representing the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives and indicated for each pair whether they considered the two choices to be the same ("In your view, do these two phrases describe the same underlying choice?"). One pair was later removed from analysis due to a defunct choice representing the laypeople's perspective (see . Details on data collection and the study procedure are included in the supplemental materials I.c.</p><p>The distribution of the semantic similarities of these 99 pairs of the choices are displayed in panel (a) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>. For each pair, we determined whether the simple majority vote of participants (i.e., at least 13 out of 25 participants) indicated that the two choices were the same. According to this criterion, 24 of the 99 pairs were identified to COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 8 comprise the same choices. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis (see panel (b) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>) further revealed an optimal similarity threshold of .65, indicating that pairs of choices with a semantic similarity at or above this threshold tended to be classified as the same by a majority of participants. The full details of this approach are described in the preregistration at https://osf.io/f6e7q/.</p></div>

By contrast, the inventory representing the laypeople's perspective includes choices that appear more balanced, involving opportunities that have both positive and negative outcomes irrespective of the option chosen (e.g., accept a new challenge at work, get surgery, use social media).</p><p>Moreover, many choices used to calibrate behavioral research measurement tools have a dominant, normative, or objectively better option (e.g., it is clearly better not to drive after drinking alcohol). In contrast, real-life choices often do not have an unambiguously better option (e.g., getting surgery might carry certain risks, but so does not getting surgery; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Verschoor et al., 2016)</ref>. Over time, these measures have established themselves within various subfields of psychology and judgment and decision-making research. However, many are by now several decades old and lack any substantial updates for novel risks in the 21 st century such as using social media or polluting the environment.</p><p>Thus, if researchers mainly rely on choices representing the researchers' perspective to study real-life risky choices or to validate behavioral and propensity measures, they may be limiting their explanatory or predictive scope. As a result, many decision-making theories may have limited applicability to choices people face in their lives.</p><p>Interestingly, some of the most stereotypically risky choices were part of both the inventories representing the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives (i.e., their overlap):</p><p>to drink alcohol, take drugs, or bet money on a gamble, among others. In other words, some of the more frequently studied choices were also considered relevant in laypeople's eyes, implying that research may have a solid understanding of how these specific choices unfold. However, these overlapping choices represent only a small subset of the total (18%), indicating that 82% of choices remain distinct to either the inventory representing the researchers' or laypeople's perspective. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We analyzed data from 825 participants via Prolific (sample size determined by a prior simulation study, see https://osf.io/f6e7q/). Details on data collection via Prolific, sample composition, and quality control are described in the supplemental materials I.d. Onboarding. Participants first read about the background and purpose of the study and provided informed consent. They then reported sociodemographic information (i.e., age, gender, level of education, employment status, and yearly income). Participants were informed that they had to turn off any VPN they were using and pass a Google reCAPTCHA bot check in order to continue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and procedure</head><p>Instructions and comprehension check. Participants received the following information on the main task:</p><p>When people make choices, they may take various factors into account. In the next section, you will see a series of 15 different choices. We are interested in understanding the extent to which 7 factors would play a role in your decision-making process if you were to make these choices.</p><p>As in the calibration study, participants had two attempts to pass the comprehension check before being prevented from completing the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis plan</head><p>We addressed research question 2 by comparing the perceived relevance of different classes of psychological mechanisms across choices in the two inventories (incl. their overlap).

This model allowed us to estimate the perceived relevance (R) using fixed effects for inventory (I), class of mechanism (M), and their interaction (all dummy-coded), with by-participant (p) and by-choice (c) random intercepts, and random slopes for class of mechanism. A beta distribution was used for the likelihood. We employed weakly informative priors for both the fixed and random effects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Despite the small overlap in the choices representing the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives (see study 1), study 2 suggests that there were at least some similarities between perspectives in the perceived relevance of classes of psychological mechanisms.</p><p>Specifically, across the two perspectives and their overlap, participants perceived a similar relevance of cognitive resources and control, and affect. knowledge--were rated as more relevant in the inventory representing the laypeople's perspective than in the inventory representing the researchers' perspective. The most pronounced difference between the inventories can be found in the perceived relevance of social influence (see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>): Social influence was rated as more important for choices representing the researchers' perspective than for choices representing the laypeople's perspective. This suggests that choices representing the researchers' perspective may, at least in the participants' views, be more susceptible to factors such as peer influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Irwin &amp; Millstein, 1986)</ref>, social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gerrard et al., 2008)</ref>, or accountability <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tetlock, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, study 2 suggests that participants perceive the various classes of psychological mechanisms to have a different relevance to the choices of the two inventories (and their overlap). These findings thus aggravate the potential issue identified in study 1:</p><p>Specifically, the two perspectives do not only seem to differ on the level of choices, but also on the level of psychological mechanisms the respective risky choices may tap into. These discrepancies raise an important issue for decision-making research: Relying primarily on choices representing the researchers' perspective to develop and calibrate measures of decision making and risk taking may lead to a systematic underestimation of the relevance of certain mechanisms in real-world choices. This, in turn, has serious implications for the field's ability to understand and predict many real-world choices of modern life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head><p>As society continues to evolve (e.g., novel technologies) so does the landscape of risky choices that individuals face. A key objective of the behavioral sciences is to understand and predict these choices. The present findings reveal substantial discrepancies between real-life risky choices in the focus of behavioral scientists (e.g., used to calibrate measurement tools) and those reported by laypeople, on the level of both the choice content itself-real-life choices typically investigated by behavioral scientists largely differ from those that laypeople report to face-and the psychological mechanisms perceived to be involved in them.</p><p>This raises an important question about the alignment between behavioral scientists' focus when calibrating their measurement tools and the modern-day landscape of risky choices people encounter. While many choices representing the researchers' perspective are clearly still relevant today-calibrating measurement tools on choices such as whether to steal, get into a fight, or destroy property can help researchers better understand and potentially prevent delinquent behavior-they do not seem to capture the full range of choices individuals encounter. This discrepancy could pose a problem for the generalizability and real-life applicability of many research findings: Even if current measurement tools have some ability to predict the risky choices comprised in the researchers' perspective they may have very little to say about many choices people consider relevant in today's world. As outlined in the introduction, it is difficult to define the ground truth with regards to which risky choices are indeed relevant in society. Yet, with the current article we have aimed to illustrate commonalities and discrepancies between the two main perspectives on risky choices studied here, as well as to contextualize these choices with three additional views on important choices and risks more generally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our conclusions should be interpreted in light of some limitations, two of which we will address in detail in what follows.</p><p>First, our conclusions regarding the overlap of risky choices in the focus of the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives naturally rest on samples of risky choices.</p><p>Specifically, the laypeople's perspective is based on choices reported by representative Swiss COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 22 samples comprising more than 4,000 individuals , and the inventory representing the researchers' perspective was distilled from an initial list of more than 600 frequency measures from various subfields within the behavioral sciences. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that some relevant choices were not captured by either approach. Moreover, while the inventory representing the laypeople's perspective may adequately describe the ecology of risk in many other Western societies, it may not capture important risky choices faced by people in other parts of the world.</p><p>Second, our conclusions about the relevance of psychological mechanisms are based on participants' responses to hypothetical choice scenarios. Participants were asked to evaluate the relevance of various psychological mechanisms, which may be more difficult for some mechanisms (e.g., mechanisms operating automatically or without conscious awareness, such as the class of mechanisms described by cognitive resources and control) and individuals than others (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977</ref>, for a long-standing debate about individuals' ability to provide insight into internal processes).</p><p>Therefore, the findings from this study primarily speak to the perceived relevance of various classes of psychological mechanisms for different choices. In any case, in our view the discrepancies in perceived relevance of different classes of psychological mechanisms between the two perspectives highlight which mechanisms warrant further investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opportunities for future research</head><p>Future research should address these limitations by examining both choices and psychological mechanisms involved in real-life scenarios. A first step in this direction could be made by calibrating behavioral tasks on the broader set of choices comprised in the laypeople's perspective, which may require the adoption of more naturalistic tasks and / or the experimental manipulation of (relevant) psychological mechanisms therein.</p><p>Moreover, researchers may examine decision making directly in contexts that carry real consequences for individuals. To this end, techniques such as ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) may constitute a fruitful tool that enables simultaneously obtaining a COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 23 detailed representation of the risky choices at play in people's lives and learning about psychological mechanisms involved at different steps of the decision-making process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Behavioral sciences and judgment and decision making in particular aim to better understand and predict how people make risky choices. This requires the research conducted in these fields to generalize from the lab to real-life scenarios. This can be achieved if researchers either use the same choices to develop their measurement tools and laboratory tasks as people face in their lives, or if the underlying psychological mechanisms at play in these choices are comparable. In two studies, we have shown that neither of these requirements is met: Many commonly studied choices differ from the choices individuals encounter in today's world, and they seem to tap into different classes of psychological mechanisms. To enhance the applicability and generalizability of research findings, researchers ought to reconsider the alleged real-life choices they often use to calibrate various decision-making tasks. Doing so may ultimately contribute to a deeper understanding of decision-making processes in everyday life.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>illustrates the semantic similarities between the various risky choices (as measured by cosine similarities), within and across the two inventories.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Study 1 revealed a substantial discrepancy in the real-life risky choices typically investigated in the behavioral sciences and those reported by laypeople. Specifically, after identifying 103 unique choices from an initial set of 162, only 19 choices (18%) were shared by both the inventories representing the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives. This indicates that a vast majority of choices were unique to either the inventory representing the researchers' or laypeople's perspective, implying that the current status quo of choices studied in the behavioral sciences does not fully capture the diversity of choices encountered in everyday life. The discrepancy in choices between the inventories representing the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives raises questions about why the behavioral sciences rely on this particular scope of frequency measures to validate measures (e.g., laboratory tasks) of risk taking and decision making. Many of the choices representing the researchers' perspective originate from clinical or developmental psychology often focusing on potentially pathological or delinquent behaviors (details on the development of the inventory representing the researchers' perspective are included in the supplemental materials I.a).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head>Study 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Analyzing which psychological mechanisms the risky choices from the two perspectives tap into As outlined in the introduction, despite the divergence between perspectives on the level of individual risky choices, empirical findings relying on the choices comprised in the researchers' perspective could, in principle, still generalize well to real-life decision making-provided that the same psychological mechanisms are relevant (to a similar COMPARING PERSPECTIVES ON RISKY CHOICE 13 extent) as in the choices comprised in the laypeople's perspective. On the other hand, if there is a misalignment between the perspectives both on the level of choices and on the level of underlying psychological mechanisms, this would suggest not only a systematic neglect of choices that people consider important but also a potential failure to understand and predict a substantial subset of real-world choices of modern life with current state-of-the-art measurement tools of risk taking. But what even are the psychological mechanisms that may play a role in the various risky choices? In fact, a plethora of psychological mechanisms that may shape risky choices have been proposed to date. Broadly speaking, these can be grouped into seven classes of mechanisms (for details, see Lob et al., 2024), namely, the subjective perception of choice attributes (e.g., subjective perception of values; Bernoulli, 1738; von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1944), time factors (e.g., time pressure; Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993), goals and motivation (e.g., specific needs; Mishra et al., 2017), cognitive resources and control (e.g., memory processes; Johnson et al., 2007), social influence (e.g., social norms; Gerrard et al., 2008), experience and knowledge (e.g., previous exposure; Loewenstein et al., 2001), and affect (e.g., regret; Loomes &amp; Sugden, 1982). Despite this rich collection of potentially relevant psychological mechanisms, it remains largely unclear how and to what extent they are involved in the different risky choices comprised in the two perspectives. Thus, in study 2 we addressed our second research question, namely: To what extent do potential differences between the researchers' and laypeople's perspectives imply differences in the psychological mechanisms they tap into?
