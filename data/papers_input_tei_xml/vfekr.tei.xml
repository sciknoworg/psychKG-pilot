			<abstract>
				<p>The value associated with response alternatives has been observed to impact rapid choices while slower decisions remain relatively unbiased. Here we aim to understand how the decision process is redirected towards goal-relevant evidence after the initial value prioritisation and propose that conflict detection and cognitive control serve as the underlying mechanism. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from participants performing a speeded binary choice task based on the price of realistic food stimuli that naturally also encompassed subjective preferences. Our findings indicate that preferred alternatives were consistency selected faster, irrespective of the amount of task-relevant information available and in the absence of any motor or attentional anticipation, suggesting fast automatic integration of value-based information. Furthermore, participants&apos; pre-existing mental representations of item prices and preferences influenced the degree of value biases on response accuracy. Consistent with our initial hypothesis, results show that in incongruent trials, where subjective value and objective information compete, mid-frontal theta (MFT) activity was heightened and predicted choice accuracy, indicating monitoring and detection of conflict. Additionally, our findings unveiled enhanced MFT power proportional to the potential cost opportunity of the choice and following errors, highlighting the implication of cognitive control in various aspects of decision-making. In essence, this study provides the foundation for comprehending how value-biases are overcame within the brain, while illustrating the need to use more ecological paradigms to better understand the multifaceted interactions characterising human behaviour in real-world scenarios.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>It is midnight, and tomorrow morning you are about to embark on your well-deserved holiday trip to relax. However, you find yourself stressing about what to pack and what not to, and struggling to close the suitcase lid. How did you get yourself into this problem? While it is obviously essential to close your suitcase before your flight, it feels no less important to pack essential clothing, novels you have postponed for months, and of course, your brand-new snorkelling gear. The subjective value you associate with these items and the objective considerations regarding their volume and weight must be all considered together under one single optimization problem. This is the kind of decision-making problem we address here.</p><p>In real-life decision making, interactions between values (often subjectively assigned such as preferences) and objective attributes, be them purely physical such as size and weight or more abstract such as monetary costs, are pervasive. In controlled laboratory protocols, previous research has highlighted that items associated with higher value have higher salience in attention tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Hickey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Libera &amp; Chelazzi, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Theeuwes &amp; Belopolsky, 2012)</ref>. Beyond attentional capture, the relative values of alternatives also have been shown to impact decision processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blangero &amp; Kelly, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Corbett et al., 2023)</ref>, with choice alternatives associated with higher value being chosen more often and faster, seemingly regardless of the choice's difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Noorbaloochi et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>These findings come as no surprise, considering that we perceive and interact with the world around us through the lens of our internal preferences and desires, which have a strong influence on expected and actual rewards (or punishment) outcomes associated with our actions. The ongoing internal consideration of value, even in the absence of conscious awareness, is further supported by research demonstrating the widespread and automatic nature of the value-based system (VBS), which encompasses a network of brain regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, ventral striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex. Activation of this system occurs during the process of valuation and decision-making based on subjective preferences. The generality of the VBS is supported by its responsiveness to a wide variety of stimuli, such as food items <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Plassmann et al., 2007)</ref>, paintings <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Kawabata &amp; Zeki, 2004)</ref>, sculptures <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dio et al., 2007)</ref>, faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(O'Doherty et al., 2003)</ref>, indoor and outdoor scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Yue et al., 2007)</ref>, and houses <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Lebreton et al., 2009)</ref>. Moreover, the activation of the VBS areas during decisions where value is irrelevant to the task at hand strongly suggests that it is engaged automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kim et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lebreton et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Past research has identified brain regions that are sensitive to both choice-relevant and choice-irrelevant value information, and may even predict the extent to which value biases the decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Grueschow et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hickey et al., 2010)</ref>. In contrast, other brain areas, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), exhibit stronger encoding of value when it is directly relevant to the ongoing decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Grueschow et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Frömer et al., 2019)</ref>. While certain regions encode value consistently, some prefrontal areas are capable of integrating contextual information about the decision, although this integration process requires time. Previous studies investigating value biases in decisions have demonstrated that as response times slow down, the impact of subjective value on decision-making declines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Noorbaloochi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2010)</ref>. These findings suggest the presence of a mechanism that regulates the decision-making process, redirecting resources towards pondering goal-relevant evidence after an initial jolt toward value.</p><p>Cognitive control emerges as a promising candidate to fulfil this regulatory function. This adaptive mechanism enables individuals to adjust to changing task demands and optimize performance. It relies on the activation of an extensive brain network, which includes prefrontal structures such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and the mPFC (M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Botvinick et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Debener et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kerns et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">MacDonald et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Pochon et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Sheth et al., 2012)</ref>. These brain regions increase their activation during conflicting choices or following errors, and it has been postulated that they act as an alert system to facilitate attention reallocation or increase the motor threshold (M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Botvinick et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cavanagh et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Guan et al., 2023)</ref>. In addition to its involvement in cognitive control, the dACC has also been associated with other mechanisms such as information sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Monosov &amp; Rushworth, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boroujeni et al., 2021)</ref> and foraging behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Hayden et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kolling et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Monosov et al., 2020)</ref>, and it has been suggested to play a role in perception via 'internal foraging' <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Safavi &amp; Dayan, 2022)</ref>. Moreover, the dACC has been linked to reward-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bush et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennerley et al., 2006)</ref> and motivation (M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botvinick &amp; Braver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Holroyd &amp; Yeung, 2012)</ref>, and recent research has made strides in reconciling these findings with its role in cognitive control, aiming to develop a global understanding of the dACC's functions.</p><p>An emerging perspective posits that the dACC dynamically modulates its activity based on the expected value of control, which is influenced by both task demands and contextual factors such as reward contingencies and task difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Shenhav et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Shenhav et al., , 2016</ref>. By flexibly adjusting the level of engagement of other brain areas, the dACC optimises the allocation of cognitive resources, maximising the potential benefits of control while minimizing associated costs. This framework primarily relies on functional neuroimaging data, but recent efforts have sought to integrate findings from single-cell recordings and lesion studies conducted in both humans and non-human animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Silvetti et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Holroyd &amp; McClure, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brown &amp; Alexander, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Human EEG studies have put forth mid-frontal theta oscillations (MFT, 4-7Hz) as a potential indicator signalling the need for cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014)</ref>. Increased MFT activity has been consistently observed in various scenarios that necessitate heightened cognitive control, including higher cognitive load during working memory tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Itthipuripat et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Onton et al., 2005)</ref>, sustained attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Sauseng et al., 2007)</ref>, conflicting stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Nigbur et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hanslmayr et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Jiang et al., 2015)</ref>, intersensory conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Marly et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Morís Fernández et al., 2015</ref>, and instances following incorrect responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cavanagh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Narayanan et al., 2013)</ref> or negative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Marco-Pallares et al., 2008)</ref>. Additionally, although heightened MFT activity is observed in common motor-conflict paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cohen &amp; Donner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Jiang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Haciahmet et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Drew et al., 2022)</ref>, it is not limited to such situations. Studies focusing on stimulus-stimulus conflicts have employed protocols without response reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Drew &amp; Soto-Faraco, 2023)</ref> or with delayed response reports to mitigate motor contamination <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Marly et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Ruzzoli et al., 2020)</ref>, while still observing an analogous pattern of increased MFT activity during conflict trials. In fact, recent research has challenged the strict functional and temporal demarcation between decision-making processes and motor actions. Instead, it suggests a parallel outlook of information processing, wherein the integration of evidence and the execution of motor outputs may coexist and interact <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cisek &amp; Kalaska, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">McKinstry et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Ozbagci et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Resulaj et al., 2009)</ref>. This notion aligns well with the observation of similar MFT variations in response to both purely perceptual-related conflicts and conflicts encompassing actions. For their part, value-biased decisions also exhibit resemblances to tasks commonly employed in cognitive control studies (e.g., Flanker, Stroop, Simon tasks), as choices bearing conflicting information are characterised by slower reaction times and increased error rates. This suggests that the conflict monitoring and control system, as revealed by frontal midline theta enhancement, may be integral to the detection of conflict between, and the resolution of the competition amongst, goal-relevant and value-based evidence for decision-making, thereby ensuring efficient performance.</p><p>Previous literature has typically employed the drift-diffusion model (DDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007)</ref> to investigate the cognitive adaptations associated with value-based biases in decision-making processes. The DDM simulates decision-making through the accumulation of noisy sensory evidence, referred to as the "decision variable," until a choice is finally made when it reaches a predefined threshold <ref type="bibr">(or bound)</ref>. This model has proven highly effective in predicting both choice accuracy and response times, shedding light on the underlying cognitive mechanisms involved in decision-making biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Forstmann et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Voss et al., 2004)</ref>. The classical DDM can be adapted to account for the preference for one alternative over the other through the introduction of a "starting point bias." This bias initially shifts the accumulation of evidence towards the favoured alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mulder et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Voss et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Mochol et al., 2021)</ref>. Another common extension of the DDM explains how differential reward outcomes bias perceptual decisions by incorporating a "drift bias," which accelerates the accumulation of evidence toward the preferred option <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Fan et al., 2018)</ref>. More sophisticated mechanisms have also been introduced to account for perceptual decisions with asymmetric rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Diederich, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Diederich &amp; Busemeyer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Shinn, Ehrlich, et al., 2020)</ref> but in all cases, the outcome associated with each response was artificially manipulated and known before the onset of the choice alternatives or target. Consequently, participants were able to adapt their evidence accumulation based on these response-reward contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Corbett et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Noorbaloochi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blangero &amp; Kelly, 2017)</ref>. Hence, it remains unknown whether value can influence decisions when response-reward contingencies are not known in advance, and the mechanisms through which decision processes may be biased. Although cognitive control has been proposed to play a role in adjusting the decision-making processes towards goal-relevant evidence, as far as we know there is currently a lack of research investigating the connection between conflictrelated mid-frontal theta oscillations and value-biased decision-making processes.</p><p>In the present study, we introduce a novel experimental paradigm that combines a decisionmaking task with scalp EEG recordings to address the role of cognitive control in regulating decision making towards the goal-relevant evidence in the light of conflicting subjective value. To do so, we set out to address the following questions: (a) We investigate whether task-irrelevant preferences exert a bias on choice decisions regarding task-relevant attributes when both attributes are available concomitantly. We employ edible items, characterised by subjective values and objectively estimated prices. If this bias exists, we anticipate two primary outcomes. Firstly, if value biases depend on the fast and automatic activation of the VBS, we expect choices to be equally biased regardless of the amount of task-relevant information available (choice difficulty) which is integrated later in the decision process. Secondly, we predict that faster decisions will be more significantly affected by value than slower decisions, indicating the presence of a time-dependent correction mechanism. Additionally, while edible items possess the inherent advantage of naturally encapsulating intrinsic preferences and prices, how one attribute relates to the other at an individual level cannot be experimentally manipulated and may impose some challenges. One we anticipated is that, for certain participants, the estimated prices and subjective values of items may exhibit a positive correlation, giving rise to what we term a "preference-for-expensive bias". This bias could potentially arise from the well-established association between the prices of goods and their perceived quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Rao &amp; Monroe, 1989)</ref>. If such relation exists, we predict it may have the counter expected effects of value on choice behaviour, with a propensity to select the non-preferred, typically cheaper, alternative. (b) By examining variations in frontal midline theta activity, we aim to explore whether the cognitive control network is involved in regulating decisions towards task-relevant evidence. We hypothesize that this network plays a role in detecting and potentially resolving conflicts between automatic activation of subjective value-based representations and objective task-relevant information to be used for correct choice. Lastly, (c) we aim to investigate whether intrinsic preference biases in objective decisions can be modelled using the classical DDM framework and identify the mechanisms at play.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental task and design</head><p>We developed a novel experimental design divided in three phases. First, a stimulus selection phase where participants were presented with 236 products of food and drinks typically available in supermarkets in Spain. Their task was to reject products they didn't recognise or for which they didn't have any idea of the taste. Participants had no time limit. Rejected products were removed from the subsequent phases. In case less than 180 products were selected, the participant was discarded. In the second phase <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref> -left), participants were asked to rate the previously selected products on two parameters: the subjective value of that foodstuff, and its objective monetary price. For subjective value estimation, participants rated how much they like the product presented (by mouse clicking on a visual scale from -100 to 100 with a single tick-mark in the middle), they were encouraged to sometimes think of the products cooked or as part of a meal and to dissociate the frequency at which they consume the product from the pleasure they feel consuming it. During the rating of the objective price, participants had to estimate the monetary cost of the product in a supermarket (visual scale bar from 0 to 10 euros). To encourage precision of participants estimations, the three last rated items were displayed on the visual scale bar. Subjective value and price rating were self-paced, included several breaks, were run in separate blocks, and were presented in a random order between participants.</p><p>The third (and last) phase consisted of the experimental choice task of interest <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1right)</ref>, where in addition to behaviour, neural data was recorded using scalp EEG. Participants were introduced with a realistic context in which they had to go grocery shopping in the supermarket. They were asked to fill up 16 shopping carts (separate experiment runs) composed, each of them, of 80 products with the goal to fill the shopping carts as cheap as possible. To do so, they were presented with pairs of products, and they quickly had to select (one second time limit) the cheapest product. Each trial started with a fixation cross presented for 1200ms, a pair of items was then presented on the screen and disappeared as soon as a response was made or after 1100ms. The items were presented as square images (8x8cm) in the centre of the screen separated by a small space (2cm) with a fixation cross in the middle to limit eye movement. The selected item was added to participants' virtual shopping carts. If no response was made on time, the most expensive product was automatically added and participants were presented with the feedback message 'you were too slow, try to be faster' for 3 seconds. To incentivise good performance, participants were told they would win a product (randomly selected) from each shopping cart whose cost was less than 15 euros above the optimal (cheapest possible) one. Participants received their item(s) right at the end of the experiment. Their performance was displayed at the end of each run.</p><p>Before starting, participants were presented with two mini shopping carts (20 trials each) to practice the task and get acquainted with the experiment pace and response deadline. These practice runs were not considered for analysis. Breaks were offered to participants in the middle and in-between each run. Experimental design. Estimation: Participants estimate the value (preference) or prices of all recognised items by clicking on the bar. The three last estimated items are displayed on the bar to facilitate participants' ratings. Choice: trial sequence. Participants quickly select the cheapest item using button presses. The items disappear as soon as they answer or after 1100ms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>During the experimental choice phase, participants were presented with pairs of products which varied in price difference (from 0 to 3 euros) and in subjective value difference (from 0 to 60, arbitrary rating scale units). The directions of the differences in price and values between the two products characterised the congruency condition. Among pairs with large subjective value difference (40 ≤ ∆V ≤ 60), half were defined as congruent (C+) because the preferred item was also the cheapest (and hence the correct choice), and the other half were defined as incongruent (C-) because the preferred item was the most expensive (and hence, incorrect choice). Pairs with a small value difference (∆V &lt; 20) were defined as carrying no congruency (C0).</p><p>The item pairs were selected online during the experiment, based on the individual ratings from the first two phases. The selection used a custom-made algorithm which maximised the number of positively rated (value) products included and homogenised pairs over the different conditions: difference in price between the pairs of items and congruency. The goal of the algorithm was that participants were presented with around 75% of trials with a congruency component (half C+ and half C-) and 25% of trials with no congruency component (C0). Given the variable nature of subject's ratings, this ideal distribution of trials could not always be achieved but the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials was always kept equal.</p><p>To homogenise the materials included in the final analyses, we filtered out a posteriori trials containing items with negative subjective ratings (disliked) and trials with intermediate value difference (20 ≤ ∆V &lt; 40), to ensure a sufficiently strong congruency manipulation. To be clear, these trials were included in the experiment but not analysed as part of our hypothesis testing. We also excluded trials for which the reaction time was faster than the individual mean minus 3 standard deviations, as they were considered premature responses. These screenings were pre-registered and applied before any data analyses. They resulted in less than 15% of trials rejected on average per subject. Mean percentages and numbers of trials included in the analyses for each experimental condition are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>. In practice, trials with no-congruency (C0) show an average subjective value difference (±standard deviation (s.d.)) of 4.81±0.46. As expected, no congruency effect between value and price was present for this subset of trials in any of our measures of interest: accuracy, ; RT: ; theta power: . Please note that trials considered as carrying a congruency (C+ and C-) had an average subjective value difference of 49.28±0.75.</p><p>As pre-registered, the price difference condition (∆P) was discretized in three bins, small (between 0 and 1 euro), medium (between 1 and 2 euros) and large (between 2 and 3 euros) for data visualisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited from the Centre from Brain and Cognition (CBC) database based on several criteria. We followed the following in/exclusion criteria. First, participants who follow any specific diet (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, etc) were excluded, in order to maximize the number of liked edible products. Second, we only selected participants who had lived in Spain for at least the past year, to maximize product familiarity and knowledge of prices. Participants ages were between 19 and 34 years old, and they were excluded if they were presently undergoing psychological conditions or medical treatment. Finally, participants were asked to fast during the 3 hours preceding the experiment, as we reasoned this would make liked products more appealing. The whole experiment lasted between two and three z = . 62, p = . 54 z = . 11, p = . 91 χ 2 1 = . 055, p = . 81 hours in total and participants received 5€ compensation per half hour spent in the laboratory (a total between 20 and 30 euros). Additionally, participants whose performance was good enough (within 15euros of the theoretical optimal cart) received a real product randomly selected from their virtual shopping cart (16 out of 34 participants left the laboratory with a minimum of one and up to sixteen products). After completion of the experiment and before data analysis, we applied additional pre-established exclusion criteria. We excluded participants with less than 10 valid trials per experimental condition (congruency x ∆P x Reaction time (median split)) for the behavioural analyses, and 20 trials for the EEG analyses. We also excluded participants for which the price difference (∆P) was significantly different between the congruent and incongruent conditions to have balanced conditions. Finally, we removed participants for whom the proportion of correct trials was not significantly higher than chance.</p><p>According to the pre-registration, recruitment continued until the completion of a sample size of 30 valid datasets (30 meeting the behavioural performance and EEG criteria, and 1 meeting only the behavioural criteria </p></div>

The online reference was placed on the right mastoid and the ground electrode on AFz.

We first removed excessively noisy and faulty electrodes (1 electrode was removed for 6 participants and 2 electrodes were removed for 3 participants). Data was segmented in trials starting at fixation onset and ending 500ms after the stimuli disappearance and filtered using a dual-pass Butterworth filter with a passband of 0.1-50Hz (order 2) and a notch filter of 50Hz. Overlaps in the data were then removed to apply an independent component analysis (ICA). Using components head maps and spectral components, one to two independents component were manually removed per participant (mean: 1.17), corresponding to blinks and horizontal eye movements.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p>Behavioural data was analysed using R and MATLAB. To use consistent statistical approaches for behavioural and neural data we chose to use mixed effect models (MEM). The significance of each factor or interaction of interest predicting accuracy, RT and MFT power was evaluated using forward model selections based on likelihood tests ratio and all steps are reported (see <ref type="table">Tables S2 to S7</ref>). When outliers were detected (more than 1.5 interquartile range <ref type="bibr">[IQR]</ref> away from the distribution mean), correlations were run both including and excluding the outliers. Multiple comparisons were always corrected using the Bonferroni method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice behavioural analysis</head><p>Accuracy, defined as the probability to select the cheapest item, was analysed using generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) while reaction time (RT) was logtransformed and analysed using linear mixed-effect models (LMM).

As expected, we did not find significant interactions between congruency conditions and price difference (∆P). To further assess if this negative result could be due to a lack a power, we ran a posteriori sensitivity analyses to estimate the minimum effect size that could have been detected with powers of at least 80 and 95% using the R package simr <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EEG Time-Frequency Analysis</head><p>As we found differences in response speed between experimental conditions, we analysed the EEG data response locked (as mentioned in the pre-registration). The EEG analysis focused on oscillatory activity in the theta range (4-7Hz), therefore, to get a reliable estimate of theta power, we used a sliding window of 500ms on our defined epoch. Time frequency analysis was performed using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) in steps of 20ms with a single tapper (Hanning). Missed trials (no response) and trials with a RT inferior to 500ms were excluded from the analysis leaving on average (±s.d.) 92.1±6.8% of the included trials. Before analysing, we applied the spherical splines method <ref type="bibr">(Perrin et al., 1989)</ref> to increase spatial resolution. For completeness, time-frequency analysis of MFT stimulus-locked is briefly presented in the supplementary results ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single Trial EEG Analysis</head><p>Based on the time frequency analyses of congruent and incongruent trials, we defined a 500ms window of interest from -450 to 50ms relative to the response. The effect of the experimental conditions (congruency and price difference) on mid-frontal theta (MFT) power were tested using LMM with subjects as random intercepts. MFT power has previously been found to correlate with response time and performance accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cohen &amp; Donner, 2013)</ref>. To explore these relations, we tested the significance of MFT as a predictor of accuracy and RT using GLMM (binomial) and LMM respectively, both with subjects as random intercepts and slopes.</p></div>

Beta oscillations were averaged over the electrodes C1, C3, C5, CP3, FC3 (left) and C2, C4, C6, CP4, FC4 (right) and contrasted as a function of response side (contralateral minus ipsilateral to response hand). Beta oscillations were estimated using a similar approach as for MFT oscillations. LRP was calculated as the difference between the ipsilateral vs. contralateral activity of electrodes C3 (left) and C4 (right) and an additional Butterworth lowpass filter at 4Hz was applied prior to analyses. Both correlates were analysed stimulus and response-locked, and baselined with the 500ms time window prior to stimulus onset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modelling the response behaviour</head><p>We modelled participants reaction time (RT) and accuracy at the binary choice task using drift-diffusion models (DDM). The DDM assumes that decisions are made through a noisy process that continuously accumulates evidence over time, represented by a decision variable until it reaches one of the two decision boundaries (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). These boundaries correspond to the amount of evidence required to make a decision. In an unbiased choice, the starting point of the accumulation process is situated at the midpoint of the two bounds. The drift rate in the DDM represents the strength or quality of the evidence supporting each decision alternative. It determines the direction and speed at which evidence accumulates over time. Higher drift rates indicate faster and more accurate decision-making, while lower drift rates indicate slower and less accurate decision-making. The choice reaction time is set to be the sum of the decision time formalised in the DDM process, and a non-decision time, which accounts for afferent and efferent delays unrelated to the decision itself, such as stimulus encoding, motor preparation, or response execution. Lastly, the DDM incorporates the amount of noise or random variability in the evidence accumulation process. It is modelled here as a Wiener process (i.e., a sample from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1). The parameters of the fitted models are summarised in Table 1. and described in more detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modelling urgency</head><p>We observed in our data that slower choices are not necessary associated with higher accuracy, suggesting the presence of an urgency signal. These results are not surprising, given the time pressure imposed by the short response deadline (one second). To capture this urgency signal, we employed a linear "gain function", that uniformly scales both evidence and noise uniformly throughout the course of the trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cisek et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ditterich, 2006)</ref>. We also attempted to model the urgency signal using "collapsing bounds", where the decision bounds decayed linearly or exponentially with time. This manipulation causes the decision bounds to become more permissive as the trial progresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Drugowitsch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Shinn, Ehrlich, et al., 2020)</ref>. We found that our data was better fitted (measured using Bayesian Information Criterion -BIC) using a linear gain function compared to collapsing bounds. As a result, we report only models that include an urgency signal modelled as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x, x 0 μ u(t)</formula><p>where represents the urgency at time , and the slope of the linear ramp in gain function with time . The bounds are constant over time and fixed at .

We observed that using a gaussian distribution of the non-decision time was predicting the data the best.</p><p>where the non-decision time is drawn from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation . Additionally, in order to be able to predict contaminant responses (for example, very fast responses), we implemented a mixture model where the probability of a lapse trial is drawn from a uniform distribution .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modelling value biases</head><p>We observed that participants preference for one of the two presented items biased both their reaction times and responses accuracy. The effect on RT was consistent and resulted in preferred items (higher estimated value of the pair) being chosen faster than the non-preferred</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u(t) = σ 0 + s u • t σ 0 t = 0 s u t B(t) = 1 t nd~N( m nd , σ nd) t nd m nd σ nd p L U( . 001, . 2)</formula><p>ones, both for correct and incorrect choices. The effect of value on choice accuracy was less consistent as it varied with participants RT. Overall, we observed higher accuracy for congruent trials, where the correct alternative was also the preferred one, compared to incongruent trials for the faster responses (median split on the RT), while the opposite was true for slower responses. To model such effects, we started by implementing simple biases affecting the accumulation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Starting point bias</head><p>First, we introduced a starting point bias which bias the initial point of the accumulation process towards one of the alternatives; the preferred one (correct response in congruent trial, or incorrect response in incongruent trials) or the non-preferred one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The initial point of the decision variable is biased symmetrically in congruent ( ) and incongruent trials (</head><p>).

However, in our task, the rewardresponse contingencies (position of the preferred alternative) are not known before the stimuli onset which differ from previous studies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drift rate bias</head><p>As a result, we introduced an additional drift rate biased toward either the preferred or the non-preferred alternative . Similar to the starting point bias, the drift rate is biased symmetrically in congruent ( ) and incongruent trials ( ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modelling errors</head><p>We observe that models were predicting a probability of correct choices superior to the one observed in the data, for both congruent and incongruent trials, so we intended to lower the predicted accuracy using two mechanisms. First, we considered the possibility that participants do not integrate the evidence perfectly over time by introducing a leak term <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cisek et al., 2009)</ref>. We observed that this leak term could not explain the probability of errors observed in the data.</p><p>Secondly, we considered a mechanism unrelated to the integration process which traduces an error in mapping between the evidence accumulation and the generation of the motor response <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Shinn, Ehrlich, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hanks et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Erlich et al., 2015)</ref>. We modelled this mapping error to occur, with a certain probability , once the decision variable had reached the bound associated with the correct, cheapest alternative, and to bias participants to mistakenly generate a motor response towards the incorrect, more expensive alternative instead. This mapping error was implemented by modifying the simulated distribution of reaction times. For a simulated probability density function , where is the response accuracy; correct or incorrect, we computed the final density using , calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">dx = μ • ∆ P • u(t) • dt + u(t) • dW + (d B • C )/(t + 1) • dt dx = μ • ∆ P • u(t) • dt + u(t) • dW + (d B • C − t) • dt dx = μ • ∆ P • u(t) • dt + u(t) • dW− d B • C • t • dt C = 1 C = 0 dx = μ • ∆ P • u(t) • dt + u(t) • dW− d B • C + • t • dt p map f (x R) R f′ (x) f′ (x) f′ (x R = er r) = f (x R = er r) + p map f (x R = cor r) f′ (x R = cor r) = (1 − p map ) f (x R = cor r)</formula><p>We thought that, due to the strict response deadline imposed to participant, such error in mapping could be plausible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fitting</head><p>Fitting the model to the data and simulations were performed using the PyDDM package in Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Shinn, Lam, et al., 2020)</ref> with a time step of 5 ms and decision variable discretization of 0.005. The python code and notations of the different model parameters used were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Shinn, Ehrlich, et al., 2020)</ref>. The data was fitted for each participant individually and separately for trials carrying a congruency component (large ∆V, congruent and incongruent trials) and no congruency (small ∆V). Such distinction was made first to understand the mechanisms underlying the value-biases observed and, seeing the difficulties encountered to reproduce our data (see Results), to see whether trials a priori not biased by value could be explained using the DDM. Goodness of fits were estimated using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the best predicting model was assessed by comparing the averaged BIC over the participants. All models had at least 6 free parameters: a drift rate , two urgency-related parameters and , two parameters related to the non-decision time and , and predicting the rate of lapse trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimated prices and preferences</head><p>First, we assessed the quality of participants' price estimations by examining the correlation with actual supermarket prices for all participants (Kendall's correlations, all ). Regarding value ratings, they were predominantly positive (80.4%) and we observed that for approximately half of participants value ratings were positively correlated with price estimations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2A</ref>). For these participants, then, there was a preference for more expensive items: the preference-for-expensive bias. However, except for two participants, we didn't find any correlation between the error in price estimation and subjective value ratings ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>) suggesting that participants do not systematically over or underestimate the items they like and are able to give objective estimations of the items' prices. The preference-forexpensive bias was anticipated (see pre-registration). Indeed, the association between the price of goods and their perceived quality is well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Rao &amp; Monroe, 1989)</ref>, providing a potential explanation for the observed phenomenon. For instance, studies have demonstrated that elevating the price of a wine is linked to heightened subjective reports of pleasantness <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Plassmann et al., 2008)</ref>. Hence, the preference-for-expensive bias potentially exists within all individuals; however, within the context of our subset of edible items, it becomes statistically evident only among a specific subgroup of participants. Here we assumed that, if this bias has any impact, it would be in the opposite direction of the congruency bias of interest in our study. That is, the congruency bias of interest would make participants chose preferred items more often and rapidly, whilst in our dataset participants who tend to prefer more expensive items should in fact be more inclined to show the opposite bias. Indeed, they should tend to direct their choice toward the usually cheaper, non-preferred item, thus excluding the possibility of a confound leading to a false positive. </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">μ σ 0 s u m nd σ nd p L p &lt; . 001</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective preference exerts a bias on objective choice behaviour</head><p>Choice accuracy in the main task was analysed using generalized mixed effect models (GLMM), with subjects as a random variable (see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>). Model selection revealed a significant effect of congruency between value and price (model ), with congruent trials being more accurate than both incongruent and no-congruency trials (see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> for statistics). A main effect of price difference was also found (model ) with accuracy increasing with ∆P, and a main effect of RT (model ) with longer RTs being associated with lower accuracy. No significant interaction was found between price difference and congruency (model , <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2A</ref>) suggesting, as anticipated, that the observed congruency effect is due to an early automatic influence of value preceding a voluntary choice strategy. To further assess the absence of interaction, we run sensitivity analyses estimating the minimum effect sizes that could have been detected between the congruency conditions (here C+ or C-only) and ∆P. We found that effects of ±.15 and ±.18 could have been detected with powers of 87.33% (95%CI = [80.9, 92.2]) and 98.7% (95%CI = [95.3, 99.8]) respectively. In comparison, the interaction between congruency and RT revealed a fixed effect of .46. Therefore, if the congruency effect in choice behaviour were a deliberate strategy, one would anticipate its strength to diminish with ∆P. If such reduction exists, it seems to be relatively minor, as it would have been otherwise detected in our experiment. Finally, as previously reported in the literature, a significant interaction between congruency and RT was found (model ). The interaction can be explained by the following patterns. First, accuracy decreases with increasing RT, and this decrease is more pronounced for congruent trials compared to both incongruent and no-congruency trials, and for no-congruency trials compared to incongruent trials <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>). Second, the magnitude of the congruency effect is larger for faster RTs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A)</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 V = 385, p adj = . 012</formula><p>Koechlin, 2010; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Noorbaloochi et al., 2015)</ref>. However, in our data we additionally observed a complete reversal of the congruence effect at longer RTs, with congruent trials which tended to be responded to less accurately than incongruent trials ( , Cohen's d [95% CI] = -.56 <ref type="bibr">[-1.05, -.05]</ref>). This effect was not expected and is discussed in the next section. Log-transformed RTs were analysed with linear mixed-effect models (LMM) including both correct and incorrect trials to gauge the potential interaction between accuracy and congruency <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Noorbaloochi et al., 2015</ref>). Indeed, model selection revealed this interaction as significant <ref type="table">(Table S4 -</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref> and <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>). Overall, this pattern reflects that when participants chose faster, they tended to choose the item they preferred. Again, we did not find any interaction between congruency and price difference (model , <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2B</ref>), nor a 3-way interaction with accuracy (model ). However, as expected, we found a significant overall effect of price difference on RTs <ref type="table">(Table S4</ref> -model ), with participants responding faster to trials with larger ∆P. In accordance with the effect of price difference found on accuracy, these results suggest that price difference between the two alternatives modulates difficulty; the larger ∆P the easier the trial (leading to more accurate and faster responses). Mirroring our approach with accuracy, we performed an a posteriori sensitivity analysis to estimate the minimum detectable interaction between congruency (C+ and C-only) and ∆P. .4]) respectively. In comparison, the interaction between congruency and response accuracy demonstrated a fixed effect of .065. Therefore, results show that if the influence of subjective value on RT is indeed modulated by ∆P, it appears to be relatively modest in magnitude, as a more substantial effect would likely have been detected. Together with the analyses of response accuracy, these findings suggest that the items' value has an automatic effect on choice behaviour, seemingly independently of the amount of task-relevant evidence available.</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether the influence of preferences on both response choices and response times was modulated by participants experience at the task. Accuracy was analysed using a GLMM, incorporating congruency, response time (median split), and time-on-task (run 1 through to 16, corresponding to the sixteen presented shopping carts) as factors ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  S3A</ref>). We observed a significant main effect of time-on-task, indicating that participants became more accurate as the experiment progressed ( ). Additionally, a significant interaction between congruency and time-on-task was observed ( ), indicating a stronger improvement in accuracy for incongruent trials compared to congruent trials resulting in choices being less biased by value as time unfolded in the experiment. Regarding response times, we employed the same methodology and used mixed-effects models to examine the relationship between response time, and congruency, response accuracy, and time-on-task ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S3B</ref>). The results revealed a decrease in response time with time-on-task ( ). However, contrary to the findings in accuracy, no interaction between congruency and time-on-task was observed (</p><p>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that participants became both more accurate and faster as they progressed through the task. They indicate that while value biases in response time persist throughout the experiment, the tendency to quickly select the preferred alternative diminishes over time, and that when responding slower, the inclination to select the least preferred alternative more frequently increases with time-on-task. These results suggest that subjective value biases in response choices are dependent on participants' familiarity with the task, whereas the value biases observed in response times likely rely on more automatic mechanisms and remain unchanged regardless of participants' experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The interaction between subjective value and price is a source of choice behaviour variability</head><p>Overall, the results so far suggest that fast decision-making is biased by the automatic integration of task-irrelevant value-based preferences, resulting in more frequent selection of preferred items regardless of the magnitude of the objective task-relevant evidence (∆P). However, an apparently atypical finding was that, for slower choices, accuracy in congruent trials was lower than in incongruent trials. We hypothesised that this unexpected effect might be a consequence of the positive correlation between price and preference, significant for 15 out of 31 participants in our dataset <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2A</ref>). For this group of participants, preferred items are consistently associated with higher prices and therefore to the incorrect response in congruent trials. This association may have induced a response adaptation during the experiment that influenced a choice strategy in favour of the non-preferred option, since in their case it is, more frequently than not, the correct answer. To support this account, we χ 2 1 = 31.61, p = 1.88 × 10 −8 χ 2 1 = 9.21, p = . 0024</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">χ 2 1 = 300.38, p &lt; 2 × 10 −16</formula><p>χ 2 1 = . 016, p = . 90 conducted exploratory analyses. First, we ran correlation tests between participants' accuracy and the magnitude of their individual price-preference correlation coefficient. This correlation tests were run for each congruency condition separately. If the account above is correct, the error rates on congruent trials should scale with the participants' price-preference correlation strength. Indeed, we observed a significant negative correlation between accuracy and individual price-preference correlation strength, only within congruent trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>, Pearson, ; incongruent trials, Spearman, ).</p><p>Additionally, we re-run the initial analyses on accuracy and RTs separately for those participants that showed a significant preference-for-expensive bias and those that did not (threshold p=.05, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4B</ref>). For the latter group (no positive preference-price correlation), we observed a significant effect of congruency within faster trials ( ) and not on slow responses ( ), which was in principle the expected pattern. However, and confirming our post-hoc explanation, for the group with a significant positive price-preference correlation we found an overall bias toward the non-preferred items, leading to lack of congruence effect for fast responses ( ) and the atypical reversal of the congruence effect in slower trials ( ). Therefore, the pattern of congruency effects observed is, at least in part, modulated by participants' strength of association between subjective value (preference) and price: in participants with a strong positive association, their behaviour is biased towards choosing the least preferred but, consistent with their prior, most likely cheaper (correct) option. We further investigated whether the strategy to choose the non-preferred item is evident right from the outset of the experiment or whether it develops gradually as participants become familiar with the task. Employing similar analyses to those presented earlier (refers to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  S3A</ref>), we modelled accuracy based on several factors: time-on-task (runs), congruency (C+, r = − . 50, p = . 005 r = . 03, p = . 88</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V 16 = 8, p adj = . 003 V 16 = 65, p adj = 1 V 15 = 55, p adj = 1 V 15 = 106, p adj = . 027</formula><p>C-), and choice reaction time (median split on RT). However, in this instance, we introduced an additional factor to account for participants' preference-for-expensive biases (whether significant or not) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S4</ref>). The results revealed a three-way interaction involving the presence of the preference-for-expensive bias, time-on-task, and congruency ( ). Post-hoc analyses unveiled a significant interaction between congruency and time-on-task among participants displaying a preference-for-expensive bias ( ), while no such interaction was observed among the remaining participants ( ). These outcomes suggest that the observed reduction in participants' inclination to rapidly choose the preferred alternative (as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S3A</ref>) appears to stem from the existence, within a subset of participants, of a positive correlation between the estimated values of items and their prices. For these individuals, accuracy in congruent choices does not experience improvement as the task is carried out. This phenomenon may arise due to an adaptive mechanism that builds upon participants' prior expectation that the preferred items are generally more expensive. Conversely, participants who do not exhibit the preference-for-expensive bias witness an enhancement in accuracy for both congruent and incongruent trials over time, thus maintaining the unaltered impact of value on faster choices throughout the course of the task.</p><p>Lastly, based on previous literature predicting that prior expectation about stimulus probability has larger effect when the signal-to-noise ratio is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bogacz et al., 2006)</ref>, we specifically tested whether the higher accuracy observed for incongruent compared to congruent trials was modulated by the task-relevant evidence (∆P), in slower choices and for participants with a significant preference-for-expensive bias. No interaction between ∆P and congruency was found (</p><p>).</p><p>Contrary to participants' choices, response times were not related with individual correlations between estimated prices and preferences (Pearson's correlations, C-: ; C+: ), neither the magnitude of the congruency effect on RT ( ), implying that RT are less sensible to participants priors than choices. These findings suggest that, although value may exert an automatic influence on choice behaviour that manifests as a consistent effect on RT, the preference-for-expensive bias might impact participants' decision-making process in a more deliberate manner, but still independently of the choice difficulty. This controlled influence could potentially account for the bias's exclusive impact on response choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increased mid-frontal theta oscillations for conflictual subjective value and price.</head><p>We have demonstrated that, consistently with predictions, preferences affect participants' fast choices and RT, and this effect is independent on the amount of goal-relevant (price difference) information present. This suggests that value-based evidence kicks in early and possibly automatically, while the integration of objective task-relevant evidence (price) unfolds more slowly. We assume that the initial integration of value-based information is triggered by the VBS. In incongruent trials, later-arriving objective evidence about the correct choice contradicts the choice supported by subjective value. We hypothesised that this conflicting situation in incongruent trials would engage conflict-processing brain mechanisms, indexed via the amplitude of mid-frontal theta (MFT) oscillations in our experiment. To test this hypothesis, we analysed MFT power in a time window from 1200ms χ 2 1 = 17.84, p = 2.41 × 10 −5 χ 2 1 = 13.10, p = 2.96 × 10 −4 χ 2 1 = . 001, p = . 97 χ 2 1 = 1.29 p = . 26 r = . 23, p = . 23 r = . 33, p = . 075 r = . 30, p = . 11 before stimulus onset until 500ms after the response ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5)</ref>. Overall, we observed a significant MFT increase after stimulus onset, and in each experimental condition separately (all ). Firstly, we investigated whether the magnitude of this MFT increase is larger for price-preference incongruence, our principal question. As congruent and incongruent trials are characterised by different mean reaction times, we ran a time-resolved responselocked analysis (-1200 to 500ms, where t=0 is the response) for MFT power differences across congruency conditions (for completeness, stimulus-locked time-frequency analyses are reported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S5</ref>). We found significantly higher MFT activity for incongruent compared to congruent trials during a 160ms window (-280 to -120ms) before response ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5B</ref>, one-tail t-tests with Monte-Carlo multiple comparisons correction,</p><p>). We selected a window of 500ms centred around the peak of this significant difference to analyse MFT on a trial-by-trial basis using linear mixed effect models. Model selection revealed a significant effect of congruency <ref type="table">(Table S6</ref>, model ), with higher MFT power for incongruent compared to congruent trials <ref type="table">(Table S7</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5C</ref>  &lt;.05) around which an analysis window was selected (grey shaded area: -450 to 50ms relative to response). The topographic head map represents the difference in theta power between incongruent and congruent trials over this analysis window. C. Average theta power predicted <ref type="table">(Table S6 -</ref> As we have shown that the presence of the preference-for-expensive bias modulated the congruency effect observed on behaviour (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4)</ref>, we addressed whether such bias also influenced the MFT (-450 to 50 relative to response) differently in congruent and incongruent trials. We conducted exploratory analyses and observed that participants' mean MFT activity was not affected by the magnitude of the preference-for-expensive bias (correlation coefficients between estimated prices and preferences) in either congruency condition (Spearman's, C-:</p><p>; C+: ; : ).</p><p>Additionally, even though we found that MFT power is significantly higher in incongruent compared to congruent trials only for participants not showing a significant preference-forexpensive bias ( ; significant bias: , similar results p &lt; . 001 t = 17.56, p = . 047</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">m 1 p adj m 1 p adj r = − . 17, p = .</formula><p>38 r = − . 17, p = . 37 C 0 r = − . 17, p = . 38 t 14 = 2.31, p = . 037 t 14 = 1, p = . 34</p><p>found with the time-frequency analysis in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure S6A-B)</ref>, the magnitude of this difference did not correlate with the bias magnitude ( , <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure S6C</ref>). These findings indicate that the preference-for-expensive bias had minimal or no influence on the extent of conflict-related MFT. While additional data is required to establish this potential interaction with greater certainty, the analyses presented in the subsequent section suggest that the preference-for-expensive bias affects the way MFT is relayed and impacts subsequent choice behaviour, rather than directly influencing the strength of MFT activity itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mid-frontal theta oscillations account for individual variability in conflict detection.</head><p>Subsequently, we investigated whether the magnitude of MFT power estimated from the relevant 500ms time window (centred around the peak of the congruency effect), is associated with behaviour. Initially, we employed mixed effects models with MFT power as a single predictor, to explore its relationship with RT and accuracy in each congruency condition separately, allowing both the MFT power estimate and the intercept to vary for each subject. As previously, RT was log-transformed and fitted using a linear model while accuracy was fitted using a binomial logistic regression. Consistent with previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cohen &amp; Donner, 2013)</ref>, we found MFT power to be a positive predictor of RT in all congruency conditions (C+:</p><p>; C-: ; ), and the strength of this relation did not significantly differ between conditions ( ).</p><p>MFT activity was a significant predictor of the response slowing observed in correct incongruent trials compared to congruent ones ( ), a behavioural effect which was consistent across participants ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>) and which was not modulated by individual preferences for expensive items, as opposed to subjective value biases observed on accuracy ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A-B)</ref>. Additionally, the magnitude of the congruency effect on MFT (difference between C-and C+) did not correlate with individual preference-for-expensive biases ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure S6C</ref>). These results reveal that MFT sensitive to the value-price conflict is not correlated with behavioural biases triggered by participants preferences. In other words, the measured MFT may reflect the detection of conflict but not necessarily its resolution.</p><p>Regarding accuracy, we found that theta power was only a significant positive predictor of response accuracy in incongruent trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6A, C+:</ref> ; C-: ; ), with individual estimates being significantly higher compared to those for congruent trials ( ) and for nocongruency trials ( ). The difference between congruent and no-congruency trials was not significant ( ). Together, these results suggest that higher cognitive control, as expressed through higher MFT power, is required to respond correctly in incongruent trials specifically. This confirms our hypothesis that, in incongruent trials, the competition between price and value-based evidence triggers a conflict (and possibly the ensuing mechanisms for its resolution). We assume then that the strength of the association between MFT and accuracy may serve as a proxy to investigate the presence of a conflict at the individual level and to understand sources of variability observed in the behavioural results. The next sections present the corresponding analyses. r = . 066, p = . 73 t = 4.47, p = 1.34 × 10 −4 t = 6.88, p = 4.12 × 10 −7 C 0 : t = 4.47, p = 1.34 × 10 −4 F 2 = 1.11, p = . 33 r = − . 42, p = . 02 z = . 07, p = . 95 z = 2.28, p = . 022 C 0 : z = . 60, p = . 55 t 29 = − 4.46, p adj = 3.42 × 10 −4 t 29 = − 4.75, p adj = 1.53 × 10 −4 t 29 = − 1.69, p adj = . 30</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual analysis of MFT and accuracy: Congruent trials</head><p>We started by looking at whether the individual's strength of the price-preference bias would be correlated with MTF in congruent trials. Please remind that we hypothesised that subjects with a strong (i.e., significant) price-preference correlation would require more control precisely in congruent trials. This was the post-hoc explanation of the atypical reversal in the behavioural congruency effect in these participants, given that the strategic prior to choose the non-preferred item would have to be countermanded. In line with this, we observed that in individuals whose accuracy is strongly associated with higher theta power in congruent trials, the more likely this person is to show the reversed congruency effect in behaviour ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6B -left, Pearson,  )</ref>. Additionally, consistent with this explanation, individual MFT estimates in congruent trials were also positively correlated with individual correlation coefficients between preference and price ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6C -left,</ref> ). This reinforces the idea that for participants who usually prefer more expensive items, congruent trials required the need to regulate a conflict between a strategic prior (choose the non-preferred item) and the correct response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual analysis of MFT and accuracy: Incongruent trials</head><p>Turning now to incongruent choices, please note that, MFT significantly predicted accuracy at the group level in incongruent trials, thus in principle suggesting that conflict detection and/or control facilitated correct responses. When unpacking this effect at the individual level, we observed that the stronger the behaviour was biased toward the preferred item overall, the better MFT power in that participant predicted accuracy ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6B -right,</ref> ). This is in line with our hypothesis that incongruent trials induce a stronger conflict, resulting in behavioural consequences and leading to the engagement of conflict-related brain mechanisms to overcome it. Furthermore, in contrast to congruent trials, no significant relation between theta estimates and the strengths of correlations between estimated price and preferences was found ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6C -right,</ref> ), suggesting that the prior toward responding with the non-preferred item (in a subgroup of participants) did not need to be controlled in these incongruent trials, and only the conflict elicited by the competition between price and value-based information was relevant. r = − . 80, p = 1.37 × 10 −7 r = − . 51, p = . 004 r = . 68, p = 3.80 × 10 −5 r = − . 16, p = . 21</p><p>Although, we only observed a small effect of congruency on the MFT power overall, we were able to demonstrate the strong relationship between theta oscillations and choice conflict at individual level <ref type="bibr">(Pinner &amp; Cavanagh, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, in multitasking situations, higher theta has been found to be associated with lower performance, suggesting that MFT power is a proxy to assess individuals' cognitive workload <ref type="bibr">(Puma et al., 2018)</ref>. In our study, we found higher MFT to be associated with better performance in incongruent trials (Spearman, ; without outliers: ) but not in congruent trials (Spearman, ; without outlier:</p><p>), suggesting that frontal theta reflects here the need for cognitive control and not the workload per se.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual analysis of MFT and accuracy: No-congruency trials</head><p>For completeness, similar analyses were conducted on trials without a congruency component, where both items are similarly valued. As previously reported, theta power did not emerge as a significant predictor of accuracy, and individual theta estimates exhibited no correlation with either the congruency effect on accuracy ( ) or the strength of the preference-for-expensive bias (</p><p>). These results further emphasize the specific influence of the preference-for-expensive bias on conflict monitoring and choice behaviour when a preferred alternative is present.</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether the distinct evolution of accuracy over time, contingent upon the presence of a preference-for-expensive bias (as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S3</ref>), could be correlated with specific changes observed in MFT activity. We employed a LMM to predict MFT power as a function of time-on-task (run), congruency (C+ or C-), and the preferencefor-expensive bias (significant or not) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure S7</ref>). We found a reduction of MFT activity ( -4 5 0 t o 5 0 m s r e l a t i v e t o t h e r e s p o n s e ) w i t h t h e t i m e s p e n t o n t a s k ( ), mirroring prior reports in studies examining task-related MFT activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnau et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beldzik et al., 2022)</ref>. This effect could be attributed to learning and short-term task automatization accompanied by a reduction in high-level cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Mohr et al., 2016)</ref>. Interestingly, we also found a tendency for a three-way interaction between time-on task, congruency and the presence of the preference-forexpensive bias ( ). Subsequent post-hoc analyses revealed a significant interaction between time-on-task and congruency for participants not exhibiting the preference-for-expensive bias ( ), wherein MFT decreased throughout the experiment in congruent choices, while it increased for incongruent choices. MFT activity has indeed been found to ramp up with mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Tran et al., 2020)</ref>, and this increase might be due to heightened cognitive exertion as participants strive to uphold task performance in the face of the price-value conflict. Conversely, no significant interaction emerged for participants with a preference-for-expensive bias ( ), which could potentially explain the growing influence of their prior biases on their choices, prompting them to opt for the least preferred items more frequently than the preferred ones. Such adaptive behaviour might be favoured as cognitively less demanding. r = . 53, p = . 003 r = . 60, p = . 001 r = . 28, p = . 13 r = . 23, p = . 22 r = − . 17, p = . 38 r = . 20, p = . 30 χ 2 1 = 12.94, p = 3.21 × 10 −4 χ 2 1 = 2.74, p = . 098 χ 2 1 = 7.35, p = . 0067 χ 2 1 = . 17, p = . 68</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The relation between price difference and theta reflects trial importance</head><p>The analyses of behavioural responses presented earlier pointed out that price difference modulates trial difficulty, with trials with large ∆P leading to faster and more accurate responses (hence, we can assume, easier). Importantly, the ∆P effect occurred across the board, regardless of congruency. An effect of price difference was also found on MFT power using LMM <ref type="table">(Table S6</ref>, model ) and time-frequency analysis, which revealed a higher theta power for trials with a large ∆P (2 to 3 euros) compared to trials with a small ∆P (0 to 1 euro) from 280 until 20ms before response <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 7,</ref> ). around which an analysis window was selected (grey shaded area: -450 to 50ms relative to response). The topographic head map represents the difference in theta power between trials with small and large ∆P over this analysis window. C. Average theta power predicted <ref type="table">(Table S6-</ref> These results may seem counter intuitive, as theta power is generally found to increase with trial difficulty (e.g., with working memory load, Maurer et al., 2015) and correlate positively with RT <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cohen &amp; Donner, 2013)</ref>. However, in our case, price difference is not solely a proxy for trial difficulty, but it also correlates with trial importance for the subject's outcomes. Indeed, on erroneous trials, the difference in price between the two items penalizes (is added to) the participants' shopping cart. Consequently, while incorrect responses in trials with a small ∆P (a few cents) has little consequence on participants scores, errors in trials with large ∆P (a couple of euros or more) are greatly penalized. In previous literature, higher activity in the dACC has been associated with higher required effort but also with associated expectation of higher rewards or losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Vassena et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Shenhav et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Safavi &amp; Dayan, 2022)</ref>. In our case, these two features are conflated given that price difference correlates with both the difficulty (negatively) and trial importance (positively). We believe it is the greater losses associated with errors which could explain the larger theta activity observed with trials with large price differences.</p><p>In line with this hypothesis, we observed two main differences between the individual level of variations of MFT power with congruency conditions and with price difference. First, the congruency effect on accuracy (congruent more accurate than incongruent) tends to correlate m 2 t = 37.58, p = . 007</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">m 2</formula><p>with the congruency effect on MFT power (partial Pearson's correlation controlling for the preference-for-expensive bias as it strongly correlates with the congruency effect on accuracy ( ; without outliers: ): ; without outliers:</p><p>), while the variations of theta power with ∆P do not correlate with the effect of accuracy on ∆P (Spearman, ; without outliers: ). These results suggest that performance accuracy as a function of price difference does not rely on theta power, as it can be the case in congruency conditions where conflict monitoring is necessary to ensure correct responses ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6A)</ref>.</p><p>Secondly, we observed that the more the MFT activity increases post-stimulus presentation in general, the less it increases with price difference <ref type="bibr">(Pearson, ; without outliers: Spearman, )</ref>. This result may suggest individual differences in the cognitive workload of the task's objective difficulty (∆P, short response deadline). Interestingly, this pattern is not observed across the congruency conditions (Spearman, ; without outliers: Pearson, ) where MFT activity is overall found to be higher for incongruent compared to congruent trials regardless of individuals level of MFT power post-stimulus. It suggests that mid-frontal theta activity reflects mainly the conflict between price and value-based evidence and, when possible, it adapts to the magnitude of losses associated with potential errors in order to maximise performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mid-frontal theta oscillations as a mechanism of cognitive control for the interaction between subjective value and estimated price</head><p>We previously found a general increase in MFT power in incongruent trials, where subjective value and objective information about price are in conflict, compared to congruent trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>). To confirm the role of MFT as a common cognitive control mechanism, we sought to extend the results by looking at MFT activity following errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cavanagh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Van Driel et al., 2012)</ref>, and investigate how our experimental conditions may impact this effect. We analysed MFT activity in the 500ms window following responses, baselined with the 500ms window preceding stimulus onset, as a function of response accuracy (correct or incorrect), price difference, and congruency ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8A</ref>). Using a LMM including these factors as fixed effects and subjects as random factor, we found a significant effect of response accuracy ( ) on post-response MFT with theta power being higher after errors. This replicates typical post-error Theta increase findings. We also found an interaction between ∆P and response accuracy ( ) with error-related theta (difference between MFT post-errors and post-correct responses) increasing with ∆P. In previous literature, increased MFT activity has been found for aware compared to unaware errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wang et al., 2020)</ref> and for errors associated with greater losses . Here, incorrect responses in trials with larger ∆P are both more penalised (the price difference is added to participants' shopping cart) but probably also more detectable, which makes it difficult to disentangle these two sources.</p><p>A well-known post-error behaviour adjustment consists of slowing down the decision responses in the trial following an incorrect response (post-error slowing; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Botvinick et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Dutilh et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Rabbitt, 1966)</ref>.

What is more, we found an interaction of the post-error slowing with ∆P (LMEM, , <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8B</ref>) showing that response times are significantly slower following incorrect responses in trials with larger ∆P. Congruency did not interact with the amplitude of post-error slowing ( ). To test for the potential link between post-error slowing and post-error MFT increase, we used LMM to predict RTs based on the previous trial's MFT activity post-response and the response accuracy of the current trial. We found a significant interaction between these two factors ( ). Consistent with previous literature (see metaanalysis: <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cavanagh &amp; Shackman, 2015)</ref> and with our expectation, post-error MFT significantly predicted the next trial RT ( ) but not MFT activity after correct responses ( ), pointing out the role of MFT as a proxy for control after committing errors. However, post-error MFT amplitude did not predict accuracy in the subsequent trial ( ). Additionally, MFT amplitude post-response was not affected by the current trial RT ( ), as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beldzik et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, turning again to individual-level analysis, the amplitude of error-related MFT did not correlate with performance in general at individual level <ref type="figure">(Pearson's,</ref> ). However post-error slowing did <ref type="bibr">(Pearson's, )</ref>, with participants who slowed down more after incorrect responses being also more accurate overall.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Value biased conflict is not reflected in the motor-related activity</head><p>So far, we have interpreted the behavioural and EEG correlates for conflict as reflecting computations related to the decision process. However, one could assume that similar motorrelated conflict regarding which response to effect, could have produced our results. In fact, decision-making processes and motor actions are not clear separable processes, since recent evidence points towards a parallel perspective of information processing where decision and action may coexist and interact. This notion is supported by evidence that choice action is frequently initiated before the completion of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cisek &amp; Kalaska, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">McKinstry et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Ozbagci et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Resulaj et al., 2009)</ref>. In this context, we do not aim to disentangle stimulus-related conflicts from motor-related conflicts. Instead, we focused on determining whether EEG correlates pertaining to motor preparation in the context of decision making reveal the presence of motor-related conflicts. To do so, we analysed neural corelates of motor activation through beta-band oscillations (13-30Hz, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure  S8</ref>) in parietal aeras and the lateralized readiness potential (LRP, <ref type="figure">Figure S9)</ref>. Differences in the timing of motor activation between congruent and incongruent trials was not detected in beta but was detected in the LRP, with congruent trial latencies being shorter than incongruent trials.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The drift diffusion model fails to reproduce participants' choice behaviour</head><p>The drift diffusion model (DDM) is a powerful framework to model binary choices. In the value-biased decision-making literature, it has shown to reproduce human and animal behaviour by introducing different types of reward biased mechanisms. In order to provide better generalization of our findings, we intended to model participants' choice behaviour in our price minimisation task using a simple DDM comprising six free parameters <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). These parameters encompassed non-decision time, which was Gaussian-distributed with a specified mean ( ) and standard deviation ( ). The simple model further included a drift rate ( ) governing the accumulation of evidence, and a lapse trial rate ( ) introduced to account for odd trials, such as when responses were very fast and appeared unrelated to the presented stimuli. We also included an urgency signal, given the time pressure of the task. This urgency signal was modelled as a linear gain function characterized by an intercept and a slope .</p><p>In addition, we modelled the value bias observed in both accuracy and RT by incorporating mechanisms impacting the evidence accumulation process through shifts in starting point or drift rate. We also introduced mechanisms which are independent of the information integration, such as errors in the mapping between the decision variable and the motor response (see Methods for more details). We observed that the model exhibiting the best fit (lowest BIC averaged across the participants, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table S8</ref>) was the one that encompassed a bias in the drift rate ( ). The distribution of fitted was found to be positive <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10B</ref>), suggesting that the accumulation of evidence in favour of the preferred, compared to the non-preferred item, occurs faster. This model additionally incorporated a non-zero probability for mapping errors to arise between the decision variable linked to the correct alternative and the motor output ( ). Introducing this mapping error possibility led to a modest reduction in the predicted accuracy, aligning it more closely with the observed accuracy. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Illustration of the drift diffusion model (DDM). Evidence is accumulated in the decision variable ( ) over time until it reaches one of the decision thresholds (boundaries ). Three simulated trajectories of the decision variable are depicted, with a drift rate , and a starting point .

The results show that the models overestimated the observed accuracy; in congruent trials, the slow errors, that may be related to the preference-for-expensive bias were not well predicted, while for incongruent trials, models failed to predict the fast errors caused by the selection of the preferred alternative ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10A</ref>).

These findings underscore the potential of the DDM to elucidate, albeit partially, the fundamental cognitive mechanisms underpinning the decisionmaking process at stake in this task. Specifically, while the preference-for-expensive bias appears to exert a relatively uniform impact across all choices, the cognitive conflict manifested through increased MFT may exhibit trial-specific variations, making it potentially more challenging to capture comprehensively within the framework of a classical DDM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, this study stands as the first demonstration of intrinsic value biases (preferences) on objective decisions in the absence of attentional anticipation or 1 motor preparation based on pre-set response-reward contingencies. Our results using food stimuli and their intrinsic subjective preferences, replicate the outcomes found in those other tasks; the preferred alternative was selected faster and more often in case of rapid responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Corbett et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Diederich, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Diederich &amp; Busemeyer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mulder et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Noorbaloochi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2010)</ref>. We found that the congruency effect between preference and choice-relevant information on RT was remarkably consistent across participants ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>) and over the duration of the task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure S2B</ref>), revealing that subjective value is able to bias online objective decisions, without the implication of prior expectations. Furthermore, the impact of the amount of goalrelevant evidence available on value biases has received limited attention in previous research and has yielded inconsistent findings. Some studies reported no discernible modulation of the biases driven by asymmetric payoffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Noorbaloochi et al., 2015)</ref>, while others noted an effect confined to accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Corbett et al., 2023)</ref>. In this study, we offer compelling evidence supporting the notion that value biases on decision behaviour remains unaltered by choice difficulty. This suggests that the impact of value on decision-making is rather automatic. Such proposition is supported by extant evidence which suggests the rapid and automatic encoding of value, even when it bears no relevance to the immediate task at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Lebreton et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Moneta et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, while standard conflict tasks reveal that goal-irrelevant visual attributes exert a diminishing influencing on decisions as trials progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Luo &amp; Proctor, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>, similar dynamics emerge in scenarios involving choices influenced by asymmetric reward with swift decisions, in particular, exhibiting a bias toward options linked to higher payoffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afacan-Seref et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Corbett et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Noorbaloochi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> ρ = − . 46, p = . 011 ρ = . 28, p = . 13</p><p>Errors in price estimations are not affected by participants preferences.</p><p>1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2010)</ref>. In this study, we successfully replicate these findings, further emphasizing the existence of a flexible mechanism redirecting resources away from preferred alternatives and toward task-relevant information. Our initial hypothesis postulated that cognitive control would assume this function, and our findings indeed support this premise. Specifically, incongruent trials characterized by value-price conflicts exhibited significantly greater MFT activity compared to congruent trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>). Subsequently, information concerning the items' prices is encoded, triggering an increase in MFT activity in incongruent trials. This heightened MFT activity is in response to the conflicting evidence arising from the disparity between subjective value and prices. MFT plays a role in redirecting the decision process towards the evidence that aligns with the task goal, thereby upholding task performance. Furthermore, the processed evidence is subjected to comparison with pre-existing prior beliefs. In scenarios where participants exhibit a significant preference-for-expensive bias <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>), the accumulated information about the items may clash with their pre-existing bias, particularly in congruent trials. This potential conflict between the newly acquired evidence and prior beliefs might be resolved through MFT signalling. Alternatively, participants' prior belief may favour the non-preferred items by directly influencing the decision process or via the disengagement of the conflict signalling network in incongruent trials. Notably, this alternate pathway appears to gain prominence as participants progress through the experiment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures S5 and S6</ref>).</p><p>As expected, we also found that MFT served as an overall positive predictor of accuracy in incongruent trials and that the strength of this relationship correlated with the degree of individual value biases in decision-making ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6A-B)</ref>. This finding aligns with prior research, underscoring the involvement of heightened cognitive control signalling to implement behavioural adjustment and enhance performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Cooper et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kerns et al., 2004)</ref>. What is more, while, at the group level, MFT activity was not associated to correct responses in congruent trials, suggesting no evident value-price conflict, it played a significant role for individuals exhibiting pronounced preferences for expensive items ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure  6</ref>). Once again, the strength of this relationship correlated with participants' tendencies to exhibit behavioural bias toward their non-preferred alternative and suggests the existence of a conflict between, on one hand, the subjective value and price of the stimulus, and on the other hand, individuals' pre-existing beliefs concerning these attributes. We posit that this conflict elucidates why participants with significant preference for expensive items did not manifest the anticipated accuracy effects in faster trials and even displayed opposite congruency effects in slower trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>). In these cases, their priors guided decisions away from the preferred item, which they usually associate as more expensive (and hence, incorrect, response).</p><p>As initially proposed in the original versions of the conflict monitoring theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Botvinick et al., 2001)</ref>, previous results has shown that conflict monitoring, as gauged by ACC activity and MFT power increases, is not restricted to motor conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kerns et al., 2004)</ref> and extends to perceptual <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Drew et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Jiang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Nigbur et al., 2012)</ref> and stimulus-stimulus conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Drew &amp; Soto-Faraco, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Marly et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Morís Fernández et al., 2018)</ref>. Our findings contribute to further broaden the theory by demonstrating high level stimulus conflict between two different properties of the same stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Ruzzoli et al., 2020)</ref>, as well as conflict between stimulus properties and pre-existing beliefs (priors). Moreover, our results reinforce earlier discoveries indicating that subjective value evidence skews decisionrelated signals in higher cortical regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Rorie et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2010)</ref>. These findings serve as a foundational basis for advancing our comprehension of the neural mechanisms underlying the flexible behavioural adaptations in response to conflict.</p><p>Concerning the prior expectations associated with stimuli, they have been consistently demonstrated to impact both perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bar, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2008)</ref> and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Kelly et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hanks et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Ratcliff, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mulder et al., 2012)</ref> through reciprocal interactions between top-down priors and bottom-up inputs. In the latter cases, adjustments in either the starting point <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cho et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mulder et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Wagenmakers et al., 2008)</ref> or the drift rate of the evidence accumulation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Hanks et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Ratcliff, 1985)</ref> have been reported, indicating a preference for the alternative that is more often correct. However, these studies involve alternatives with unequal prior probabilities of being correct for which the associated motor outputs are known. In contrast, in the present study, priors could not drive anticipatory attentional or motor effects, as they require first identifying and categorising the items in order to then map them onto prior representations of how properties such as subjective values and price are represented. This likely explains why in our case, a significant bias in the drift rate predominantly accounts for the data and aligns with individuals' preference-for-expensive bias. Additionally, this may clarify why the prior's impact increases over time within a trial, contrary to the typical finding where the effect of the prior diminishes as more evidence is accumulated <ref type="bibr">(Gold et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, both behavioural and neural findings in the present study consistently demonstrated that the impact of prior stimuli expectations was dynamic and increased over time within the task. Basing decisions on prior representations might indeed constitute an adaptive strategy that is less cognitively demanding than invoking stronger cognitive control mechanisms, manifested by increases in MFT activity. Specifically, anticipatory effects with prior belief of outcome distributions indicate that responses linked with the less probable stimulus tend to be slower and less frequent <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Mulder et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Wagenmakers et al., 2008)</ref>. However, in the case of participants exhibiting a significant preference-for-expensive bias, the expected likelihood of the preferred option being correct is diminished, leading them to select the preferred option less often, but also more rapidly. These findings suggest, in our experimental protocol, the coexistence of a competitive interplay between mechanisms guided by prior beliefs and those influenced by subjective value, where the influence of value prevails primarily in relation to reaction time and appears decoupled from choice accuracy. Indeed, even though value biases choice behaviour in a seemingly automatic manner (independently on the extent of goal-relevant evidence available), its effect on response accuracy can be countermanded while its impact on RT persists. Further investigations are needed to gain a deeper comprehension of the underlying cognitive and neural processes and these intricate interactions.</p><p>Additionally, even though statistically significant in only half of the participants examined, we cannot disregard the possibility that the preference-for-expensive bias is inherently widespread within our sample group and could potentially manifest given a larger selection of edible items. Indeed, price and perceived quality have been shown to be positively correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Rao &amp; Monroe, 1989)</ref>, possibly forming the basis for a corresponding positive relationship between subjective values and prices. We posit that the overall reduction in accuracy observed as the trial progresses, particularly in congruent trials-an aspect that may seem perplexing-could potentially be attributed to this bias.</p><p>This study underscores the generality and intricacy of mid-frontal theta (MFT) oscillations as a cognitive control mechanism. In addition to conflict-related MFT, our findings shed light on its involvement in post-error adjustments, consistent with prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cavanagh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Van Driel et al., 2012)</ref>. Notably, we observed that the increase in error-related MFT is heightened with greater price differences (∆P) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8A</ref>). This modulation may stem from the heightened salience of errors in trials with larger ∆P, as supported by prior work demonstrating that post-error MFT is influenced by error awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wang et al., 2020)</ref>. Alternatively, the penalty aspect of large ∆P, as it deducts from participants' performance in case of incorrect responses, makes it possible the concomitant role of the trials' importance or expected costs on these fluctuations . However, it is worth noting that recent evidence fails to support such effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Frömer et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding MFT activity during the decision process, our paradigm implied an inverse relationship between trial difficulty, indexed by less accurate and slower responses as ∆P decreases ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref>), and trial importance or potential cost, which increases with ∆P. This finding appears contrary to our initial expectation, which was based on prior literature demonstrating that ACC and MFT activity increases with task difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Shenhav et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Pochon et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Botvinick, 2007)</ref>. However, the ACC is sensitive to various signals, including choice value and effort cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Croxson et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Klein-Flügge et al., 2016)</ref>, which may confound its direct relationship with task difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Botvinick et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kolling et al., 2016)</ref>, as also challenged by recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Umemoto et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Castro-Meneses et al., 2020)</ref>. Instead, we interpret the increase in MFT activity with ∆P as an effect of trial importance, where greater cognitive control is needed when larger losses are at stake. This interpretation aligns with the expected value of control theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Shenhav et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Shenhav et al., , 2016</ref>, which posits the role of the dACC in weighing the costs and benefits associated with decisions to optimize cognitive resource allocation. Indeed, individuals are shown to engage more cognitive control areas when they expect higher rewards or losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alexander &amp; Brown, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brown &amp; Braver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Rushworth &amp; Behrens, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the relationship between MFT activity and ∆P depends on basal Theta activity during the decision process. This suggests that, at an individual level, Theta is modulated in response to task importance only when it is not already high owing to task demands. MFT related to cognitive load has indeed been shown to exhibit large individual variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Gevins &amp; Smith, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Klimesch et al., 1999)</ref>. Additionally, when comparing congruent and incongruent trials, we observed that the increase in MFT during the latter, compared to the former, is not contingent on the basal activation of task-related MFT. In short, the presence of a ceiling effect affecting MFT activity related to expected loss, but not conflict-related MFT, suggests the existence of multiple levels of cognitive control signaling. Notably, the value-price conflict appears to have a more automatic effect, seemingly independent of perceived task demands.</p><p>Lastly, prior studies have reported both decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnau 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beldzik 2022</ref>) and increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Tran et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Wascher et al., 2014)</ref> in task-related MFT with time-on-task. Our findings reconcile these divergent findings by revealing complex modulations of task-related MFT with time spent on the experiment. These modulations differ depending on the presence of both a value-price conflict and a prior belief binding subjective values and prices at an individual level ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure S7</ref>). It seems improbable that increased fatigue or disengagement in the task may have caused these complex interactions. Instead, these results indicate that Theta is flexibly modulated over the course of the experiment to more efficiently allocate cognitive resources. Further investigations are warranted to gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted and dynamic nature of MFT signaling, its underlying neural networks <ref type="bibr">(Zuure et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Töllner et al., 2017)</ref>, and its potentially distinct roles, such as conflict processing or error correction <ref type="bibr">(Muralidharan et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Töllner et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beldzik et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we opted to delve into the cognitive mechanisms underlying value-biased decisions within a realistic experimental context. While we deem this approach crucial for comprehending human behaviour in genuine settings, it also introduces intricacies that can pose challenges. Primarily, the experimental conditions are built on the items' values and prices, which are both estimated. In regard to values, we managed this uncertainty by constructing our congruency conditions around substantial preference disparities. Concerning prices, our observations of slower response patterns and increased MFT activity following errors, even for minor price differences (less than one euro), suggest participants' estimations were remarkably precise and consistent. However, estimations errors leading to miscategorisations of the trials cannot be entirely excluded and may have added noise in our results.</p><p>Among the various objective attributes of edible items, our decision to inquire about prices stemmed from the frequent real-world practice of estimating prices (potentially more common than explicitly assessing weight or size dimensions). Furthermore, such estimation necessitates an initial encoding of the product's identity. This differs from prior experimental designs where participants selected between edible items based on the extent of background they covered on the screen, yielding no discernible effect of subjective value <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Polanía et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Employing real-life edible items also introduces an inherent challenge linked to the potential variability in participants' familiarity with the presented products. This variability could impact the precision or confidence of their initial estimations of value and price. Furthermore, this familiarity factor might have exerted an influence during the subsequent choice phase. Specifically, items that participants were more familiar with could have been more quickly encoded, and facilitated a faster retrieval of their associated features or garnered a more substantial share of attention during the decision-making process. We tried to minimise the possible impact of this by first explicitly asking participants about the edible items they did not recognise and removed them from the subsequent task phases. Additionally, we collected a high number of trials for each participant (more than a thousand on average, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>) to reduce the potential impact of the familiarity confound.</p><p>The potential complexity associated with the cognitive mechanisms involved in the task employed, and the variability inherent in the processing of each stimulus could directly contribute to the challenges encountered in accurately predicting the data using the drift diffusion model framework. We therefore contemplated the possibility that some fundamental tenets of the drift-diffusion framework might not have been optimally suited to the task at hand. First, we questioned whether the assumption that the decision variable relies on sequential sampling might have encountered limitations within this specific experimental context due to the accumulation of both external and internal evidence. Indeed, existing literature suggests that patients with hippocampal damage display impairments in valuebased decisions, implying a role of memory in such processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Foerde et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Palombo et al., 2015)</ref>. However, studies have also shown that choice behaviour in value-based tasks conforms to the sequential sampling model's regularities <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Krajbich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Milosavljevic et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Polanía et al., 2014)</ref>, even when memory retrieval is clearly required <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Gluth et al., 2013)</ref>, indicating that memory retrieval and sensory evidence accumulation might, to some extent, share neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Shadlen &amp; Shohamy, 2016)</ref>. Here the complex interaction between value, task-relevant evidence and participants prior's belief may be more difficult to formally dissociate in time. Second, in our attempt to account for withinparticipant variation in the processing of stimuli, we introduced factors like gaussian distributed non-decision time to accommodate trial-specific differences. However, a more substantial concern pertains to the assumption of the drift diffusion model (DDM) that the drift rate and decision threshold remain constant across trials. Our findings indeed reveal that the decision process is susceptible to transient biases (stemming from value and prior beliefs), which can be counteracted through dynamic enhancements in cognitive control, revealing that adjustments occur within the course of a decision-making process. In the case of decisions influenced by priors, the implementation of a neurologically informed model utilising EEG correlates of evidence accumulation and motor preparation enabled the incorporation of drift and urgency rate adjustments, resulting in improved predictive accuracy of choice behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Kelly et al., 2020)</ref>. Recent studies employing tasks involving conflict processing have used the hierarchical drift-diffusion model (HDDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Wiecki et al., 2013)</ref> to introduce trial-specific variations in mid-frontal theta (MFT) activity. These studies have demonstrated its impact on various parameters influencing the choice process, such as the starting point, drift rate, and decision threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Guan et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Castagna et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Frank et al., 2015)</ref>. These results are indeed promising, but they also highlight the challenges in identifying the specific roles of conflict-related MFT in shaping decision processes.</p><p>Moreover, our results demonstrate that fluctuations of MFT activity throughout the experiment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure S7)</ref> is not associated with similar variations in choice behaviour ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures  S3 and S4</ref>) revealing that the effect of MFT on the decision process may be indirect or in interaction with other brain structures. Additional research is warranted, particularly employing intracortical recordings, to more precisely identify the sources of the rapid and dynamic MFT activity observed, as well as the specific neural networks it is intricately involved with.</p><p>In conclusion, this study effectively underscores the impact of inherent preferences on objective decision-making, in the absence of anticipatory preparation. This finding further strengthens the notion that value is swiftly and automatically encoded, preceding and irrespective of the quantity of goal-relevant information available. Additionally, it introduces a novel cognitive model wherein MFT oscillations contribute to steering the decision process towards goal-relevant evidence, thus overcoming online value biases. Finally, the use of a more ecological experimental setting, with realistic stimuli, has unveiled the implications of complex processes intertwined with participants' prior representations.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>.

We observed difference in the peak, with higher amplitude for incongruent compared to congruent trials, and in the timing of motor response activation, with congruent trial preceding incongruent trials especially in fast trials (B).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequential biases are independent of the objective evidence</head><p>The response deadline in the experiment put time pressure on participants. We wondered whether such urgency elicited the occurrence of sequential biases. As the experiment was not designed to look at sequential effects, we focused our exploratory analysis on whether participants responses, especially the faster ones, are biased by their directly preceding response. We classified trials as 'repeat' when the response (left or right) in the current trial was the same as the one in the previous trial, and as 'switch' when it was different. We found that faster choices were significantly biased toward switching compared to repeating ( ) , w h i c h w a s n o t t h e c a s e f o r s l o w e r c h o i c e s ( ). Especially, we observed that this 'switch' bias was present independently of the objective evidence present (∆P small:</p><p>, medium:</p><p>, large: ; <ref type="figure">Figure S11</ref>), suggesting that this bias serves as an initial adaptation to counteract the response urgency rather that an adaptive strategy to the trial's difficulty. However, accuracy didn't seem to be affected by this motor sequential bias as the probability to be correct was not significantly different between switch and repeat fast trials overall ( ) and inside ∆P conditions (small: , medium:</p><p>, large: ).
