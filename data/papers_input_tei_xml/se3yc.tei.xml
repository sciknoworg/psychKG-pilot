<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>As of recent greenhouse gas studies, commercial shipping continues to significantly contribute to global carbon emissions, as well as a notable impact through methane and nitric oxide <ref type="bibr">(International Maritime Organization, 2021)</ref>. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) cautions that without proactive measures, these emissions could increase by 50% by 2050. In response, the IMO has set a goal of reducing CO 2 emissions per transport work by at least 40% by 2030, introducing mandatory strategies like the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan <ref type="bibr">(International Maritime Organization, 2011)</ref>. Considering that fuel consumption constitutes around 70% of a ship's operational costs, particularly from propulsion <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rehmatulla &amp; Smith, 2015)</ref>, reducing it aligns both environmental and economic interests. Yet, a gap persists between the technical potential for emissions reduction and the actual performance, also known as 'energy efficiency gaps' <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acciaro et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jaffe &amp; Stavins, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Johnson &amp; Andersson, 2011)</ref>. These gaps represent a yet unresolved challenge for the human factors, ergonomics, and psychology communities.</p><p>In a comprehensive systematic review on potential emission abatement measures in shipping, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bouman et al., 2017</ref> identified alongside technical implementations (e.g. resistance reduction devices or biofuels), operational strategies such as energy efficient route planning (EERP) as key measures. The optimization of speed and route in particular has proven to be promising, with potential CO 2 e reductions up to 60% and 48% respectively. Operational strategies furthermore have the benefit of being easier to implement in existing vessels compared to more costly technical implementations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ait Allal et al., 2019)</ref>. Arguably, they are instrumental to achieving IMO goals, considering the life span of vessels can reach 50 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Buxton &amp; Cain, 1994)</ref>. However, operational strategies rely significantly on human decision-making for their effectiveness, as has been seen in the implementation of safety regulations onboard <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sampson &amp; Bloor, 2007)</ref>. This underscores the integral role of human factor in bridging energy efficiency gaps.</p><p>Despite its relevance to this challenge, human factors research on maritime decision-making is still surprisingly scarce. Research related to human decision-making in energy efficiency has largely focused on analyses of broader aspects like policy effectiveness and stakeholder incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jimenez et al., 2022)</ref>, rather than individuals onboard. Nevertheless, first onboard interview studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Poulsen &amp; Sampson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Poulsen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zoubir et al., 2023)</ref> reveal challenges such as dilemmas of balancing the goal for reduced fuel consumption through slow steaming against the demand for high-speed travel to ensure timely arrivals, or managing high workload and fatigue. This underscores the need for a holistic approach as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rasmussen et al., 2018</ref>, which includes addressing maritime challenges directly through operational strategies. Furthermore, the adoption of BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 5 environmentally-friendly behaviors demands significant cognitive capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Langenbach et al., 2020)</ref>; a resource already in short supply due to the stringent demands onboard. Innovative technologies, such as decision support systems (DSS) for EERP (cf. e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beşikçi et al., 2016)</ref>, could alleviate cognitive load, thus motivating the implementation of tangible actions and leveraging technical potential.</p><p>However, to leverage the potential for DSS and other technologies, understanding the interaction between technology and crew behavior is critical. <ref type="bibr">Viktorelius and Lundh, 2019 highlights</ref> challenges in implementing an energy monitoring system and an energy saving policy on board, revealing that the process often sparked tensions between onboard crew and onshore stakeholders. This implementation required a significant realignment of existing practices and depended, therefore, on the crew's ability to reconcile them with established routines. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Viktorelius and Lundh, 2019 found</ref> that the success of an energy management system onboard hinged on its ability to resonate with and support the crew's operational realities. These perspectives underscore the importance of further research in 1) where energy efficiency operations can be conducted onboard, 2) what seafarers' needs in EERP are, and 3) how to balance technical innovation with these requirements. To this end, various human factors frameworks-such as Expectancy-Value Theory, Basic Psychological Needs, Types and Levels of Human Interaction with Automation, and the Critical Decision Method-can provide valuable insights. These frameworks and their relevance are discussed in detail in the Background section.</p><p>The objective of the present research was to investigate seafarers' task-related behavior, motivation, and decision-making in EERP, especially in regard to future technical systems, and is centered around four research questions (RQ). RQ1 asks, "What are the predetermined tasks for route planning in maritime operations?". We addressed this through a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA), grounded in both operational manuals and expert interviews (N = 3). RQ2 explores, "How do seafarers appraise different route planning tasks in regard to energy efficiency in their working environment?" Here, in the sense of Expectancy-Value-Theory, seafarers evaluated success expectancy, value, and cost of these tasks in their work environment. RQ3 explores, "How do seafarers rate a) their satisfaction of basic psychological needs at work, b) their preferences for automation types and c) how do these correlate?". RQ2 and RQ3 both seek to understand factors influencing seafarers' intentions to engage in EERP or use DSS, and were carried out as an online survey involving a broader demographic of seafarers (N = 62). Findings from RQ1 to RQ3 were used to inform the development of a DSS for EERP. Finally, RQ4, "What themes emerge in seafarers' decision-making regarding energy-efficient route planning when utilizing an energy-efficiency decision support system in a controlled ship simulator experiment?", seafarers (N = 22) utilized this DSS in a professional ship bridge simulator. To this end, we conducted interviews utilizing an adapted version of the Critical Decision Method and thematically analysed the data. Altogether, we sought a comprehensive understanding of seafarers' tasks and decision-making in maritime EERP, ultimately contributing towards bridging the energy efficiency gap.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expectancy-Value Theory</head><p>To assess how seafarers appraise tasks in energy-efficient route planning (EERP), we adapted the Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT), a psychological concept from the field of achievement motivation. EVT, originally applied to the achievement motivation and decision-making of learners in educational settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Wigfield &amp; Cambria, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000)</ref>, parallels the work situation of seafarers. In both contexts, motivation and decision-making are leveraged to achieve target outcomes, such as energy efficiency in the maritime setting.</p><p>EVT identifies three criteria that typically influence decision-making to achieve a specific goal:</p><p>Subjective Value, which is the perceived importance or benefit of a task-such as planning for a slower speed to reduce fuel consumption, which might be seen as particularly valuable, thus enhancing motivation to engage with a task; Success Expectancy, the perceived likelihood of successfully completing a task, key in maritime operations where outcomes like achieving just-in-time arrival while maintaining reduced speed can be uncertain; and Cost, which encompasses the perceived effort, time, and other resources required for a task, where high perceived costs, like frequent adjustments to voyage plans due to changing weather conditions, might deter motivation even when tasks are valuable or likely to succeed.</p><p>Using this framework to evaluate tasks from RQ1 allows us to identify which tasks seafarers are likely to choose, as they already meet the criteria for achievement motivation. Recognizing seafarers as experts, we can leverage their insights to pinpoint high-value tasks for EERP that align with operational needs and promote energy efficiency. Tasks perceived as having low success expectancy or high costs are less likely to be executed but could offer high value, indicating a need for technical support. By distinguishing these tasks, we characterize energy efficiency gaps in EERP and guide the development of technical systems to mitigate limitations such as high costs while enhancing strengths like high success expectancy, essential for creating human-centered DSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hoch &amp; Schkade, 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction at Work (BPN)</head><p>Intrinsic motivation involves performing tasks for the inherent satisfaction derived from the work itself, rather than for external factors or rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is driven by external factors, such as compliance with regulations or monetary incentives. In the shipping industry, extrinsic motivators are usually employed to motivate seafarers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kanev et al., 2017)</ref>, as seen with the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan or SEEMP (International Maritime Organization, 2011), which mandates energy-efficient operations onboard.</p><p>However, studies with maritime samples have shown that intrinsic motivators lead to an increase in performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Davy &amp; Noh, 2016)</ref> and innovative behaviors (S.-C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chen et al., 2010)</ref>. Consequently, it is prudent to assess where technical systems such as DSS can support intrinsic motivation on the BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 7 bridge, thereby boosting the likelihood that seafarers will adopt energy-efficient behaviors.</p><p>Intrinsic motivation in a work context is outlined in Self-determination Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Autin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2012)</ref>. This theory highlights three core psychological needs-Competence, Relatedness, and Autonomy-that significantly influence an individual's intrinsic motivation depending on whether they are fulfilled or frustrated. Competence refers to feeling effective in one's interactions with the environment; for seafarers, it can be fulfilled e.g., when they successfully apply their training to route planning, but becomes frustrated when integrating weather conditions into planning feels overly time-consuming. Relatedness involves feeling connected to others and is fulfilled when seafarers feel supported by their colleagues and supervisors, fostering collaboration, yet it is frustrated when seafarers face their time aboard in isolation. Autonomy describes feeling in control of one's own actions, fulfilled when seafarers have the freedom to plan their routes, and frustrated when their actions are overly influenced by external stakeholders. By understanding whether seafarers' needs are fulfilled or frustrated, we can identify which aspects of the working environment drive intrinsic motivation to e.g., conduct EERP. This insight can enable user-centric design of energy efficiency technology and can help inform policies that shape onboard practices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preferences for Automation Types (PAT)</head><p>A further key issue in maximizing the effectiveness of technical systems for seafarers' EERP is determining which functions should be controlled by humans and which by automated systems. For instance, a fully automated system can theoretically collect weather data for a region, calculate fuel consumption for each sector, plan an energy-efficient route, and control the autopilot to execute this plan. However, such extensive automation might e.g. raise safety concerns among seafarers or create feelings of redundancy. Conversely, handling all tasks manually could e.g. lead to an unnecessary increase in workload and diminish overall energy efficiency. It is thus important to discern which EERP functions seafarers e.g. view as suitable for automation and which might encounter resistance. We can thereby inform which technology is likely to be accepted and be effective in bridging the energy efficiency gap in maritime operations, or which may benefit from intermediate (rather than full) levels of automation.</p><p>To assess seafarers Preferences for Automation Types, we drew from the Model for Types and Levels of Human Interaction with Automation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Parasuraman et al., 2000)</ref>. This model categorizes various functions, which can to varying degrees be controlled by humans or automated systems. It includes functions such as information acquisition (collecting data), information analysis (interpreting data), decision selection (choosing an applicable action), and action implementation (carrying out the selected action). Each function type can coexist within a system with varying levels of complexity. For example, a system might feature highly automated information acquisition while still requiring significant human involvement in data analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Critical Decision Method</head><p>In designing human-centered maritime technology, especially DSS, it's crucial to identify potential application areas as outlined in RQ2, but also to understand key information, attitudes, and routines that drive decision-making. Naturalistic Decision-Making (NDM) offers a valuable framework for this analysis, focusing on decision-making in real-world scenarios typical in maritime settings, such as EERP, where uncertainty is a common feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lipshitz &amp; Strauss, 1997)</ref>. NDM explores how experienced practitioners, like seafarers, utilize their knowledge and intuition in decision-making.</p><p>The Critical Decision Method (CDM) is a qualitative approach within NDM, used to elicit expert knowledge during critical incidents. Through this method, experts recount significant decisions, with the interviewer guiding them to detail their thought processes, observed cues, considered options, and rationales for their decisions (G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Klein, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">G. Klein et al., 1989)</ref>. This approach helps reveal the tacit knowledge and cognitive strategies involved in decision-making and inform design of technical systems (G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Klein, 1993)</ref>. In the maritime sector, CDM has provided insights into e.g. safety incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kjell I. Øvergård &amp; Martinsen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tan et al., 2010)</ref> or pilot decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Butler et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Applying CDM in the present study, particularly observing seafarers' initial interactions with DSS, sheds light on current practices and preferences. This includes understanding the information seafarers rely on, their receptiveness to new route planning methodologies, and the routines that influence their decisions.</p><p>BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1 -Hierarchical Task Analysis</head><p>In a first step, we sought to codify work-as-written and work-as-done as an HTA, thereby answering RQ1: "What are the predetermined tasks for route planning in maritime operations?".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) decomposes tasks into subtasks to analyse their relationships, enhancing understanding from a user's perspective. Originally for training, its applications now include system design and safety analysis, aiding in identifying performance requirements and issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Stanton, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>To develop the HTA, we initially identified and categorized tasks from the IMO Resolution A.893(21) (International Maritime Organization, 1999) and SOLAS V/15 <ref type="bibr">(International Maritime Organization, 1974)</ref>. The former contains the detailed 'Guidelines for Voyage Planning', and the latter mandates the use of appropriate navigational tools and publications for safe navigation. While A.893(21) provides a structured framework for the stages of voyage planning, SOLAS V/15 mandates the availability of essential navigational information, thereby complementing each other.</p><p>In a second step, this framework was further augmented through expert interviews with seasoned seafarers. The three experts' backgrounds encompassed a broad range of maritime experience:</p><p>The first expert (E1), a nautical student who had served as a ship mechanic or cadet on research vessels for four years. E2, a research associate in nautical science, had six years of experience, including roles as First and Second Officers on container ships and heavy-lift carriers. E3, now working as a lecturer in nautical science at a university, had the most extensive experience, with fifteen years in the field, culminating in the position of Master, and having worked on tankers, container ships, and heavy-lift carriers. These interviews provided insights into the practical and operational challenges in maritime navigation and safety, critical for developing an effective HTA. These interviews offered insights into practical tasks not formally documented in existing literature, such as the master's evaluation of the route plan prior to its execution. This allowed for an HTA reflective of both regulatory guidance and real-world practices.</p><p>Subsequently, we constructed the task hierarchy, categorizing and sequencing tasks to reflect their priority and execution. This involved breaking down larger tasks into sub-tasks and identifying the specific environment and tools each task required. This step of the HTA development was conducted with a workshop between the authors and expert E1. The HTA was then further validated in a workshop with all experts, who discussed each task individually. In a final step, it was again compared to the IMO guidelines, to ensure that the final HTA contained all elements of work-as-written.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 10</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result -RQ1</head><p>The HTA is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, laying out the predetermined tasks for route planning in maritime operations (RQ1). Besides the breakdown of tasks and subtasks, it also displays procedural algorithms to indicate where a task may be skipped or repeated.</p><p>In summary, the Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) identifies four key tasks at the highest level: specifying objectives of route planning (1.), appraising information necessary for route planning (3.), executing the actual route planning (4.), and evaluating planned routes (5.). This emphasizes that the actual plotting of a route is only one aspect of the comprehensive route planning process. Notably, there are more possible tasks for the appraisal of information (n = 71) compared to planning (n = 44).</p><p>It is important to note that the HTA provides an overview of all potential tasks, though not all tasks are completed in every voyage. For example, tasks related to the polar code (3.1.4) are only relevant for voyages in specific geographical areas.</p><p>The HTA also includes numerous "checks" (e.g., task 3.4 involves checking tide tables, pilot charts, ice charts, forecasts, tidal stream atlases, and NAVTEX). This information gathering is crucial for safe operations, as mandated by regulatory texts, and is similarly essential for EERP. However, all three nautical experts involved in the HTA development noted that not all seafarers consistently check all information. This may depend on a seafarer's training, familiarity with a region, or time constraints. Some checks may be performed automatically; for instance, checking for up-to-date sea charts (3.5.1) is a feature of Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), which are required on most commercial vessels, though seafarers still control these checks.</p><p>A key insight is the role of objective specification and evaluation in the planning process onboard. The creation of a voyage plan may involve different crew members, depending on the regulations and practices of a specific ship or shipping company. However, the final quality assurance is the responsibility of the master, who must sign off on the plan as the individual responsible for the vessel. This highlights that voyage planning is a collaborative process. Even if initial checks and plans are performed by a crew member, the master (and by extension, external stakeholders) may also influence energy efficiency through setting objectives or evaluating the plan. HTA displaying the EERP process in maritime navigation, as derived from IMO guidelines and expert seafarer input.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study -Online Survey</head><p>In the next step, our objective was to allow seafarers' to rate route planing tasks in regard to energy efficiency in their working environment, and to examine psychological basic need fulfillment at work, as well as preferences for automation types. The presented study received ethical approval from the University of Luebeck ethics commission <ref type="bibr">(Approval Number 2022-636)</ref>. This study was pre-registered at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GU5RX. The initial registration was updated after data collection to account for a smaller sample size than targeted, which would have resulted in insufficient statistical power for the initial hypotheses. The updated registration also focuses rather on the task analytic perspective than a specific exploration of relations of psychological constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>TWe initially recruited a sample of 82 seafarers by posting on 50 international platforms specifically designed for professional seafarers. These platforms included forums and user groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, ranging in size from small groups with a few hundred members to large communities with up to 230,000 maritime professionals. Participants were compensated with a €20 bank transfer or voucher. Data sets were inspected for plausibility, focusing on timing and consistency of responses (e.g., schematic response behavior) to ensure data validity. Additionally, responses to an attention check at the beginning of the survey ("Please select 'Somewhat disagree' for this question.") were evaluated. As a result, 17 data sets were removed, leaving a final sample of N = 65 participants who completed the survey related to RQ3, which encompassed the first half of the study. A total of 42 participants completed the entire survey, including sections related to RQ2.</p><p>Participants' were experienced with active duty onboard (M years = 9.6, Mdn = 9.5, SD = 6.8) and had previously served on a wide range of ships, including container ships (n = 43), tankers (n = 19 ) and heavy-lift carriers (n = 14). Regarding officers' rank, the sample included Masters (n = 13),</p><p>Chief Mates (n = 21), 2nd Officers (n = 14) and Cadets (n = 4), as well as "Other" (n = 13), which included pilots or retirees. Most participating seafarers received their officer's licences in Europe (n = 60), followed by Asia (n = 3), with one each in North America and Oceania. Route planning experience of participants was measured as an estimate of how many routes they had previously participated in planning M routes = 96.17, SD = 117.29, Mdn = 50).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study was conducted with LimeSurvey v3.28 (LimeSurvey Project Team / Carsten Schmitz, 2015). The survey was conceptually divided into two parts, the first half included questions for RQ3 on experience, need satisfaction, and preferences (N = 65), and the second part included the Expectancy-Value-Cost appraisal of tasks needed for RQ2 (n = 42). The survey was structured this way to anticipate drop-outs due to the extended length of task ratings.</p><p>BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The survey included the following measures:</p><p>Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (BPNSWS). The questionnaire (B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chen et al., 2015)</ref> consists of eight items each for the satisfaction and frustration of each of the three basic psychological need proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deci and Ryan, 2008</ref>, and were rated on a scale from 1 (Completely disagree) to 6 (Completely agree). Dimensions were autonomy (e.g. "I feel that the decisions I make at work reflect what I really want", α = .66), competence (e.g. "I feel confident that I can do things well at work", α = .83), and relatedness (e.g. "I feel that the relations I have at work are only superficial", α = .82).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference for Automation Types (PAT)</head><p>. Based on the model described above Preferences for Automation Types (PAT) we developed a questionnaire with four sub-scales with four items each. Items included functions which could be completed either by humans or automated systems and were validated through expert interviews in the field of engineering psychology (N = 5), which resulted in a revised version that was used in the present study. Participants' instructions were</p><p>to "Please indicate the degree to which you would prefer the following steps to be carried out either solely by a human or solely by an automated system." Responses were on a 6-point scale, including 1 = "Completely prefer human" to 6 = "Completely prefer automated systems". The questionnaire is included in Appendix 2.</p><p>The PATS has four sub-scales: information acquisition (e.g. "Gather data from multiple sources or sensors", α = .88), information analysis (e.g. "Perform calculations with current data", α = .87), decision selection (e.g. "Make a decision on which action(s) to carry out based on current data.", α = .78), and action implementation (e.g. "Put a decision into action.", α = .73).</p><p>EVT-Ratings. Participants were presented with a fictional scenario in which they were tasked with planning routes for a general cargo vessel engaged in tramp (i.e. without fixed route schedules) shipping in Northern European waters, using an ECDIS and without any charter contract restrictions. This approach aimed to establish a uniform context for all participants, to increase internal validity and reliability. Participants were then asked to evaluate 23 specific tasks identified from the HTA. To avoid overwhelming participants with too many tasks, we aggregated tasks from the 3rd and 4th levels of the HTA, focusing on the appraisal and execution of route planning. This approach allowed us to consolidate finer-grained tasks (e.g., 'Open loading computer') into broader composite tasks (e.g., 'Special Cargo'), providing a more manageable task list while maintaining the essential components of the original levels of granularity. The final task list is available in Appendix 1.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Definitions were always available to the participants to reference during task rating. Rating was conducted on single-item sliders (0 = extremely low to 5 = extremely high). We utilized single-item scales primarily due to the extensive range of questions in our survey and the straightforward nature of EVT constructs. This approach allowed us to minimize respondent fatigue, a consideration in surveys with numerous items <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Sackett &amp; Larson, 1990)</ref>, while maintaining survey efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bergkvist &amp; Rossiter, 2007)</ref>. Given that the constructs in question are unidimensional and can be captured through a single item <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gardner et al., 1998)</ref>, single-item scales were deemed sufficient and appropriate for this study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>The analyses conducted in study 2 were explorative and descriptive. To examine RQ2, we first normalized each participant's ratings for value, success expectancy, and inverted cost by applying z-standardization. This adjustment allowed us to account for individual response tendencies in EVT BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 15 ratings. Subsequently, we computed a cumulative score by summing the three standardized criteria for each task, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Trautwein et al., 2012</ref>. To identify any significant deviations in task ratings, we calculated 95% confidence intervals for these sums. Ratings falling outside these intervals were considered significantly different from the overall mean of task appraisals.</p><p>To address RQ3a, we calculated the means of the subscales of the BPNSWS. We furthermore conducted two-sided dependent Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to determine if any needs deviated from another. The relational approach allowed the identification of BPN which may be lacking in comparison to other needs. For RQ3b, we similarly calculated means for each subscale of the PATS, but compared these with two-sided one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to a neutral mean of 3.5.</p><p>This approach utilized the dichotomous answer scale of the PATS to differentiate preferences either for human or automated systems, or to no preference. Finally, we explored the relationship between BPNSWS with the PATS by conducting an exploratory correlation analysis.</p><p>Power analyses with G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Faul et al., 2007)</ref> were conducted and assumed a medium effect size (either d = 0.5 or r = 0.3), an alpha level of .05, and a power of .8. The minimum sample size of 64 for the exploratory correlation (RQc) was achieved. As data was in part non-normally distributed, we applied non-parametric tests. Univariate outliers were calculated and removed based on 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). Effect sizes were interpreted in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cohen, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus</head><p>The DSS utilized in this study was developed through a user-centred design process To better describe the sample, Propensity to Trust in Automation (PTT) and Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI) were assessed. PTT, which measures an individual's natural tendency to trust automated systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jessup et al., 2019)</ref>, was rated on a 6-point Likert scale from "Completely disagree" to "Completely agree" (M = 3.8, SD = 0.4). ATI evaluates a person's tendency to engage actively in technology interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Franke et al., 2019)</ref>. Using the same 6-point scale as PTT, BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 21 participants had an above-average ATI (M = 4.3, SD = 0.8), compared to the population average of 3.5 (t(21) = 4.69, p &lt; .001), aligning with the technical nature of the seafaring profession.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants were tasked with creating a route plan with the least fuel consumption possible between Dover and either Gothenburg or Bordeaux. This was conducted on a professional ship bridge simulator environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Wärtsila, 2023)</ref>, while utilizing the DSS described above. In alignment with the HTA, participants were also provided with comprehensive route planning information, including objectives, vessel specifications from technical documents, and oceanographic and meteorological data.</p><p>This study was originally conceptualized as an evaluation study, and is the focus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Zoubir et al. (2024)</ref>. We separately analysed post-study interviews to gain insights into task related behaviours, which were beyond the scope of that paper, but which are key to understanding which factors influence seafarers' decision-making, and are therefore reported in the present section.</p><p>Task-analysing interviews adapted the Critical Decision Method (CDM; G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Klein et al., 1989)</ref> to facilitate a structured assessment of decision-making factors and processes during EERP. However, in the present study, rather than retrospectively eliciting experts' knowledge about a non-routine critical decision-making task, we adapted this method as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gruner et al. (2023)</ref> to explore how different experts proceed with the same pre-experienced simulated task. In other words, seafarers conducted EERP with a DSS where the scenario and timeline were pre-defined and participants' gave their expert input to the same sequence of events. This was done by having participants create a timeline of events during EERP, and reporting in which of these events a decision was made. Next, as in the original CDM, progressively deepening probes (displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure ,</ref> cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hoffman et al., 1998)</ref> were used to illuminate factors potentially influencing decision points during EERP. This allowed for the collection of rich data on decision-making during the task, while accounting for individual differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>In analysing the interview data, we employed the thematic analysis method described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Braun and Clarke (2006)</ref>. First, the interviews were transcribed verbatim using an offline, R-based tool for WhisperTranscribe <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Radford et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Wijffels et al., 2023)</ref> and then reviewed for accuracy.</p><p>Next, MZ and MG familiarized themselves with the data to identify initial patterns and formulate preliminary ideas for themes. This approach allowed for an assessment of how widespread a theme was, without biasing longer responses, which may repeat the same theme multiple times. This initial coding loop resulted in a satisfactory inter-coder reliability (κ = .73). Themes were adjusted to reflect differences, and in a subsequent loop, the coders reached full agreement on all codes. Finally, codes were formalized in writing (for a final theme list, see Appendix 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To visualize and examine the relative impact of influencing factors on EERP with a DSS, we aggregated the results of the thematic analysis into an Ishikawa fishbone diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ishikawa &amp; Loftus, 1990</ref>). For each of the six probes on participants' decisions about EERP with a DSS, the extracted themes and the number of participants assigned to each theme are presented <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 7</ref>). In the following section, the major results of the thematic analysis are presented, including interview quotations or context for a subset (but not all) of these themes (see Supplemental Materials for all codings). Quotations were paraphrased for clarity, with validity derived from a consensus between authors MZ and MG.   Under Goals, we examined objectives considered by participants besides reducing fuel consumption, which was named as a main goal in the simulation task. Ensuring safety was notably prioritized (n = 13), and was often coded alongside weather (n = 4): "the goal was [. . . ] a safe route depending on the weather information" (participant P13). Other prominent themes included optimal trade-offs in route planning (n = 8) and acceptable voyage duration (n = 8), both frequently BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 23 mentioned. Furthermore, participants often used a subjective evaluation of performance indicators such as time or weather. For example, P6 chose a slightly higher fuel consumption to arrive just-in-time, as "three hours which you would have to wait [at anchor] is substantial". At the same time, P21 rejected an energy-efficient route, because saving 0.5 metric tons of fuel was worth it "to not disrupt the whole crew and the cargo". These responses illustrate the constant evaluations seafarers make, and imply even further details to be considered (e.g., a company's preferences to stay at anchor, or feedback a navigator receives from the crew).</p><p>Regarding Knowledge, continuing the vein of safety, participants most frequently used information on meteorological weather conditions (n = 12), particularly wind strength and direction, including gale warnings. Which mostly taken from the DSS, but were also sourced from experience, such as typical poor visibility in the Biscay (P14). Furthermore, weather was considered in regard to sea-state (n = 4) included swell, tide, current, and wave height. Participant P8 appreciated that weather in the DSS was shown in relation to time: "it can change with heavy changes, especially in the North Sea." Fuel consumption (n = 10) and voyage duration (n = 9) were also examined, and the influence of weather on these was noted, "to see how they act upon our ship during this relative route" (P18). While these examples show in-depth analysis of the route suggestions and how they came to be, some participants remained at a surface level and/or relied on experience: "I just clicked the button and decided. Of course, I had a look at the fuel consumption and decided on the most common way I would choose" (P20).</p><p>When asked about the Basis on which route suggestions were selected or rejected, participants frequently mentioned adherence to seafaring regulations (n = 10), e.g. International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG) (P5: "Yeah, the rules you always have to follow planning a route are the COLREGs."). Often, the rejection of a route occurred because a suggestion improperly crossed traffic separation schemes (P16: "[. . . ]I looked through the routes themselves, they were crossing counterwise some TSS <ref type="bibr">[. . . ]</ref>."), raising doubts about their permissibility. Despite the possibility of correcting such errors during navigation, routes that contained these errors were often rejected outright, underscoring the expectation that route suggestions must be flawless. Interestingly, P20, a highly experienced seafarer, noted that instinct also played a crucial role in route selection. For route rejection, this participant emphasized heuristic decision-making by adopting the principle: "Don't do anything you don't understand".</p><p>In terms of the role of Experience or training in supporting their decisions in route planing, participants more frequently mentioned onboard experience (n = 16) than general training (n = 9), underscoring seafaring as a field that relies heavily on practical knowledge. P21 highlighted the value of experience: "Even when forecasts say you will pass the German Bight or Humber in six hours with a sea state of four or five, experience tells you once you get there, it will actually be six or seven." BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24</head><p>Training was often discussed in the context of initial education at universities or seafaring schools, and on-the-job training, but typically mentioned alongside experience. For example, P23 stated, "we had three navigation semesters and a weather semester. All of that knowledge -and then the rest is instinct. [During route planing] there was no written down rule and no checklist: I check it in my head."</p><p>In discussing what could be Aiding decision-making in EERP, participants often echoed themes of safety or experience. For instance, several respondents requested more detailed information in the DSS (n = 8) such as sea data commonly found in advanced Electronic Navigation Charts used in ECDIS systems. P3 emphasized the need for traffic information to avoid reliance solely on personal experience for route verification. Additionally, there was also a notable interest in receiving more training, both on improving energy efficiency in general (n = 4), and on using the DSS effectively (n = 4), with the latter compared to the ECDIS, for which seafarers received in depth training. Finally, there were calls for meta-information on calculations by the DSS (n = 3), including detailed descriptions of data sources, data accuracy, and algorithms used, with the goal of being able to double-check the automated suggestions.</p><p>In discussions about Hypothetical scenarios, participants pointed out the influence of changing contexts (n = 7) and the need for more detailed information (n = 6), particularly in relation to navigational and environmental data. These discussions revealed how variations in weather conditions, vessel specifications, and data reliability could significantly impact routing decisions. For example, P12 mentioned that better-than-expected weather might lead them to choose routes with lower fuel consumption rather than faster ones. On the other hand, P9 indicated that unexpected adverse weather would shift their preference toward safer routes, even if these were less fuel efficient. Furthermore, P15 emphasized the importance of being able to adjust waypoints in response to real-time conditions, a feature that would allow mariners to navigate safely around hazards and manage traffic effectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>This paper established an HTA of route planning informed by IMO guidelines and expert</p><p>interviews. An online survey with N = 65 experienced seafarers revealed that certain tasks, notably tidal streams, and tide and weather routing, were perceived as more effective for energy efficient operations, despite associated costs. Regarding their workplace and technology needs, seafarers rated autonomy satisfaction at work significantly lower than other need satisfaction, and preferred automated information acquisition and analysis, but human decision-making. Furthermore, lower levels of autonomy satisfaction correlated weakly with higher preferences for automated decision-making.</p><p>Finally, seafarers (N = 22) were interviewed based on the Critical Decision Method after planning a route with a DSS in a professional ship-bridge simulation. Thematic Analysis was used to understand seafarers decision-making processes in EERP. Key findings highlighted that participants prioritized safety and optimal goal trade-offs in route planning while emphasizing the importance of practical experience, regulatory adherence, detailed weather and traffic information, and transparent and flexible automated tools for EERP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collaborative Route Planning and Evaluation through 3rd-Parties</head><p>One key message from the HTA was how much route planning in maritime navigation is often a collaborative effort between onboard personnel, such as nautical officers, who create and validate drafts, and the master, who signs off on them. This validation may also be expanded with external stakeholders, who are integrated into the route planning via onshore fleet operations centers or fleet management systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(John &amp; Werner, 2015)</ref>. Such systems can provide real-time data, monitor vessel performance, ensure compliance, and support communication and incident response, representing a further agent in the loop. In our DSS development, we considered these collaborative elements, enabling both onboard and onshore stakeholders to potentially participate in route planning (e.g., via rapid export/import of route plans). However, increased percieved influence from onshore stakeholders on energy efficiency operations onboard can lead to feelings of being controlled <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Zoubir et al., 2023)</ref> or increased fatigue, for example, during virtual arrivals <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Poulsen &amp; Sampson, 2019)</ref>. This underscores the need for a framework for the development of collaborative DSS that supports route planning and accounts for this cooperative multi-stakeholder task, including the preservation of seafarers' leeway in EERP.</p><p>One applicable framework proposed by M. <ref type="bibr">Klein, 1997 and utilized</ref> in systems such as the Spatial Group Decision Support Collaborative System described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Medeiros et al., 2001</ref> focuses on cooperative planning activities. This framework considers three central aspects: work process coordination (i.e., task completion, in the present case, route planning), rationale capture (i.e., BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 26 recording the decision-making process, here particularly for fuel consumption, time reduction, and safety considerations), and conflict management (i.e., reconciling differences between actors by e.g. finding alternative routes that sufficiently meet different KPIs). Our current DSS in study 3 already considered work processes, and this model, along with the results of study 3, suggests that capturing key aspects of a route (including meta-information on which KPI was decisive) and processing route plans for review are essential features for all future DSS. Additionally, features for creating and tracking alternative suggestions through third parties should also be considered. Although these aspects were partially incorporated in our current DSS, further development could enhance these features significantly, as suggested by the HTA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of EVT with Empirical Studies</head><p>When comparing the operational measures as rated with EVT by participants in this study with those empirically tested in other studies, we find energy efficiency measures which are rated congruently (e.g., high subjective and high empirical ratings) and incongruently (e.g., high subjective and low empirical ratings). Abatement values considered in the following section are reported from the review conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bouman et al., 2017</ref>, citing key reports such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Faber et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lindstad et al., 2015</ref>.</p><p>Results in study 2 showed congruent ratings in three main areas: ship stability measures, weather routing, and speed planning. Ship stability measures such as trim, ballast, and rudder control optimization have been shown in empirical studies to offer emission abatements of up to 10%. Seafarers gave these measures an average rating of 0.2 SD above the mean on a z-standardized subjective scale, with values ranging from -2 (very negative) to +2 (very positive). Weather routing, an important area for reducing emissions, can lead to abatement of up to 48% compared to standard practices. Our seafaring sample reflected this with a high mean subjective rating of 0.83 SD. Speed planning through decision support systems can potentially reduce emissions by up to 15%, and was given an average positive rating of 0.48 SD in our study.</p><p>However, other areas showed significant incongruence. Tidal stream routing, which can reduce emissions by up to 12%, received a very high subjective rating of 0.95 SD, a value higher than weather routing, suggesting overestimation by seafarers. Conversely, traffic operations, which can reduce emissions by up to 8%, were rated somewhat negatively at -0.23 SD, indicating possible underestimation. It is important to note that the studies on traffic operations often include efficient port call management, which was not mentioned in the task list for Study 2.</p><p>Altogether, our analysis highlights that future research should investigate how factors influence the (in)congruence between subjective and empirical ratings. Specifically, we propose that over-and underestimation of operational measures and individual differences in subjective ratings may arise from a lack of information, biased perceptions, variable environmental and operational conditions, cognitive BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 27 biases, and the complexity of maritime operations. These aspects have been examined in energy efficiency research in other sectors, such as road transportation (cf. e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Franke et al., 2016, for</ref> comprehensive model). Incorporating features addressing these aspects (e.g., on-the-fly training on energy efficiency and biases) could enhance DSS effectiveness, improving operational performance and sustainability. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of combining empirical research with subjective assessments to develop comprehensive and effective task analysis.</p><p>Finally, there is -to the best of our knowledge -a lack of empirical evidence for several operational measures rated positively for energy efficiency on board, such as "Tides," "Climatic Routing," and "Machinery Status." This could stem from a limited research focus on these tasks, the complexity of quantifying their impact, or challenges in isolating these factors in dynamic maritime operations. Future research should focus on quantifying the seafarers' ability to incorporate the impact of tidal routing and climatic routing in EERP, as well as examine the relationship between machinery status and energy consumption to enhance understanding and efficiency in maritime operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low Satisfaction of Autonomy Need in Seafaring</head><p>In study two, we found a weak correlation between the fulfilment of autonomy basic needs at work and preferences for automated decision-making. This is surprising, as one might assume that a low satisfaction of autonomy (i.e., low feelings of control over the environment) would coincide with a desire to make more decisions, thereby exerting control over one's environment. One possible explanation for this could be found in models of Human-Algorithm interaction, such as the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Savolainen and Ruckenstein, 2022.</ref> In that paper, the authors review four aspects of autonomy: algorithmic competence, situation mastery, co-evolution, and breathing space. Our findings in study 2 may particularly align with the concept of breathing space; participants with low autonomy satisfaction might perceive that a system making decisions automatically could increase their breathing space, thereby allowing them to freely focus on other tasks. Alternatively, a reduced feeling of autonomy may coincide with complex requirements imposed by external stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Zoubir et al., 2023)</ref>, and automated decision-making could be as a strategy to comply with such demands. Future work should explore how individual facets of autonomy contribute to seafarers' interaction with DSS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Requirements for Automated Supporting Systems for Energy Efficient Route Planning</head><p>The results of study 3 have highlighted that the interaction of seafarers with a system that supports EERP provides critical aspects to consider when developing and implementing a DSS onboard.</p><p>The planning of energy-efficient maritime routes constantly demands careful balancing of different mission objectives, such as travel duration and safety. Accounting for fuel consumption adds another layer of complexity in the decision-making process of seafarers. Besides navigational feasibility, weather, and compliance with regulations, safety of one's ship and travel duration set by the onshore crew highly determine route choices. Although seafarers balance relevant objectives for an optimal BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 28 outcome, safety, for example, will most likely always take precedence over lower priority goals such as fuel efficiency. Results, however also highlight the challenging trade-off of immediate onboard (safety) and onshore interests (travel duration) in route planning. Therefore, supporting a route decision also means supporting the merging and weighing up of diverse, potentially conflicting navigational goals.</p><p>Aligning the system with the multi-layered priorities of maritime operations may increase the likelihood of the system being (properly) utilized. Ultimately, individuals' decisions about the route may be made based on externally imposed requirements (orders and regulations), but also on personal experience, individual risk perception or the prioritization of secondary objectives (such as energy efficiency).</p><p>Generally, route planning goals and their associated prioritization are accompanied by the information necessary to achieve these goals. Hence, in the present study, additional and more detailed information on aspects such as energy efficiency metrics and weather were consistently requested to gain a holistic picture of the route options provided by the system. Most frequently, meteorological information was used by participants to make informed decisions, highlighting the relevance of up-to-date environmental data. Accurate, real-time weather data is crucial for early and precise action and should be embedded in novel systems supporting EERP. Such availability would provide assistance to seafarers in optimally balancing present goals, especially in variable weather conditions. This notion is likewise echoed in the requirements for the systems' capabilities in the future. Conditions at sea, such as the weather, can change unexpectedly. In this case, it must be transparent how well the system can deal with unforeseen changes and/or users should be able to make changes, particularly if the system is not able to implement instant changes accurately.</p><p>Given that practical experience is essential to seafarers' ability to plan routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jay, 2022)</ref>, the extent to which automated decision aids can influence practical learning of general route planning, and energy-efficient route planning in particular, needs to be considered. In the present study, participating seafarers highlighted the need for general practical experience in route planning to be able to accurately judge the automated systems' recommendation. This implies that a mere presentation of route suggestions might hinder the gain in practical experience. Providing details about the reason for suggesting a particular route may actually promote experience acquisition. Once again, additional or more detailed information could not only enable well-informed decisions on the EERP, but also the accumulation of knowledge that navigators need to accurately assess and integrate energy efficiency into their decision processes.</p><p>Specific requirements for the decision support system itself was another theme emphasised by the users in the present study. Meta-information on the system's capabilities, as well as training and experience with the system, were considered crucial. Users expressed that detailed information about the system's algorithms, decisional processes, and data sources would enhance understanding of the systems' operating principle and thus foster trust and accurate utilization. Thus, an accurate BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 29 judgement of the system could be enabled, making any necessary dynamic route adjustment more robust. Consequently, the manageability and adaptability of the system recommendations could enable highly relevant controllability by the seafarer and thus improve safety and operational efficiency. DSS trainings that provide hands-on experience in various scenarios could ensure that seafarers can not only operate the system, but also critically assess and understand the rationale behind its suggestions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>The limitations of our studies include a partial exploration of the differences between various ship types; data was aggregated across ship types, potentially obscuring mean differences between sectors. While the samples nevertheless exhibited a good range of experience and ship types, the study did not comprehensively investigate specific regulatory differences, such as higher safety standards in oil shipping, which could influence cost or success expectancy in study 2. Furthermore, despite the Standard of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping (STCW) setting minimum training requirements, variations in the quality of training, such as the integration of simulators, or differing standards above this minimum across countries, were not fully examined. Our results are there therefore influenced by European, often container-shipping seafarers, which should be taken into account when generalizing the results.</p><p>The present study was exploratory in nature and did not apply false discovery rate corrections, primarily due to the low sample size, opting to focus on exploratively identifying patterns in our data without the stringent control of Type I errors. As a result, findings that rely on statistical correlations, such as the correlation between autonomy and preferences for decision-making, lack confirmatory power and should be treated with caution. Future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm these results and provide more definitive conclusions.</p><p>The application of EVT in this research represents a novel approach, as EVT is generally not used for task appraisal but rather as a motivational construct. It was chosen for this comprehensive coverage of motivation aspects, but also for its intuitive appeal, which was necessary due to the constraints of employing single-item measures required by the extensive task list. Other potentially relevant frameworks like the Theory of Planned Behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, which also integrate expectancy-value components, were not used due to their complexity. This decision may limit the depth of motivational insights compared to what might be achieved with more detailed multi-item scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In summary, this study's HTA of route planning, guided by IMO guidelines and expert interviews, underscores the complex nature of maritime navigation and the potential for human-centered technical support. Our surveys of and interviews with experienced seafarers revealed that tasks with high subjective value, such as weather routing and tidal stream consideration, are often hindered by associated costs. These tasks, which involve spatial information, can be effectively BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 30 integrated into mapping tools to alleviate these costs.</p><p>Our findings provide crucial insights into the requirements for DSS. These systems need to be transparent and adaptable, primarily automating information acquisition and analysis, while incorporating seafarers' practical experience and input from external stakeholders, particularly during decision-making. Additionally, DSS must enable seafarers to maintain meticulous control over safety and regulatory compliance during EERP, even if this increases their workload. Incorporating comprehensive information and training on energy efficiency and cognitive biases could significantly enhance DSS effectiveness, leading to improved operational performance and sustainability.</p><p>Future research should explore how factors such as training and regulatory compliance affect the correlation between subjective perceptions of abatement potential and empirical data. The study's limitations, particularly the lack of exploration of ship type differences, highlight the need for more sector-specific analyses. Future work should also address empirical evidence gaps for operational measures like machinery status and tidal considerations during route planning. Blending empirical research with subjective assessments is essential to create holistic task analyses that reflect seafarers' everyday working conditions.</p><p>Further studies should also examine the balance between automation and human decision-making, considering how autonomy impacts seafarers' interaction with DSS. Training programs that offer practical experience and transparency about system algorithms and decision-making processes are vital for building trust and consistent system utilization. Aligning DSS with the multifaceted priorities of maritime operations will enhance their adoption and efficacy, ultimately contributing to safer and more efficient navigation and bridging the energy efficiency gap in shipping. </p></div>

Six outliers were removed for values exceeding 1.5 times IQR. For Information Acquisition (W = 1669.50, M dn = 4.75, p &lt; .001, d = 1.52, large effect) and Information Analysis (W = 1673.50, M dn = 4.75, p &lt; .001, d = 1.49, large effect), the results indicated a significant deviation from the neutral mean, suggesting a notable preference for control by automated system. In the case of Decision Selection, there was a significant departure from the neutral mean, but in the opposite direction (W = 479.50, M dn = 3.00, p = .015, d = -0.33, small effect), indicating a preference for human control. For Action Selection, the t-test revealed no significant difference from the neutral mean (W = 708.00, M dn = 3.50, p = .866, d = 0.06, negligible effect), suggesting no clear preference. Altogether, these results suggest preferences for automated systems in functions pertaining to information, humans for decision-making, but no clear preferences for implementing said action.</figDesc></figure>

The interface (Figure 6) was developed through co-design activities like design sprints, domain expert reviews, and workshops. Presented on a tablet computer, the DSS included a nautical chart with optional overlays for e.g. atmospheric pressure isobars, current direction arrows, wind vanes, and significant wave height heat maps (A). The ship's current position, past track, and suggested routes were also visualized (B).A timeline control simulated virtual ships' progress along different routes while considering forecasted weather conditions (C). A fly-out module provided comparisons of routing options based on key performance indicators such as fuel-oil consumption, travel duration, ETA, and weather warnings (D). A full description of this DSS can be found in Schwarz et al., 2023. BRIDGING THE GAP ON THE BRIDGE 20 DSS utilized in Study 3.

All participants were at least in an advanced stage of studies to become a nautical officer or active nautical officers. They were recruited via university and alumni mailing lists of the nautical program. Compensation for participation was €60 via bank transfer. In terms of experience, participants had spent at least 6 months at sea professionally (M months = 18.4, SD = 7.5) and had previously planned routes, either as part of training (M count = 16.6, SD = 17.5) or on duty (M count = 54.5, SD = 212.3).
