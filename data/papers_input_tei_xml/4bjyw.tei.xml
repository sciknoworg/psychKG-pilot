<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In joint cognitive tasks, pairs or groups of individuals collaborate to achieve a common goal.</p><p>This could be to find a particular target among distractors, to make perceptual decisions, or to recall particular stimulus features. Interestingly, verbal communication is not a pre-requisite for successful collaboration in these tasks. This is illustrated in a study where pairs of collaborating individuals (also known as "dyads") were asked to jointly search for a particular target <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brennan, Chen, Dickinson, Neider, &amp; Zelinsky, 2008)</ref>. The individuals, each in a separate room, were presented with the same field of distractor stimuli ("Q") among which a target ("O") could be embedded. In one condition, the only information shared between the pair was where each individual was currently looking, which was recorded by an eye tracker, and displayed on the other's display.</p><p>Collaborative search proved to be faster than the solitary equivalent.</p><p>One important observation in the aforementioned study was that pairs implicitly divided the search space in two halves, with each taking responsibility for their own half <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brennan et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In a condition in which pairs were allowed to speak, pairs verbally decided on a highly similar strategy, although being allowed to communicate in this way did not seem to improve performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brennan et al., 2008)</ref>. This finding has since been replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Neider, Chen, Dickinson, Brennan, &amp; Zelinsky, 2010)</ref>. In addition, the collaborative benefit seems to correlate with the similarity of individuals' verbal communication style, and their social proximity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brennan &amp; Enns, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the benefit of knowing about collaborators' actions extends across perceptual domains, for example when this information is auditory or even vibro-tactile <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Wahn et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Modelling work suggests that joint visual search with real-time communication is quicker because of active collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brennan &amp; Enns, 2015)</ref>, but not when participants simply follow each other's gaze around the search array <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Messmer, Leggett, Prince, &amp; McCarley, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yamani, DIVISION OF LABOUR IN COGNITIVE COLLABORATION 4 Neider, Kramer, &amp; McCarley, 2017)</ref>. The latter behaviour occurs more in competitive joint search, whereas collaborative search facilitates participants to more efficiently divide the search space <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Niehorster, Cornelissen, Holmqvist, &amp; Hooge, 2019)</ref>. When joint visual search is performed without direct feedback, collective search is also faster than independent search, albeit to a lesser extent: When feedback is given only after a trial, performance is better for groups of two or three compared to single participants, and is correlated with individual search speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wahn, Czeszumski, &amp; KÃ¶nig, 2018)</ref>. This suggests that without real-time feedback, a collective benefit can be achieved through statistical facilitation rather than collaboration. However, real-time information on collaborators improves performance to a greater extent. In the literature, these concepts are referred to as "collective benefit" and "collaborative benefit" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wahn, Kingstone, &amp; KÃ¶nig, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural adaptation to group performance</head><p>Although the cognitive tasks described above require individuals to coordinate or respond to each other's actions, they do not require individuals to be aware of each other's level of cognitive skill. By contrast, real-life collaborations often require a division of labour that is in keeping with individual capacity. For example, when lifting wooden planks of increasing length, pairs of participants decide to start jointly carrying planks at a length that was proportional to the pair's mean arm span <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Richardson, Marsh, &amp; Baron, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sebanz, Bekkering, &amp; Knoblich, 2006)</ref>. This illustrates that pairs were not only aware of each other's capacity to carry planks, but also able to act on this knowledge.</p><p>Recent work on joint perceptual decision-making has demonstrated that individuals within a pair assume their collaborator is equally capable, and that violations of this assumption are detrimental to joint performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mahmoodi et al., 2015)</ref>. In this study, participants had to first individually decide on whether a target appeared in a first or second interval, and in the case of disagreement one was randomly chosen to be arbitrator and make a final decision. Crucially, each individual provided a confidence rating, which the arbitrator could use to make their decision.</p><p>Arbitrators were shown to weigh each response equally, even when differences in task performance were introduced between the participants by making one individual's task harder, and when participants received a group reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mahmoodi et al., 2015)</ref>. This elegantly suggests that humans weigh their collaborators' opinions equally rather than optimally.</p><p>Unfortunately, perhaps in a small-scale application of the Dunning-Kruger effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999)</ref>, less skilled individuals were more likely to report higher confidence in wrong decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mahmoodi et al., 2015)</ref>. This is an inherent problem with self-report, and potentially clouded arbitrators' ability to make a skill-based decision in trials with disagreement. In addition, individual participants could not directly affect the performance of the other participant. Hence, it remains unclear whether humans would act on the perceived cognitive skills of collaborators when they are given a chance to do so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Joint visual short-term memory</head><p>Here, we present a novel collaborative task that requires a pair of participants to briefly remember a number of visual stimuli. In one variety of visual short-term memory tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zhang &amp; Luck, 2008)</ref>, participants are presented with a memory array of several items, for example coloured squares or bars with a particular orientation. They are then required to maintain the items in memory for a duration of several seconds. After this delay, one item is probed, and participants are required to reproduce the original colour or orientation.</p><p>The advantage of using such a task to investigate collaborative behaviour, is that visual short-term memory is a well-studied system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brady, Konkle, &amp; Alvarez, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Luck &amp; Vogel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ma, Husain, &amp; Bays, 2014)</ref>. Although there is debate on the precise architecture, researchers agree that short-term memory is of a limited capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adam, Vogel, &amp; Awh, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Awh, Barton, &amp; Vogel, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bays, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bays &amp; Husain, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cowan, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wilken &amp; Ma, 2004)</ref>. In addition, visual shortterm memory capacity can be measured reliably within individuals, and shows a wide variability between individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Luck &amp; Vogel, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that visual short-term memory is closely related to visual attention, and in fact that active maintenance requires attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zokaei, Heider, &amp; Husain, 2014)</ref>. Our approach is thus quite closely aligned with aforementioned joint cognition studies, and rather different from joint long-term memory studies that usually test joint recall of individually studied items, or joint encoding and recall after a longer period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rajaram &amp; Pereira-Pasarin, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In our task, individuals receive objective feedback on their own and their partner's performance. Performance is translated into a group reward in a non-linear way that punishes larger errors more strongly than smaller errors. Crucially, participants can claim stimuli for themselves by looking at them, and are later probed only on stimuli that they have claimed. This means that participants can choose to take responsibility for more or fewer stimuli. In line with aforementioned research on physical collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Richardson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sebanz et al., 2006)</ref>, we hypothesised that participants would learn how well they were doing compared to their partner, and adjust their behaviour accordingly.</p><p>For example, if a pair of participants is asked to remember a total of eight items, one participant could notice they were doing markedly better than their partner when each claim four items. On the next trial, they could choose to claim one additional item, which would increase their memory load to five items. As a consequence, their partner's memory load would be reduced to three items. Although their own performance would decrease slightly, their partner's performance could increase by a greater amount, and their joint reward would be greater.</p><p>In addition, we hypothesised that participants would judge the collaboration to be better when their partner was more sensitive to the difference in cognitive ability between them. In other DIVISION OF LABOUR IN COGNITIVE COLLABORATION 7 words, we expected pairs that had a larger discrepancy in visual short-term memory capacity to rate their collaboration as better if the higher-capacity individual adjusted their behaviour to help the lower-capacity individual.</p><p>Finally, we decided to measure social apathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ang, Lockwood, Apps, Muhammed, &amp; Husain, 2017)</ref>. Taking on more items in a collaborative task could be viewed as pro-social, and thus could be mediated by social apathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lockwood et al., 2017)</ref>. Reasoning along these lines, one could hypothesise that higher levels of social apathy would correlate with lower levels of behavioural change inspired by inter-collaborator differences in ability. To avoid overlooking potential overlap between apathy as a personality trait and more traditional personality traits, we also measured the typical Big Five <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(O'Connor, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>After expressing interest, potential participants were approached via email to schedule a testing session. They were also requested to complete an online questionnaire in advance, which included questions on demographic data, Big-Five personality domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gosling, Rentfrow, &amp; Swann, 2003)</ref>, and apathy in the behavioural, social, and emotional domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ang et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Informed consent to completing the questionnaire was acquired at the start of the online session.</p><p>Informed consent to participation in the testing session was acquired in written form before the start of the session.</p><p>Testing sessions took place in Lund University's 'Digital Classroom', which contains 25 computers with eye trackers (SMI RED-m at the time of testing) that are connected to the same network, and can share data in real-time. For details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(NystrÃ¶m, Niehorster, Cornelissen, &amp; Garde, 2017)</ref>. Participants were each assigned a cardboard cubicle that contained a desk with a computer and an eye tracker <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>. All computers were connected to the same network, and controlled from a master computer. During a testing session, participants first completed an individual visual short-term memory assessment (described below). When all participants finished, their eye trackers were calibrated.</p><p>After calibration, participants performed a collaborative task (described below) with randomly assigned partners. Participants were unaware of who their partner was, as they were not identified within the game. Because participants were inside a cubicle that blocked others from view, and were instructed to remain silent throughout the game, there were no external cues through which partners could be identified.</p><p>We aimed to run three consecutive collaborative tasks per testing session, with new pairings on every run. We succeeded in this aim in all but one session, in which we did not have time for a third collaborative task run (consenting and calibrating 10 participants took longer than anticipated).</p><p>Testing sessions did not last longer than 1 hour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited through advertisement on informal channels at Lund University, including physical and digital notice boards. In addition, we advertised with the Lund International Society of Psychology (LISP) by offering a free MSc-level lecture on the applications of eye tracking in psychological research (attendants were encouraged but not mandated to participate). In total, 41 individuals expressed interest and completed our pre-participation questionnaires. Out of those, 3 individuals took part in a pilot, and 32 individuals in a testing session. This number includes two authors, who each participated once, in sessions where an odd number of participants showed up. Participants were compensated for their time with gift cards that were valid in a variety of local shops.</p><p>A total of seven sessions were run. The first (N=3) was a pilot session to test whether the setup worked as expected, and did not yield usable data. The following six sessions (N=9 + author Niehorster, N=4, N=2, N=4, N=4, N=3 + author Dalmaijer) ran smoothly, with the exception of the malfunction of one computer that interrupted two pairs in the first session. In addition, we had to exclude one session were anonymisation was compromised due to only two of the scheduled participants showing up.</p><p>The testing sessions yielded usable data from 32 unique pairs of individuals. These individuals (N=26, 7 males, 19 females) had a mean age of 25.7 years with a standard deviation of 4.1 and a range of 21-38 years, varied in highest completed education from high school to doctorate</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIVISION OF LABOUR IN COGNITIVE COLLABORATION</head><p>(2 high school, 14 Bachelor, 7 Master, 3 Doctorate), and had a variety of nationalities (Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, India, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual visual short-term memory capacity assessment</head><p>The individual short-term memory assessment aimed to test participants' capacity to recall and reproduce visual information <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). It consisted of 80 trials, during each of which or 4 items with a unique orientation were presented for 5 seconds. This was followed by a maintenance period of 3 seconds during which the items were masked. The maintenance period ended with the appearance of the mouse cursor, and a circle around one of the (still masked) items. Participants could then use the computer mouse to precisely indicate the orientation of the probed item as they remembered it. On the first click, the mask was replaced by an item that was oriented toward the current mouse position. Participants could hold down the mouse button while moving the cursor to rotate the item to the remembered orientation, and press the space key to confirm.</p><p>The items were sinusoidal gratings with a diameter of 1.5 degrees of visual angle, and a spatial frequency of five cycles per stimulus. Each item had a unique and randomly generated orientation that differed from the other items by at least ten degrees. Item locations were also randomly generated on each trial, were separated by at least 3.35 degrees of visual angle, and avoided areas near the screen edge (left/right borders were defined as 10% of the screen width, and top/down as 10% of the screen height). Masks were noise patches with the same diameter as the gratings. Each trial was preceded by a centrally presented fixation cross, which was visible for a randomly selected interval between 1 and 1.5 seconds. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> -Experimental procedure in two visual short-term memory tasks. In these tasks, participants see a number of items for a limited amount of time, then hold them in memory for three seconds, after which one of the items is probed. The orientation of the probed item can be adjusted by participants, who are asked to reproduce the memorised orientation. The individual assessment was designed to estimate individual participants' visual short-term memory capacity. The collaborative game was designed to allow participants to divide memory items between them in any way they preferred. Participants received direct visual feedback on what items they and their collaborator claimed.</p><p>We computed errors as the circular distance between a participant's responses and the original orientation of items (i.e. the difference in angle between a probed item and the associated response). For each participant, we established an error distribution for both the two-item and the four-item condition (40 trials each). These error distributions were fitted (using a maximumlikelihood procedure) to a mixture model (Equation 1) that described the probability density function of responses, and estimated the proportion of trials in which an item was forgotten Î² (guesses), the proportion of trials in which the response to one item was made with another item in mind Î³ ("swap errors"), and the precision of recall Ï that was defined as the converted spread parameter (analogous to a normal distributions standard deviation) of a Von Mises distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bays, Catalao, &amp; Husain, 2009)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p (Î¸)=(1âÎ³âÎ²)Ï Ï (Î¸âÎ¸)+ Î³ 1 2 Ï +Î² Ï Ï (Î¸âÎ¸ * ) (1)</formula><p>Where:</p><p>Î¸ are a participant's responses on each trial in either the 2-item or 4-item condition -Î¸ are the orientations of the probed item on each trial -Î¸* are the orientations of the non-probed items on each trial</p><p>After establishing the proportion of trials in which participants did not guess, and the precision of their recall in those trials, we could estimate their visual short-term memory capacity Îº (Equation 2). Specifically, we computed the Kullback-Leibler divergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kullback &amp; Leibler, 1951)</ref> between the probability density function that fitted their non-guessed responses best (Equation 3), and the probability density function that describes pure guessing (Equation 4). This metric quantifies the information gain when a participant remembers an item instead of randomly guessing its orientation. An approximation of visual short-term memory capacity Îº (in bits) can be computed by multiplying the Kullback-Leibler divergence by the amount of to-be-remembered items n. Note that here, swap errors are counted towards the computation of memory capacity Îº.</p><p>Although swap errors originate from information that was bound to the wrong item, this information was stored in visual short-term memory, and should thus count towards its maximum capacity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Îº=n â« âÏ Ï p (x) log 2 p( x) q( x) dx (2)</formula><p>Where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p (x)=(1âÎ³)Ï Ï (x)+ Î³ 1 2 Ï (3) q (x)= 1 2 Ï<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The final estimate for each participant's visual short-term memory capacity was obtained by averaging the estimates of Îº obtained from the 2-item and 4-item conditions. The associated unit is bits of information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Joint visual short-term memory task</head><p>We designed a joint short-term memory task that was similar in concept to the individual task described above <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. In each trial, a pair had to memorise a total of eight items (the same sinusoidal gratings as in the individual task). After a maintenance period of 3 seconds, each individual was probed to recall one of the items. Responses could again be given by using the mouse to precisely indicate the memorised orientation, as in the individual task. Individual participants within each pair were rewarded with points for their performance (see below for the exact reward scheme). They were shown both their own reward, and the reward that their partner obtained. These rewards were then added together, and equally divided between the participants.</p><p>Hence, participants were not only incentivised to do well, but also to help their collaborator do well.</p><p>Crucially, the individuals in each pair were allowed to claim their own share of the items.</p><p>They could claim an item by looking at an item for 150 ms of longer. After a participant claimed an item, a light shading appeared behind it on their own screen, and a dark shading appeared behind the same item on the other participant's screen. Participants could not claim items that were already claimed. Only claimed items would be probed for a response. If a participant did not claim any items, no item would be probed, and they would be assigned a reward of 0 points. This occurred in only 1 out of all 800 trials. (In this scenario, the other participant would have to claim and remember all eight items.) How many items were claimed by each individual within a pair was determined by the pair.</p><p>They received an instruction that explicitly informed them that they were allowed to divide the items between themselves and their collaborator in any way they saw fit, for example with one participant claiming more than the other, or with both participants claiming equally many. They were also instructed that their pair should attempt to obtain as many points as possible. There was no communication between the individuals beyond being able to see which items were claimed by themselves, and which by their collaborator.</p><p>Pairs were constructed by randomly assigning two participants to the same game. Each pair completed 25 trials, after which each individual indicated on a visual analogue scale how good they thought the collaboration was, how fair they thought their collaborator was, and how likeable they thought their collaborator was. Each individual took part in two or three consecutive collaborative sessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance-dependent group reward</head><p>Choosing the appropriate reward scheme for the joint visual short-term memory task was not a trivial matter. Ideally, individuals were rewarded as a function of their performance. Here, performance (recall error) was defined as the absolute circular difference between the prompted target's orientation and the associated response. This error existed in a space between degrees (perfect recall) and degrees (the largest possible circular distance between target and response).</p><p>The most straightforward scheme would entail a linear relationship between individuals' recall error and their reward. However, recall error is rarely uniformly distributed: Participants are generally more likely to respond around 0 error, with the exact shape of the distribution depending on their visual short-term memory capacity Îº. A non-linear reward scheme, such as a normal distribution, could address this.</p><p>We anticipated three ways to play the joint visual short-term memory game outlined above.</p><p>The first option was an equal division of labour, with each participant claiming half of the items to remember.</p><p>The second option was a proportional division of labour, with each participant claiming a proportion of the items that corresponded to the ratio of participants' visual short-term memory capacities. For example, if one participant's capacity Îº was 4 bits and the other participant's was 2.4 bits, a proportional division of 8 items would have had the higher-capacity participant claim 5 and the lower-capacity participant claim 3.</p><p>Finally, there was a paradoxical division of labour, which could have been optimal depending on how strongly the reward scheme penalised higher errors. Specifically, if low errors were to receive disproportionally larger rewards, the optimal strategy would have been to have the lower-capacity player claim all but one item. The higher-capacity individual would have then claimed only one item, and would thus have achieved a very high reward.</p><p>To illustrate the effect of different reward functions, we simulated the expected joint rewards between two players of different visual short-term memory capacities Îº who divided labour equally,</p><p>proportionally, or paradoxically <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>When only very low errors would receive a high reward (normal distribution with a low standard deviation), a paradoxical division of labour would be optimal, whereas it would be hard to predict when proportional division would work in a pair's favour <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3</ref>, top row).</p><p>When higher errors would be punished less severely (e.g. via a normal distribution with a high standard deviation, or a linear function), paradoxical division of labour would become less ideal. However, although optimal, proportional division would give only a small benefit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3,</ref> bottom two rows).</p><p>The ideal reward function would incentivise proportional division of labour while not making paradoxical division of labour too tempting. Our simulations indicated that this ideal reward function was a normal distribution with a standard deviation that resulted in the incentivisation of low errors without penalising higher errors too strongly <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3, second row)</ref>.</p><p>Because of the outlined simulations, we opted for defining our individual reward function as a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 17 degrees (centred around 0 degrees). This corresponded with the average standard deviation of errors in a pilot experiment using coloured stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dalmaijer, Poullias, Somai, &amp; Husain, 2017)</ref>. The second, third, and fourth column show the expected reward under three different strategies. In the equal strategy, collaborators divide items equally. In the proportional strategy, participants divide items proportionally to their visual short-term memory capacity. In the paradoxical strategy, the lower-capacity player takes on all but one of the items, and the higher-capacity player takes on only one item. The x-axis denotes the visual short-term memory capacity of the first player, and the y-axis that of the second player. The colouring indicates the expected group reward, with brighter colours indicating higher rewards. Finally, the penultimate and rightmost columns indicate the relative improvement of the proportional and paradoxical strategies compared to equal division. These columns show that steep reward functions (disproportionality rewarding lower errors) result in high expected benefits from the paradoxical strategy, whereas less steep reward functions do not. However, less steep reward functions also decrease the expected benefit from using a proportional strategy. The optimal reward function, which incentivises the proportional strategy but not the paradoxical, seems to lie in the middle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>We considered each of the 32 unique pairs an independent measurement. We divided the individuals within each pair as "higher capacity" and "lower capacity", according to their visual short-term memory capacity that was independently determined through the individual assessment.</p><p>Our main hypothesis was that within each pair, the higher-capacity individual would claim more items than the lower-capacity individual. To test this, we used an independent-samples t-test to test whether the average number of claimed items was different between the higher and lowercapacity individuals. We also hypothesised the difference in claimed items would correlate with how participants rated the collaboration, and thus used a linear regression to verify whether the difference in claimed items (relative to the difference in capacity) predicted collaboration judgement of both participants within a pair.</p><p>Earlier research indicated that in joint visual search, two collaborators divide items in search space, for example by dividing the field in a top and a bottom half <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brennan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Niehorster et al., submitted)</ref>. To assess whether this pattern also emerged in our data, we computed the average location of all items claimed by each individual. We then computed the average distance, and the standard deviation of the distance (across trials) between each individuals' average item location.</p><p>The average unsigned distance reflects the extent to which individuals divided the space, and the standard deviation reflects how consistent they were in dividing the space in the same way. We correlated these two outcome measures with the ratings each player assigned the collaboration quality, and the fairness and likeability of their collaborator.</p><p>Finally, to assess the effects of personality traits on division of labour, we computed the differences in personality questionnaire scores between the higher-capacity and lower-capacity individuals within each pair. We then used a multivariable linear regression with the difference in capacity as co-variate, as well as the differences in the subscales of the Apathy Motivation Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ang et al., 2017)</ref> and Big Five personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gosling et al., 2003)</ref> questionnaires.</p><p>Because of our relatively low number of samples, we used Kendall's rank correlation coefficient Ï <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kendall, 1938)</ref>.

As a result, we were left with sufficient power to detect strong effects, but not necessarily to detect weaker effects.</p><p>In addition, we required quite a few comparisons to address our hypotheses. We thus decided on the rather conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dunn, 1961)</ref>. Specifically, we set the statistical significance threshold Î± to 0.05, and performed 23 tests, plus a multivariable regression with 9 predictors (which includes 1 F-test, and 10 t-tests). We thus set our corrected significance threshold to 0.0015 (equivalent to a correction of 34 independent tests). All p values at or below this level will be considered statistically significant.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation checks</head><p>There was a good range in the distribution in errors and associated visual short-term memory capacities computed from the individual assessments ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4A)</ref>. The associated visual short-term memory capacities ranged from Îº=1.41 to Îº=5.65 bits, with a mean of 3.62, and a standard deviation of 1.22.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>No capacity-dependent division of labour</head><p>Our hypothesis was that players would divide the number of items between themselves according to their capacities. However, there was no significant difference in how many items were claimed by the lower and higher-capacity individuals in the joint visual short-term memory game, [t=0.00, p=1.000] <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 5A)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, we computed the capacity ratios of all pairs, where higher numbers indicated a larger discrepancy between the players. We also computed the ratio in the number of items each player claimed, where higher numbers again indicated a larger discrepancy between players. If our hypothesis were true, there should have been a significant correlation between the players' capacity ratio and their claim ratio. This correlation was not observed <ref type="bibr">[Ï=-0.18, p=0.151]</ref>, and in fact nearly all claim ratios were instead close to 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 5B)</ref>.</p><p>These results indicate that participants divided labour equally rather than proportionally. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Division of labour does not affect collaboration perception</head><p>To assess whether the division of labour affected collaboration perception, we computed the discrepancy between expected (based on capacity ratios) and actual (based on claim ratios) division of labour. This was simply the signed difference between the claim ratio and the capacity ratio (claim minus capacity), where positive values indicated that the higher-capacity player within a pair claimed more items than they should have (if players divided items proportionally to their capacities), and negative values that the lower-capacity player over-claimed.</p><p>We hypothesised that players would have rated the collaboration better when they and their collaborator had shared items proportionally. Hence, we expected a correlation between the difference in claim and capacity ratios on the one hand, and the average collaboration rating on the other. However, there was no statistically significant relationship between the claim-capacity disproportionality and the rating of how good the collaboration was given by higher-capacity individuals [Ï=0.01, p=0.961], nor with that given by lower-capacity individuals <ref type="bibr">[Ï=0.09, p=0.484]</ref> ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6A)</ref>. The same was true for the ratings given by higher-capacity [Ï=-0.10, p=0.426] and lower-capacity individuals' [Ï=0.31, p=0.014, not significant at Î±=0.0015 ] of how fair the other player was <ref type="figure">(Figure 6B)</ref>, and for the ratings given by higher-capacity [Ï=0.04, p=0.733] and lowercapacity individuals' [Ï=-0.03, p=0.833] of how likeable the other player was <ref type="figure">(Figure 6C)</ref>.</p><p>These results indicate that participants did not factor in proportional division of labour in their appreciation of the quality of their collaboration, or the fairness or likeability of their collaborator. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> -Correlations between the disproportionality between the visual short-term memory capacity and claimed items ratios within each pair. Negative disproportionality values (x-axis) indicate the lower-capacity player (blue) claimed more items than they perhaps should have given their short-term memory capacity, whereas positive values indicate the higher-capacity player (pink) claimed more. A disproportionality of 0 constitutes perfectly proportional division of labour. There was no correlation between disproportionality and ratings of collaboration quality (A), collaborator fairness (B), and collaborator likeability (C) given by either of the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collaboration perception was driven by behavioural volatility</head><p>We hypothesised that division of items according to their position on the screen would affect collaboration perception. Specifically, participants in joint visual search have been shown to regularly divide the item space in two halves, even when their only means of communication was real-time feedback on where the other participant was looking <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brennan et al., 2008)</ref>. Because the spatial structure and feedback matches this type of experiment, we hypothesised that adherence to the same type behaviour would have positively affected collaboration perception.</p><p>To verify this, we computed the average location of items claimed within each trial by each participant within a pair. We then computed the average distance between these locations within each pair, where higher values indicated that participants divided the search space to a higher degree. In addition, we computed the standard deviation of the distance between the players within each pair, where higher values indicated less consistent behaviour.</p><p>There were no statistically significant correlations between the average inter-player distance and collaboration ratings given by higher-capacity <ref type="bibr">[Ï=0.17, p=0.178]</ref>   <ref type="figure">(Figure 7, top row)</ref>.</p><p>There were statistically significant relationships between the standard deviation of the interplayer distance and ratings given by higher-capacity individuals on good collaboration [Ï=-0.49, Although lower-capacity players showed the same pattern, the relationship between the standard deviation of the inter-player distance and ratings given by lower-capacity individuals on good  <ref type="figure">(Figure 7, bottom row)</ref>.</p><p>These results indicate that at least the higher-capacity players rated the quality of collaboration, as well as the fairness and likeability of their collaborator, lower as a function of the variability of the distance between each collaborators' claimed items.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apathy and Big Five traits affect number of claimed items</head><p>A secondary objective of our study was to assess the effects of apathy as measured by the Apathy Motivation Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ang et al., 2017)</ref> and Big Five personality traits as measured via a brief questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gosling et al., 2003)</ref> on the number of items participants claim. Within each pair, we computed the difference between the higher-capacity and lower-capacity player in the following independently assessed traits: visual short-term capacity (measured in our independent assessment); behavioural activation apathy, social motivation apathy, and emotional stability (Apathy Motivation Index subscales); extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness (Big Five subscales). We then used these nine differences as co-variates in a linear multivariable regression to predict the differences in the average number of claimed items between the higher and lower capacity players within each pair.</p><p>The total difference in the number of claimed items was statistically significantly predicted by the complete model [F(9,22) = 5.81, p&lt;0.001].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In a new collaborative visual short-term memory task, we leveraged individual differences in cognitive ability, and employed a non-linear performance reward structure to incentivise collaboration between randomly assigned pairs of participants. Paired individuals did not know who their collaborator was, and could not communicate verbally, but they did receive real-time feedback on each other's behaviour. Our results indicate that collaborators did not share their cognitive workload proportionally to their individual capacities, but instead divided labour equally.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of adherence to proportional division did not affect individuals' ratings of the collaboration's quality, nor their collaborator's fairness or likeability. Instead, collaboration ratings correlated strongly with the variability in the distance between locations of items claimed by each individual. Interestingly, this variability did not correlate with individuals' performance, and was thus irrelevant to the task. Finally, our results suggest that individual differences in social apathy and conscientiousness correlated with differences in the proportion of labour within a pair.</p><p>Others have recently demonstrate the existence of an equality bias among collaborators who had to make a shared perceptual decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mahmoodi et al., 2015)</ref>. That work suggested pairs of collaborators value each other's opinion equally, even when one collaborator was markedly better (whether naturally, or through experimenter manipulation). What remained unclear was whether a discrepancy in collaborators' ability would prompt the higher-ability individual to help the lowerability individual.</p><p>Our task differed from Mahmoodi and colleagues' study in that it allowed collaborators to divide labour amongst themselves. Because they received feedback after each trial, collaborators were given the opportunity to assess the difference in ability between them. Furthermore, they were subject to a non-linear group reward scheme that incentivised not only individuals' own performance, but also that of their collaborator. Hence, in our experiment collaborators had information on each other's ability, were able to act on their ability discrepancy by proportionally dividing labour, and also incentivised to do so to maximise reward. However, the vast majority of collaborators opted for dividing items equally, which suggests that the equality bias in opinions demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mahmoodi et al., 2015)</ref> extends to the division of labour.</p><p>Another interesting finding we highlight here is that individuals' rating of the quality of collaboration was unaffected by whether or not labour was shared equally. In fact, particularly the higher-ability individual within each pair instead rated the collaboration quality less high as a function of the variability in their pair's behaviour. Specifically, if the distance between their own and their collaborator's average location of claimed items varied a lot between trials, they were more likely to rate the collaboration as less good, and also to rate their collaborator as less fair and less likeable. This is despite the fact this distance variability did not correlate with performance, and was thus unrelated to reward.</p><p>Earlier work suggests that participants in collaborative cognitive tasks prefer to divide their workspace in halves <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brennan &amp; Enns, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brennan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Neider et al., 2010)</ref>, and minimise overlap in self-assigned workspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Niehorster et al., 2019)</ref>. This maximises the distance between collaborators, perhaps so they avoid getting in each other's way. Our work suggests that it is not the distance between collaborators, but instead the trial-to-trial consistency in distance that determines the perceived collaboration quality. Hence, behavioural stability is a trait that individuals seem to prefer in their collaborators.</p><p>Finally, the results presented here indicate that inter-collaborator differences in cognitive ability (visual short-term memory capacity) did not drive labour division, but that differences in personality traits do. Specifically, inter-collaborator differences in lack of social motivation, or 'social apathy' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ang et al., 2017)</ref>, correlated with differences in the number of items each claimed.</p><p>The same is true for the Big Five personality trait conscientiousness, albeit in the opposite direction.</p><p>Note that these findings should be interpreted more carefully, as they originate from difference scores (which obscure directionality), and because they originate from a model with a large number of co-variates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions</head><p>We should note that the research presented here is highly exploratory, and that our sample of 32 pairs only provided enough statistical power to detect large effects. We took this into account in our statistical analyses by being conservative and applying a stringent Bonferroni correction, resulting in a statistical significance threshold of 0.0015. Although we are reasonably confident that the behavioural effects we report are robust, we would like to stress the possibility of smaller effects having gone undetected. We have published our methods and data in a public repository, and invite other researchers to use these tools to replicate and extend our findings (see https://github.com/esdalmaijer/2017_Lund_Collaborative_short-term_memory_game).</p><p>There are several potential explanations for why participants divided their cognitive labour equally in our joint visual short-term memory task. We interpret this finding as an extension of previously reported equality bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mahmoodi et al., 2015)</ref>. However, one could also take participants' reluctance to unequal division of labour as a protection against "free loading": Perhaps higher-capacity individuals did not want lower-capacity individuals to benefit from their additional labour. Although our reward scheme would have ensured the higher-capacity individual in this scenario to also benefit from proportionally shared labour, it cannot be ruled out that highercapacity individuals either did not pick up on this, or weighted preventing "free loading" over their own increase in reward. Finally, one could argue that our reward scheme was too complicated for participants to comprehend, particularly because they were not allowed to communicate, and that this made them default into equal sharing. Although readers of this manuscript can appreciate the complexity of the employed reward scheme, individual participants in our experiment could not: To them, better recall accuracy translated into higher rewards, particularly when their own and their partner's recall were highly precise. This direct dependency on not just their own recall precision but also their partner's was made very apparent in every trial's feedback screen.</p><p>Future studies could adopt the tools presented here to investigate what drives equal sharing of labour. The results presented here do not conclusively distinguish between competing explanations: Are participants unable to determine their partner's short-term memory capacity from feedback, do they not consider capacity in their judgement of what division is fair, or are they more concerned with preventing "free loading"? This could in part be investigated by asking participants to rate their partners' capacity, or by explicitly telling pairs what each individual's capacity is.</p><p>It would be interesting to follow up our finding that more stable division of stimulus space was related to better collaboration ratings. Researchers could implicitly encourage pairs to divide the stimuli by introducing a visual divide between two groups of stimuli, for example through different colouring or spatial separation. This should lead to improved collaboration ratings over the randomised stimulus locations employed here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, we explored collaborative behaviour in a novel joint visual short-term memory task, and found that collaborators divide cognitive labour equally between them. This was true even when there was a large discrepancy between collaborators' (independently assessed)</p><p>short-term memory capacities, and when dividing labour proportionally would have yielded higher group rewards. Paradoxically, participants did not weigh proportional division of labour into their rating of collaboration quality. Instead, high collaboration ratings were associated with low behavioural variability, despite this not relating to group performance.</p><p>We conclude that in a collaborative task with clear performance feedback but without verbal communication, individuals prefer to divide labour equally and in a consistent pattern, even when proportional division would be optimal.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Lund University's Digital Classroom setup.
