			<abstract>
				<p>This study explores how non-verbal displays of high social rank influence observers&apos; decision-making in dyadic negotiations. We hypothesized that recipients&apos; displays of both dominance and prestige would increase a negotiator&apos;s likelihood of proposing a fair offer, with dominance being effective only when power asymmetry heightens compliance pressure. In a preregistered experiment (N = 309), participants played the role of the proposer in an Ultimatum Game after competing with another person in three tasks that determined social rank. We found that participants (proposers) were more likely to offer a fair share of money to a responder displaying prestige after being outperformed in the tasks. In contrast, when faced with a dominant-displaying responder who outperformed them, participants did not increase their offers compared to a neutral condition without power asymmetry, suggesting that dominance did not elicit fairness even under compliance pressure. A path model revealed that the responder&apos;s display of authentic (but not hubristic) pride mediated the impact of rank differentiation on proposers&apos; fairness-driven decision-making. These results suggest that prestige, rather than dominance, is more effective in facilitating negotiation within a power hierarchy.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expression of Prestige through Authentic Pride, not Dominance through Hubristic Pride, Promotes Fairness in Ultimatum Bargaining</head><p>We make decisions every day, but these decisions are rarely made in isolation. They often depend on what others afford us. Negotiation is at the core of this interdependent decisionmaking process, as it serves as a means for individuals or groups to resolve conflicts, allocate resources, and reach agreements. The nuance of negotiation arises from the power asymmetries between the parties involved-a common feature in various contexts, such as corporate meetings, salary negotiations, trade agreements, labor union discussions, diplomatic relations, and legal settlements.</p><p>In typical negotiation, one side has more power than the other. Power is an individual's capacity to influence others' states, actions, or outcomes in a desired direction through asymmetric control over valued resources, whether these resources are tangible (e.g., material, economic) or intangible (e.g., social capital, information, status) (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Galinsky et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Keltner et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008)</ref>. The literature broadly identifies four ways in which powerful individuals or groups influence negotiation outcomes: (1) alternatives-the strength of one's alternatives to a negotiated agreement; <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(2)</ref> information-knowledge about the negotiation itself, including the other party's preferences, limits, and needs; (3) status: being respected or holding a high regard in the eyes of their counterpart; and (4) social capital-the network of relationships and connections a negotiator has <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Galinsky et al., 2017)</ref>. By harnessing any of these sources of power, negotiators tend to have a higher probability of achieving their ideal outcome (but not necessarily mutual benefits).</p><p>This article aims to shed light on the interaction between power and non-verbal displays in shaping negotiation outcomes in dyads. To do so, we integrate insights from two major POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION theories: the dual-strategies theory of social rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cheng et al., 2013)</ref> and the emotions-as-socialinformation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Van Kleef et al., 2010)</ref>. Our focus is on how different expressions of social rank, particularly signaled through non-verbal and emotional expressions of dominance (indicating competition and hubris) or prestige (indicating cooperation and authenticity), influence the observer's decision making in the context of ultimatum bargaining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information Asymmetry and Power Dynamics in Negotiation</head><p>In our study, we specifically explore one source of power, information. Several studies have explored power dynamics of information in negotiations using the Ultimatum Game <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Güth et al., 1982)</ref>. In this game, a proposer offers a portion of a fixed amount to a responder, who can either accept or reject the offer, with rejection resulting in no payout for either party. The Ultimatum Game models marketplace negotiations, such as those between retailers and buyers, where one party often holds more information than the other. This information asymmetry is particularly advantageous for the retailer, who may possess exclusive knowledge-such as the true prices of products-that the buyer lacks. Similarly, in hiring negotiations, candidates may be pressured to accept offers from employers who might otherwise withhold counteroffers to other candidates. In such situations, powerful negotiators can propose unfair deals, unbeknownst to the receiver, by exploiting their information asymmetry to maximize their own gains.</p><p>Experimental studies confirm that proposers often exploit such information asymmetries at the expense of less-informed responders when they are allowed to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Besancenot et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chavanne &amp; Ferreira, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000)</ref>. However, Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Dijk and Vermunt (2000)</ref> argued that in such negotiation scenarios, when both parties are aware of the true prices or payoffs, the power dynamic shifts to the responder (e.g., buyer or job candidate) who can have a final say to ultimately decide the joint outcome. This is indeed the default setting POWER, <ref type="bibr">EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION of the Ultimatum Game (Thielmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Van Dijk &amp; De Dreu, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Van Dijk et al., 2020)</ref>. In such a scenario, negotiations yield fairer outcomes for the responder, because the proposer cares more about fairness than strategic gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000)</ref>. Overall, these findings suggest that whereas information asymmetry can enable negotiators to exploit their advantage in ultimatum bargaining, concerns for fairness can still lead to fair outcomes, even with power asymmetry implicit in in negotiation scenarios. The likelihood of achieving fair deals for both parties, therefore, often depends on which party holds more power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How Power Is Communicated Makes a Difference</head><p>We propose that the impact of power in negotiations depends on the motivations behind how individuals achieve, signal, and maintain their power, as well as how these motivations are perceived by the other party. This perspective addresses a gap in the literature, where sources of power are often implicit rather than explicitly examined. In economic game experiments, power distribution is typically constrained by the game structure, leaving unclear the justification for why certain individuals should possess superior power. As a result, powerless <ref type="bibr">(or powerful)</ref> participants often accept the existing power asymmetries without question. However, outside of laboratory settings, the justification for power has significant implications, as attributes such as gender, overconfidence, narcissism, and attractiveness can grant unqualified individuals power <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Berger et al., 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Grosz et al., 2020)</ref>. In market negotiations, for example, a buyer may want to know whether the retailer is knowledgeable, and this perception should influence the final outcome. When power is assumed without valid information, negotiations risk granting authority to the incompetent, leading to undesriable decisions.</p><p>Contrary to the naïve view that participants passively accept power imbalance in economic games, we propose that people actively seek to assess the source of power, asking, POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION "Does this individual deserve power?" Observers form impressions of a negotiator's power through minimal expressive behaviors, such as facial expressions, gestures, and vocal tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ambady &amp; Rosenthal, 1992)</ref>. These interpersonal cues are crucial in negotiation contexts, where information about the counterpart is often limited, and judgments must be made under great uncertainty. De Dreu and Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kleef (2004)</ref> corroborate this insight, finding that powerless negotiators often adapt their strategies based on whether, through subtle signals, they perceive their counterpart as competitive or cooperative. To explore these nuanced effects on negotiation outcomes, we focus on how the powerful and powerless perceive each other, specifically examining two ways in which individuals establish and maintain social rank in hierarchies: dominance and prestige.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Strategies for Attaining Social Rank: Dominance and Prestige</head><p>There is a variety of individual differences in motivations and strategies to attain, signal, and maintain power <ref type="bibr">(Mitchell et al., 2020)</ref>. According to the dual-strategies theory of social rank, individuals navigate power hierarchies through two fundamental strategies: dominance and prestige <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cheng et al., 2013)</ref>. Some individuals seek a high rank through dominance, a strategy characterized by coercive tactics such as threat and aggression. Others strive for prestige by demonstrating culturally valued expertise and competency. Although dominance is commonly observed in many primate societies where physical combat is frequent <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen Zeng et al., 2022)</ref>, prestige is relatively unique to humans whose communities are built around cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Henrich &amp; Gil-White, 2001</ref>). The dual-strategies theory formulates these tactics as personal preferences in how individuals try to achieve social ranks in contemporary hierarchies. These preferences are associated with specific personality traits consistently across societies: dominantseekers tend to be aggressive, arrogant, antisocial, disagreeable, and unlikable; prestige-seekers POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION tend to be communal, confident, altruistic, extraverted, and likable <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cheng et al., , 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Körner et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Liu et al., 2012)</ref>. Research in hunter-gatherer societies and modern groups show that both dominant and prestigious individuals do gain and maintain higher ranks in groups, and followers ascribe power to those individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cheng et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McClanahan et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Von Rueden et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonverbal Displays of Dominance and Prestige</head><p>Dominance and prestige communicate distinct visual cues that are easily recognized by observers. The dual-strategies theory posits that dominance is characterized by expansiveness, the absence of smiles, and a downward head tilt, whereas prestige is signaled by expansiveness, smiling, and an upward head tilt <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Witkower et al., 2020)</ref>. These cues reflect non-verbal expressions of power studied in various research contexts, including the expression of emotions such as anger and fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carney, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hall et al., 2005)</ref>. These non-verbal differences correspond with the emotions of hubristic and authentic pride, which underlie the motivations of dominant and prestigious individuals. Hubristic pride, associated with arrogance, is typical of dominant individuals, whereas authentic pride, characterized by self-confidence, is common among prestigious individuals . These experiences of pride reliably emerge when one achieves a higher social rank: hubristic pride co-occurs with general negative emotions such as hostility and aggression; authentic pride is accompanied by general positive emotions such as joy <ref type="bibr">(Kusano &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emotions as Social Information</head><p>Understanding how dominance and prestige influence negotiation outcomes requires examining how negotiators perceive and respond to displays of social rank from the other party.</p><p>The emotions-as-social-information model <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Van Kleef et al., 2010)</ref> suggests that people rely on POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION others' emotional expressions to infer whether a situation calls for competition or cooperation, guiding their decisions in uncertain social interactions. In negotiation studies, these inferences play a significant role. For example, Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kleef et al. (2004)</ref> found that an angry expression from a negotiator was more effective than a happy one in eliciting concessions from the other party, as it signaled a tough stance and prompted receivers to concede more to avoid potential conflict, especially when negotiators were motivated by strategic interests. <ref type="bibr">Similarly, Van Dijk et al. (2008)</ref> found that in the Ultimatum Game, proposers offered the most to an angry responder out of fear of rejection. However, when proposers had the opportunity to deceive (knowing the true value of monetary tokens when the responder did not), they made the lowest offers to angry responders. In contrast, when responders expressed joy, proposers were more inclined to propose fair deals, regardless of whether deception was available <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Van Dijk et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>We propose that these findings extend to the distinction between dominance and prestige within the emotions-as-social-information framework. Social information signaled through emotions can serve as information power. Dominance, signaled through anger and toughness, may elicit strategic concessions due to perceived threat and competition, whereas prestige, associated with prosocial emotions, may foster fairer and more cooperative outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Varying Effects of Dominance, Prestige, and Related Emotions on Negotiation</head><p>Other negotiation studies employing emotional expression as cues can be interpreted within the emotions-as-social-information model. Several studies in the literature support this hypothesis, indicating that social information can improve negotiation outcomes by promoting assertive and dominant behaviors. These behaviors not only enhance a negotiator's confidence but also effectively communicate their intentions and preferences, leading to greater gains of the dominant <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Pike &amp; Galinsky, 2020)</ref>. Moreover, expressing anger has been shown to make POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION negotiators appear tougher and less susceptible to their opponents' strategies for claiming value, with angry negotiators achieving higher value claims than their happier counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Overbeck et al., 2010)</ref>. The perception of threat and anger by the negotiator can lead to increased concessions from their counterpart <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sinaceur et al., 2011)</ref>. In negotiations, the expression of dominance can improve joint outcomes as the powerless party tends to yield to the powerful <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Wiltermuth et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Wiltermuth et al., , 2018</ref>. Collectively, these findings generate a testable hypothesis that the display of dominance-related emotions by someone in a higher rank can enhance joint outcomes, not because they signal a willingness to cooperate, but because the competitive intent induces submission or compliance from the powerless individual.</p><p>Nonetheless, displaying dominant emotions can backfire. In a public goods dilemma game, players cooperated less with partners who displayed hubristic pride rather than authentic pride, as the former was perceived as arrogant and unlikable <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Wubben et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Similarly, Van Dijk et al. (2008)</ref> found that negotiation outcomes varied depending on the opportunity to deceive the other party (i.e., presence of information asymmetry). When confronted with angry responders, negotiators made fair offers to avoid rejection; however, when deception was possible, proposers exploited the angry responder by making unfair offers. Put simply, the power of dominance in negotiation may depend on whether the situation allows concessions from the powerless. When the situation affords equality, the power of dominance may wane.</p><p>Unlike dominance, the display of prestige may generally be more effective in eliciting fairness-driven allocations in negotiations because it signals competence, positive moods, and cooperative intent. Several studies have demonstrated how even a minor social rank can increase coordinated negotiation. Lower-ranked individuals tended to offer more money to higher-ranked individuals who displayed some form of competence in something as simple as a "trivia quiz," POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION highlighting the potential role of prestige in enhancing genuine cooperation among low-ranking negotiators <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ball &amp; Eckel, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ball et al., 2001)</ref>. In a public goods dilemma game, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Wubben et al. (2012)</ref> found that players cooperated more with partners who displayed authentic pride, which signaled likability. Similarly, happy responders generally elicited fairer allocations in the Ultimatum Game, even when proposers had information power: the chance to deceive them by withholding the true value of the tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Van Dijk et al., 2008)</ref>. Prestige may also facilitate coordination by signaling trust and fairness in negotiations, as seen in trust games where trustees' genuine smiles increased trustors' endowments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Centorrino et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Scharlemann et al., 2001</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Study Design and Hypotheses</head><p>Our study has two goals. First, we aim to conceptually replicate and extend Van Dijk et al.'s (2008) economic game experiments, which examined how the proposer's power interacted with the responder's emotional expressions (anger vs. joy) in the Ultimatum Game. Second, we seek to provide, to our knowledge, the first experimental test of the dual-strategies theory of social rank in a negotiation context. This theory posits that dominance and prestige are two distinct yet effective tactics for shaping power hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cheng et al., 2013)</ref>. To explore how power influences negotiation outcomes, we integrate insights from the dual-strategies theory with the emotions-as-social-information model <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Van Kleef et al., 2010)</ref>, which links social information to competitive (dominant) or cooperative (prestigious) expressions. We examine how two sources of information power-one structured by the game and the other conveyed through the responder's expressions-interact to produce different negotiation outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulating Power by Inducing Asymmetric Information</head><p>Given that the proposer's offer in the Ultimatum Game depends partly on their perception 10 POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION of the responder, the game can be modified to change the power balance between participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000)</ref>. In our study, we manipulate two source of power. First, we manipulated proposer's power by providing them with asymmetric (vs. transparent) information about the actual token prices, unknown (known) to the responder. The asymmetric condition enabled proposers to secure a better final deal than the responder appeared to believe. Such asymmetric information simulates dishonest retailers who maximize profits by concealing true product prices from consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Van Dijk et al., 2020)</ref>. Our implementation of the Ultimatum Game therefore replicates previous experiments in which proposers with asymmetric information were inclined to leverage this power by withholding true token prices from less informed responders <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Besancenot et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chavanne &amp; Ferreira, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulating Social Rank by Expressions of Dominance and Prestige</head><p>Second, we manipulated power of social information: whether responders (the simulated partner) displayed either dominance (hubristic pride, hostility, aggression) or prestige (authentic pride, joy) after going through a rank differentiation. We based our rationale on the previous experiment by Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Dijk et al. (2008)</ref>, in which the effect of asymmetric information interacted with responder's emotional (verbal) expression. In their study, proposers tended to make higher offers to angry responders compared to happy responders when the responders had asymmetric information unknown to the proposers (i.e., concession). When proposers had asymmetric information unknown to the responder, allowing them to deceive angry responders, they were willing to offer the lowest shares of money. Critically, however, whether proposers had asymmetric information or not made no difference when responders appeared happy. Our study extended the logic to the non-verbal expressions of dominance and prestige.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION</head><p>We employed a 2 (Information: Transparent vs. Asymmetric) x 3 (Expression: Neutral vs. Dominance vs. Prestige) between-subjects design. Within this framework, we tested three pre-registered hypotheses, each tailored to the specific context of the Ultimatum Game (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Hypothesis 1 predicts that when both players have equal information about the true value of the tokens (transparent information), a responder displaying dominance (e.g., hubristic pride, anger) will elicit higher offers from the proposer compared to the neutral condition, driven by a desire to make concessions. Hypothesis 2 predicts that the dominant responder's influence diminishes under asymmetric information (where only the proposer knows the true token values), leading the proposer to offer less than in the neutral condition, as dominance loses its persuasive power. Hypothesis 3 predicts that, regardless of the information condition (transparent or asymmetric), proposers will offer more to responders displaying prestige (e.g., authentic pride, joy) compared to the neutral condition, due to increased concerns about fairness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>To enhance the internal validity of our experiment, we sought to overcome previous methodological limitations. The experiments studying the relation between emotion and  <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sinaceur et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Van Dijk et al., 2008)</ref>. We used non-verbal displays of dominance and prestige validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Witkower et al. (2020)</ref>. We embedded these displays within a contest that induces a social rank-a winner and a loser-similar to the experiments with trivia quizzes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ball &amp; Eckel, 1996)</ref>. This was ideal given that the dualstrategies theory of social rank considers both dominance and prestige as competent and effective, with both arising from achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cheng et al., 2013)</ref>. This method provides a direct experimental test of the dual-strategies theory by a manipulation of expressions after achieving a high social rank. Data, experimental materials, sample &amp; budget justification, and predictions are available (https://osf.io/auhr9/?view_only=f92bdee7b94a4fbe8d2d4f76efdcee8c). Below, we report deviations from the original plan whenever appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Ultimatum Game</head><p>We adopted the Ultimatum Game <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Güth et al., 1982)</ref> to examine power asymmetry and its effects on negotiation dynamics. In this game, two players allocate monetary tokens: the proposer, who makes the initial offer, and the responder, who can either accept or reject it. The proposer receives a pool of tokens and offers a portion to the responder. If the responder accepts, both players receive the proposed amounts; if the responder rejects, neither player gets anything.</p><p>The game features asymmetric dependence, in which by default the responder holds more power than the proposer because the former ultimately determines the final outcome <ref type="formula">(</ref> In this context, decision-making of the proposer in the Ultimatum Game is considered to reflect prosocial preferences driven by fairness in reaching an agreement <ref type="bibr">(Thielmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Van Dijk et al., 2020)</ref>. Although the stake size might appear too small to fully engage participants, prior research suggests that increasing the stakes has minimal impact on proposers' offers <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Larney et al., 2019)</ref>, indicating that higher stakes should not critically alter incentives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>As the current experiment is building on Experiment 2 of Van Dijk et al. <ref type="formula">2008</ref>, we considered the effect size of the significant interaction effect observed in their original study. We initially aimed for a sample size of 158 (approximately 30 per each cell), assuming = .05, 80% power, and a medium effect size f = .25, using G*Power <ref type="bibr">(Faul et al., 2009)</ref>. Data collection spanned four academic semesters (the Fall of 2021 to the Spring of 2023), and the data were not analyzed until the end of the Spring 2023. The final sample size was 309 (52% female; 52% white), which was above 2.5 times the original sample size reported in Van Dijk et al. <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref>.</p><p>Participants were recruited through a participant pool and offered course credits at a large public university in North America (see the Appendix for detailed demographic information).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure &amp; Material</head><p>Upon arrival to the laboratory, participants completed a consent form, which emphasized that their final compensation would depend on the outcomes of interactive tasks they would engage in with another participant located in another room. After a brief wait, participants were seated in front of a computer displaying a video of another participant reading from another screen, unaware that the partner was a prerecorded actor. The computer matched the gender of the actor with participants' gender. The experiment was programmed by PsychoPy version 2 POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Peirce et al., 2019)</ref>. The entire session lasted less than 30 minutes for most participants. None of the participants identified the hypotheses and the true purpose of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personality Measures</head><p>Following basic demographic questions, participants answered a battery of questions to assess personality traits of themselves, which are not analyzed here (see Appendix).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rank Differentiation</head><p>Participants learned that (1) they would complete three tasks; (2) overall performance of both players would be announced; and (3) their performance would determine the role they play later in an economic game. We induced rank differentiation by manipulating the performance of the partner across the three very difficult tasks. The three tasks had been pretested to be extremely difficult so that it would appear reasonable for them to be outperformed by the partner.</p><p>In the Prestige and the Dominance conditions, participants received notice at the end of each task that the partner had outperformed them; in the Neutral condition, no such description was displayed. See Appendix for full texts and details of the tasks.</p><p>The Sternberg Memory Test. The computer introduced this task as a measure of participants' short-term memory. Each trial displayed a sequence of 3 to 8 random numbers, followed by a single number. Participants were asked to decide if the single number was in the sequence by pressing "Yes" or "No." After a series of practice trials, participants completed 30 main trials with feedback given in each. In the Dominance and Prestige conditions, participants learned that the partner achieved a score of "29 out of 30 trials correct (Average reaction time = 0.68 seconds)." The Neutral condition received no performance review of the partner.</p><p>The trivia quiz. The task measured advanced knowledge in economy using six multiplechoice quizzes adopted from previous experiments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ball &amp; Eckel, 1998)</ref>. For example, one POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION question asked about the U.S. Federal Budget allocation for national defense in 2020. Each quiz was supplemented with correct answers. In the Dominance and Prestige conditions, the partner was reported to have "4 out of 6 quizzes correct," whereas the Neutral condition received no performance review.</p><p>Person perception task. The task ostensibly assessed participants' interpersonal skills.</p><p>They were instructed to consider the Trolley Problem, deciding whether to intervene or not when a trolley approaches a group of people. The task involved predicting decisions made by other individuals with education and personality information displayed for each target person. After three practice trials and eight main trials, participants were informed of their scores. The computer was programmed to give all participants "3 out of 8 (37.5%)." In the Dominance and Prestige conditions, the partner was reported to have scored "6 out of 8 (75%)," whereas the Neutral condition had no performance review of the partner.</p><p>Performance review. Participants received feedback on their overall performance scores. In the Dominance and Prestige conditions, they saw the following message: "1st place: Your partner; 2nd place: You." In the Neutral condition, they received the following message: "Your partner's score: Average; Your score: Average." Due to programming difficulty, actual inputs of participants on each task were not recorded.</p><p>Exchange of expression. Participants read: "On the next page, you will have 5 seconds to convey your current feelings to your partner through nonverbal expressions. Look at the camera and try to express your emotions. After your recording, your partner will send you a video clip." After participants recorded their expression, the next screen paused for 20 seconds to indicate that the video was being sent to the partner.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Emotional Impressions</head><p>The Hubristic and Authentic Pride Scales . Participants were instructed to rate "how the partner may be feeling right now." The hubristic pride scale included arrogant, conceited, egotistical, pompous, smug, snobbish, and stuck up (a = .93, wtotal = .96).</p><p>The authentic pride scale included accomplished, achieving, confident, fulfilled, productive, selfworth, and successful (a = .97, wtotal = .98). The items were rated on a seven-point scale (1 = Not at all; 7 = Extremely).  Note. Female participants interacted with the female actor; male participants with the male actor. Non-verbal expressions were previously validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Witkower et al. (2020)</ref>. POWER, EMOTION, &amp; NEGOTIATION exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation identified three factors that underlie the 31 items (see Appendix, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure A1</ref> &amp; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref>). We assessed positive affect (a = .94, wtotal = .96), hostile affect (a = .93, wtotal = .97), and negative (a = .85, wtotal = .93).

Participants read statements about the partner and rated how much these statements described their overall impression of the partner. Consistent with Witkower et al. <ref type="formula">2022</ref>, we relied on short versions of each scale. The dominance scale had four items, such as "The person enjoys having control over me" (a = .92, wtotal = .95). The prestige scale had four items, such as "I recognize his/her unique talents and abilities" (a = .85, wtotal = .89).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Ultimatum Game</head><p>Having evaluated the partner, the Ultimatum Game was introduced. In the Dominance and Prestige conditions, participants were assigned as proposers and their partners as responders "based on their prior performance" in the three tasks. In the Neutral condition, role assignment was "random." They learned that the final compensation depended on token allocation, with tokens translating to real money at the end. Participants received 12 tokens and learned that each token was worth $1.00 to them but only $0.50 to the partner.</p><p>Manipulation of asymmetric information. In the Transparent condition, participants learned that the partner was aware of the true price of tokens, whereas in the Asymmetric condition, he/she was not. Specifically, in the Asymmetric condition, the fact that the partner was unaware of this price difference empowered the proposer to deceive the responder. Token allocation. Before making their final decision, participants were reminded once again of (1) the true prices of the tokens and <ref type="formula">2</ref>whether the responder was aware of this information. They were then instructed to indicate the number of tokens they would offer to the other person using an integer scale ranging from 0 to 12, which served as the main dependent variable in the study. In the end, all participants received a rejection from the partner, but they were debriefed afterward to learn that the partner was a computer simulation. Each participant left with $4.00.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation Results</head><p>Impressions of hubristic pride and dominance did not mediate any paths between the experimental manipulation and token allocation. However, impressions of authentic pride and prestige showed significant indirect effects. When examining simple mediations, the impression of prestige marginally mediated the relationship between competency manipulation and token allocation in the prestige condition, with an indirect effect of b = .184, SE = 0.103, p = .076, though not in the dominance condition, b = .089, SE = 0.067, p = .180. However, a similar mediation effect for authentic pride was not reliable in either the prestige condition, b = .625, SE = 0.400, p = .118, or the dominance condition, b = .324, SE = 0.209, p = .120. These results suggest that no single pathway was strong enough to fully mediate the effect of the experimental manipulation on token allocation. Importantly, we found two significant serial mediations. Experimental manipulation of social rank in both the Dominance and the Prestige conditions increased token allocation via increases in impression of authentic pride and prestige <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 6</ref>). That is, the partner's perceived competency increased perception of authentic pride, which increased impression of prestige, which then encouraged greater token allocation: significant indirect effects of the Dominance condition, b = .097, SE = 0.048, p = .045; the Prestige condition, b = .188, SE = 0.093, p = .042.</p><p>This verifies the observation that the Dominance condition did elevate authentic pride and prestige compared to the Neutral condition (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>.

These results support the idea that a higher social rank increases token allocation only to the extent that the competent is perceived to be authentic and prestigious, but not hubristic nor dominant. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We examined how outcomes in dyadic negotiation are shaped by the interaction between two sources of power: the information afforded by the game structure and social rank expressed through dominance and prestige. Specifically, we investigated how impressions of dominance (facilitated by hubristic pride) and prestige (facilitated by authentic pride) influenced prosocial preferences driven by fairness concerns in dyadic interactions. We contextualize our findings within the existing literature and propose directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prestige Promotes Fairness Preferences in Negotiation</head><p>Our experiment and mediation analysis extend previous research by demonstrating that perceptions of authentic pride, following rank differentiation, signaled to observers that the competent individual was prestigious. This perception, in turn, increased observers'preferences for fairness. These findings support a causal link between prestige and prosocial behavior, aligning with one aspect of the dual-strategies theory of social rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cheng et al., 2013)</ref> and the general process outlined by the emotions-as-social-information model <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Van Kleef et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We observed that a prestigious expression prompted proposers to offer a fair 50% (5:5)</p><p>share, which surpasses the conventional 40% (4:6) share typically observed in the Ultimatum Game-a pattern also replicated in our neutral conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Oosterbeek et al., 2004)</ref>. Participants likely offered fair shares to prestigious individuals because they perceived them as deserving of equal rewards for their competence, likability, and cooperative intent. From these findings we infer that negotiators employing prestige tactics may foster mutual trust, even among strangers, during negotiations.</p><p>This mechanism helps explain why prestige-such as being recognized as a "star" player after winning a trivia quiz-enhanced cooperation in earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ball &amp; Eckel, 1996)</ref>, as individuals displaying prestige and authenticity likely encouraged a sense of fairness. More broadly, our findings illustrate how large-scale cooperation can be facilitated by prestige, as fairness lubriates social interactions compared to dominance-based hierarchies, which often lack this element <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Henrich &amp; Gil-White, 2001</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Is Dominance Effective?</head><p>We began our study with the premise that dominant individuals aid negotiation outcomes by prompting concessions from less powerful parties (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wiltermuth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Van Dijk et al., 2008)</ref>. However, our results did not support this prediction. At first glance, our findings align with growing evidence that prestige, rather than dominance, plays a more crucial role in coordinating power hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Boehm, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Durkee et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Garfield et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Garfield et al., , 2020</ref>).</p><p>Yet, a more conservative interpretation of our null results suggests that dominance may be effective under certain conditions not fully captured by our study. <ref type="bibr">McClanahan et al. (2021)</ref> found that in small group tasks over short durations, dominant individuals maintained power without gaining peer respect. However, studies examining longer periods did not support this finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anderson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Redhead et al., 2019)</ref>. In negotiation or coordination scenarios, especially involving larger stakes or groups under strong compliance pressure, dominance may prove more effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our study has notable limitations. Although the effects aligned with expected directions, the manipulation of asymmetric information on proposers did not significantly increase their incentives to exploit responders in the Ultimatum Game, contrary to previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chavanne &amp; Ferreira, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Besancenot et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000)</ref>. Future studies should examine the robustness of the impact of asymmetric information on deception in the Ultimatum Game through high-powered, pre-registered replications.</p><p>Second, participants exhibited little fear of rejection in the Ultimatum Game, even when facing dominant responders, though the effects were in the expected direction. Fear of rejection may only become salient when decisions carry higher stakes; an allocation of $12.00 might have been too modest to evoke significant concern (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Larney et al., 2019)</ref>. Another potential reason could be endogeneity-where anticipating the responder's internal state influences the fear of rejection. If participants believed their offer would be fair enough to be accepted, they likely reported lower fear of rejection due to this assurance. In other words, explicitly asking about fear of rejection in the Ultimatum Game might contaminate the decision-making process, which is shaped by participants' psychological state before making an offer. Although the exact cause is unclear, these limitations restricted our ability to fully explore the contingent effects of dominance on concessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Directions</head><p>Despite these limitations, we believe the current results can bridge research areas involving large groups, such as cooperation, organizational behavior, and leadership, through the lens of power and fairness. Extending our research beyond dyadic negotiation scenarios may help us better understand broader decision-making processes and group dynamics, particularly since power asymmetry often undermines group performance in unequal settings (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson &amp; Brown, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Berdahl &amp; Anderson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mannix, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Greer &amp; Chu, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Haslam et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hildreth &amp; Anderson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pai &amp; Bendersky, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Reit &amp; Halevy, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In these contexts, studying social capital as a form of power-which was not examined in our study-might be especially important, as it leverages network-based resources and trust in larger groups. Investigating the mixed effects of power on groups, particularly through paradigms such as the Public Goods Game and Prisoner's Dilemma, or through organizational data, could clarify the effectiveness of dominance (or prestige) tactics in facilitating group coordination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Negotiation involves two interdependent parties, often with one holding more power than the other. This power asymmetry can either improve or impede the negotiation outcome, depending on how the power is communicated. Understanding the dynamic role of power, along with how emotions are expressed and perceived in dyadic interactions, has broad implications across various contexts, including corporate management, job recruitment, human resources, policymaking, and trade. For optimal negotiation outcomes, the more powerful party should demonstrate cooperative intentions once they attain power. Don't look dominant. Show prestige.</p></div>

You and your partner will complete the same three tasks, and we will announce overall performance of both of you based on these tasks. Later, the role you play in an Economic Game (the final task) will depend on how well you two solve the three tasks. 4. I am afraid that people will find fault with me.</p><p>5. I often worry that I will say or do the wrong things.</p><p>6. I am frequently afraid of other people noticing my shortcomings.</p><p>7. I worry about what people will think of me even when I know it doesn't make any difference.</p></div>

The way we did that was to have you play alongside your partner via a camera. In reality, there was no other player: your partner was a video that we specifically created to make you believe that you were interacting with another person. Also, the feedback you received was not real: your feedback made it always seem that you are not bad, but clearly not excellent either. However, the feedback was never an accurate assessment of your performance.</p><p>Our main interest in this study was to see how you interacted with a stranger. We were particularly interested in creating a status hierarchy between you and the simulated partner. In fact, we wanted to see how much you would be willing to share with another person who seems to be higher/equal in status in this particular situation.</p><p>Although your simulated partner rejected your offer during the economic game, you will receive 4.00 dollars. This is in addition to the 2 SONA credits.</p><p>Overall, we apologize for having deceived you, and have you interact with a person who was not real. We equally apologize for providing you with false feedback on your alleged performance.</p><p>However, this deception was necessary for us to make sure you take the game seriously, and share with the other person as if this other person was real.</p><p>Now, please ring the bell to call the experimenter.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Filler items.
