			<abstract>
				<p>Can investment fund managers earn a license to invest unethically? Past moral behavior can provide a perceived license to behave less morally, yet people may expect ethical consistency. In four experiments (N = 2,677), we examined whether people license ethical fund managers to engage in ethically questionable &apos;sin stocks&apos;-or whether people view ethical fund managers making ethically questionable investments as hypocritical. We investigated both same-domain (past ethical investment) and cross-domain (distinguished military service) evidence for the fund manager&apos;s moral character and earning via both traditional investing and &apos;shorting&apos; sin stocks. We found no evidence of a moral license for ethical investors to earn money off sin stocks (even by shorting them). In contrast, people rated ethical fund managers as less permitted to invest in such stocks, consistent with expectations of ethical commitment-a finding partially mediated by perceived hypocrisy. Hence, people expect ethical fund managers to maintain high ethical investment standards.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Do people offer fund managers a 'license' to invest unethically based on past ethical behavior? A growing literature suggests that the traits of fund managers influence perceptions of their investment behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Furnham, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hegde &amp; Mishra, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">ten Brinke et al., 2018)</ref>. Past moral behavior signals that one holds moral values and goals and is willing to put in the effort to acting on these values, i.e., moral character, which people perceive as holistically reflective of an array of positive traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fleeson et al., 2014)</ref>. People therefore infer others' traits from morally-relevant decisions (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Rom &amp; Conway, 2018)</ref>, such that moral decisions imply moral character <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Pizarro &amp; Tannenbaum, 2012</ref>). In the current work, we investigate how past manager moral behavior influences ethically questionable investment decisions, or sin stocks. Sin stocks are stocks issued by companies that engage in socially or morally objectionable activities, allowing investors to profit from problematic products, such as alcohol, tobacco, and gambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hong &amp; Kacperczyk, 2009)</ref>. There are theoretical reasons to expect that past manager moral behavior may increase either permission or condemnation of sin stock investments.</p><p>On the one hand, people may afford a license to managers who establish a past record of moral behavior to invest unethically. Past moral behavior can provide a moral license to engage in ethically questionable behavior, either via moral credits where people reduce condemnation of ethically questionable behavior balanced by past positive behavior, or by moral credentials, the assumption that morally questionable behavior likely reflects benign rather than malicious motives, reducing condemnation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Miller &amp; Effron, 2010)</ref>. In other words, the same questionable behavior may seem less immoral when performed by a saint because they presumably have noble motives or because their sins are washed away by past good deeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Monin &amp; Miller, 2001)</ref>. Therefore, a manager who establishes a pattern of moral behavior before investing in sin stocks may plausibly have a good reason for doing so, or may be 'permitted' in light of their past ethicality. If people draw this inference they should afford greater license to ethical managers to invest in sin stocks. We call this the licensing hypothesis.</p><p>On the other hand, people may hold ethical managers to a higher moral standard than others. A key aspect to moral perceptions is honesty <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hofmann et al., 2014)</ref> and trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Goodwin, 2015)</ref>, as people infer they can rely on moral others to consistently make ethical decisions. Therefore, seemingly ethical managers who invest in sin stocks risk appearing to capitalize on both the benefits of a moral reputation (e.g., trust) and the benefits of violating such reputation (e.g., profit), implying that their apparent moral character was, in fact, a sham. The discrepancy between past ethical and current unethical behavior therefore risks perceptions of hypocrisy: pretends to be more ethical than they really are, which people strongly condemn <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Effron &amp; Helgason, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Effron &amp; Miller, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Huppert et al., 2023;</ref>. Hence, perceivers might especially disapprove of fund managers who invest unethically after past ethical behavior. We call this the ethical commitment hypothesis.</p><p>We compared these predictions across four studies examining perceptions of investment in sin stocks by managers with or without evidence of past moral behavior in the same domain (Study 1) or a different domain <ref type="bibr">(Study 2)</ref>. We also examined whether people perceive ethical managers as licensed to bet against a sin stock (i.e., buying short-derivatives) rather than in favor of a stock (buying long-derivatives), as doing so would still make money on unethical companies, but in a way that rejects rather than endorses them <ref type="bibr">(Studies 3 &amp; 4)</ref>. We summarize the key characteristics of each study in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>First, we tested whether a fund manager's past ethical investment provides license to invest in sin stocks. Consistent with the literature on moral licensing, we originally predicted that people would rate a fund manager known to invest in socially responsible companies ("saint stocks") as more permitted to invest in "sin stocks" that abandon social responsibility policies, but not control stocks that maintain such policies, compared to a neutral manager. We compared this to the ethical commitment hypothesis, positing that people would provide lower license for ethical managers to invest in sin stocks abandoning versus maintaining responsibility policies compared to a neutral manager.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. A power analysis suggested that we needed 690 participants to obtain ~95% power to detect an effect of f = .15 with α = .05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Faul et al., 2009)</ref>. Anticipating excluding ~15%, we collected data from 812 participants (from Mechanical Turk), excluding 192 using the pre-registered criterion, leaving a final sample of 620 participants (Mage = 38.75, SD = 11.98; 43.6% female). We pre-registered the procedure at: https://aspredicted.org/AWS_LVJ; we report all manipulations, measures, and exclusions for this and all the other studies. In Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Materials, we present the number of participants in each cell, and the correlation between variables (for this and other studies).</p><p>Design. We employed a 2 (license: past socially responsible investment versus control) × 2 (decision: investment in sin stocks vs control stocks) between-subjects design. We focused on the main effect of license and the interaction between license and stock type to determine whether previously investing in saint stocks provides fund managers with more leeway to invest in sin stocks.</p><p>Procedure. We manipulated license by presenting participants with information that the fund manager previously invested in either companies that care about their employees (saint condition: "This fund manager is known to have invested heavily in the past in companies that care about their employees (e.g., by engaging in profit sharing, ensuring that employees have respectable retirement benefits)"; see Methodology file for more details), or a broad index (control condition). We manipulated the decision by presenting participants with information on either two companies that abandoned environmentally friendly or socially responsible policies (sin stocks condition: e.g., a company that will "lower levels of service quality, lower safety standards, and the use of potentially deceptive marketing practices"), or two companies that continued these policies (control stocks condition). Participants then rated the following items on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree):</p><p>1. I would be comfortable if this fund manager invested in these companies on my behalf. 2. It is appropriate for this fund manager to make such investments.</p><p>3. This fund manager should be forbidden from making these investments (reversed). We computed the mean (α = .83), which served as our dependent variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Overall, participants rated investing in sin stocks less permissible than control stocks, Msin = 3.51, SD = 1.56 vs Mcontrol = 5.37, SD = 1.33; F(1, 616) = 254.53, p &lt; .001, η 2 =.292, d = -1.28, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-1.48, -1.11</ref>]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">1</ref> There was no main effect of the fund manager's past investment history, Msaint = 4.62, SD = 1.83 vs Mcontrol = 4.27, SD = 1.60; F(1, 616) = 3.04, p = .082, η 2 =.005, d = 0.202, 95% CI [0.04, 0.36]. However, there was a significant interaction, F(1, 616) = 14.29, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .023. Participants rated it was similarly (im)permissible for the saintly and control fund manager to invest in sin stocks, Msaint = 3.38, SD = 1.70 vs Mcontrol = 3.62, SD = 1.43, t = -1.30, p = .193, d = -0.15, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.39, 0</ref>.07], but more permissible for the saintly than control fund manager to invest in control stocks, Msaint = 5.67, SD = 1.16 vs Mcontrol = 5.03, SD = <ref type="bibr">1.44,</ref><ref type="bibr">t = 4.26,</ref><ref type="bibr">p &lt; .001,</ref><ref type="bibr">d = 0.49,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI = [0.27,</ref><ref type="bibr">0.71]</ref>. Hence, 'saintly behavior' increased license to invest in companies that continued (but not abandoned) corporate social responsibility policies (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These findings are inconsistent with our original hypothesis that investing in socially responsible stocks can license investing in sin stocks. However, these findings suggest that investing in socially responsible stocks can license investing in control companies that maintain socially responsible policies-i.e., continued ethical commitment.</p><p>Notably, the managers' past ethical behavior was in the same domain as the present investment decision. Some work suggests that people are more concerned about hypocrisy in the same domain than different domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Effron &amp; Miller, 2015)</ref>. Hence, perhaps differentdomain ethical behavior may provide a license to invest in sin stocks, as some work suggests licensing can arise from prosocial activity in another domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Miller &amp; Effron, 2010)</ref>. On the other hand, people tend to draw holistic inferences about moral character <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fleeson et al., 2014)</ref>, suggesting that people would expect continued ethical action even when managers engage in different-domain ethical behavior. Therefore, in Study 2, we tested whether people license fund managers to invest in sin stocks based on ethical behavior in a different domain: military experience. Past investment in companies that care about their employees (e.g., by engaging in profit sharing, ensuring that employees have respectable retirement benefits)</p><p>A tobacco company that is poorly rated on social responsibility relative to its peers Sin Short</p><p>Notes. Fund manager saintliness is between-subjects. All studies except Study 4 have another between-subjects factor. ESG = environmental, social, or governance issues. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The moral permissibility of 'saint' and control fund managers to invest in stocks Study 2 Many people view military service as a sacrifice on behalf of a nation, and therefore laudatory (e.g., Jordan, 2012). 2 Accordingly, investors tend to trust and invest more in investment funds with managers with a military background <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cochardt et al., 2022)</ref>. Indeed, research suggests that including military veterans on corporate boards increases ethical business decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Simpson &amp; Sariol, 2019)</ref>, perhaps in part because veterans are less likely than other groups to engage in corporate fraud and tax evasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Benmelech &amp; Frydman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Koch-Bayram &amp; Wernicke, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Law &amp; Mills, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shepherd et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, we manipulated whether a fund manager had laudatory military experience or not as a proxy for different-domain moral licensing. We then tested perceived permission for this fund manager to engage in morally controversial behavior (e.g., invest in sin stocks), or whether people would hold the military manager to higher ethical standards than a control target, similar to Study 1. We pre-registered the procedure at: https://aspredicted.org/LTW_HGP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. Similar to Study 1, we aimed for ~95% power to detect f = .15 with α = .05. Anticipating excluding ~25% (due to a higher-than-expected exclusion in Study 1), we collected data from 920 participants, excluding 183 using the pre-registered criterion, leaving a final sample of 737 (Mage = 39.7, SD = 11.9; 44.1% female). Participants' political orientation scores (M = 3.68, SD = 1.87) roughly corresponded to the midpoint of the scale (1 = liberal, 7 = conservative).</p><p>Design. We employed a 2 (license: military service versus control) × 2 (decision: investment in sin versus control stock) between-subjects design. We focused on the main effect of license and the interaction between license and stock type to determine whether laudatory military service provides fund managers with more leeway to invest in sin stocks.</p><p>Procedure. We manipulated license by presenting participants with information that the fund manager was either a distinguished veteran (saint condition: "Before his career in the financial sector, Major Coleman served with distinction as an officer in the United States Army. (…) During his military service, Major Coleman was awarded numerous honors, including the Bronze Star for valor (heroism) for rescuing some soldiers from a burning vehicle, and the Humanitarian Service Medal for evacuating refugees from conflict zones."; see Methodology file), or distinguished businessman (control: "Before his career in the financial sector, Mr. Coleman served as manager of a small chain of vacation resorts."). We manipulated decision type by presenting participants with either information on companies that abandoned environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) policies (sin stock condition; this was the same as one of the descriptions from Study 1), or continued these policies (control). Participants then rated the same three items as Study 1 (α = .86). We also measured political orientation from 1 (liberal) to 7 (conservative), and tested whether results held both for participants scoring below the midpoint (N = 404) and equal to or above the midpoint (N = 516).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Results corroborated Study 1: overall, participants again rated investing in sin stocks less permissible than control stocks, Msin = 3.54, SD = 1.76 vs Mcontrol = 5.73, SD = 1.08, F(1, 733) = 416.55, p &lt; .001, η 2 =.362, d = -0.15, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-1.67, -1.34</ref>]. There was again no main effect of fund manager's moral character, Msaint = 4.58, SD = 1.91 vs Mcontrol = 4.67, SD = 1.75, F(1, 733) = 1.22, p = .269, η 2 =.002, d = -0.05 <ref type="bibr">[-0.19, 0.08]</ref>. However, there was again a significant interaction, F(1, 733) = 4.24, p = .040, η 2 = .006. Participants reported that it was less permissible for the veteran than control manager to invest in sin stocks, Msaint = 3.36, SD = 1.77 vs Mcontrol = 3.70, SD = 1.74, t = -1.87, p = .062, d = -0.20, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.40, 0</ref>.00], but not more permissible for the veteran fund manager than the control fund manager to invest in control stocks, Msaint = 5.78, SD = 1.11 vs Mcontrol = 5.68, SD = 1.05, t = 0.91, p = .365, d = 0.10, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.10, 0.33]</ref>.</p><p>Note that both studies point to a statistically significant interaction between saintliness and the type of stock, suggesting consistently that the effect of saintliness is different for sin and control stocks. However, some non-interactive effects (for sin stocks in Study 1 and control stocks in Study 2) were not statistically significant at conventional thresholds. To address the issue of an inability to detect some of the effects due to insufficient statistical power, we have pooled the data from Studies 1 and 2. This pooling has allowed us to answer two questions: <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(1)</ref> does our data overall support the finding that saintliness decreases permissibility to invest in sin stocks, and increases permissibility to invest in control stocks?; (2) is the effect of saintliness different for same-domain and cross-domain ethical behavior? Regression analyses in . <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> use control stocks as the reference and thus the coefficient for Saint fund manager corresponds to the effect of saintliness in control stocks. Overall, results support the assertion that saintliness increases the permissibility to invest in control stocks while reducing the permissibility to invest in sin stocks (see Saint fund manager × Sin stock interaction). However, the lack of a Saint fund manager × Sin stock × Cross-domain interaction suggests that same-domain (i.e., investment-related) and cross-domain (i.e., ex-military-related) ethical behavior lead to similar outcomes. Thus, overall this supports the ethical commitment hypothesis in both domains of ethical behavior (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2A</ref> for an illustration of predictions from the regression model that pools same-domain and cross-domain behavior).  Together, the results of Study 2 disconfirmed the licensing hypothesis and supported the ethical commitment hypothesis: fund manager saintliness decreased the permissibility of investing in sin companies, and increased the permissibility to invest in control stocks, unlike Study 1 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we tested whether this pattern would hold across the political spectrum, as conservatives may be more likely to view veterans as ethical than liberals (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>). The interaction between fund manager type and political ideology was not significant, showing that people with a conservative versus liberal political ideology did not differ in the judgments of fund managers for either sin stocks (b = 0.29, SE = 0.36, t = 0.80, p = 0.427) or control stocks (b = -0.09, SE = 0.22, t = -0.39, p = 0.700). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Study 2 provided further evidence contrary to the licensing hypothesis: people rated it less permissible for the manager with distinguished military service than distinguished business career to invest in sin stocks. This finding suggests that people may hold ethical fund managers to higher moral standards than control managers, whether their implied moral character arises from the same domain (past ethical investment) or a different domain (distinguished military service). These results extend Study 1, but they also align with research by <ref type="bibr">Cochardt and colleagues (2022)</ref> showing that people tend to view ex-military mutual fund managers as more ethical.</p><p>Yet, the question remains whether there may be ways for saintly fund managers to make money off sin stocks in a manner that appears acceptable. For example, by 'shorting' a sin stock, a manager essentially bets against a company and makes money off their downfall. Would people view it as permissible for saintly managers to make money by shorting sin stocks, implying disapproval of their sinful activities, or disapprove of saintly managers making money off sin stocks even through shorting? We examined this question in Study 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Together, Studies 1 and 2 suggest that people provide ethical managers less license to invest in sin stocks, i.e., to benefit financially when unethical companies succeed. However, investors can also bet against companies, making money when they fail (short-selling or 'shorting' stocks). This raises the question of whether the perceived ethical problem of investing in sin stocks is that managers make money off unethical stocks, or whether the problem is betting in favor of sin stock success (implying motivation to want unethical companies to succeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pizarro &amp; Tannenbaum, 2012)</ref>. Is it acceptable for ethical managers to make money off the failure of sin stocks?</p><p>In Study 3, participants considered a manager who may invest in a sin stock via either a long-derivative (whose value increases if the stock price increases) or a short-derivative (whose value increases if the stock price decreases). Buying a short-derivative is essentially equivalent to short-selling ('shorting') a company, a practice made famous in the film The Big Short. Generally speaking, people consider shorting to be unethical , which -based on our earlier findings -would suggest that saint fund managers would not be more permitted to short such stocks. However, a counter-argument is that shorting a sin stock can be perceived as activist investment, where an investor bets against the company, with public justification for this decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Paugam et al., 2021)</ref>. For example, a fund manager may short stocks to inform the investment community that a company is likely engaging in fraud, leading to overvaluation. Similarly, a fund manager may believe that a company is overvalued because the stock price does not fully account for the social harm that the company causes, which should reduce the stock price in the future. Hence, shorting a stock may signal disapproval of a company.</p><p>Therefore, saintly fund managers may be more permitted to short sin stocks than regular fund managers if people perceive their short-selling as signaling moral disapproval. Consistent with this view, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pizarro and Tannenbaum (2012)</ref> found that people judged investors by the ethicality of what they appeared to hope would happen-for example, investors who made money when a disaster did not happen were viewed as more ethical than those who made money when a disaster did happen, because this implied they hoped the disaster would happen. Therefore, people may particularly license a saintly manager to short sin stocks because it implies an activist investor's desire to see sin stocks fail, consistent with their moral character. Alternatively, people may view any profit off sin stocks as unethical, even if obtained via shorting, and hence contrary to their moral character.</p><p>Furthermore, we measured perceived hypocrisy to test whether hypocrisy perceptions mediate the effect of saintliness on investing permissibility in short and long positions. Specifically, people may view the saintly manager as less permitted to invest long in sin stocks due in part to viewing this decision as hypocritical. Investing short in sin stocks, however, might be seen as hypocritical only if profiting off the misfortune of sin stocks is perceived as unethical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. Once again, to obtain ~95% power to detect f = .15 with α = .05 which anticipating excluding ~25%, we recruited 920 MTurkers and excluded 177 using the preregistered criterion, leaving a final sample of 743 (Mage = 41.6, SD = 13.1; 41.7% female).</p><p>Design. We employed a 2 (license: past socially responsible investment versus control) × 2 (position: long versus short) between-subjects design. We focused on the main effect of license and the interaction between license and investment position to determine whether previously investing in saint stocks provides fund managers with more leeway to invest in favor or against sin stocks.</p><p>Procedure. Similar to Study 1, we manipulated the fund manager's license via past ethical investment behavior. We randomly assigned participants to read that the manager previously invested in either 'saintly' companies-here defined as industry leaders in topics rated in a pretest as ethically relevant, including product safety &amp; quality, corporate behavior, and health &amp; safety of its employees as rated by an independent agency (saint condition), or the manager previously invested in companies from a broad market index (control condition). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> All participants considered a scenario where a company abandons its ESG policies (i.e., a sin stock by this definition). However, we manipulated which position the fund manager deliberated: either long, so they would profit if the company's stock increased, or short, so they would profit if the company's stock decreased. Participants then rated the same items as Study 1 (α = .84).</p><p>Participants also rated the moral hypocrisy of the fund manager using a five-item scale (e.g., "This fund manager is two-faced", α = .94; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Effron &amp; Miller, 2015;</ref>. Finally, as manipulation checks, we checked whether people generally judge investing in short positions less favorably than long positions (3 items, e.g., "buying long/short derivatives is moral/immoral", αlong = .98, αshort = .98; , generally judge traders who make short (vs. long) investments less favorably (2 items, e.g., "people that buy long/short derivatives are good/bad people", αlong = .89, αshort = .83; , and are less willing to personally adopt a short than long position (2 items, "buying long/short derivatives is very attractive/very unattractive to you", αlong = .94, αshort = .94; . We conducted an analysis of variance and mediation analysis, as pre-registered at: https://aspredicted.org/RNE_RUW.</p></div>

We found no main effect of license on investment acceptability, Msaint = 3.85, SD = 1.69 vs Mcontrol = 3.64, SD = 1.73, F(1, 739) = 2.69, p = .102, η 2 =.004, d = 0.12, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0</ref>.00, 0.27], nor a main effect of investment position: participants rated the permissibility of investing in a sin stock via long-derivatives and short-derivatives not significantly differently, Mlong = 3.70, SD = 1.63 vs Mshort = 3.79, SD = 1.79, F(1, 739) = 0.54, p = .461, η 2 &lt; .001, d = -0.05, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.19, 0.09]</ref>. Moreover, there was no significant interaction, F(1, 739) = 0.06, p = .814, η 2 &lt; .001. Results are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The lack of a main effect of position was surprising, considering that people generally rated investing in short positions as less favorable than in long positions (Mlong-trade = 3.88, SD = 2.29 vs Mshort-trade = 5.46, SD = 2.37, t = 13.1, p &lt; .001, d = 0.68, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.80, -0</ref>.57]), judged short-traders less favorably than long-traders Mlong-trader = 4.03, SD = 1.81 vs Mshort-trader = 5.76, SD = 1.87, t = 18.1, p &lt; .001, d = 0.94, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-1.06, -0</ref>.83]), and declared less interest in personally investing in short than long positions Mlong-interest = 3.96, SD = 2.32 vs Mshort-interest = 6.36, SD = 2.34, t = 19.8, p &lt; .001, d = -1.03 <ref type="bibr">[-1.16, -0</ref>.91]).</p><p>Mediation analysis. Despite a lack of main effects in the ANOVA, a mediation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hayes, 2017)</ref> supported the notion that judgments of fund managers' hypocrisy carried indirect variance from fund manager history to sin stock investment permissibility (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4A</ref>). Specifically, people rated saintly managers higher in hypocrisy, Msaint = 4.10, SD = 1.70 vs Mcontrol = 3.79, SD = 1.67, t = 2.54, p = .011, d = 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.33], and hypocrisy furthermore predicted reduced investment acceptability ratings, as the indirect effect was outside the 95% CIs. Hence, there was a negative indirect effect of saintliness on investing in sin stocks overall via increased hypocrisy. Intriguingly, however, this analysis also revealed a positive direct effect, suggesting possible suppression (see below).</p><p>We next performed a moderated mediation analysis, with short versus long position entered as a moderator (of path a from manager character to hypocrisy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hayes, 2017)</ref>. This analysis suggested that hypocrisy mediated the effect of fund manager saintliness on reduced permissibility of long positions, blong = -0.37 <ref type="bibr">[-0.61, -0.15]</ref>, as this effect fell outside the 95% CIs, but not short positions, bshort = -0.08 <ref type="bibr">[-0.34, 0.19]</ref>, as this effect fell within the 95% CIs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4B)</ref>. That said, the interaction between fund manager type and position type on hypocrisy judgments was only trending towards statistical significance, failing below traditional thresholds, F(1, 739) = 2.73, p = .099). Hence, we interpret this pattern cautiously, but it suggests that people judge that saintly managers may not invest long in sin stocks due to hypocrisy, whereas saintly managers shorting sin stocks may not seem as hypocritical.</p><p>Together, these patterns suggest statistical suppression, a case where opposite effects statistically cancel out, resulting in a null total effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rucker et al., 2011)</ref>. Hence, this pattern implies one or more unmeasured mediators carrying indirect variance from saintliness to increased sin stock investment acceptability (perhaps especially for long positions). For example, it could be that increased perceptions of moral credentials mediate increased investment acceptability for saintly managers simultaneously with hypocrisy perceptions reducing investment acceptability, simultaneously with hypocrisy reducing acceptability. Hence, the effect of saintliness on sin stock investment may be more complex than previously thought. Future work might profitably investigate this possibility. Notes: 95% bootstrapped CIs are reported in the square brackets. Panel A shows the main preregistered mediation analysis. Panel B shows moderated mediation analysis, with the position on the stock (short vs long) serving as the moderator. * p &lt; 0.05; *** p &lt; 0.001</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In contrast to Studies 1 and 2, we did not replicate the effect that saintly fund managers were less permitted to invest in sin stocks; there was no significant effect of manager investment history or long versus short position on sin stock investment acceptability; nor did they interact. People rated saintly and control fund managers equally permitted to 'go long' and 'go short' on a sin stock. It is therefore possible that people view interacting with sin stocks in any professional capacity, whether using long or short positions, as morally questionable, regardless of one's 'saintly' investment history.</p><p>However, the null effect on the acceptability of investing in sin stocks is at odds with other findings: we replicated past work  showing that overall, people judged shorting less favorably than going long, rated short-sellers worse than people taking long positions, and were less interested in shorting than going long themselves. Hence, people may be sensitive to important differences between shorting and going long on a sin stock, yet not rate managers differently who do so (despite high statistical power). How can we resolve this apparent paradox? One possibility is that this case may tap a complex set of attributions that partially cancel out, i.e., statistical suppression.</p><p>The mediation and moderated mediation findings showed that perceptions of hypocrisy carried negative indirect variance from manager saintliness to investment acceptability (for long positions). In other words, a saintly manager hoping to profit off investments in unethical companies risks appearing more hypocritical than a control manager. The moderated mediation findings suggest that saintly fund managers who short sin stocks may not appear hypocritical, whereas saintly fund managers who go long may. Thus, it may be that people focus on the hypocrisy of saintly managers who want sin stock companies to succeed, suggesting unethical motivation inconsistent with supposed moral character (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pizarro &amp; Tannenbaum, 2012)</ref>. Saintly managers who short sin stocks and therefore appear to want sin stock companies to fail appear less hypocritical, but no less permitted to invest. It may be that moral approbation for shorting sin stocks is offset by general negative attitudes towards short-sellers documented in the other measures and past work .</p><p>Moreover, the mediation analysis also revealed a positive direct effect of saintliness on investment permissibility once hypocrisy was included in the model, suggesting the presence of unmeasured mediators consistent with a moral credentials effect. In other words, people may view it as more acceptable for a saintly (than control) manager to invest (long) in a sin stock due to some mechanisms, while simultaneously viewing this as less acceptable due to other mechanisms (e.g., hypocrisy). The exact nature of these mechanisms remains unclear. Moral credential theory suggests that credentials reflect moral character perceptions, so measures of moral character may carry indirect variance. However, other potential mediators are also possible. Future work might profit from testing such mediators. Finally, it may be that the current sin stock manipulations were simply not clear enough for many participants to identify the stocks as unambiguously unethical. Therefore, we addressed this possibility in Study 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4</head><p>In Study 4, we wanted to create the most favorable conditions for a possible licensing effect on shorting sin stocks to manifest. Therefore, we strengthened the sin stock manipulation by combining information that operates in a morally controversial industry (specifically tobacco; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hong &amp; Kacperczyk, 2009)</ref>, with information that was also assessed by a rating agency as using poor labor standards in its supply chain. This creates favorable conditions for possible construal effects, where people may infer that an ethical (versus control) fund manager who shorts such a sin stock is expressing moral disapproval of the company and is therefore permitted a license. Conversely, if people remain averse to ethical manager making any money off sin stocks, they should rate the ethical investor lower in permissibility to short the stock than a control manager.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. We aimed for 250 participants per cell. Anticipating an exclusion rate of ~20%, we recruited 625 MTurk participants. Ultimately, we excluded 48 participants using the pre-registered criterion, leaving a final sample of 577 (Mage = 39.7, SD = 11.8; 47.5% female), providing 80% power to detect d = 0.23 (i.e., slightly larger than a small effect according to Cohen's (1988) guidelines.</p><p>Design. We employed a 2-cell between-subjects design to determine whether previously investing in saint stocks provides fund managers with more leeway to invest against (short) a 'super-sin' stock.</p><p>Procedure. We again manipulated license via past ethical investments: participants read that the fund manager previously invested in either 'saint' companies who cared about their employees from Study 1 (saint condition), or a broad market index (control condition). We also expanded the rating scale. Participants rated the following items on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree):</p><p>1. I would be comfortable if this fund manager made this investment on my behalf.</p><p>2. It is appropriate for this fund manager to make such an investment.</p><p>3. This fund manager should be forbidden from making such an investment (reversed). 4. It is perfectly fine for this fund manager to make this trade.</p><p>5. This fund manager should NOT make this trade (reversed). We computed the mean (α = .91). Participants also rated fund manager moral hypocrisy using the same five-item scale as Study 3 (α = .94), and judged the act of shorting a 'laggard' company (a tobacco manufacturer with lax corporate responsibility policies) using three items adapted from , such as "buying 'short' derivatives on a tobacco stock is moral/immoral" (α = .97).</p><p>We conducted t-tests to assess how fund manager saintliness impacted investment permissibility, hypocrisy, and shorting acceptability. We complemented this with a mediation analysis to examine whether fund manager hypocrisy might mediate the effect of saintliness on investment permissibility. We pre-registered the procedure at: https://aspredicted.org/W2Z_9HD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Main effect. Consistent with Study 3, participants rated the permissibility of saint and control fund managers shorting the super-sin stock as not significantly different (Msaint = 4.47, SD = 1.66 vs Mcontrol = 4.28, SD = 1.75, t = -1.32, p = .19, d = 0.11 <ref type="bibr">[-0.06, 0.27]</ref>). Manager hypocrisy ratings were also similar across conditions (Msaint = 3.36, SD = 1.64 vs Mcontrol = 3.44, SD = 1.69, t = -0.51, p = .61, d = -0.04 <ref type="bibr">[-0.22, 0</ref>.12]), as were judgments of shorting the tobacco super-sin stock (Msaint = 4.74, SD = 2.54 vs Mcontrol = 5.05, SD = 2.61, t = -1.46, p = .14, d = -0.12 <ref type="bibr">[-0.29, 0.04]</ref>).</p><p>Mediation analysis. The mediation analysis corroborated the main analysis: there was no significant indirect effect via hypocrisy, b = 0.024, SE = 0.047, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.068, 0.117]</ref>, nor was there a significant direct effect, b = 0.052, SE = 0.085, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.115, 0.218]</ref>. Consistent with Study 3, participants did not rate shorting the sin stock more favorably in the saint fund manager condition due to reduced fund manager hypocrisy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These results do not clearly support either the licensing or ethical commitment hypothesis. The lack of effects is puzzling given the findings in Studies 1 and 2. That said, in this study we examined only perceptions of shorting a sin stock, which Study 3 suggested may reflect a complex set of competing perceptions that partially suppress one another: shorting a sin stock implies desiring it to fail, which may seem laudable, but participants reported that shorting in general is less ethical, and it may be these perceptions canceled out, resulting in a null effect. One interpretation might be that a licensing effect exists even for shorting sin stocks, but if so it is rather small (d = .11, based on our estimates), making it difficult to demonstrate as significant even with relatively large sample sizes. Therefore, we addressed this issue via a meta-regression analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Meta-Regression</head><p>Our findings are largely inconsistent with the existence of a license to invest in morally controversial companies, following virtuous acts from the same domain (investment) or a different domain (distinguished military service). Instead, Studies 1 and 2 supported the ethical commitment hypothesis, where people expect ethical managers to continue their ethical commitment by rejecting sin stocks and embracing ethical stocks. Intriguingly, this ethical commitment implied a license to invest-but only in companies that continue corporate social responsibility policies.</p><p>However, effect sizes are mostly small and less clear in Studies 3 and 4 than in Studies 1 and 2, especially regarding the permissibility of shorting (betting against) sin stocks (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2B</ref>).</p><p>It may be that a small net licensing effect emerges for shorting sin stocks, but this effect is challenging to cleanly detect without high power. Thus, to shed more light on this matter, we performed a meta-regression on the pooled dataset (N = 2,677), aimed at more precisely estimating the effect of saintliness and investing long vs short in sin stocks (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). We illustrate predicted permissibility ratings from the meta-regression in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2C</ref>.</p><p>Findings demonstrated that, overall, people provided saintly managers with higher permissibility to invest long in control stocks than control managers. So people appear to trust saintly fund managers more to make investments in non-sin stocks-possibly because they infer that saintly managers select moral ethical stocks than control investors. In addition, conventional (control) fund managers investing in favor of or against sin stocks were rated less favorably than managers investing in favor of conventional (control) stocks, similar to past work.</p><p>However, these effects were moderated by interactions. Consistent with the ethical commitment but not licensing hypothesis, saintliness reduced permissibility ratings for investing in sin stocks, as evidenced by the Saint × Sin Stocks interaction. However, an analysis of conditions, in which participants judged the sin stocks (and not the control stocks) provides some evidence that saintly managers have a higher permissibility from conventional fund managers to short sin stocks (i.e., invest against them), as the Saint fund manager × Short position interaction is positive and (marginally) statistically significant.</p><p>See <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table S3</ref> for a comparison of the effect of fund manager saintliness across the four studies, both excluding and including the effect of control variables. These suggest that our findings are robust to the inclusion of the control variables that we measured (subjective investment knowledge, objective investment knowledge, gender, and age). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Information on fund managers (or corporate directors; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gow et al., 2018)</ref> is often publicly available and may guide investors' perceptions and decisions. People may infer fund manager moral character from past ethical behavior (e.g., ethical investment, distinguished military service), which then shapes expectations and reactions to current investment choices. We examined whether such moral character information provides managers a moral license to invest (long) in sin stocks (harmful or socially irresponsible companies), or to bet against them (to short-sell them), or whether instead people expect ethical consistency: that ethical managers should eschew sin stocks but are especially licensed to invest in ethical stocks that maintain corporate social responsibility policies.</p><p>Overall, results failed to support the licensing hypothesis, but to a large extent supported the ethical commitment hypothesis. This pattern emerged in two (out of three) manipulations of stock manager moral character, including both same-domain (investment-related) and crossdomain (non-investment-related) part moral behavior. Results in Study 2 held for both liberal and conservative participants who may disagree over the ethicality of military service. Results in Study 3 were less clear, but the effect of fund manager saintliness on investing long in sin stocks was partially mediated by hypocrisy: people rated it less permissible for ethical managers to invest long in sin stocks in part due to the hypocrisy this action would imply, suggesting their past ethical behavior was insincere and served only to mask their true less ethical aims.</p><p>That said, clear results primarily emerged for investing long; results for shorting (betting against) sin and conventional stocks were less clear. One reason for this may be statistical suppression, as people may view shorting sin stocks as good because it implies a desire to see sin stocks fail <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Pizarro &amp; Tannenbaum, 2012)</ref>, but simultaneously rate shorting itself unethical, thereby largely canceling out clear effects of manager ethicality on shorting sin stocks.</p><p>As effect sizes were modest and findings from some studies were mixed, we conducted a meta-regression on results across all studies. This analysis revealed a main effect of saintliness, such that overall regular fund managers are less permitted to invest in favor of sin stocks, relative to regular stocks. Secondly, saintliness translates into greater permissibility to invest (long) in regular stocks (based on the results from the control groups). Thirdly, saintliness translates into a lower permissibility to invest long in sin stocks relative to regular fund managers, but their permissibility to invest short in sin stocks might be different from that of regular fund managers, albeit we only have very weak evidence for the latter, visible only in a meta-regression (and not in Study 4, which was specifically designed to produce the most favorable conditions for a potential licensing effect). Therefore, people seem to care about the ethicality of fund managers and evaluate their current investment decisions in light of inferences about moral character based on past ethical deeds. Fund managers should consider this influence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>We contribute to several literatures. First, we add to the literature on moral licensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Miller &amp; Effron, 2010)</ref>, which rarely investigates economic decision-making (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">List and Momeni, 2021)</ref>. A meta-analysis performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blanken et al. (2015)</ref> found an overall effect of licensing in the literature, but effect sizes crossed the zero point, indicating important moderators where some studies demonstrate licensing and other studies the opposite: ethical consistency (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Conway &amp; Peetz, 2012)</ref>. Our studies generally support expectations of ethical consistency rather than licensing, regardless of whether past ethical behavior was samedomain or cross-domain. Our findings suggest that fund managers cannot earn a license to invest in morally controversial companies, partially due to such investments appearing hypocritical, consistent with a recent study that investigated an executive of a tobacco company (O'Connor et al., 2020)-at least under the conditions examined here.</p><p>Our findings make sense insofar as people view moral character as indicative of reliable, trustworthy decision-making in service of the public good which increases willingness to cooperate <ref type="bibr">(Goodwin et al., 2014)</ref>, which allows for maximizing mutual returns in non-zero-sum interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gintis et al., 2003)</ref>. Attempts to promote an ethical reputation while simultaneously aiming to benefit from unscrupulous action (investing long in sin stocks) suggest that supposed moral character information merely reflects hollow moral <ref type="bibr">selfpresentation (Lönnqvist et al., 2014)</ref>, which can lure unsuspecting victims into vulnerability in non-zero-sum interactions and then exploit-them-that one is a hypocritical 'wolf in sheep's clothing' (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Krebs &amp; Denton, 2013)</ref>. Accordingly, people appear to expect ethical consistency out of ethical managers and refuse them license to invest in sin stocks. Intriguingly, however, we do find evidence that ethical managers may earn a license to invest in companies that continue corporate social responsibility policies. Such decisions are in line with ethical manager moral character, and the increased license may reflect the inference that ethical manager investments partly reflect expert estimates that such companies contribute to the public good rather than mere greed, and are therefore more palatable than equivalent investments by neutral managers. Future research might benefit from clarifying whether such license applies specifically to ethical companies or applies broadly to neutral companies as well.</p><p>Second, we contribute to the literature that links fund manager (or upper echelon manager) characteristics with the attractiveness or performance of investment funds (or corporations; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Benmelech &amp; Frydman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cochardt et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">ten Brinke et al., 2018)</ref>, or an instance where economic decisions are made for others <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ruessmann &amp; Topolinski, 2020)</ref>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our findings suggest that acts in the same domain (investment) seem to be a more reliable indicator of character that is applicable to the investment world, than prior commendable acts in a different domain (such as in the military). Thus, in our studies, serving in the military did not increase the license to invest in regular stocks. However, there is tentative evidence that investments in sin stocks by ex-military are nonetheless judged relatively unfavorably, possibly due to such actions being perceived as hypocritical <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cochardt et al., 2022)</ref>. However, we did not assess this mechanism in Study 2, and thus this assertion is speculative.</p><p>Third, we contribute to research on the psychology of short-selling stocks ('shorting'; . Our findings do not provide conclusive evidence suggesting that fund managers' socially responsible investments or virtuous behavior increases the legitimacy to short socially irresponsible companies. This could be the result of a conflict between the act of shorting-which is judged to be significantly less moral than making typical ('long') investments-and virtuous (moral) investment. Shorting a sin stock is in some ways analogous to sacrificial moral dilemmas where causing harm maximizes outcomes. Shorting a stock is analogous to a harmful act, but the fall of a sin stock may be the morally best outcome overall. Research shows that people view others who reject sacrificial harm-even to achieve positive outcomes-as typically warmer, more moral, and more trustworthy than people who accept such sacrifices, even though they also appear less competent and leaderlike (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Everett et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Everett et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rom et al., 2017)</ref>. Hence, people may view saintly fund managers who accept harm-shorting the stock-as hypocritical for inflicting such harm which seems immoral, even as they approve of intentions to see sinful stocks fall. Hence, effects may be mediated by multiple different perceptions tracking concerns about the manager's character and the outcomes they achieve; future work should examine this possibility. It may also be that ethical managers who do more work to explain and broadcast their shorting decision as an activist choice for moral reasons will short perceptions. In the current work there is not much evidence that people interpret shorting sin stocks by ethical managers as activist investments. One reason may be that the fund manager will profit from this activist investment, and people appear to see social good and profit as conflicting goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bhattacharjee et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Limitations and future directions. Like all studies, the current work has some limitations. First, we mostly operationalize sin stocks as companies that abandon environmental, social, or governance (ESG) policies (except in <ref type="bibr">Study 4)</ref>. Alternative approaches could be used, such as focusing on the industry in which the company operates in (e.g., gambling). However, past work suggests that alternative operationalizations of 'sin' produce similar findings as the current manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Niszczota et al., 2022)</ref>. We cannot rule out that the lack of direct support for the ethical commitment hypothesis -postulating that investment in sin stocks backfires for ethical fund managers -is due to a different operationalization of saintliness. In Study 1, saintliness was operationalized solely based on the way that employees are treated, whereas in Study 3, saintliness was determined through past investment in companies that jointly care for product safety &amp; quality, corporate behavior, and the health &amp; safety of its employees. Perhaps more importantly, the classification of a company as a violator of these issues was explicitly determined by an independent rating agency, i.e. did not require any assessment to be made by the fund manager, but merely to act on the assessment of others. Some research suggests <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Niszczota &amp; Kaszás, 2020)</ref> that the need for morally competent fund managers becomes less salient if the moral violations are clear-cut (i.e., there is no need for the fund manager to judge the company, as it has been already judged by others or doesn't require any judgment as it is unequivocally sinful). Overall, the effect of saintliness might be diluted if the past investment record of the fund manager was determined by some issues that were less relevant (or more murky) to a layperson (such as corporate behavior, e.g., violation of antitrust laws), or if the judgment of the companies is delegated to a third-party (e.g., a rating agency).</p><p>Second, we operationalized moral character via inferences based on past behavior; we did not assess moral character directly, which future work should do, and future work should generalize to a broader array of ethical domains than just two. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Walker and Hennig (2004)</ref> described lay perceptions of three different moral exemplars: just, brave, and caring. Distinguished military veterans fit the brave archetype, and ethical fund managers arguably the just arc-type--it may be that people hold different expectations for investment decisions by caring exemplars such as kind nurses (perhaps especially for sin stocks related to health, such as junk food companies). Third, we examined only perceptions of fund managers themselves rather than other investors or corporate parties. It seems reasonable to expect that our findings should apply to related targets such as private investors, the upper echelon of management (such as CEOs), or partners in venture capital firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barber et al., 2021</ref>), but we do not investigate this directly. Finally, we examined perceptions rather than behavior. Although moral judgments tend to powerfully motivate behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Skitka et al., 2005)</ref>, it remains to be seen how well the moral judgments in the current work translate into behavior such as withdrawing funds from a manager who invests in sin stocks. Future work would benefit from measuring actual investment decisions.</p><p>The final limitation concerns generalizability. The analysis was conducted on people from one industrialized country with an extremely well-developed stock market (the United States), in which perceptions of what constitutes a 'sin' stock and a 'saintly' fund manager might be different than in other countries that have somewhat developed stock markets. For example, countries with larger Muslim populations might perceive investment in companies producing alcohol less favorably for religious reasons, and in countries outside of the US, military veterans (even distinguished ones) might be perceived less favorably, and not indicative of moral character. Future research might study different populations to aid the generalizability of findings on investments that have a moral component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Four studies examined how perceptions of fund manager ethicality influence perceptions of current investment decisions. Results are inconsistent with licensing and instead generally support the ethical consistency hypothesis: people expect ethical managers to put their money where their mouth is and reject sin stocks in favor of neutral or socially responsible stocks, lest they appear hypocritical. There is little clear evidence that people endorse ethical managers even shorting sin stocks. This may explain in part why hedge fund manager Steve Eisman described in The Big Short (Lewis, 2011) reported that many of his investors were angry with him after he shorted unethical banks even after the 2008 economic crisis made a huge profit for his investors and proved him right. Consistent with our results, even though he was arguably an activist investor driven partially by ethical motives, he found that shorting sin stocks appears ethically fraught. Our work suggests that investing long in sin stocks is even more so. Instead, ethical investors may wish to invest long in ethical companies to avoid perceptions of hypocrisy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology file</head><p>Saintly fund managers cannot earn a license to make sinful investments</p><p>We conducted four experimental studies, in which the structure was as follows:</p><p>1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main tasks</head><p>Study 1: Past investment behavior (same-domain moral licensing) First between-subjects factor: sin vs non-sin companies Sin companies. Imagine two companies. The first company was committed to environmentally friendly policies. After the new chief executive officer (CEO) had taken over the company, he planned to scrap the eco-friendly policies in favor of more profit planned. The second company is Sigma Industries, a for-profit corporation that provides casual dining and catering services. Sigma is considering entering the market in a new region, which would involve changes to their current operations. Because this market entry is an opportunity for Sigma to reevaluate its current practices, an executive at the firm has submitted a proposal recommending changes. Relative to the firm's current practices, this proposal involves reduced investment in socially responsible practices. In particular, compared with Sigma's current practices, the proposal calls for lower levels of service quality, lower safety standards, and the use of potentially deceptive marketing practices. Under the new plan, Sigma would also decrease employee pay and worsen its impact on the environment.
