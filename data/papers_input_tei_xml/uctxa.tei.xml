			<abstract>
				<p>Social information plays a key role in almost all areas of human decision-making, helping individuals reduce uncertainty and improve their decisions. Despite a wealth of research on how people use social information, few studies have focused on the process of searching for social information. Social information search is, however, a key component of social learning. People also do not learn from just anyone, for example, they show preference for their ingroup and actively disregard information from the outgroup. Such a bias can have negative outcomes. Here, we examine how partisanship-known to cause a strong ingroup bias-affects social information search and social information use across four studies. We split the search process into initiation-an initial hurdle to seek out social information-and the extent of search after initiation. We found that partisanship did not affect the quantity of search after initiation, with participants exploring the choices of ingroup and outgroup members equally. However, in an election prediction task, where partisan identity was more salient, participants initiated more social information search from the ingroup. For social information use, participants gave more weight to the choices of ingroup members and weighed social information more if it aligned with their political beliefs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of disentangling social information search and use, highlighting that partisan biases in information processing can emerge at different stages.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Divergent Effects of Partisanship on Social Information Search and Use</head><p>Social information-information obtained from observing or interacting with others-is ubiquitous, helps people to reduce uncertainty in decision making, and is central to social learning, which facilitates the transmission of knowledge, skills, and norms within and across generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boyd et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kendal et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kendal et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rendell et al., 2011)</ref>. Technological advances, like the Internet, have considerably increased the quantity and type of available sources of social information everyday <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Salganik, 2018)</ref>. People increasingly use online platforms when making a multitude of decisions, including which restaurant to dine at, which products to buy online, and which trends to follow. Given its significance, a substantial body of research has explored how people use social information (i.e., how they are influenced by the social information they encounter; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kendal et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rendell et al., 2011)</ref>. Much of this research has, however, treated individuals as passive receivers of social information, ignoring the equally-important process of how individuals search for social information and select their sources. People, for example, actively decide which, and how many, comments to read when comparing food establishments. And on social media, they can decide whom to follow and the content they engage with (e.g., comments, groups, subreddits, other partisans). One prominent example is that people selectively prefer information from the ingroup-with whom they share a social identity-while ignoring information from the outgroup <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Van Bavel &amp; Pereira, 2018)</ref>. This can have negative outcomes: At present, there are concerns of how partisan information silos may exacerbate misinformation, polarisation, and echo-chambers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barberá et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Törnberg et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Here, across four studies (N = 717), we investigate how partisan group identity (known to produce a significant ingroup bias) influences social information search (studies 1-3) and social information use (study 4). Doing so, we ask whether in-and outgroup social information search and information use functions similarly, or if it is governed by different processes. Do people, for example, search for more social information from ingroup members, and also give it more weight? Or alternatively, do people search similarly across group identity, but weigh ingroup information more?</p><p>There is a long tradition of studies in the social sciences that investigate social information use. Generally, social information use tasks involve observing the opinion (or behaviour) of others and then studying subsequent changes in opinion (or behaviour). Various notable paradigms to study this have been established, including advice-taking, two-armed bandit, and ball-and-urn tasks (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Morin et al., 2021)</ref>. When using the information of others, a wealth of strategies on how people integrate social information have been formulated, including copy-if-dissatisfied, copy-if-uncertain, copy-the-majority, and copy-the-best (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kendal et al., 2018)</ref>. Of particular relevance for our study are model-based strategies, in which individuals are biased to copy individuals with specific characteristics. In humans, there is strong evidence that individuals weigh information coming from ingroup members more than information from outgroup members (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Smaldino &amp; Velilla, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The process of social information search has received substantially less attention. One important question in this context is whether people are also biased in who they sample social information from and how much. Everyday practices like asking family and friends for recommendations, and strategies like 'copy kin' and 'copy friends' indirectly speak to this.</p><p>Indeed, a prior study on adolescent-using a novel social information search paradigm, that we will build on-has shown that adolescents search for social information preferentially from their friends over non-friends, as well as from peers that are perceived as trustworthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Slagter et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Slagter et al., , 2023</ref>. And research on social (media) networks has shown that people actively seek out partisan content <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Robertson et al., 2023)</ref>, suggestive of an ingroup bias in search. Such, however, does not preclude the possibility of the reverse: being interested in social information stemming from the outgroup (e.g., Democrats following Republicans politicians like Donald Trump on X).</p><p>The use of web browser extensions that indicate the political bias of content, or those that present users with content from opposing viewpoints, suggest that there is also an interest in seeking outgroup perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bozdag &amp; van den Hoven, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Crucially, while social information search and social information use are two separate processes, it is unclear whether they are governed by similar mechanisms. You may seek and explore social information from the outgroup and return with more moderate views <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Broockman &amp; Kalla, 2024)</ref>, you may choose to disregard the information altogether (e.g., no change), or you may return more convinced of your own views (e.g., backfire effects; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bail et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Combined, this can have worrying implications for individual and societal outcomes in the political realm, especially in light of research that shows social ties form along partisan lines, and that partisans readily accept ingroup information and disregard outgroup information <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cohen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ditto et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jost, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Van Bavel &amp; Pereira, 2018)</ref>. These matters can also be made worse by both algorithmic-and user-driven choices that steer people into more partisan eco-systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Garimella et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McPherson et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mosleh et al., 2021)</ref>. Information shapes beliefs, attitudes, and ultimately, behaviour. Indeed, such a context, has led some to argue that identity-driven motivations have led to partisanship predicting attitudes on climate change and COVID-19 vaccination-issues with broad scientific consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Van Bavel et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Such assertions feed into broader issues regarding the reliability of online information, and how that is associated with echo-chambers, misinformation, and polarisation.</p><p>In this paper, as a secondary goal, we also consider the role between social information and uncertainty. As mentioned above, social information helps to reduce uncertainty, which is central to decision making. Given its important role, ample research has been conducted on social information use and uncertainty, establishing that individuals use more social information when they are uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bach &amp; Dolan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">FeldmanHall &amp; Nassar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kendal et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Toelch, Bach, et al., 2014)</ref>. Here again, however, there is a lack of research looking at the effect of uncertainty on social information search, which we will explore here.</p><p>Overall, we report four studies that examined the role of ingroup bias in social information search and use across different decision-making contexts. Study 1 focused on the role of ingroup bias in social information search in an abstract risky gambling task. Studies 2 and 3 investigated the process of social information search in a more ecologically-valid election prediction task. Democrats and Republicans were asked to predict the outcome of state-level elections, after which they were able to search the decisions of others and readjust. Study 2 focused on the role of uncertainty, while study 3 also included the role of ingroup bias in social information search. Importantly, we split the search process into initiation-an initial hurdle to seek out social information-and the extent of search after initiation. Finally, study 4 focused on social information use in the election prediction task. Here, Democrats and Republicans saw social information either from their ingroup or outgroup, and information that either aligned with their political beliefs or not. For the social information search studies, we predicted higher levels of search (i) for the in-than outgroup, and (ii) when facing higher uncertainty. For social information use, we predicted stronger weighting of social information when it (i) came from the in-than outgroup, (ii) when it favoured the in-than the outgroup, and (iii) when facing higher uncertainty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1 -Social Information Search, Social Identity, and Uncertainty</head><p>Study 1 (N = 100) investigated how in-and outgroup bias impacts social information search across different levels of uncertainty. Participants started by completing a Topical Social Survey, which primed and established their in-and outgroup identity in relation to an important partisan social issue, gender, and political leaning (for more details, see Methods). The ingroup manipulation was successful with participants identifying strongly with the ingroup (M = 5.73 out of 7; SD = 0.09) and not with the outgroup (M = 1.52 out of 7; SD = 0.11). Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides descriptive statistics on the participants in study 1 (and studies 2-4).</p><p>Next, participants performed a Gambling Task, adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Slagter et al., 2023)</ref>, where they made a series of choices under risk (i.e., lower uncertainty) and ambiguity (i.e., higher uncertainty, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>-B). In both conditions, participants had to decide between a safe option (5 point reward) or a risky gamble <ref type="bibr">(8, 14, 20, 32, 35, and 50 point reward)</ref>. Importantly, prior to making a decision, participants could search the decisions of up to 20 previous participants on the same trial. They could also make a decision without searching for any social information. They were informed that the other participants belonged to either their in-or outgroup (between-subject design). Participants were financially rewarded for the amount of points collected across four randomly-selected trials (for a detailed overview of the task, see Methods). . Schematic representation of the Gambling Task in study 1 (A-B) and the Election Prediction Tasks in study 2 (C-D), study 3 (E-F), and study 4 (G-H). (A) In the Gambling Task, participants either made decisions under risk or ambiguity (lower or higher uncertainty; within-subjects). Within each condition, they needed to decide between a gamble worth between 8 to 50 points (yellow button) or a safe option worth 5 points (blue button). (B) To inform themselves, participants could search the decisions of up to 20 previous in-or outgroup participants (between-subjects) by clicking on the grey boxes. Once revealed, yellow indicated either a risk or ambiguity choice and blue indicated the safe option. Ingroup members shared the same gender, political ideology, and stance on a selected topical issue as the participant (and vice versa for outgroup members). (C) In the Election Prediction Task (study 2), participants first predicted the election outcome of a U.S. state (Red [Republican]; Blue <ref type="bibr">[Democratic]</ref>) and provided their confidence on a scale from 1 (not at all confidence) to 11 (completely confident). (D) participants could then reveal up to 20 grey boxes showing the choices of previous participants, revealing blue (red) indicated that the previous participant chose a Democratic (Republican) outcome. Finally, participants could provide their revised prediction and confidence. (E-F) In study 3, all aspects remained identical to study 2, except that participants could now reveal 10 choices from Democrats and 10 from Republicans. Revealing preferential choices (e.g., Democrats seeking choices from Democrats) was quantified as ingroup search, and outgroup search otherwise (e.g., Democrats seeking choices from Republicans). (G) In study 4, participants were first asked to predict what percentage of votes would go to either Democrats or Republicans for a particular state, and their associated level of confidence (low; high). (H) Participants then observed the prediction of a single previous participant-either a Democrat or Republican-and could make a second prediction.</p><p>Given the experimental setup, we expected participants to not search on a substantial portion of trials (for histograms, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Supplementary Figure 1</ref>), and used a hurdle model to account for this data structure (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Slagter et al., 2023)</ref>. We first modelled whether participants initiated a search or not (the initial hurdle). For participants who took the hurdle, we tested how much they searched (i.e. number of boxes revealed). We modelled the initial hurdle using a logistic regression model with search initiation (no; yes) as the response variable, and as fixed effects: group (outgroup, ingroup) and uncertainty (low, high; for full model details, including additional fixed effects, see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 2</ref>). For the second part, which only included trials where participants searched, we examined the proportion of search using a beta regression. For all models, we used Bayesian mixed-effects models (brms; Bürkner, 2017), with participant id as a random intercept. We report the means of the posterior distribution and the 95% credible intervals (CI).</p><p>On average, participants initiated search in 27.14% of the trials (1,140 out of 4,200 trials).  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), when facing higher uncertainty (for full model results, see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2 -Search and Uncertainty in Predicting the 2020 U.S. General Elections</head><p>Study 2 (N = 196) investigated the role of social information search and uncertainty in a more ecologically-valid decision-making task. Prior to the 2020 U.S. General Elections (16-27/10/2020), participants had to forecast the election outcomes of 20 U.S. states. The states consisted of 10 Easy-States (e.g., New York as a Democratic state; low uncertainty) and 10 Swing-States (e.g., Pennsylvania; high uncertainty). Participants first rated their prediction (i.e., Democratic or Republican) and then indicated their associated level of confidence using an 11-point scale (low to high; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>). They could then sample up to 20 decisions made by other participants on the same trial, after which they had to provide a revised prediction and confidence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>). The political orientation of the previous participants was undisclosed, though participants were informed that previous participants were incentivised for correctness. Similar to study 1, participants could decide whether to search or not. Participants were incentivized based on the accuracy of their most confident predictions. Two of their most confident predictions were randomly selected and each correct prediction led to a higher reward (for a detailed overview of the task, see Methods).</p><p>Participants reported lower initial confidence levels (higher uncertainty) when predicting the outcomes of high uncertainty states (beta = .15, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[.13, .17]</ref>). Hence, we used participants' initial confidence level as a measure of the uncertainty in their predictions. <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure 2</ref> shows aggregate initial confidence levels for low vs. high uncertainty states. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Social information search initiation, extent of search, and social information use descriptive statistics in study 1 (A-D), and the Election Prediction Tasks in study 2 (E-F), study 3 (G-J), and study 4 (K-L). In study 4, social information use (s) was calculated as the relative adjustment from the first to the second prediction per state (s = 0 meaning ignoring social information; s = 1 fully copying social information; and s = 0.5 weighing first prediction and social information equally). Small dots represent participant-level data, and the large black dots represent the aggregate mean with SE; boxplots show the median and the interquartile range (IQR); and whiskers indicate an additional 1.5 IQR. Model results for all studies. For studies 1-3, the model results include social information search initiation and the amount of social information search. Group (Out-/In-) = coded out-to ingroup, with "outgroup" as reference. Uncertainty (Low/High) = coded as low vs. high uncertainty, with "low" as reference (only for study 1 and study 4). For studies 2-3, uncertainty was rated using an 11-point scale, with higher numbers representing higher uncertainty. Study 4 focused on social information use. Dots represent the mean and error bars the 95% CI of the posterior distribution.</p><p>Participants initiated search in 66.35% of the trials (2,601 out of 3,920 trials), which was substantially higher than in study 1. <ref type="figure">Figure 2E</ref>-F shows descriptive statistics for search initiation and amount of search across low and high uncertainty (median split). We ran a hurdle model to assess how initial confidence and political identity (Democrat, Republican) affected search initiation (no; yes) and search proportion (for full model results, see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 3</ref>).</p><p>Similar to study 1, we found that participants were more likely to initiate search (beta = .27, 95% CI = [.24, .31]; <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), and explore a higher proportion of choices (beta = .11, 95% CI = [.09,</p><p>.13]; <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), when they were less confident (i.e., higher uncertainty). Political identity did not affect search initiation (beta = -.30, 95% CI = [-1.02, .41]) or proportion search (beta = .04, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-.31, .39]</ref>). Study 2 shows that the uncertainty results from study 1 generalises to this more ecologically-valid context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3 -Search, Social Identity, and Uncertainty in Predicting the 2020 U.S. General</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elections</head><p>Study 3 (N = 200) builds on study 2 by including preferential in-and outgroup search. All study aspects remained identical to study 2, with the exception that participants could now search the predictions made by 10 Democrats and/or 10 Republicans within the same trial ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure   1E</ref>-F). Participants could thus simultaneously search the decisions of both in-and outgroup members, mimicking a more real-world situation, where social information was also more salient for the task. We categorized participants' search as ingroup when they preferentially searched choices within their own party (e.g., a Democrat seeking other Democrat choices), as outgroup when they preferentially searched choices from the other party (e.g., a Democrat seeking Republican choices), and as equal when their search was balanced.</p><p>Participants' reported lower confidence levels (higher uncertainty) when predicting the outcomes of high uncertainty states (beta = .12, 95% CI = [.11, .14]), and thus, we used their confidence level as a measure of their uncertainty. Participants initiated search in 64.83% of the trials (2,593 out of 4,000 trials). <ref type="figure">Figure 2G</ref>-J shows descriptive statistics for search initiation and amount of search across the in-and out-group and uncertainty levels (median split). We ran a hurdle model to assess how group (outgroup, ingroup), initial confidence, and political identity (Democrat, Republican) affected search initiation (no; yes) and search proportion (for full model results, see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 4</ref>). Unlike study 1, participants' initiated more search for the ingroup (beta = .18, 95% CI = [.10, .26]; <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Though, like study 1, the proportion of search did not differ between the in-and outgroup (beta = .04, 95% CI = [.02, .10]; <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). In other words, participants were more likely to search any ingroup choices; yet, for those who did initiate search, they searched equally between the in-and outgroup. As with study 2, search initiation (beta = .21, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[.19, .24]</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), and amount of search (beta = .04, 95% CI = [.02, .06]; <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), was higher when participants were less confident (i.e., higher uncertainty).</p><p>Participants identifying as Republicans initiated less search (beta = -.67, 95% CI = [-1.30, -.04]), though political identity did not affect proportion of search (beta = .04, 95% CI = [-.31,</p><p>.39]).</p><p>Study 3 replicates the findings from study 1, showing that participants search in-and outgroup information equally when search has begun. Though, in this more ecologically valid task, at a time close to the U.S. General Elections, we find that search initiation is higher for the ingroup. Study 3 also replicates the findings from studies 1-2, showing that higher uncertainty leads to higher levels of social information search.</p><p>Studies 1-3 were designed to study social information search and not social information use (i.e., the influence of observed choices on participants' decisions). Their design largely prevented us from testing social information use for various reasons. For example, in study 1, participants initiated search in only 27% of the trials (1,140 out of 4,200 trials). While study 2 and 3 had higher search initiation (~65% of trials), across all studies, the social information predominantly pointed in the direction of participants' initial prediction. In study 3, the social information matched participants' initial choices in 78.74% (1,993 out of 2,531 trials). And of the total number of initial choices, only 9.92% were revised (219 out of 2,374). Study 4 was designed to provide a strong test of social information use.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>U.S. General Elections</head><p>In study 4 (N = 221), we ensured that the social information stemmed from previous participants whose predictions deviated from the initial estimates of the participants. Further, we experimentally varied the observed participant's group membership (Democrat; Republican) and the direction of social information to be either in favour of the participant's preferred outcome (e.g., Democrat majority for Democrats) or away from their preferred outcome (e.g., Republican majority for Democrats). This design allowed us to causally measure adjustments participants made after observing the predictions or others, providing a direct assessment of social information use.</p><p>For each of the 20 states, participants started by predicting what percentage of votes would go to either Democrats or Republicans (E 1 ). They also stated their confidence in their initial prediction (low; high; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1G</ref>). Participants then observed the prediction of a single previous participant (X) and could make a second prediction (E 2 ; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1H</ref>). Social information use (s) was calculated as the relative adjustment from the first to the second prediction per state</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(s = [E 2 -E 1 ] / [X -E 1 ]</formula><p>; with s = 0 meaning ignoring social information; s = 1 fully copying social information; and s = 0.5 weighing the own first prediction and social information equally).</p><p>Participants observed predictions from the ingroup (e.g., Democrats observing Democrats) in one block, and from the outgroup (e.g., Democrats observing Republicans) in another block (counterbalanced). To test for favourability, we varied the direction of social information within blocks. Relative to the participant's first prediction, the social information indicated more or less votes for the participant's favoured party. Participants were incentivised for accuracy, where two of their predictions were selected and each correct prediction led to a higher reward (for a detailed overview of the task, see Methods).</p><p>Adjustments from first to second predictions were overwhelmingly in the range 0 ≤ s ≤ 1 (88%; <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure 3</ref>). This implies that participants' second predictions were typically weighted averages of personal information and social information.</p><p>The subsequent analyses focus on these cases only. Overall, participants adjusted 29% towards social information. This indicates that, on average, participants assigned more than twice as much weight to their own first predictions than to the social information, reflecting the widely documented phenomenon of "egocentric discounting" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Morin et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Toelch, Bruce, et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 2K</ref>-L shows descriptive statistics for social information use across the in-and out-group and low and high uncertainty (high vs. low confidence).</p><p>Next, we modelled how the strength of social information use (s) was influenced by group (outgroup, ingroup), favoured direction (no, yes), the interaction between group and favoured direction, and uncertainty (low, high; for full model results, see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table   5</ref>). Participants used more social information when it came from an ingroup member compared to an outgroup member (beta = .03, 95% CI = [.01, .05]; <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Participants also used more social information when that information pointed in the direction favourable to the participant's affiliated party (beta = .03, 95% CI = [.00, .05]). That is, participants adjusted their predictions more if social information showed a higher vote share for their preferred party than their own first prediction, compared to when it showed a lower voter share. Favourability did not depend on the source of social information (interaction effect between group x favour; beta = -.02, 95% CI = [-.05, .01]). Finally, participants used more social information when they were more uncertain (i.e., lower confidence; beta = .05, 95% CI = [.03, .07]; <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated the impact of (partisan) group identity and uncertainty on social information search and use. Study 1 focused on the role of ingroup bias in social information search in a gambling task; studies 2 and 3 did so in a more ecologically-valid election prediction task; finally, study 4 focused on the role of ingroup bias in social information use. Studies 1-3</p><p>show that participants searched equally from ingroup and outgroup sources once search was initiated. However, in the election prediction task, where social information was arguably more salient to the task, participants were more likely to initiate ingroup social information search, revealing a bias in search initiation. Study 4 found that participants put greater weight on information stemming from in-than outgroup sources, and when the social information aligned with their preferred outcomes. Additionally, uncertainty reliably increased both social information search and social information use across all studies.</p><p>In the gambling task (study 1), participants did not preferentially seek ingroup (actively avoid outgroup) social information during search initiation; whereas in the election prediction task (study 3), participants were more likely to initiate search from ingroup members, resulting in the avoidance of outgroup information. This discrepancy could be due to the former task being more abstract, and the latter more ecologically valid (although see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Slagter et al., 2023)</ref>. For instance, the gambling task, requiring limited personal investment, emphasises hypothetical and probabilistic rewards (the chance of a green ball drawn from an urn), where social information may be of limited value. In contrast, the election prediction task, conducted weeks before the 2020 U.S. General Elections, could have heightened the salience of partisan group identity, especially as it was more directly tied to the task's relevance. Indeed, such a finding also ties in with prior research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robertson et al. (2023)</ref> assessed online news consumption behavior prior to the 2018 and 2020 U.S. Elections, where they quantified participants' Google Search results, the links followed, and all other URLs visited while browsing. While they did not find evidence for a filter-bubble (i.e., Google recommending co-partisan content), they did so for selective search:</p><p>Participants visited more news websites that aligned with their political identity. Despite these differences in search initiation in study 1 and study 3, it is striking that once participants began searching, both tasks showed similar patterns: Participants explored ingroup and outgroup sources equally. This is encouraging, as it suggests a willingness to consider diverse perspectives, regardless of group identity. We encourage future research that varies levels of partisan identity salience, task relevance, and barriers to search to shed further light on these findings.</p><p>Participants exhibited an ingroup bias in social information use, and also when social information indicated a preferred outcome for the participant's favoured party. The interpretation and integration of social information is, thus, not a neutral process but influenced by motivational factors tied to partisan group identity. These findings align with extensive literature on ingroup bias, which suggests that individuals are more likely to accept and integrate information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs or preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ditto et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Van Bavel &amp; Pereira, 2018)</ref>. Notably, in study 4 (and also study 3), participants received monetary incentives for accuracy and their decisions could not be observed by others, minimising the scope for motivations to protect their (political) identity, or attempts to gain social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kahan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kunda, 1990</ref>). Yet, participants integrated information more when it came from a co-partisan and signalled better outcomes for their favoured party.</p><p>Regardless of whether this result may reflect wishful thinking, or conversely, selective discounting of displeasing information, this highlights the pervasive influence of partisan group identity on belief formation.</p><p>Uncertainty emerged as a key motivating factor across all studies. Consistent with prior research, participants sought more social information when faced with higher levels of uncertainty, whether in the gambling task (study 1) or the election prediction tasks (studies 2-3).</p><p>Moreover, uncertainty also increased the likelihood of belief updating based on social information (study 4). These findings align with previous established research that has shown uncertainty to be a primary driver of social information use-individuals are more likely to incorporate social information into their decision-making when uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bach &amp; Dolan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">FeldmanHall &amp; Nassar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kendal et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Toelch, Bach, et al., 2014)</ref>. Thus, the dual role of uncertainty highlights its fundamental importance in shaping both the search for, and the use of, social information in decision-making. Further, given that we replicate the well-established uncertainty effects on both information search and use across the four studies, this goes to show that participants were sensitive to these manipulations and engaged with the task, giving us confidence in our overall results.</p><p>Our findings bear relevance for understanding and addressing polarisation in digital media environments. In today's polarised media landscape, concerns regarding filter bubbles and echo chambers abound. Some findings strongly argue that people self-select into co-partisan information silos <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barberá et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robertson et al., 2023)</ref>, whereas others argue the opposite <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dubois &amp; Blank, 2018</ref>; for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Terren &amp; Borge-Bravo, 2021)</ref>. Our results offer more nuanced insights: Although biases in search initiation reflect a tendency to seek ingroup sources in certain contexts, the equal exploration of ingroup and outgroup information suggests that people may be more open to diverse views than given credit for, especially when barriers of search are minimised. Relatedly, these findings also challenge the effectiveness of interventions that focus solely on providing a balanced information diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bozdag &amp; van den Hoven, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Instead, the persistence of polarisation may be more strongly related to the differential weighting of information from in-versus outgroup sources. In efforts to correct inaccurate beliefs-such as those concerning vaccine safety or climate change-information may be most effective when it comes from trusted ingroup sources (e.g., local [copartisan] leaders; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Guilbeault et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pink et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, interventions should consider leveraging trusted ingroup messengers or reducing the salience of partisan identity when presenting countervailing information.</p><p>Limitations and future directions warrant consideration. Although intentional, we employed a controlled experimental environment-also with one-off updates in the election prediction tasks-that does not fully capture the complexity of real-world decision-making.</p><p>While this approach allowed us to isolate core mechanisms of social information search and use, future research should aim to replicate these findings in more naturalistic settings to enhance ecological validity. In addition, the relatively modest effect sizes across our studies suggest that further research is needed to identify the conditions under which these biases (or lack thereof)</p><p>are most likely to manifest and to quantify their broader real-world impact. It is important to note that biases can compound and be amplified over the course of interactions to impact collective outcomes. In a social network, people repeatedly observe similar views when surrounded by like-minded others, who preferentially seek and share information favourable to their own views, and disregard discordant views <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Garimella et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McPherson et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mosleh et al., 2021)</ref>. Beyond this, the discrepancy in search initiation and equal extent of social information search once initiated, coupled with biased social information use, raises intriguing questions about whether these findings generalize to other forms of group identity (political or not; U.S. or not), gender, religion, or nationality. Finally, future studies could investigate social information search and use under conditions such as time pressure, cognitive load, and the influence of individual-level moderators, including personality traits, where these effects may be further exacerbated.</p><p>This study not only extends the existing research on social learning but also prompts further inquiry into the degree to which echo chambers and filter bubbles are a product of individual behavior compared to motivational or structural influences. The central challenge lies in identifying the conditions under which selective social information search and usage occur, as well as understanding their underlying causes. Ultimately, these insights are crucial for designing effective strategies-be they technological or policy-driven-that promote a more balanced engagement with information and help mitigate partisan polarization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Topical Social Survey</head><p>Next, a Topical Social Survey was used to prime and establish participants' in-or outgroup partisan identity. Participants started by selecting a topical social issue they felt strongly about. The list of topical issues included gun control, drug legalisation, immigration, healthcare, and student loans (taken from Pryor et al., 2019 and the Heritage Foundation).</p><p>Participants were then presented with a statement related to the chosen issue (e.g., "Adults should not have the right to carry a concealed handgun"), had to indicate their level of (dis)agreement with it (e.g., whether they were pro or against gun control), and provided a 50-word response on their stance. Next, via two 50-word prompts, participants were asked to deliberate a prototypical identity for someone who would share and oppose their views, respectively. Participants' stance on the social issue statement, along with their gender and political ideology, were used to define their profile summary (e.g., male, conservative, pro-gun control). Finally, participants were presented with a group of 20 individuals who were either matched (i.e., ingroup) or were diametrically opposed (i.e., outgroup) to their own profile, and had to indicate how strongly they identified with both groups, using the 7-point "Inclusion of Other in the Self" scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aron et al., 1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gambling Task</head><p>Participants were then presented with a Gambling Task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1A-B)</ref>.

Participants did not receive feedback to avoid learning effects. All gambles (except two) offered a higher expected value than the safe option. The gamble was represented by a vase filled with a mix of green and black balls, where drawing a green ball resulted in a win, and a black ball in no points. The odds of winning the gamble were explicitly shown for choices under risk (e.g., 85 green balls versus 15 black balls; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). For the high uncertainty condition-choices under ambiguity-an incomplete distribution was shown: 15 balls out of 100 balls ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A)</ref>. The ambiguity probabilities closely mirrored the risk-probability in ratio (e.g., 85/100 reflected via 13/15 green balls).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Election Prediction Task</head><p>The objective of the Election Prediction Task was to predict state-level election outcomes for the upcoming 2020 U.S. General Elections. For each trial, participants were presented with a U.S. state (e.g., Colorado) and had to make an initial prediction between a Democratic election outcome or a Republican election outcome ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C)</ref>, and they had to indicate their confidence in the prediction on a 11-point scale, with 1 being 'Not at all confident' and 11 'Completely confident' ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>). After making a prediction and rating their level of confidence, participants could search the prior decisions of 20 participants. If the box turned blue (red), it indicated that the previous player predicted a Democratic (Republican) outcome ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>).</p><p>Participants then provided their revised choice and confidence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>). Participants did not receive information about the identity of these 20 previous participants (i.e., whether they identified as a Republican or Democrat), only that they were also incentivised for accuracy.</p><p>Participants had to predict the election outcomes of 20 U.S. states, consisting of 10 Easy-State and 10 Swing-State trials, reflecting low and high uncertainty. Easy-States are those that are historically easier to predict the outcome of (e.g., New York being a Democratic state);</p><p>whereas Swing-States are historically more difficult to predict (e.g., Pennsylvania). The Easyand Swing-States were further balanced and divided into whether they would be Democratic or Republican majority states. Whether a state was an Easy-or Swing-State, and whether the state leaned Democratic or Republican, was determined by polling data from FiveThirtyEight's forecasts (17/10/2020; https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/; for a list of all trial properties and details on the states, <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 7</ref>).</p><p>To populate the choices of previous players, we conducted a pilot study in which participants (N = 100) predicted the outcome of the 20 states in a solo version of the Election Prediction Task (without the possibility to search the choices of others). The sample was similar to the sample in the current study: aged between 18-40, and balanced for gender and political ideology. In all, each state received 100 predictions and these were averaged and visually represented across 20 boxes (i.e., each box representing 5% of the votes).</p><p>Participants completed 20 trials (10 Easy-and 10 Swing-States), which were first randomised and divided into two blocks of 10. Finally, participants were asked to predict who would become president and who would have a senate majority.

Crucially, the nature of social information was now in the form of votes (e.g., percentage of votes expected to go to the Democratic and the Republican party), a more fine-grained measure.

Rearranging this formula as E 2 = (1s) * E 1 + s * X highlights that second predictions were an average of the first predictions and social information, weighted by s (with s = 0 meaning ignoring social information; s = 1 copying social information; and s = 0.5 weighing the own first prediction and social information equally).</p><p>The choices of the previous players (X) were gathered via a pilot study, as in study 2 and study 3.</p><p>Here, participants (N = 100) that were representative of the current study, and similarly incentivised (see below), predicted the outcome of the 20 states in a solo task (without social influence).</p><p>Participants completed 20 trials (10 Easy-and 10 Swing-States) randomised across two blocks of ten trials each. In one block, the previous participant was a member of the ingroup, in the other block, they were a member of the outgroup (counterbalanced in order). Within blocks, we varied the direction of social information relative to the participant's own first prediction. To this end, for each round, we defined a 'target' value of social information, and showed the pre-recorded prediction that was closest to this target. In four rounds, we targeted social information that showed a lower vote share for the participant's preferred party, and in another four rounds, we targeted social information that showed a higher vote share. To enhance believability, the two remaining rounds were 'fillers' in which targeted social information was either very close or very far from the participant's first prediction. These filler trials were omitted from the analyses.</p><p>To allow for a constant scope for adjustments and to control for distance effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Yaniv, 2004</ref>) that might influence adjustments, we targeted social information that was 10-20 percentage points (pp) away from a participant's first prediction. The distribution of distances of the target (e.g. how many rounds had a target value of 10pp, 12pp, etc away from the first prediction) was the same for each participant. To avoid extreme social information, target values could not exceed 90% of votes for either party. Cases where this criterion reduced the scope for adjustment (e.g. when a participant's first estimate was already extreme), or where the pre-recorded prediction closest to the target value was identical to the participant's first estimate were omitted from the analyses (9.9% of cases).</p><p>Regarding incentives, we selected one first prediction, and one revised prediction for each participant to determine their bonus payment. Selection of the first prediction was weighted by participants' confidence, with a round with high confidence being twice as likely to be selected than a round with low confidence. Each second prediction was equally likely to be selected for payment. For each selected prediction, we paid $1.00 if it exactly matched the election outcome for that state (rounded to the nearest percentile). For each percentage point off, we subtracted $0.05. <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure 3</ref>. The distribution of adjustments in individual trials in Study 4. Bars indicate frequencies of adjustments from first to second predictions after observing social information. The white background shows the 'rational' range of 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, in which participants' second predictions were a weighted average of their own first prediction and social information (for details, see) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Molleman et al., 2019)</ref>. Bar colours indicate qualitatively different cases of keeping the first prediction (24% s = 0; green), adopting the social information fully (4% s = 1; pink), and compromising between the two (58% 0 &lt; s &lt; 1; golden yellow). Grey bars and band backgrounds indicate cases where participants moved away from social information (s &lt; 0), or adjusted beyond the social information (s &gt; 1).

Schematic representation of the Gambling Task in study 1 (A-B) and the Election Prediction Tasks in study 2 (C-D), study 3 (E-F), and study 4 (G-H). (A) In the Gambling Task, participants either made decisions under risk or ambiguity (lower or higher uncertainty; within-subjects). Within each condition, they needed to decide between a gamble worth between 8 to 50 points (yellow button) or a safe option worth 5 points (blue button). (B) To inform themselves, participants could search the decisions of up to 20 previous in-or outgroup participants (between-subjects) by clicking on the grey boxes. Once revealed, yellow indicated either a risk or ambiguity choice and blue indicated the safe option. Ingroup members shared the same gender, political ideology, and stance on a selected topical issue as the participant (and vice versa for outgroup members). (C) In the Election Prediction Task (study 2), participants first predicted the election outcome of a U.S. state (Red [Republican]; Blue [Democratic]) and provided their confidence on a scale from 1 (not at all confidence) to 11 (completely confident). (D) participants could then reveal up to 20 grey boxes showing the choices of previous participants, revealing blue (red) indicated that the previous participant chose a Democratic (Republican) outcome. Finally, participants could provide their revised prediction and confidence. (E-F) In study 3, all aspects remained identical to study 2, except that participants could now reveal 10 choices from Democrats and 10 from Republicans. Revealing preferential choices (e.g., Democrats seeking choices from Democrats) was quantified as ingroup search, and outgroup search otherwise (e.g., Democrats seeking choices from Republicans). (G) In study 4, participants were first asked to predict what percentage of votes would go to either Democrats or Republicans for a particular state, and their associated level of confidence (low; high). (H) Participants then observed the prediction of a single previous participant-either a Democrat or Republican-and could make a second prediction.</figDesc></figure>

Small dots represent participant-level data, and the large black dots represent the aggregate mean with SE; boxplots show the median and the interquartile range (IQR); and whiskers indicate an additional 1.5</p></div>
