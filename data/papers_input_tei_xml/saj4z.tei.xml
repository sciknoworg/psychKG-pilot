<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Miscommunication is pervasive in conversational interactions, having short-and long-range impacts on interpersonal communication. The evaluation of the social and cognitive underpinnings of miscommunication have received relatively less attention. Here we report two experiments investigating how a listener's cognitive effort and decision-making processes were affected by a speaker's use of ambiguity that led to a miscommunication. Both Experiments 1 and 2 found that an environmental cue that made a miscommunication more or less salient impacted listener language processing effort. Moreover, findings from Experiment 2 indicated that listeners may develop different processing heuristics dependent upon the speaker's use of ambiguity that led to miscommunication, exerting a significant impact on cognition and decision-making. For instance, we found that perspective taking effort and decision-making complexity metrics predict language processing effort, indicating that instances of miscommunication produced cognitive consequences of indecision, thinking, and cognitive pull. Together, these results indicate that listeners behave both reciprocally and adaptively when miscommunications occur, but the way they respond is largely dependent upon the type of ambiguity and how often it is produced by the speaker.</p><p>Keywords: miscommunication, pragmatics, ambiguity, reciprocity, cognitive effort</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Evaluation of Listener Comprehension Indecision and Cognitive Effort When Unresolvable Ambiguity Leads to Miscommunication</head><p>Miscommunication is a failure to communicate all necessary information needed to correctly interpret a communication partner's message <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(McTear, 2008)</ref>. Miscommunications are pervasive in interactive communication (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Roche, Paxton, Ibarra, &amp; Tanenhaus, 2013)</ref> and are often seen as noise in the communication channel. Healey, <ref type="bibr">de Ruiter, and Mills (2018)</ref> argue, however, that miscommunication is essential to the communication system, as it may be consequential for flexibility and adaptation. Miscommunication has received a great deal of attention with respect to repair mechanisms used specifically to resolve it (e.g., see <ref type="bibr">Healey, de Ruiter, &amp; Mills, 2018)</ref>. However, little research to date has focused on the impact of miscommunication on global social interaction, cognition, and decision making. Here, we evaluate the social, cognitive, and behavioral impacts of miscommunication due to conversational ambiguity on listeners' language comprehension and decision-making.</p><p>Ambiguity sometimes leads to miscommunication and misunderstanding. Because communicating is a cognitively demanding activity, interlocutors are likely attempting to reduce the expenditure of cognitive resources while speaking (e.g., ambiguity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Piantadosi, Tily, &amp; Gibson, 2012</ref>) and listening (e.g., passive recipiency; <ref type="bibr">Jefferson, 1993)</ref>. Ambiguity that leads to miscommunication may occur because the speaker has difficulty in perspective-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Keysar, 2007)</ref> or reduced cognitive resources during message formation <ref type="bibr">(Roßnagel, 2004)</ref>. Listeners, on the other hand, may feign engagement by passively attending during conversations through the use of response tokens <ref type="bibr">(e.g., uh-huh;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jefferson, 1993)</ref>. When speakers unsuccessfully produce ambiguous statements, this could lead to different types of message formation errors. Two key types of errors are speaker-extrinsic, i.e., due to circumstances beyond the speaker's control, and speaker-intrinsic, i.e., due to circumstances within the speaker's control. These two types of errors may differentially affect how much effort listeners are willing to exert to maintain the conversation (e.g., passive vs. active engagement), in turn differentially affecting their language comprehension and decision-making Critically, for a listener to address a miscommunication, it must first be noticed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bjørndahl, Fusaroli, Østergaard, &amp; Tylén, 2015)</ref>, and it is possible that context may drive heuristics (i.e., cognitive shortcuts) associated with handling the communication breakdown. At present, there are no known theoretical accounts regarding what happens to cognitive and decision-making processes when a listener misunderstands what a speaker says. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to evaluate how different types of ambiguity leading to miscommunication (i.e., extrinsic/intrinsic to the speaker) affect the listener's cognitive system and decision-making processes. We do this using eye-and computer mouse-tracking, drawing upon current cognitive, social, and psycholinguistic theories to explain how ambiguity leading to miscommunication impacts cognition and decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>There are a number of reasons why local levels of miscommunication are rarely completely deleterious to an eventually successful conversation. As noted above, ambiguity, a prominent reason for miscommunication <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Keysar, 2007)</ref>, is a natural outgrowth of establishing reference, common ground, and collaboration, making it integral to language <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Piantadosi, Tily, &amp; Gibson, 2012)</ref>. Ambiguity may only be problematic when it causes confusion and is unresolvable, but there are a number of contexts in which disambiguation occurs. In some contexts, ambiguity may be disambiguated by using language to recruit joint attention in the visual world through (e.g., "look here!"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sedivy, Tanenhaus, Chambers, &amp; Carlson, 1999)</ref>, discussing previously shared experiences (e.g., "remember when…"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Metzing &amp; Brennan, 2003)</ref>, but also in the ability to repair through a request for clarification <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Levelt, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">White, 1997)</ref>. Ambiguity has the potential to be a tool that helps streamline communication by reducing cognitive effort for both speakers and listeners who share common ground (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Piantadosi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zipf, 1949)</ref>.</p><p>Though there are a number of strategies to handle problematic ambiguity when it is noticed, there are a number of contexts that may never promote resolution of miscommunication. For instance, one may fail to initiate a repair for cognitive and socio-pragmatic purposes, such as lacking the information necessary to diagnose the miscommunication <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999)</ref> or being afraid to ask the expert <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Jadad et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Marvel, Epstein, Flowers, &amp; Beckman, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>If never addressed, the potential long-range effects may have far more severe outcomes than if handled locally when the miscommunication occurs. Many areas of the research in the domain of miscommunication largely focuses on descriptive aspects of miscommunication in medical settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Halverson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Healey, Mills, Eshghi, &amp; Howes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Isaacs &amp; Creinin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Raley et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sutcliffe, Lewton, &amp; Rosenthal, 2004)</ref> or how listeners request and resolve miscommunication through repair (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bazzanella &amp; Damiano, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dingemanse &amp; Enfield, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kitzinger, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Purver, Hough, &amp; Howes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Schegloff, Jefferson, &amp; Sacks, 1977)</ref>. Thus, at present, there is a gap in the understanding of how miscommunication is resolved and the effects of unresolved miscommunication on language processing and cognition.</p><p>Although the social and cognitive underpinnings of miscommunication have received limited attention, there is evidence that listeners are capable of flexibly adapting to speakers' infelicitous use of language. For example, listeners tend to suspend their expectations about the correctness of word usage when speakers mislabel common words and misuse modifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grodner &amp; Sedivy, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, interlocutors may benefit from requests for repair when they signal that a miscommunication has occurred because the requests enhance detection of miscommunication and improve recovery from communicative errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mills, 2014)</ref>. Young children are also sensitive to the reliability of a speaker's message based on miscommunication.</p><p>For example, with respect to word learning, preschool children who detect inaccuracies in adult references will override the tendency to rely on adults (over peers) to learn new words <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jaswal &amp; Neely, 2006)</ref>. Likewise, children prefer to learn words selectively from more <ref type="bibr">(vs. less)</ref> reliable speakers based on demonstrated reliability over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Birch, Vauthier, &amp; Bloom, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Scofield &amp; Behrend, 2008)</ref>. Though this list of studies is not all-encompassing, these findings suggest that, by encouraging flexible adaptation to ' infelicitous language use, miscommunication serves as a form of communication (see <ref type="bibr">Healey, de Ruiter &amp; Mills, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Despite these findings, it is unclear whether listeners take into account the circumstances behind ambiguities leading to miscommunication. In order for miscommunication to be noticed, its consequences may need to become evident <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bjørndahl, Fusaroli, Østergaard, &amp; Tylén, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In a scenario in which a miscommunication and its consequences are recognized, we may naturally approach conversation cooperatively (i.e., cooperative principle; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Grice, 1975)</ref> and/or reciprocally <ref type="bibr">(theory of reciprocity;</ref><ref type="bibr">McCroskey &amp; Richmond, 2002)</ref>. That is, the type of ambiguity leading to miscommunication and the underlying consequence (together) may trigger different processing heuristics available to handle the communication breakdown. For instance, a cooperative listener may be more likely to take on some of the processing load if she recognizes that the speaker is unintentionally miscommunicating because she and the speaker lack common ground (i.e., miscommunication is extrinsic to the speaker). Alternatively, if the speaker seems to be largely uncooperative or tends to avoid exerting effort to be clear (i.e., miscommunication is intrinsic to the speaker), then the listener may reciprocally disengage to save precious processing resources.</p><p>If the communication error goes unnoticed, however, its type may not matter. Thus, an environmental cue such as feedback indicating whether the miscommunication is speaker-extrinsic or speaker-intrinsic (i.e., interference) may be necessary to bring the miscommunication and the reason for it to the listener's attention so that the listener can selectively adapt their processing effort in the future (one-bit model: simple cues may trigger responses on an as-needed basis; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brennan, Galati, &amp; Kuhlen, 2010;</ref>. This, in turn, should impact the processing heuristic initiated to handle future communication breakdowns.</p><p>To test this, we implement a computer mouse-and eye-tracking paradigm to assess listeners' willingness to put forth processing effort to interpret an ambiguous message that sometimes leads to a miscommunication. Eye-and computer mouse tracking methods were chosen because they have the potential to reveal underlying cognitive and decision-making processes <ref type="bibr">(eye-tracking: Tanenhaus &amp; Spivey-Knowlton, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">mouse-tracking: McKinstry, Dale, &amp; Spivey, 2008)</ref>. Eye-tracking and computer-mouse tracking techniques have been shown to be highly correlated measures of underlying cognition <ref type="bibr">(Chen, Anderson, &amp; Sohn, 2001)</ref>. Gaze dwell time is associated with cognitive processing effort (reading: <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ehrlich &amp; Rayner, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rayner, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rayner &amp; Duffy, 1986</ref>; mental rotation, sentence processing, and quantitative comparisons: <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Just &amp; Carpenter, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr">visual search: Tikhomirov &amp; Poznyanskaya, 1966</ref>; and problem solving: <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Grant &amp; Spivey, 2003)</ref>. Mouse-tracking has been shown to reveal multiple parallel cognitive processes that converge to be integrated into action dynamics over time (see Spivey &amp; <ref type="bibr">Dale, 2004)</ref>, revealing both implicit (i.e., automatic, heuristic-based, early) and explicit processing (i.e., systematic, effortful, late) (Wojnowicz, Ferguson, <ref type="bibr">Dale, &amp; Spivey, 2009)</ref>. Mouse-tracking also has the potential to show the "mind in motion" <ref type="bibr">(Freeman, Dale, &amp; Farmer, 2010)</ref>, revealing indecision, hesitation, and cognitive competition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dale, Roche, Snyder, &amp; McCall, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">McKinstry, Dale, &amp; Spivey, 2008)</ref>. Therefore, pairing mouse-tracking with eyetracking may provide a more comprehensive account of the impact that ambiguity leading to miscommunication exerts on cognition (processing effort) and decision making (hesitation, indecision, and cognitive competition).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study</head><p>The purpose of the current study was to determine how listeners' cognitive and decisionmaking systems are impacted by two different types of ambiguity leading to miscommunication (i.e., speaker-extrinsic vs. speaker-intrinsic) by maximizing recognition of it via interference. To do this, we asked listeners to follow ambiguous instructions (e.g., Click on the small shape in the presence of two small shapes) from a talker who sometimes miscommunicated. We maximized a listener's understanding about the reason the miscommunication occurred via interference from feedback and subsequently measured their action dynamics to determine how processing effort affected their decision-making processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Questions</head><p>Locally, miscommunication should not be problematic, but the compounding nature of continuous miscommunication may affect how listeners approach conversation in important ways.</p><p>There are a number of factors such as attentional processing effort that can impact how listeners approach and handle a miscommunication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>Experiment 1 included the evaluation of speaker extrinsic and intrinsic (ambiguity) errors that were equally distributed over the course of the interaction. This allowed us to evaluate three specific questions related to local (trial-level) changes in language processing effort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Question 1 (RQ1). Do listeners differentiate language processing effort</head><p>depending on the ambiguity that leads to a miscommunication because of speaker-extrinsic vs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>speaker-intrinsic contexts?</head><p>Hypothesis. Miscommunication may trigger the human communication system to be flexible and adaptive to promote fluid communication <ref type="bibr">(Healey, de Ruiter, &amp; Mills, 2018)</ref>. To be efficient communicators, the processing heuristics engaged for successful communication may be adapted to handle miscommunications. For instance, listeners may actively consider the constraints of the conversation and behave cooperatively (cooperative principle; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Grice, 1975)</ref>. For instance, a good interlocutor may take on some of the processing load if she learns a miscommunication has accidentally occurred due to [speaker] extrinsic factors (constrained by the context), such as the speaker unknowingly experiencing a different perspective. However, if the listeners perceived the speaker's error was due to the speaker being imprecise in her language by not exerting enough effort to disambiguate between confusable alternatives (speaker-intrinsic miscommunication), then the listener may reduce language processing effort to match the speaker's level of effort <ref type="bibr">(reciprocity;</ref><ref type="bibr">McCroskey &amp; Richmond, 2002)</ref>. Therefore, it is hypothesized that listeners will treat speaker-extrinsic errors as more forgivable and may take on a greater processing load when ambiguity leads to miscommunication relative to a speaker intrinsic error, in which reciprocity may be assumed. Hypothesis. There should be a relationship between listener language processing effort, perspective taking effort, and complexity of the decision-making process. We hypothesize that more perspective taking on the previous trial should be associated with deeper language processing on the next trial because it disengages automatic processing effort (i.e., one bit model: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brennan, Galati, &amp; Kuhlen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">heuristic vs. systematic-based processing: Chaiken, Liberman, &amp; Eagly, 1989</ref>). More specifically, the one-bit model assumes that understanding an interlocutor's needs does not have to be complex; rather, simple cues may help listeners keep track of important aspects of the conversation activated on an as-needed basis. Therefore, when a cue to attend is received, the receiver's processing heuristic should be adapted to meet the needs of the conversation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Question 2 (RQ2</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary.</head><p>Taken together, these research questions will evaluate the adaptive nature of the cognitive and decision-making systems (RQ3) when they are impacted by different types of speaker errors (intrinsic vs. extrinsic; RQ1) when miscommunication is noticed based on feedback (RQ2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>Experiment 2 extends Experiment 1 in a modified task to determine whether listeners develop a sociolinguistic register (i.e., constraining language for a particular purpose or setting) associated with speaker-specific miscommunication proclivities. Experiment 2 is a modified version of Experiment 1, in which the distribution of ambiguity error types was dichotomous, creating two speaker types: an egocentric speaker (producing a higher proportion of speakerextrinsic errors) and an imprecise speaker (producing a higher proportion of speaker-intrinsic errors). The purpose of Experiment 2 was to replicate the findings of Experiment 1 with regard to local (trial-level) impact of miscommunication (Research Questions 1-3), and, in addition, to evaluate global effects of miscommunication on listeners' language processing effort that may differ based on sociolinguistic register (Research Question 4).</p><p>Research Questions 1-3. As with Experiment 1, Research Questions 1-3 will assess differences in language processing effort at localized instances of the interaction (i.e., trial-level).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis. Localized instances of communication breakdown in Experiment 2, across all</head><p>three research questions, were expected to replicate findings from Experiment 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Question 4. Do listeners adapt language processing effort to handle differences between a speaker's proclivity to produce communication errors?</head><p>Hypothesis: As listeners learn about a speaker's communication style, they are likely to develop sociolinguistic registers for their conversation partners and may vary their language processing effort as a means to adapt to the requirements of the conversational context, which may have beneficial consequences on cognition (e.g., minimizing processing resources needed; <ref type="bibr">Chaiken, Liberman, &amp; Eagly, 1991)</ref>. We should see that listeners will adaptively and differentially approach a speaker with a proclivity to produce a specific type of error. Differences in language processing effort expended by listeners in response to speaker error proclivities may illuminate the processing mechanisms driving the heuristics used to handle communication breakdown.</p><p>Summary. Experiment 1 is intended to establish a basis for whether or not listeners are sensitive to differences in speaker-extrinsic and-intrinsic effects that lead to miscommunication when miscommunication is impactful and noticed. Experiment 2 examines whether listeners adapt their language comprehension to speakers' proclivity to produce extrinsic and intrinsic errors, advancing the understanding of the socio-pragmatic implications of speaker-specific effects on communication breakdown. Together, these studies contribute to a foundational understanding of how the cognitive system adapts to the constraints of the social context of miscommunication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>In the current task, we evaluate the impact of two types of ambiguity leading to miscommunication--speaker extrinsic and speaker intrinsic--on language processing effort. In addition, we evaluate the consequence of miscommunication, which may also impact language processing effort and decision-making processes. Miscommunication often goes unnoticed and could have little impact on a conversation unless it creates some type of explicit consequence for the interlocutor (e.g., request for clarification, disagreement, etc., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bjørndahl, Fusaroli, Østergaard, &amp; Tylén, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brennan &amp; Schober, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mills, 2014)</ref>. We, therefore, consider how differences in language processing effort may be impacted by interference that results in an explicit consequence while preventing the initiation of a repair. Listeners may be more willing to put forth language processing effort if feedback communicates that the error was extrinsic to the speaker, with the error being outside of the speaker's control. . Second, it was expected that action dynamics, which were evaluated via measurement of mouse-cursor trajectories and perspectivetaking effort, would reveal differences in underlying decision-making complexity (i.e., indecision and cognitive pull) when a consequence was made explicit (McKinstry, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Dale, &amp; Spivey, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Sixteen undergraduate students from a university in the Midwestern US (mean age = 21.5 yrs.) participated in the experiment. A priori 2 between x 2 within groups mixed repeated measures power analysis (60 experimental critical trials) using G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007</ref>) with a moderate-to-large effect size (partial η2 = .14, equivalent to f = .40, α = .05, power 1-ß= .95) revealed that N = 8 was sufficient. All participants were native speakers of American English with no reported hearing or speech impairments and normal to normal-corrected vision.</p><p>One participant was removed from the analysis due to her eye-tracking data being corrupted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials: Equipment &amp; Stimuli</head><p>Equipment included an Eyelink 1000 Plus desktop remote eye-tracker, 21" iMac computer, noise-cancelling headphones, wireless mouse, and a CAD-U37 studio condenser microphone.</p><p>Visual Stimuli included 32 shapes: 4 shapes (circle, star, square, and triangle) x 4 colors (blue, green, purple, red) x two sizes (big, small). In each trial, two shapes were paired such that zero, one, or two features overlapped (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, left panel).</p><p>Auditory Stimuli included 280 pre-recorded statements from a Caucasian female ("Courtney"). The statements included instructions referencing one, two, or three of the target object's features: e.g., Click on the red shape / big red shape / big red triangle. To prevent listeners from guessing the upcoming trial structure, a fully-crossed list of possible visual stimulus pair combinations was created (N = 1,964), and items used for the experimental session were pseudorandomly selected from this list (one feature = 114, two features = 103, three features = 63). All recordings were adjusted to the same comfortable listening level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure &amp; Design</head><p>At the start of the experiment, a nine-point calibration, validation, and drift correction method prescribed by SR-Research Eyelink 1000 user manual for eye-tracking was used. Listeners were then told they would be interacting with another person, Courtney, who was seated in the next room. To increase ecological validity, a lab assistant who never interacted with the participant sat quietly outside of the testing room during the experimental task. To begin a trial, listeners clicked on a bullseye button at the bottom center of the computer screen, which initiated a pre-recorded instruction from the pseudo-confederate ("Courtney"). After listeners made a selection, they were presented with a screen in which they were able to see the objects the pseudo-confederate described with feedback regarding the correctness of the selection they made (see  Mouse cursor trace and text were not present in trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]</head><p>A 2 (interference vs. no interference; between subjects) by 3 (Error Type: No Error -Filler, Speaker Extrinsic Error -Critical, Speaker Intrinsic Error -Critical; varied within subjects) design was used. A subset of the filler trials and all of the critical trials contained an ambiguous instruction. Ambiguous statements on filler trials (No Error; NE) included a temporarily ambiguous statement that could easily be resolved based on visual context (e.g., Click on the big red shape in a trial containing a big red and big blue square). However, the critical trials always contained a globally ambiguous statement that could never be resolved by the sentential or visual context, requiring the participant to guess which object Courtney referenced. For example, on some critical trials in which two red shapes were present, Courtney instructed the listener, "Click on the red shape" (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). However, after listeners made a selection, they implicitly learned via feedback that Courtney had either produced the ambiguity because of a perspective difference (i.e., Speaker Extrinsic Error; SEE) or because of imprecise language use (Speaker Intrinsic Error; SIE). Thus, listeners were never provided with any information from the experiment in reference to a SEE or SIE's meaning.</p><p>When Courtney made a SEE, the participants learned she failed to consider that the listener saw different objects than her (i.e., a perspective mismatch). On the other hand, the participant learned that Courtney made an SIE when she referenced an overlapping feature instead of the distinguishing referent, which occurs when a speaker is distracted or cognitively loaded <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Becic et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ferreira &amp; Griffin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fromkin, 1973)</ref>. However, these errors may only be impactful if the listener recognizes an explicit consequence of misunderstanding. To determine the consequences of listeners being told that they guessed incorrectly on critical trials, participants were randomly assigned to an interference/no interference condition. In the interference condition, participants were always told they had chosen the incorrect object (indicated by a large red X;</p><p>100% of critical trials), which acted as an explicit consequence to participants. Alternatively, in the no interference condition, participants were told they had always chosen the correct object (indicated by a large green check; 100% of critical trials).</p><p>It was always clear which object Courtney referenced in No Error trials because a large green check was displayed unless the participant accidentally clicked the wrong object. There were a total of 280 trials, which included 220 filler trials (NE) and 60 critical trials (30 SEE; 30 SIE trials).1 For both conditions, listeners experienced a SIE as the first communicative error, which did not occur until trial 57. After trial 57, the global ambiguity (SIE; SEE) errors and filler trials were pseudo-randomly presented to the listener. It should also be noted that ambiguity is a natural aspect of language and the filler trials contained completely felicitous uses of ambiguitysuch that the ambiguity is likely to go unnoticed because it is easily resolved by the visual context. No participants indicated any surprise or mention of an overuse of ambiguity.</p></div>

Dwell time refers to the amount of time the participant fixated on a given interest area: (1) both objects on the instruction screen on a current trial (is_dwell; dependent variable) and (2) Courtney's objects on the feedback screen following making a selection on the instruction screen (fs_dwell; predictor variable; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). Here, we use dwell time as a proxy for language processing effort (is_dwell) and perspective taking effort (fs_dwell), because dwell time is an established measure of cognitive processing effort in a number of cognitive domains (reading: <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ehrlich &amp; Rayner, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rayner, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rayner &amp; Duffy, 1986</ref>; mental rotation, sentence processing, and quantitative comparisons: <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Just &amp; Carpenter, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr">visual search: Tikhomirov &amp; Poznyanskaya, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr">problem solving: Grant &amp; Spivey, 2003)</ref>. The is_dwell measure evaluates how long the listeners exert effort when visually processing the objects on the instruction screen (i.e., how long they look at the two objects; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, left panel). On the other hand, we were also interested in the potential for listeners to take the perspective of the pseudo-confederate, which 44% of participants indicated they did. The fs_dwell measure provides a more objective measure of perspective taking when dwell time on the pseudo-confederate's objects on the feedback screen is measured. This measure served as a proxy for how much cognitive effort listeners exerted to consider the pseudoconfederate's objects on the feedback screen (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> middle/right, top left corner), with the logic that when the listeners looked longer at these objects, they may have invested effort to understand why the speaker said what she did. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010)</ref> were derived from mouse trajectories to gauge complexity of the decision-making process. X-flips consist of the number of reversals in direction of the mouse movement along the horizontal axis; they provide a measure of indecision and hesitation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dale, Roche, Snyder, &amp; McCall, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">McKinstry, Dale, &amp; Spivey, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Roche, Peters, &amp; Dale, 2015)</ref>.

Growth curve models <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mirman, 2017)</ref> were implemented using the lme4 package in R (R Development Core Team, 2012). These models included the maximum random effect structure permitting model convergence, with item and/or participant set as random intercept(s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barr, Levy, Scheepers, &amp; Tily, 2013)</ref>. When a growth curve model was implemented (see Mirman, 2017), we attempted to evaluate linear change over time. A linear model, rather than an orthogonal polynomial model, was selected because we were interested in linear change over time. Choosing a simpler model allowed for reduction in model complexity. In accordance with the recommendation of Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily (2013), we attempted to implement a fully maximal random effect structure in which all random effects were modeled as random slopes, given that all factors in our design were varied within-subjects. Failure to implement random slopes in such a design results in a random intercepts-only model, increases the likelihood of Type I error <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barr et al, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, when the model failed to converge, a leave-one-out method of random slope removal was implemented until the model converged, as prescribed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barr et al. (2013)</ref>. Plots visualizing linear models were built with ggplot2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Wickham, 2016)</ref> using the glm smoothing method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In the current context, the listener may be confused by the pseudo-confederate's use of ambiguous language. However, when the consequence of the infelicitous ambiguity is not made explicit, the miscommunication may have little impact on listeners <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bjørndahl, Fusaroli, Østergaard, &amp; Tylén, 2015)</ref>. We, therefore, evaluated language processing effort (is_dwell) as a function of what occurred on the previous trial, in which a consequence of a prior miscommunication may or may not have been explicit. It was expected that a prior miscommunication would impact future language comprehension effort. In the analyses that follow, instruction screen dwell time (is_dwell) is assumed to depend on the error type and interference experienced on the previous trial. In a second analysis, fs_dwell (dwell time on the objects displayed on the feedback screen) and the mouse trajectory metrics were assumed to be a predictor of is_dwell on the next listening trial. Previous error type (PET) refers to the type of error (No Error, SEE, or SIE) the participant experienced on the previous trial. PET was chosen because we were interested in how a previous error impacted processing effort on the next language trial.</p><p>Manipulation Check. To begin, we first evaluate whether or not SIE and SEE trials produced longer dwell times relative to NE (filler trials). The model set is_dwell as the dependent variable and Previous Error Type (PET) as the fixed effect using the maximal random effect structure with random intercepts for listeners. Results indicated that SEE trials differed significantly from the NE trials (ß = 195.63, SE = 52.52, t = 3.72, p &lt; .001), but SIE trials did not (ß = 5.69, SE = 49.46, t = 0.11, p = .91) --22% (R2) of the variance in instruction screen dwell time (is_dwell) was accounted for by Previous Error Type (see <ref type="figure">Fig. for means and standard   deviations)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE]</head><p>Language Processing Effort Over Time (analysis 1). To answer Research Questions 1 and 2, we analyzed local dwell time differences on the instruction screen objects (is_dwell) by previous error type (RQ1; critical trials: SEE, SIE; within-participant) and previous interference type (RQ2; interference v. no interference; between-participant) using three linear mixed effects models and a growth curve model. The initial models included (1) a base model representing time (i.e., trial number), (2) a model that evaluated previous interference type (PIT), and (3) a model evaluating previous error type (PET).

Results from the growth curve model using the maximal random effect structure was implemented (marginal R2 = .04, conditional</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R2 = .29).2</formula><p>Results indicated a marginal main effect of PIT (Previous Interference Type) and a marginal PIT x PET x Trial interaction (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). However, significant main effects of PET and Trial were observed in addition to a significant interaction between PIT x Trial and PET x Trial. Only the significant interactions between PIT/PET and trial were interpreted to reduce redundancy in interpretation. Recall that Research Question 1 focused on illuminating differences in processing effort (is_dwell) between error types. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that listeners put in increasingly less processing effort over the course of the experiment after experiencing SIEs, whereas processing effort after experiencing SEEs did not change over time <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 5</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[FIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE]</head><p>To answer Research Question 2, we evaluated the effect of a previous interference trial (PIT) on processing effort, as evidenced by dwell time. There was a marginal main effect of PIT <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>, indicating that listeners exerted marginally more processing effort after receiving interference from a penalty (mean = 2260.21, sd = 992.66) relative to the no interference condition (mean = 2197.92, sd = 1173.37). As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>, there were clear and significant differences in processing effort over time as a function of the interference participants experienced on the previous trial (PIT; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref>). Specifically, listeners tended to disengage from the task (shorter dwell times on instruction objects) following critical trials, but only in the no interference condition. In contrast, there was no evidence of change of is_dwell following critical trials with interference (i.e., when participants learned that they guessed incorrectly after a speaker miscommunication). This result is consistent with our hypotheses in that interference seemed to recruit and maintain more processing resources than no interference.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>), which accounted for 50% of the variance in is_dwell. Addressing Research Question 3 required determining if perspective-taking effort and decision-making metrics predicted processing effort. It was expected that there would be a positive effect of perspective taking effort (fs_dwell), hesitation (x-flips), and cognitive pull (maximum deviation) on is_dwell. As seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, a positive relationship existed between x-flips and is_dwell, indicating that more hesitation was associated with longer dwell times. The interaction between PET and PIT indicated significantly longer dwell times for SEE trials, but only if interference was experienced (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 7</ref>). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Experiment 1 sought to evaluate differences between miscommunication error type (RQ1) and interference condition (RQ2) in addition to establishing whether or not perspective-taking effort and decision-making metrics were related to processing effort (RQ3). The findings support our hypotheses for each research question. Specifically, our results indicated that listeners' language comprehension effort was impacted by the presence of interference and the type of error produced by the pseudo-confederate on the previous trial and was related to decision-making complexity. When listeners experienced a SIE or consistently experienced no negative feedback, listeners tended to disengage from the experimental task over time. In contrast, listeners exerted significantly more language processing effort when the pseudo-confederate produced a SEE; i.e.,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Grice, 1975</ref>). In the case that the SEE was attention-grabbing after a miscommunication occurred, the error may have acted as a prompt to the listener to exert more processing effort. The information about the pseudo-confederate's objects displayed on the feedback screen may have made the SEE more explicit, which may have immediately drawn the listener's attention to the item that did not match their display. The attention drawn to the salient item may have then acted as a trigger to more effortful engagement in cognitive processing on the next trial (e.g., one-bit model; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brennan, Galati, &amp; Kuhlen, 2010)</ref>. On the other hand, if listeners were engaging in the conversation cooperatively, they may have interpreted these errors as accidental and not the fault of the pseudo-confederate, thus engaging her more effortfully. These two alternatives are revisited in Experiment 2.</p><p>The results also seemed to indicate that listeners likely perceived the red X displayed in the interference condition as an explicit indicator that a misunderstanding of the speaker's message had occurred, invoking more language processing effort on the next trial. Not only did the type of error and the interference type impact listener effort, but it affected listeners' perspective-taking (fs_dwell), with measures of decision-making complexity contributing approximately 50% of the variance found in dwell time on objects on the instruction screen (is_dwell).3 Specifically, hesitation (x-flips) and cognitive competition (maximum deviation) on the current trial and longer dwell times on pseudo-confederate objects on the feedback screen (fs_dwell) during the previous trial were significantly related to dwell time on the instruction screen, as these measures interacted with the error and/or interference type.</p><p>A limitation of this experiment is that participants were presented with a mixture of SEE and SIE trials, which could potentially impact how each error is processed. Additionally, only the impact of extreme rates of interference (0% and 100%) was considered. It is unlikely that in a naturalistic communicative interaction, the result of a miscommunication would never or always negatively impact the person who misunderstood. To validate the results of Experiment 1, we modified the current paradigm by separating the two error types (SEE and SIE) into between-subjects conditions (N = 20) and introduced a new condition in which interference was pseudorandomly presented on 50% of error trials. Based on the results of this follow-up experiment, listeners tended to continue to put forth more processing effort after SEEs (mean = 1281.01 msec) relative to SIEs (mean = 1155.23 msec) (ß = 62.91, SE = 18.93, t = 3.32, p &lt; .001; see https://osf.io/tejnr for data and model output). However, there was no difference in processing effort when interference occurred on 50% of error trials (ß = 9.36, SE = 18.93, t = 0.49, p = .62),</p><p>nor was there an interaction between the previous error types and interference type (ß = -3.66, SE = 18.94, t = -0.19, p = .85). This follow-up study provides further support for the results from Experiment 1, implying that listeners are sensitive to different types of miscommunication errors whereas the presence/absence of interference may not have been as impactful to processing effort as we saw in the 100% interference condition of Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, we consider speaker-specific proclivities towards one type of miscommunication on listeners' language processing and decision-making complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>It is unlikely that speakers uniformly produce both speaker-extrinsic and -intrinsic errors during an interaction. Some interlocutors may naturally be more egocentric than others (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Duran, Dale, &amp; Kreuz, 2011)</ref>, while others may be more likely to simply say the wrong thing (e.g., when cognitively loaded or distracted; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Becic et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ferreira &amp; Griffin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fromkin, 1973)</ref>. The primary goal of Experiment 2 was to determine if there were global differences in processing effort as a function of speaker miscommunication proclivity (RQ4). A secondary goal was to replicate the results of Experiment 1 (evaluation of local effects of miscommunication on the trial level; RQ 1-3). We first present the results answering Research Questions 1-3 and then address Research Question 4. To do this, we first evaluated the effect of Previous Error Type (RQ1) and previous interference over time <ref type="bibr">(RQ2)</ref>. We then considered the effect of miscommunication on decisionmaking complexity by evaluating differences in action dynamics and perspective-taking effort to determine if there was a relationship between language processing effort and decision-making hesitation and competition.</p><p>For the primary analysis we aimed to determine whether speaker-specific proclivities to produce a certain type of miscommunication error differentially impacted listeners' cognitive processing effort (a global effect). We also considered the (global) effect of variable interference (0%, 50%, and 100%) to determine how variable probabilities of penalization may interact with previous error types during communication (a sub-goal of RQ4).</p><p>Overall, it was expected that the results of Experiment 2 should produce effects similar to those observed in Experiment 1; however, it was expected that listeners would likely adapt their (global) responding based on conversational context. Based on findings from Experiment 1, (local) SEE trials and interference should recruit more processing resources. Recall that <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brennan, Galati, and Kuhlen (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Galati and Brennan (2010)</ref> argue that listeners do not need to build complex situation models for their interlocutors; rather, salient cues may help the listener keep track of conversational context (i.e., one-bit model). Therefore, the cue distribution (i.e., speaker error proclivity and interference) should differentially impact processing heuristics recruited to engage in communicative interaction.</p></div>

All participants were native speakers of American English with no reported hearing or speech impairments and normal to corrected-normal vision. A total of 13 participants were excluded: five due to corrupted mouse cursor data, seven due to eye tracking data quality, and one due to a decision to leave the experiment half-way through (final N = 72, mean age = 19.54 yrs).</p></div>

The MSEE condition included more SEEs than SIEs, whereas the MSIE condition included more SIEs relative to SEEs (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> for trial structure). The number of no error trials was decreased4 from 220 to 145 to reduce the time listeners spent in the task, whereas the number of critical trials was kept the same (60) as in Experiment 1 (total trials = 205, 1 feature = 90 trials; 2 feature = 81 trials; 3 feature = 34 trials). The listeners experienced the first error on trial 34, which was a SEE trial in the MSEE condition and a SIE trial in the MSIE condition. After trial 34, the global ambiguity (SIE; SEE) errors and no error trials were presented to the listener pseudo-randomly. We kept the non-majority error trials in this task to prevent listeners from anticipating the type of error they would experience on a given trial. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Measures were identical to those described above and included two dwell time measures (is_dwell: dwell time on the objects on the instruction screen; fs_dwell: dwell time on the pseudoconfederate's objects on the feedback screen from the previous trial) and two decision-making complexity measures (x-flips: measure of indecision and hesitation; maximum deviation: measure of thinking and/or option competition resulting in cognitive pull).</p></div>

As inExperiment 1, outliers in the is_dwell data were removed for the following analysis (see https://osf.io/tejnr for violin plots), producing results similar to a model that included outliers. As in Experiment 1, we also performed a manipulation check to determine if SIE (ß = 289.85, SE = 26.16, t = 11.08, p &lt; .001) and SEE trials (ß = 105.95, SE = 24.23, t = 4.37, p &lt; .001), relative to NE trials, produced differences in is_dwell.

We analyzed how dwell time on the instruction screen (is_dwell) changed as a function of previous error type (critical trials: SEE, SIE; within-participant) by previous interference type using three linear mixed effects models and a growth curve model. The initial models included (1) a base model representing time (i.e., trial number), (2) a model evaluating previous interference type (PIT), <ref type="formula">3</ref>a model evaluating previous error type (PET), and (4) a model evaluating the interaction between PIT and PET.

The model with the smallest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was retained for interpretation. A test of the model fit indicated that the model evaluating PET (Model 2), PIT by previous error type (Model 3), and the growth curve model (Model 4) produced the best fit, but further evaluation indicated that the growth curve model produced a significantly better fit than the other two models (AIC = 70,466,</p><p>x2(4) = 111.83, p &lt; .001). Results from the growth curve model indicated two significant effects: Time (trial) and PET over time (trial; marginal R2 = .04, conditional R2 = .16;see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> for model results). The effect of time (trial) suggests that listeners reduced processing effort over the course of the experiment. Critically, the effect of previous error type over time replicated from Experiment 1 (RQ 1), such that listeners produced increased language processing effort for SEE trials relative to SIE trials over time (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11)</ref>; however, language processing effort decreased rather than remained stable, as found in Experiment 1. Local instances of interference failed to replicate findings from Experiment 1, RQ 2. This may be related to our failure to control for the global impact of the interference probability (0%, 50%, and 100%) in this analysis, which this will be reconsidered in a subsequent analysis of global differences in language processing effort. 2.07, p = 0.04; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 14)</ref>, and Speaker Proclivity x PET x PIT x Maximum Deviation (ß = -25.26, SE = 12.51, t = -2.02, p = 0.04; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>).</p><p>Maximum Deviation. There were two significant interactions associated with maximum deviation. Because we observed a higher-order interaction, the lower-order interaction will not be interpreted (i.e., speaker proclivity x maximum deviation). The test of simple slopes for the speaker proclivity x PIT x PET x maximum deviation interaction indicated differences in slopes for two conditions: MSEE, SIE trials, no interference ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>, top left panel, red line); MIE, SEE trials, interference <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 12, bottom right panel, blue line)</ref>. As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>, listeners who were assigned to the MSEE speaker but experienced no interference on SIE trials exhibited a positive relationship between maximum deviation and is_dwell (ß = 102.35, SE = 46.33, t = 2.21, p = .03), indicating that additional effort was required to process language during these trials. The opposite occurred for listeners who were assigned to interact with the MSIE speaker but experienced interference on SEE trials (ß = -88.21, SE = 43.50, t = 2.03, p = .04; all other simple slopes n.s.), indicating that less effort was required to process language during these trials. Recall that in Experiment 1, there was a positive relationship between maximum deviation/is_dwell for SEEs but a negative relationship between maximum deviation/is_dwell for SIEs. In Experiment 2, this effect flipped when the speaker had a proclivity to produce one type of error over another, indicating greater indecision during SIEs when interacting with the MSEE speaker and less indecision during SEEs when interacting with the MSIE speaker. This suggests that when listeners experienced more cognitive competition at selection, they seemed to reduce language processing effort expenditure on SEE trials when interacting with the MSIE speaker. This effect provides further support that listeners differentially adapt not only their language processing effort expenditure but also their decision-making metrics based on conversational context. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[FIGURE 12 ABOUT HERE]</head><p>Perspective-taking effort (fs_dwell). As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>, listeners assigned to interact with the MSEE speaker who experienced a SEE on a previous trial put in more perspective-taking effort on the subsequent feedback screen and exerted more language processing effort on the next trial. This effect replicated the PET x fs_dwell interaction in Experiment 1. Moreover, this suggests that SEE feedback recruited more attentional resources that shifted listeners' attention to the objects the speaker saw. When listeners looked at the speaker's objects, this, in turn, promoted expenditure of additional language processing effort on the next trial.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure   14</ref>;ß = 38.56, SE = 19.18, t = 2.01, p = .04, all other slopes n.s.). This result suggests that listeners who were penalized when interacting with the MSIE speaker experienced more hesitation when making a response selection, impacting their language processing effort expenditure. [ <ref type="bibr">FIGURE 14 ABOUT HERE]</ref> Summary. As seen in Experiment 1, perspective-taking effort (fs_dwell) and decisionmaking metrics (x-flips; maximum deviation) were predictive of language processing effort. In Experiment 2, we also see that perspective taking effort (fs_dwell) and decision-making metrics (x-flips; maximum deviation) were also predictive of language processing effort. Specifically, cognitive competition was positively related to language processing effort only when the listener interacted with an MSEE speaker, an SIE, and the listener was not penalized. We also saw that listeners exhibited more hesitation (x-flips) after a penalty from an MSIE speaker. This suggests that listeners' decision-making processes have an impact on language processing effort such that listeners adapt their processing heuristics based on contingencies in conversational context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Differences in Language Processing Effort (analysis 3)</head><p>. We investigated whether listeners' dwell time on the instruction screen objects (is_dwell) depended on the pseudoconfederate's error distribution and the probability of interference. This analysis addressed RQ4, which asked whether processing effort differed globally as a function of speaker proclivity and interference probability. To test this question, we used a linear mixed effect model with is_dwell as a dependent variable and error distribution (MSEE, MSIE) and interference probability (0%, 50%, 100%) as between-subjects factors. The maximal random effect structure permitting model convergence was implemented, with participant and trial number set as random intercepts. Results indicated a significant interaction between miscommunication error distribution and interference probability (ß = 86.58, SE = 37.39, t = 2.32, p = .02; marginal R2 = .01; conditional R2 = .44). As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 15</ref>, listener language processing effort (is_dwell) significantly increased when interference probability for listeners in the MSIE condition increased (MSIE_0% relative to MSIE_50%: mean difference = 258.49 msec, p &lt; .001; MSIE_0% relative to MSIE_100%: mean difference = 254.59 msec, p &lt; .001). However, listener language processing effort decreased for listeners assigned to the MSEE condition when interference probability reached 100% (MSEE_0% vs. MSEE_100%; mean difference = -169.31 msec; p &lt; .01), and no difference was observed when interference probability increased to 50% from 0% interference (MSEE_0% vs. MSEE_50%; mean difference = -22.63 msec; p = .99). It was expected that listeners would adapt their language processing effort depending on the speaker's communication style, which was confirmed by the results discussed here. Specifically, speaker miscommunication proclivity and global interference differentially impacted listeners' language processing effort. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[FIGURE 15 ABOUT HERE]</head><p>These results were rather surprising as the results from the local analysis in Experiments 1 and 2 suggested that SEE trials would be more likely to recruit extra language processing effort.</p><p>We consider the implications of this finding in the discussion section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Three analyses were conducted to evaluate listener processing effort: (1) local effects of communication errors (RQ1) and interference (RQ2), (2) effects of decision-making complexity metrics on local processing effort (RQ3), and (3) global effect of speaker proclivity to miscommunicate (RQ4). Based on the results of Experiment 1, it was found that SEE trials recruited significantly more language processing effort than SIE trials over time. This effect was replicated in Experiment 2; however, the effect of previous interference type did not replicate. We also saw that maximum deviation, x-flips (hesitation), and fs_dwell were predictive of is_dwell, replicating findings from Experiment 1. Moreover, listeners interpreted speech produced by speakers with different proclivities to miscommunicate in different ways, and interference probability associated with miscommunication also differentially impacted language processing effort.</p><p>The observed global differences in the way listeners handled different types of speaker proclivities to produce communication errors is consistent with the one-bit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brennan, Galati, &amp; Kuhlen, 2010;</ref>. For listeners assigned to the MSIE condition, interference presented with the more salient communication error cue in SEE trials may have acted as a salient cue to kick them out of simple processing heuristics through engagement of attentional resources. Visual cues presented on the feedback screen (communication error and interference cues) together may have produced an additive effect that triggered a change from heuristic to systematic processing, resulting in a global increase of processing effort. However, for listeners assigned to the MSEE condition, processing effort decreased regardless of interference from communication errors. Perhaps because listeners learned that the majority of the errors produced by the MSEE speaker were SEEs (i.e., due to perspective mismatch), they could simplify their processing heuristic because no additional environmental cue on SIE trials triggered them to change their approach. Moreover, when the error type switched to SIE, listeners assigned to the MSEE condition, experienced more cognitive pull, which came at more of a cost than it did for listeners assigned to the MSIE condition. This may have occurred because the listeners in the MSEE condition were balancing cognitive costs when they were required to expend more decisionmaking effort, which may have been more computationally expensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>In the current study, we investigated whether listeners differentiate their localized language processing effort depending on speakers' miscommunication type in a previous interaction (Experiment 1) and whether listeners' processing effort was globally affected by a speaker's proclivity to produce one type of error over another (Experiment 2). In both experiments, it was expected that listeners would adapt their processing effort based on the type of error that occurred, but also that a speaker's proclivity to produce one error over another would also differentially impact processing effort. In both Exp. 1 and 2, listeners put forth significantly more processing effort after (locally) experiencing a speaker-extrinsic error (RQ1). Moreover, global differences occurred as a function of speakers' proclivity to produce one error over another <ref type="bibr">(Exp. 2,</ref><ref type="bibr">RQ4)</ref>.</p><p>Together, these results confirm our hypotheses by providing evidence of both localized and global effects of speakers' miscommunication on listeners' language processing effort.</p><p>In answering Research Question 2, we were interested in whether or not listeners differentiated processing effort as a function of interference from a previous miscommunication.</p><p>Listeners must assess the impact of miscommunication on understanding. It was expected that the perceived impact of interference would differentially impact processing effort; indeed, results from both studies confirm this hypothesis. The additive effect of SEE paired with penalization for guessing incorrectly in the MSIE condition may have triggered listeners' cognitive system to expend more language processing effort because the cues were attentionally salient. By contrast, listeners in the MSEE condition consistently and regularly received SEE cues, which may have helped them reduce language processing effort when paired with interference. Additionally, SIE trials may not have elicited an attentional processing boost in the MSEE condition similar to that elicited by SEE trials in the MSIE condition because SIE trials did not provide a salient environmental cue to recruit processing resources over and above SEE trials. This may have helped reduce processing resources globally because they were not intermittently triggered to pay more attention.</p><p>Research Question 3 aimed to determine whether or not perspective-taking effort and response dynamics during decision-making were predictive of language processing effort. It was expected that when a cue to attend is received, listeners' processing heuristics should be adapted to meet the needs of the conversation. If a listener exerted more processing resources, it was expected that longer instruction screen dwell times (is_dwell) would be related to longer feedback screen dwell times (fs_dwell), more x-flips (i.e., hesitation), and larger maximum deviation (i.e., cognitive pull). Results from Experiment 1 confirmed this hypothesis, such that longer fs_dwell times, more hesitation (x-flips) and more cognitive pull (maximum deviation) occurred when the error was made more salient (i.e., through feedback and/or communication error cues). These effects were replicated in Experiment 2 except that listeners adapted their decision-making metrics based on the speaker's proclivity to produce a specific error type. For example, listeners in the MSIE condition seemed to put forth less language processing effort when they experienced cognitive pull after SEE trials in which a penalty was incurred, whereas the opposite occurred for SIE trials in the MSEE condition. It is currently unclear why the amount of language processing effort expended differed between the two speaker proclivity conditions, but this finding warrants future exploration into the action dynamics associated with understanding confusing language.</p><p>In summary, local miscommunications did not prevent listeners from completing the task successfully, but they did exert compounding effects that impacted the effort listeners expended when comprehending a confusing speaker. The results indicate that, locally, (1) listeners are sensitive to different types of miscommunication; (2) interference differentially affects effort depending on the type of miscommunication experienced; (3) decision-making complexity is impacted by the type of miscommunication and the explicit consequence experienced. Moreover, miscommunications exerted global effects on language comprehension triggering different cognitive processing heuristics, in turn helping the listener adapt to the communicative context. These findings may be impactful in a number of real-world contexts, especially when social rules prevent the listener from asking clarification questions. In a situation where a speaker has a different perspective than the listener and the listener is excessively penalized for misunderstanding, there may be global effects on cognition that lead the listener to disengage from expending language comprehension effort. This has important implications for education and health care, as seen in the lower global processing effort in the MSEE 100% condition in Exp. 2.</p><p>For instance, experts often fail to recognize the jargon they use may be confusing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ali, Khan, Akunjee, &amp; Ahfat, 2006)</ref>, and novices may not know what to ask or may be afraid to ask for clarification <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sheridan et al., 2015)</ref>. When this happens, novice listeners may disengage, resulting in potentially harmful outcomes such as missed learning or educational opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ryan, Gheen, &amp; Midgley, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Isaacs &amp; Crenin, 2003)</ref>. For instance, students in a classroom setting or patients in a doctor's office may lower their language comprehension effort when educators and healthcare providers speak with ambiguity that may never be resolved until a negative outcome occurs (e.g., failing a test or taking medication incorrectly).</p><p>Nevertheless, when the consequences of a miscommunication are made explicit, listeners tend to recruit additional cognitive processing effort. Experiencing a speaker-extrinsic error on a previous trial may have caused participants to recruit more processing resources because it was more salient (Exp. 1, Exp. 2), but this effect changed when the speaker had a higher proclivity to produce a speaker-extrinsic error and a penalty excessively interfered with language comprehension (Exp. 2). This was also the case when interference was experienced by listeners.</p><p>repair, future studies should also evaluate cognitive and decision-making metrics in a similar paradigm when requests for repair are permissible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We found that listeners are sensitive to the reasons a miscommunication occurs when this miscommunication is made salient. How listeners are affected by the miscommunication seems to shape how they engage their interlocutors immediately after (e.g., disengaging when not understanding). The current results contribute to our understanding of miscommunication by providing further evidence that the salience of miscommunication promotes behavioral change that functionally triggers a process that forces a listener to re-engage processing effort (one bit model; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brennan, Galati, &amp; Kuhlen, 2010)</ref>. This may re-engage processing effort in contexts in which automaticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 1999)</ref> and heuristics <ref type="bibr">(Chaiken, Liberman, &amp; Eagly, 1991)</ref> are typically relied on to process the world. These findings take an initial step towards illuminating how miscommunication impacts cognition, revealing important implications for the impact of miscommunication on understanding.

The variables fs_dwell, x-flips, maximum deviation, and previous error type were set as random slopes and participant and trial were set as random intercepts. This random effect structure was determined by using backwards removal of random slopes to reach model convergence (per Barr et al., 2013) (marginal R2 = .05, conditional R2 = .50). No Error (NE) trials were dropped from the model to reduce the degrees of freedom and because we were only interested in how decisionmaking metrics differed between the two error types (SEE, SIE).

A reduction in language processing effort after SIE trials may be attributed to the listener increasingly refusing to reciprocally engage with the speaker (theory of reciprocity; McCroskey &amp; Richmond, 2000), thereby reducing their own language processing effort (principle of least effort; Zipf, 1949). With respect to the observed increase in language processing effort after SEEs, there are two potential explanations: (1) intermixing SEEs with SIEs may have differentially engaged attention (e.g., one-bit model; Brennan, Galati, &amp; Kuhlen, 2010; visual salience hypothesis; Treisman &amp; Gelade, 1980); (2) listeners were naturally cooperative (i.e., cooperative principle: making a contribution as required by context;</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This suggests that the effect of miscommunication on subsequent conversation is affected not only by the type of miscommunication but also by how salient the miscommunication is made to be by the context. These results are consistent with findings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bjørndahl, Fusaroli, Østergaard, and Tylén's (2015)</ref> study suggesting that making a miscommunication explicit is important for conversational adaptation. This is likely because the cue that makes the miscommunication salient One potential limitation of this study is lack of ecological validity. We did not explicitly ask if participants felt that the task approximated real life miscommunication; however, we did ask if participants tried to take the perspective of the pseudo-confederate, which some of the participants reported doing (~ 44%). Therefore, real-world miscommunication may not exert the same impact on language comprehension that we show in this task (e.g., face-to-face misunderstandings are more serious than computer-mediated miscommunications; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Edwards, Bybee, Frost, Harvey, &amp; Navarro, 2017)</ref>. Future studies are planned to evaluate this effect in naturalistic contexts and should help add important findings to our understanding of miscommunication. A second possible limitation is related to the sample size in Experiment 1, which could have limited the generalizability of the mouse tracking results. However, the mousetracking measures (maximum deviation and x-flips) were reliable predictors of processing effort in Experiment 2. This study also does not evaluate long-term effects of miscommunications on higher-level cognitive behaviors (e.g., learning); thus, future studies should address this.</p><p>Additionally, we did not permit listeners to repair the miscommunication (e.g., asking for clarification).
