			<abstract>
				<p>Sequential sampling based mathematical models of decision-making involve evidence accumulation over time during decision formation and have been successful in capturing choice behaviour. A popular model is the drift-diffusion model (DDM). To capture finer aspects of choice behaviour, such as differences in choice reaction times, time-variant gain features that imitate urgency signals have been implemented in standard DDM. In particular, a previous DDM with a time-variant gain can replicate slower error decisions than correct decisions. However, the time-variant gain of the model, and other similar time-variant gain-based models, often implement time-variant gain on both signal and noise features, with the assumption that increasing gain on the drift rate (due to urgency) is similar to DDM with collapsing decision bounds. Hence, it is unclear whether the gain effects on just the signal or noise feature can lead to different choice behaviour. Here, using computational simulations, we used a previous time-variant gain DDM and systemically showed that time-variant gain only on the DDM&apos;s noise suffices to produce slower error choices while time-variant gain only on the drift rate speeds up error choices. In addition, the former was associated with more skewness and kurtosis on correct RT distributions while the latter led to more skewness and kurtosis in error RT distributions. Thus, time-variant gain in DDM&apos;s different components can lead to different choice outcomes, which can potentially be used for more systematic data fitting.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Choice accuracy and response times, especially in perceptual decision-making, have often been mathematically modelled by the drift-diffusion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>. There is neural evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Roitman &amp; Shadlen, 2002)</ref> and underlying computational principles (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bogacz et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gold and Shadlen (2007)</ref>) that support this type of noisy temporal accumulation of evidence over time during decision formation.</p><p>In reaction time (RT) tasks, in which participants report their choices freely, a drift-diffusion model (DDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref> is commonly used to account for the observed choice accuracy (psychometrics) and reaction/response times (chronometrics). The standard DDM can be described by a stochastic differential equation (Wiener process) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ratcliff 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref> = + √</p><p>where denotes some internal decision variable, is some drift rate (velocity), is a random variable that follows a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one, is the noise size (standard deviation), and is time with time step . External stimulus or signal is encoded in the drift rate , while noise ( ) can be noise due to external stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>, noise within the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Faisal et al., 2008)</ref>, or both <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>It should be noted in Equation (1) the additive influence of signal and noise on the integrative process. During decision formation in a two-choice task, the decision variable has to be integrated over time in Equation (1) such that it reaches either a prescribed upper or lower decision bound or threshold, symbolising one of the two choices being made (assuming that the initial decision variable lies between these two bounds or thresholds). It is immediately clear that error choices in the model arise purely from the noise term. Moreover, the simplicity of the model is conducive to elegant closed-form analytical solution derivations or approximations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ratcliff (1978)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broderick et al. (2009)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Murphy et al. (2016)</ref>).</p><p>Averaging across trials, the standard DDM is known to produce equal mean correct and error</p><p>RTs for the same signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. for the same task difficulty) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ratcliff, 1978)</ref>. Longtailed RT distributions are also typical. Hence, the standard DDM cannot account for experimental data with slower or faster error decisions or shorter tail RT distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>. These could potentially be caused by some sense of urgency, i.e. urge to make a choice (e.g. forced to report a choice in the presence of a set time deadline) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harris &amp; Hutcherson, 2022)</ref>. Thus, additional features are required to be incorporated into the basic DDM, leading to various DDM variants. Interestingly, such an accelerating process towards decision bounds is intrinsically endowed in neural network models of decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Usher 4 &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wong &amp; Wang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wong et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Roxin &amp; Ledberg, 2008</ref>).</p><p>An approach to account for faster error decisions than correct decisions is to vary the starting point of the DDM across trials <ref type="bibr">(Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998)</ref>, akin to some prior initial bias. To enable slower error decisions than correct decisions, one route is to have the DDM's drift rate vary randomly across trials such that the overall error decision times are slower than that of correct decisions <ref type="bibr">(Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998)</ref>. Alternatively, by decreasing the DDM's decision bound or threshold over time (collapsing bound or threshold) within a trial, slower error decisions than correct decisions, and shorter tail RT distributions can be produced -this mimics a form of urgency signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ditterich, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Drugowitsch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hawkins et al., 2015)</ref>. Similarly, another intuitively equivalent approach is to increase the drift rate over time via a time-variant gain modulation mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ditterich, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhou et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Standage et al., 2011)</ref>. In such models, the variance grows faster than the drift rate such that later choices are more inaccurate. Mathematically, the urgency signal can be implemented either as a time-variant multiplicative factor on the signal and noise (e.g. Ditterich 2006), or as an additive time-variant input signal (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Murphy et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kelly et al., 2021)</ref>. However, time-variant gain modulation is commonly implemented on both the drift rate and noise term of a DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ditterich, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, it is unclear what the behavioural consequences would be, if time-variant gain exclusively affects the DDM's drift rate or noise.</p><p>Here, we shall demonstrate, using computational simulations, that time-variant gain only on the noise term of a DDM suffices to produce slower error choices while time-variant gain only on the drift rate speeds up error choices. These results may have implications on fitting DDM to decision-making data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model description</head><p>The parameter values of the 1-dimensional DDM used were directly based on a model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ditterich (2006)</ref>, which readily accounted for the behaviour and (selected time sections of the) neuronal activity time course of non-human primates in a classic two-alternative, forced-choice RT task <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Roitman &amp; Shadlen, 2002)</ref>. The experimental stimulus for visual motion discrimination used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Roitman and Shadlen (2002)</ref> was the standard random-dot kinematogram in which task difficulty was controlled by the motion strength (coherence) (percentage of dots moving in the same direction in the presence of a background of randomly moving dots). In particular, we only focused on Model 4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ditterich (2006)</ref>, in which the decision bounds or thresholds are constant and time-variant gain modulation was multiplied by both the drift rate and noise term of the DDM.</p><p>In the presence of an urgency signal, ( ), the model is modified such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= / !"!#!$% ( )0 + √ ( ( ) !"!#!$% )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where !"!#!$% = and is the motion strength (coherence) ( = 1 for fully coherent motion) while is some proportional constant.

If this dependency is removed, the model could still readily fit the experimental data, albeit not as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ditterich, 2006)</ref>.

The upper threshold for a correct choice (for positive drift rates) is when reaches some decision threshold, = 1, while the lower threshold for an error choice (for positive drift rates) is when reaches − = −1. Once a threshold is reached, the integration process is ceased, and the time duration from stimulus onset is defined as the decision time, tdecision.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6</head><p>With this model, we explored the following four cases: (i) time-variant gain on both drift rate and noise term with noise depending on (to act as the control condition); (ii) time-variant gain on both drift rate and noise term with noise independent of ; (iii) time-variant gain only on noise term (independent of ); and (iv) time-variant gain only on drift rate (with noise term independent of ). Model parameters remained the same for these four cases. For fair comparisons in behavioural outcomes across the cases, in Case (iii) we set the constant drift rate at the mean values of that in Case (ii) (i.e. the mean of the function in Equation <ref type="formula">3)</ref>, and similarly, the noise term in Case (iv) was set at its mean values of that in Case (ii).</p></div>

Smaller time steps were checked (e.g. 0.5 ms) without affecting the results. For each case and signal-to-noise (i.e. motion strength) ratio, 1 million trials were simulated. The Mersenne Twister uniform pseudorandom number generator <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Matsumoto &amp; Nishimura, 1998)</ref> was used to generate the noise, with the trial number serving as its seed in each trial.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We first replicated a time-variant gain DDM (Model 4) as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ditterich (2006)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Case (i)</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1a</ref> shows the trend of the RTs (see Methods) across different motion strengths (coherences). It could be observed that the trial-averaged error choices were slower than that of the correct choices for the same motion strength. At motion strength 0%, i.e. the stimulus was ambiguous (e.g. consisted of completely random dot movements), the RTs were expected to be the same for both error and correct choices). With higher motion strength, the error RTs became gradually faster. Correspondingly, choice accuracy was monotonically increasing (Weibull function 1 − 0.5 -&gt; # $ ? % with scale parameter = 6.76 and shape parameter = 1.22) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.   1b</ref>). Note that at high motion strengths, the error RTs could be too noisy due to low numbers of error trials, or had no error trials at all, and these were not shown (see Methods). When we remove the factor 41 + | | from the noise term (Equation (4)) (Case (ii)), the same RT trend could be observed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1c</ref>). The only difference was that error trials occurred slightly less often ( = 6.42, = 1.28) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figs. 1c and 1d</ref>). Thus, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ditterich (2006)</ref>, this factor was implemented to fine-tune the model parameters to the observed data.</p><p>Next, when we implemented time-variant gain only on the noise term of the DDM (Case (iii)), error choices remained slower than correct choices for the same motion strengths. There were also more error choices in higher motion strengths ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1(e)</ref>), which was confirmed in the less steep choice-accuracy curve (psychometrics) ( = 7.45 , = 1.14 ) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1(f)</ref>). A side observation was that the error RTs were slightly increasing with motion strength. This is reminiscent, albeit not as extreme, of the behaviour of attractor neural network models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wong &amp; Wang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Roxin &amp; Ledberg, 2008)</ref>, which have acceleration in the ramping up of neural activities over time. On the contrary, when we implemented time-variant gain only on the drift rate of the DDM (Case (iv)), we observed the opposite trend -error choices were faster than correct choices for the same motion strengths <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1(g)</ref>). There were also fewer error trials as compared to the other cases ( = 4.08, = 1.05) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1(h)</ref>). Thus, time-variant gain only on drift rate enhances the signal at later times, leading to more correct but slower decisions, while time-variant gain only on noise term (with or without dependency on signal/stimulus ) leads to opposite model behaviour.</p><p>After demonstrating the effects on average RTs, we next investigated the effects of the different time-variant gain cases on the RT distributions. Here, we presented only for motion strengths of 3.2% and 12.8% to demonstrate for the relatively difficult and easy tasks, respectively, with sufficient number of trials to generate smooth RT distributions. Moreover, the RT distributions for these motion strengths were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ditterich (2006)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 2(a-d)</ref> showed the correct and error RTs as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ditterich (2006)</ref> (Model 4) (Case (i)). The skewness of correct and error reaction time distributions with 3.2% motion strength (difficult task) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figs. 2(a)</ref> and (b)) were 0.546 and 0.415, while that with 12.8% motion strength (easier task) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figs. 2(c)</ref> and (d)) were 0.854 and 0.362, respectively. Thus, for the same motion strength of 12.8%, correct RT distributions had longer tails than error RTs. Further, the kurtosis values for Figs.</p><p>2(a-d) were 0.047, -0.085, 0.718 and -0.064, respectively, consistent with the skewness results.</p><p>As expected, removing the dependency of on the noise term (Case (ii)) did not affect the distributions of correct and error RTs much <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figs. 2(e-h)</ref>  With time-variant gain only on the noise term (Case (iii)) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figs. 2(i-l)</ref>), the correct RT distribution for 12.8% motion coherence was more right-skewed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2(k)</ref>) with skewness of 1.093. In comparison, the other results for Case (iii), shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 2(i)</ref>, (j), and (l), had relatively less skewness with values of 0.812, -0.076 and 0.334, respectively. Interestingly, the skewness for correct RT distribution with 3.2% motion strength was now higher than in Case (i) and Case (ii), suggesting more late correct responses had occurred. The kurtosis values for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 2(i-l)</ref> were similar to those in Case (i) and (ii), with 0.081, -0.026, 1.263 and 0.127, respectively. For Case (iv), with time-variant gain only on the drift rate, the correct RT distribution for 3.2% motion strength had longer tail <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figs. 2(m)</ref>), with skewness of 0.816. In contrast, for 12.8% motion strength, the correct RT distribution was much less skewed than in Cases (i)-(iii), with a value of 0.471. An interesting observation was that the error RT distributions had much higher skewness (and kurtosis) values; 1.467 (2.680) and 0.831 (0.660) for 3.2% and 12.8% motion strengths, respectively. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides a summary of the skewness and kurtosis values for the RT distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>. Taken together, with time-variant gain only on noise (Case (iii)), the DDM had more 10 skewed correct responses despite having more and slower error choices. This should be compared with Case (iv) where time-variant gain was only applied to the drift rate, leading to higher skewness (and kurtosis) for error RT distributions despite faster errors. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> Skewness and kurtosis of the distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>. Order as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2.   correct, 3.2% error, 3.2% correct, 12.8% error, 12</ref> Finally, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kruskal &amp; Wallis, 1952)</ref> and pairwise comparisons with Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Tukey, 1949)</ref> to check for significant differences between any pair of RT distributions from any two different cases. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used because the distribution types of the RTs were assumed to be unknown. This resulted in a total of 120 possible pair comparisons. Our results found most pairs of correct and error RTs to be significantly different (p&lt;0.001). The only two exceptions were: correct RT distribution in Case (iv) with 3.2% motion strength versus error RT distribution in Case (i) with 3.2% motion strength; and between error RT distributions with 3.2% and 12.8% motion strengths in Case (ii). However, these exceptions were fine as they were either compared between two motion strengths or between correct and error RTs. Thus, comparisons across any two different cases showed statistically significant differences in the corresponding RT distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this work, we have shown that time-variant gain only on the noise term of a DDM leads to slower error decisions than correct decisions, albeit with more errors, while time-variant gain only on the drift rate of a DDM generates faster errors <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref>. These two different time-variant gain implementations also led to different effects on skewness and kurtosis of correct and error RT distributions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 2)</ref>. In particular, time-variant gain only on drift rate caused more skewness and kurtosis in error RT distributions while time-variant gain only on noise caused more skewness and kurtosis on correct RT distributions <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>To provide intuition on these observations, we can consider time-variant gain on the DDM's noise term as increasing noise over time (within a trial), causing a signal-independent urgency to force a choice. Thus, decisions made at a later time (within a trial) are going to consist of more errors than correct ones, hence slower decisions. This is akin to collapsing decision bound models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ditterich 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Drugowitsch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hawkins et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, time-variant gain on the drift signal effectively increases the signal (motion) strength over time, leading to improved accurate choices at later times, as compared to error choices with the same stimulus or signal. One may consider time-variant gain only on drift rate as a form of temporal enhancement of sensory signals, e.g. via attentional or arousal mechanisms (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Niyogi &amp; Wong-Lin, 2013</ref>). However, one cannot consider time-variant thresholds DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ditterich 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Drugowitsch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hawkins et al., 2015)</ref> to be equivalent or similar to DDM with time-variant gain purely on drift rate, despite their intuitive similarity. This is due to the choice biases (towards correct decisions) already inbuilt within the drift rate. A summary of these two different effects of time-variant gain on drift rate and noise is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>. Increasing only noise level over time causes errors at a later time to be more likely -slower error choices than correct choices.</p><p>Cognitive computational models other than time-variant gain DDM have also been proposed to account for the observed differences in correct and error behaviour, particularly DDM models with trial-to-trial variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Ratcliff and Rouder (1998)</ref> have shown that trial-to-trial variability in the drift rate can lead to longer error RTs. In fact, models without temporal integration but with urgency signal were also found to behave similarly <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ditterich, 2006)</ref>. Interestingly, in our work, we showed that within-trial urgency signal only on the drift rate showed the opposite effect -faster error RTs. A recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nguyen and Reinagel (2022)</ref> demonstrated that trial-to-trial variability in the DDM's starting point could account for rats' data where accuracy increased with RT, while trial-to-trial variability in the DDM's drift rate could account for humans' data where accuracy declined with increasing RT.</p><p>In our work, we showed, based on non-human primate data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Roitman and Shadlen (2002)</ref>, that time-variant gain on drift rate or noise may potentially offer an alternative model for such observations. Future work would require fitting the time-variant gain DDM model to their data to confirm.</p><p>The increase in noise over time during decision formation has its basis in neuronal recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Churchland et al., 2011)</ref>. In fact, in more realistic neurocomputational network models, e.g. generated through Poisson-like spike trains, neuronal noise level was expected to increase with neuronal firing rates over time (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Furman &amp; Wang, 2008)</ref>. Along that line, previous neurally informed computational modelling studies have incorporated urgency signal as a multiplicative factor on the accumulated output of decision variables (or output neural firing rates) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ditterich, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Standage et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Niyogi &amp; Wong-Lin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yau et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, time-variant gain function was multiplied to the neural output mathematical function. Given that the neural output function is generally a (nonlinear) function of the overall input, which consists of both signal and noise contributions, it remains a challenge, from a neurobiological viewpoint, to disentangle time-variant gain on noise from that on stimulus input signal.</p><p>Overall, despite the need for more evidence on time-variant gains and urgency signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hawkins et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2022)</ref>, we have shown theoretically how time-variant gain on the drift and noise terms in a DDM can differently affect decision behaviour. These may potentially be useful for more systematic fitting of choice behavioural data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Multiplicative time-variant gain modulation can also be considered as a form of gating, attentional or arousal enhanced signal (e.g. Smith &amp; Ratcliff (2009); Cisek et al.
