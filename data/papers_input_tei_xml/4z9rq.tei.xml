			<abstract>
				<p>It has become standard practice for consumers to customize products instead of choosing off-the-shelf solutions. A new practice is that consumers can directly share and discuss their customized products with their peers via social product configurators. We examine how the type of communication affects peer decision-making and satisfaction in such configurators. Drawing on research on mass customization, electronic word of mouth, and narcissism, we propose that narcissistic communication is crucial to understanding the effect of a shared configuration. A series of three studies demonstrates that consumers scoring high (vs. low) on narcissism are more likely to share their customized product online as a sample configuration and to use I-centered communication to describe that configuration. Such narcissistic communication makes peers adjust their own customized product to the sample configuration and to evaluate their own product less favorably. These findings suggest that narcissistic communication influences consumers&apos; decision-making by increasing the likelihood to conform, potentially negatively impacting consumer satisfaction. The social power of narcissists has implications for both marketing research and practice.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Customizing products and services based on individual preferences has become common practice. Manufacturers have begun implementing social product configurators that allow consumers to easily share, discuss, and improve their customized products online on social networks (SNs). For example, consumers can configure a car and directly share and discuss the configuration with peers on Facebook. Thus far, however, little is known about the consequences of integrating elements of social interaction into mass customization systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Franke, Keinz, &amp; Schreier, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schlager, Hildebrand, Häubl, Franke, &amp; Herrmann, 2018)</ref>. Which shared configurations are most influential?</p><p>What are the behavioral consequences for peers when processing such information?</p><p>Consumers are spending ever more time online. As a result, they are increasingly flooded with information and appraisal, not only from firms but also from peers. Widely accessible online social networks (SNs) such as Instagram or Twitter have made electronic word of mouth (eWOM) proliferate in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berger, 2014)</ref>. Providing information online through eWOM enables consumers to communicate about products, services, and brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rosario, Sotgiu, De Valck, &amp; Bijmolt, 2016)</ref>. A 2015 global consumer survey found that over 80% of consumers trusted recommendations from friends and family while two-thirds relied on opinions from unknown consumers posted online <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nielsen, 2015)</ref>. The latter share is expected to grow even further due to the increasing use and integration of SNs. Whereas much is known about the consequences of eWOM and its underlying processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berger, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chevalier &amp; Mayzlin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Eisingerich, Chun, Liu, Jia, &amp; Bell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, Walsh, &amp; Gremler, 2004)</ref>, less attention has been paid to which communication types by which consumers are more influential <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Luangrath, Peck, &amp; Barger, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Packard &amp; Berger, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Exploring this issue, we propose that narcissism is key to understanding the effectiveness of eWOM.</p><p>Narcissism is a relatively prevalent personality dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Emmons, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Raskin &amp; Terry, 1988)</ref>. It denotes unjustified conceit and implies excessive motivation to self-enhance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lee, Gregg, &amp; Park, 2013)</ref>. Narcissism entered the field of consumer psychology through the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sedikides, Gregg, Cisek, and Hart (2007)</ref>, who famously argued that it is "the I that buys." While explored in depth in psychology, narcissism as a relatively prevalent consumer trait is receiving increasing attention in marketing <ref type="bibr">(de Bellis, Sprott, Hermann, Bierhoff, &amp; Rohmann, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kashmiri et al., 2017)</ref>. Although narcissists supposedly use more first-person singular ("I" and "me") than first-person plural pronouns ("we" and "us") to draw attention to themselves ), this has not been corroborated by more recent research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carey et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Holtzman et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Our research integrates insights from eWOM and narcissistic communication into the mass customization domain. A pilot study and two experimental studies examine how narcissistic communication impacts peer decision-making and satisfaction in social product configurators. We draw on and contribute to three literature streams-eWOM, mass customization, and narcissism -by demonstrating that narcissistic (vs. non-narcissistic) communication in social product configurators is more influential while decreasing consumers' satisfaction with their customized products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background and Hypotheses Electronic Word of Mouth (EWOM) and Social Product Configurators</head><p>EWOM is not only one of the most significant developments in contemporary consumer behavior <ref type="bibr">(Rosario et al., 2018)</ref> but also one of the most important sources of consumer decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Litvin, Goldsmith, &amp; Pan, 2008)</ref>. EWOM, or more specifically online reviews, can greatly impact sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chevalier &amp; Mayzlin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chintagunta, Gopinath, &amp; Venkataraman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dellorcas, Zhang, &amp; Awad, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Liu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Moore, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zhu &amp; Zhang, 2010)</ref>. The effectiveness of eWOM differs across products, metrics, and platforms (e.g., the effectiveness of eWOM in SNs is stronger if eWOM receivers can assess their own similarity with eWOM senders; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rosario et al., 2016)</ref>. Consumers exchange information with other consumers online for different reasons, including the desire for social interaction and the opportunity to enhance their own self-worth <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004)</ref>. Research has analyzed the linguistic aspects of eWOM. It has examined the influence of implicit versus explicit endorsements on purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Packard &amp; Berger, 2017)</ref> and has investigated whether expressing subjectivity in online reviews enhances persuasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Liu, Ozanne, &amp; Mattila, 2018)</ref>. Research has also examined how textual paralanguage affects SNs (e.g., emojis and vocalizations like "haha"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Luangrath et al., 2017)</ref>, as well as the effects of linguistic mimicry <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Moore &amp; McFerran, 2017)</ref>. Nevertheless, the impact of different communication styles remains unclear.</p><p>Our research combines eWOM with mass customization (i.e., social product configurators). Doing so is worthwhile as integrating social sharing into mass customization systems is a novel trend across industries and markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gandhi, Magar, &amp; Roberts, 2014)</ref>. For example, car manufacturers (e.g., Porsche and Land Rover) or sportswear manufacturers (e.g., Nike and Oakley) now provide consumers with webbased tools to easily share, discuss, and improve their configured products on SNs like Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter (see Appendix A). Typically, consumers configure products and can then share a commented link on their customization via their SN profile. So far, research has focused primarily on the effects of customization formats on consumer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Huffman &amp; Kahn, 1998)</ref>. Little, however, is known about the consequences of integrating elements of social interaction into mass customization systems. The few existing studies on social product configurators have examined how feedback impacts the uniqueness and creativity of product designs, the role of social distance in product modifications, and the satisfaction with self-designed products <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(D'Angelo, Diehl, &amp; Cavanaugh, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hildebrand, Häubl, Herrmann, &amp; Landwehr, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schlager et al., 2018)</ref>. However, none of these studies have investigated whether and how different communication styles in consumer feedback messages affect peer customization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Raskin and Terry (1988)</ref> derived the concept of narcissism as a subclinical personality construct and subsequently developed a validated measure: the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). Narcissists pay more attention to self-esteem than their less narcissistic peers, strive for admiration, and are characterized by agency, extraversion, and self-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bradlee &amp; Emmons, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Morf &amp; Rhodewalt, 2001</ref>). They purchase exclusive products to elevate their self-image and consider themselves special and entitled <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cisek et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sedikides et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Narcissists and Their Communication Style</head><p>The social interactions of narcissists involve their need to boast about their achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buss &amp; Chiodo, 1991)</ref> and their need for superiority, such that their agentic bias is acted out to validate these self-beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sedikides et al., 2007)</ref>. Unsurprisingly, narcissism predicts a higher level of social activity in SNs and more self-promoting content <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buffardi &amp; Campbell, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leung, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McCain &amp; Campbell, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ong et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Poon &amp; Leung, 2011)</ref>. Narcissists are highly self-focused, persistently seek attention, and often consider themselves the epicenter of their social world <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sedikides, Campbell, Reeder, Elliot, &amp; Gregg, 2002)</ref>. They communicate to convey "heroic I" messages; this self-centered "configuration of selfhood" means that individuals strive to be the heroes of their own stories <ref type="bibr">(Goodman, Dueck, &amp; Langdal, 2010, p. 667)</ref>.</p><p>The prevailing opinion is that narcissistic communication is I-centered as narcissists tend to use more first-person singular (vs. plural) pronouns compared to nonnarcissists <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chatterjee &amp; Hambrick, 2007;</ref>. However, this relationship has been examined with contradictory results. Some studies have not found a significant correlation between I-centered communication and narcissism <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carey et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">DeWall, Buffardi, Bonser, &amp; Campbell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fast &amp; Funder, 2010)</ref>. More recently, a positive relationship has only been demonstrated between narcissism and the use of words related to second-person pronouns, sports, and swearing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Holtzman et al., 2019)</ref>. It remains unclear how narcissists communicate with respect to perspectivetaking, especially in specific settings such as social product configurators, where uniqueness perceptions are likely more important .</p><p>We propose that narcissistic consumers employ self-promoting interaction patterns within social communities associated with mass customization systems. When narcissistic consumers share their customized products with SN peers, their underlying motivation is to highlight their greatness <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Goodman et al., 2010)</ref>. They are hence likely to use more first-person singular pronouns rather than neutral, product-focused communication . H1: The greater consumers' narcissistic tendencies, the greater their use of Icentered (vs. product-centered) communication in social product configurators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Narcissistic Communication on Peers</head><p>How does narcissistic (i.e., I-centered) communication affect others in a mass customization context? Narcissists are often opinion leaders within their communities and motivated to share information about their own decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baumgarten, 1975)</ref>. Hence, we predict that when product information is communicated narcissistically, it affects peer product customization. We expect this type of message to inform peers that the product designer identifies with the customized product. Its use of "I" makes such communication seem more authentic and competent, and thus more influential <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brunell et al., 2008)</ref>. Prior research has suggested that combining firstperson pronouns and personal information evokes authenticity and enhances confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Schindler &amp; Bickart, 2012)</ref>. Further, consumers might believe narcissistic leaders are more competent and effective, based on their exhibited confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brunell et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, when consumers have the opportunity to repeat their configuration, we suspect that they are more heavily influenced by a narcissist's sample configuration (relative to a non-narcissist's), resulting in an adjusted original configuration.</p><p>H2: Consumers adjust their own customized product to their peers' sample configuration if its presentation is I-centered (vs. product-centered).</p><p>Peer input on evaluating preliminary design solutions can have positive effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Franke, Keinz, &amp; Schreier, 2008)</ref>. However, evidence also exists that social comparisons and deviating from initial preferences due to social feedback can have negative effects by devaluing self-designed products <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dahl, Argo, &amp; Morales, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hildebrand et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Moreau &amp; Herd, 2010)</ref>. Consumers evaluate their self-designed product lower if the sample is presented by a close (vs. distant) social other (D'Angelo et al., 2019). Thus, while consumers likely adjust their customized product more to a narcissist's sample configuration (per H2), we expect them to be less satisfied with their own customized product because they perceive narcissists' sample configurations as more competently customized <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brunell et al., 2008)</ref>. This might raise more doubts about one's own customized product and lead to less favorable evaluations. Negative reactions may also occur if someone's customized product is imitated <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(White &amp; Argo, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>H3: Consumers perceive their own customized products less favorably after seeing an I-centered (vs. product-centered) sample configuration.</p><p>Below, we report a set of three studies that were conducted to test H1-H3. As narcissism is linked to pride and self-enhancement, we accounted for the level of appraisal of the sample configuration by manipulating it. We conducted the studies in the automotive industry due to its advanced integration of social elements into mass customization systems (see configurator-database.com; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schlager et al., 2018)</ref>. All studies were carried out in accordance with ethical standards for psychological research (e.g., voluntary participation, informed consent, and confidential treatment of information). To improve the external validity of our results, we studied varying and market-relevant populations (i.e., recent car buyers, potential car buyers, and MBA students). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarizes the methods and results. 06, SE = .03, t = 2.07, p = .04). This result was confirmed when using a relative measure designed to put into perspective the use of the first-person singular and first-person plural (b = .08, SE = .03, t = 2.38, p = .02). The findings of our pilot study suggest that narcissists can be described as opinion leaders who heavily use first-person singular pronouns when communicating via SNs , providing initial support for H1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>Study 1 examined how narcissists' messages impact peer product customization.</p><p>As predicted in H2, we expect consumers (irrespective of their narcissism scores) to adjust their customized product to a sample configuration if this is communicated narcissistically (I-centered) vs. non-narcissistically (product-centered). Using a mass customization context allowed us to precisely measure deviations from initial consumption choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pretest</head><p>We conducted an extensive pretest to operationalize narcissistic (I-centered)</p><p>communication (see Appendix C). The pretest further served to replicate and extend the correlational results of the pilot study in a more controlled setting. The results showed that narcissists (vs. non-narcissists) are more likely to share information about products configured within a mass customization system. Importantly, narcissists tended to differentially structure their interactional patterns regarding a customized product by using more I-centered (vs. product-centered) messages. The pretest thus provides more direct support for H1. Interestingly, we found that narcissism does not predict choosing appraising versus non-appraising messages, suggesting that the effect of I-centered versus product-centered messages is considerably stronger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We employed a 2 (perspective: I-centered vs. product-centered) × 2 (appraisal: appraising vs. non-appraising) between-subjects design. The sample included 146 panel members from a commercial research company (45% female; Mage = 42; Mnarcissism = 5.52) who were prescreened for their intention to purchase or lease a car.</p><p>Having completed the NPI-15, participants configured a car with a mock-up configurator (see Appendix D1). Next, they were randomly assigned to a sample configuration along with an experimentally manipulated SN message (NI, appraising = 39, NI, non-appraising = 34, Nproduct, appraising = 35, Nproduct, non-appraising = 38). We created four variant messages. These differed in terms of perspective (I-centered vs. product-centered), appraisal, and whether the chosen attribute options were made explicit (to keep message length constant; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). We also created four sample configurations, to be used with one of the four messages. Each configuration randomly combined six product options to minimize confounding factors resulting from preferring certain options (see Appendix D2). Finally, participants configured their car a second time, before completing a four-item car expertise scale (adapted from <ref type="bibr">Hildebrand et al., 2014)</ref> and</p><p>demographics.</p><p>The dependent variable was whether participants selected the same product options during the second product customization as selected in the sample configuration.</p><p>As the same option was more likely to be chosen if few options were available (e.g., only three options for the sound system), each adjustment was weighted by the number of options for a particular attribute. Thus, we calculated an adjustment index:</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1), 6 1 i i i AI SC O = = </formula><p>where i represents the six product attributes, where SC represents whether participants choose the same (1) or not the same product option (0) as the sample configuration, and where O refers to the number of product options for the i th attribute. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Productcentered</head><p>"This Audi A6 has just been configured. The best options were chosen for the six attributes while care was taken that they fit well together."</p><p>"This Audi A6 has just been configured. Specific options have been chosen for the six attributes exterior color, rims, seat upholstery, interior décor, steering wheel, and sound system."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Consumers receiving an I-centered message were significantly more likely to adjust their customized product to a sample configuration. A two-way ANOVA with perspective and appraisal as factors and the adjustment index as dependent variable showed a significant effect for perspective (F(1, 142) = 4.25, p = .04), yet none for appraisal (F(1, 142) = 1.66, p = .20) nor for factor interaction (F(1, 142) = .09, p = .77;</p><p>MI, appraising = 4.44, MI, non-appraising = 3.18, Mproduct, appraising = 2.29, Mproduct, non-appraising = .29).</p><p>As expected, no significant effect was found between the adjustment index and customization 1 (index range: 0 to 27), as the sample configuration was shown after customization 1. Overall, H2 was supported.</p><p>We conducted two additional analyses. First, instead of analyzing consumers' adjustment toward the sample configuration using the adjustment index, we examined whether consumers changed their second customization compared to their first one. A two-way ANOVA (using the above factors) showed a marginally significant effect for perspective (F(1, 142) = 3.48, p = .06 ), yet no significant effects for appraisal (F(1, 142) = 0.51, p = .48) nor for their interaction (F(1, 142) = 0.97, p = .33), thus further supporting H2. Second, we considered narcissism scores. A two-way ANOVA with perspective and narcissism as factors and the adjustment index as dependent variable showed a significant effect of perspective (F(1, 142) = 4.22, p = .04), yet none for narcissism (F(1, 142) = 0.32, p = .57) nor for their interaction (F(1, 142) = 0.11, p = .74), demonstrating that narcissists were also influenced by I-centered messages.</p><p>Study 1 demonstrated that narcissists' social interaction patterns lead peers to adjust a configured product to that of narcissists. In light of research showing that narcissistic consumers configure more unique products <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(de Bellis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lee et al., 2013)</ref>, they may also sway others to configure such products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>Study 2 explored whether consumers are satisfied with their customized product after being presented with a narcissistic (vs. non-narcissistic) sample configuration. We focused on how consumers respond to a narcissistic versus non-narcissistic message and did not collect narcissism from this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We employed a 2 (perspective: I-centered vs. product-centered) × 2 (appraisal: appraising vs. non-appraising) between-subjects design. The sample included 169 MBA students who participated in a paper-and-pencil study. We excluded ten participants who had not read the manipulation message, resulting in a final sample size of 159 participants (23% female; mode age within age bracket 30-39).</p><p>Participants used a car configurator to configure their car of choice and subsequently evaluated their customized product. Similar to Study 1, they were shown one of four fully configured cars. Along with this sample configuration, participants</p><p>were randomly assigned to one of four experimentally manipulated messages (NI, appraising = 46, NI, non-appraising = 41, Nproduct, appraising = 34, Nproduct, non-appraising = 38) supposedly posted on Facebook. Before providing demographics, participants reevaluated their customized product by responding to several variables (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>As expected, the two conditions did not differ in terms of initial choice satisfaction (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). However, both this and further variables systematically varied by treatment after participants read the experimental message. A two-way ANOVA with perspective and appraisal as factors and choice satisfaction as dependent variable exhibited a significant effect for both perspective (F(1, 155) = 6.05, p = .02) and appraisal (F(1, 155) = 4.16, p = .04), yet no significant interaction (F(1, 155) = .83, p = .36). Regarding pride of authorship, we found a significant effect for perspective (F(1, 155) = 6.90, p &lt; .01) and appraisal (F(1, 155) = 7.69, p &lt; .01), yet no significant interaction (F(1, 155) = .58, p = .45). Regarding willingness to reconfigure, we found a significant effect for perspective (F(1, 155) = 24.21, p &lt; .001), a marginally significant effect for appraisal (F(1, 155) = 2.94, p = .09), and no significant interaction <ref type="figure">(F(1, 155)</ref> = .17, p = .68). Regarding fit of configured items, we found a significant effect for perspective (F(1, 155) = 8.50, p &lt; .01), yet none for appraisal (F(1, 155) = 2.35, p = .13) nor their interaction (F(1, 155) = 1.35, p = .25). Thus, consumers reading the I-centered (vs. product-centered) message exhibited decreased choice satisfaction, decreased pride of authorship, decreased fit of the configured options, and increased willingness to reconfigure their car (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Our pilot study and two experiments highlight the social power First, we contribute to the growing research stream on mass customization and especially social product configurators <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arora et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">de Bellis, Hildebrand, Ito, &amp; Herrmann, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schlager et al., 2018)</ref>. shown that negative eWOM is more influential than positive eWOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hewett, Rand, Rust, &amp; Van Heerde, 2016)</ref>. We extend these findings by showing that even positive eWOM may have negative consequences. Future research could more closely examine why narcissistic communication is more influential and what the underlying role of perceived competency is <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brunell et al., 2008)</ref>. The principle of social proof might also explain the greater influence of I-centered (vs. product-centered) communication. This principle implies that "we view a behavior as correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it" <ref type="bibr">(Cialdini, 2009, p. 99)</ref>. Consumers may adjust their customized product to the sample configuration to avoid mistakes, to reduce uncertainty, and to accord with social evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cialdini, 2009)</ref>. Our research also expands existing research on the detrimental effect of community feedback on consumer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Moreau &amp; Herd, 2010)</ref>. Whereas previous research has found that general feedback leads to less unique product designs and reduced satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hildebrand et al., 2013)</ref>, we show that feedback from narcissists negatively impacts consumers' satisfaction rates with their customized product.</p><p>Third, we contribute to the growing stream on narcissism in SNs and provide intriguing avenues for future research. Our research shows that narcissism manifests not only in physical appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Vazire, Naumann, Rentfrow, &amp; Gosling, 2008)</ref>  did not predict the choice of appraising versus non-appraising messages. This might be explained by the fact that narcissists' attention is primarily guided by I-centered pronouns, meaning they little heed other differences in the constructed messages or that narcissism is not a predictor of appraising messages. Future research could verify this assumption using eye tracking technology to show heatmaps of attention in the constructed messages (i.e., if consumers focus on the "I").</p><p>Also worth studying is that consumers might not identify I-centered communication as messages from narcissists, and that not all I-centered communication comes from narcissists. It would be intriguing to examine whether consumers also adjust their customized product to a sample configuration if stemming from an obviously narcissistic person. In this case, we expect consumers to configure their product very differently than the narcissistic sample configuration because they do not wish to appear narcissistic. Future research could also examine how narcissists can be identified in an eWOM context other than by I-centered communication. Other factors typical of narcissistic communication in SNs likely exist (e.g., the use of more exclamation marks; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Holtzman et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, our research has potential implications for the nascent field of influencer marketing. This has emerged as one of the fastest-growing advertising segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Linqia, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lou &amp; Yuan, 2019)</ref>. Our findings raise two key questions: How narcissistic are influencers? And are influencers largely equal to narcissists? Whereas current research</p><p>is unable to answer these questions, our findings suggest that marketers should find ways of identifying narcissists and be aware of their power to influence peers. We advise marketers to consider the potential negative effects of narcissism in the field of influencer marketing and to find the sweet spot between providing ideas and feedback Narcissism measure. The primary independent variable for the pilot study and the experimental studies was a validated measure of narcissism. We assessed narcissism using the NPI-15 . For the scale, participants were given 15 pairs of phrases; one phrase represented a narcissistic response (e.g., "I am going to be a great person"), the other a non-narcissistic response (e.g., "I hope I am going to be successful"). For each pair, participants were asked to select the response closest to their beliefs. The number of narcissistic responses was summed to form a narcissism score ranging from 0 (non-narcissistic) to 15 (very narcissistic).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>All our analyses treated narcissism as a continuous variable (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Foster and Campbell 2007)</ref>. Narcissists tended to use SNs more frequently, as indicated by a positive and significant relationship between narcissism and daily frequency of SN use (b = .51, SE = .18, t = 2.78, p &lt; .01). However, narcissism did not predict the time spent daily on SNs (b = .97, SE = 1.42, t = .69, p = .50). Requesting car buyers to state their SN use in the past 30 days revealed that narcissism was positively and significantly related to the number of replies to their own posts (b = 3.08, SE = 1.02, t = 3.00, p &lt; .01), highlighting their (perceived) role as influencers and opinion leaders. At the same time, we found non-significant or marginally significant relationships between narcissism and the number of posts written (b = .57, SE = .34, t = 1.67, p = .10), the number of replies to other posts (b = .69, SE = 54, t = 1.28, p = .20), and the number of pictures uploaded (b = .86, SE = .47, t = 1.84, p = .07).</p><p>Regarding their car purchase, narcissism was positively and significantly related to both the number of friends (b = .22, SE = .08, t = 2.81, p &lt; .01) and the number of experts consulted before vehicle choice (b = .06, SE = .03, t = 2.10, p = .04). However, narcissism was not associated with a self-reported measure of how intensively participants consulted friends (b = −.04, SE = .07, t = −.50, p = .62) and experts (b = .02, SE = .08, t = .21, p = .83). Importantly, when asked to write a post for their preferred SN, consumers' narcissistic tendencies predicted their use of the first-person singular (b = .06, SE = .03, t = 2.07, p = .04). This result was confirmed when using a relative measure that put using the first-person singular and plural into perspective (b = .08, SE = .03, t = 2.38, p = .02). Finally, and as expected, we also found that narcissism was associated with a subjective measure of being an opinion leader (b = .18, SE = .05, t = 3.86, p &lt; 0.001).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We recruited 164 MBA students for a paper-and-pencil study. We excluded five participants due to incomplete data, resulting in a final sample size of 159 participants (45% female; mode age within age bracket 30-39; Mnarcissism = 5.56).</p><p>Participants first completed the NPI-15 measure of narcissism. Individual narcissism scores served as a focal independent variable. Next, participants configured a car of choice by using a mock-up car configurator (see Appendix D1). Third, they</p><p>were asked whether and with whom they would share their customized product (first dependent variable) and, if so, to choose one of four messages accompanying the customized product (second dependent variable; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> in the main paper). These messages varied not only in terms of perspective (I-centered vs. product-centered) but also in terms of appraisal and whether the chosen attribute options were made explicit (to keep message length constant). This variation allowed us to examine whether the proposed effect of perspective holds for both appraising and non-appraising messages.</p><p>A one-item car expertise measure and demographic measurements concluded the pretest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>About half of the participating consumers (53%) agreed to present their customized product in a SN. Logit regression showed that willingness to present one's customized product depended on narcissism: Narcissistic consumers were more likely to make their customized product public than non-narcissistic ones (b = .26, SE = .06, z = 4.33, p &lt; 0.001). Categorizing consumers into narcissists (score ≥ 9) and nonnarcissists (score &lt; 9) highlighted the magnitude of this effect: Whereas 84.8% of narcissists agreed to present their customized product, only 45.2% of non-narcissists did so. In terms of messages, across all consumers, the four messages were chosen similarly often (I-centered, appraising: 22.35%; I-centered, non-appraising: 21.18%; productcentered, appraising: 29.41%; product-centered, non-appraising: 27.06%). Analyzing this choice pattern based on narcissism revealed systematic differences: Narcissism significantly predicts one's choice of I-centered (vs. product-centered) messages (b = .37, SE = .10, z = −3.81, p &lt; 0.001), a result that was robust when controlling for consumers' car expertise (b = .33, SE = .14, z = −2.45, p = .01). We found converging evidence for the effect of narcissism on perspective when considering only the two appraising messages (b = .41, SE = .14, z = −2.87, p = .004) and the two non-appraising messages (b = .33, SE = .13, z = −2.51, p = .01). These results indicate that narcissists' communication style differs from that of non-narcissists in terms of perspective, thus confirming H1. Interestingly, we found that narcissism did not predict choosing appraising versus non-appraising messages (b = .05, SE = .07, z = .62, p = .54),</p><p>suggesting that the effect of I-centered versus product-centered messages was considerably stronger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study's findings support the basic proposition that narcissism influences how consumers interact in a social environment. As such, this pretest replicates and extends the correlational results of the pilot study in a more controlled setting by showing that narcissists are more likely to share information about products configured with an MC system. Moreover, narcissists tend to differentially structure their interactional patterns regarding a configured product by using more I-centered messages.</p><p>Overview: Four different messages Dear Audi A6 Configuring User, I would like to introduce you to an Audi A6 that I just configured.

Such narcissistic communication makes peers adjust their own customized product to the sample configuration and to evaluate their own product less favorably. Narcissistic communication seems critical to understanding the effectiveness of eWOM and to determining what cuts through the noise and influences consumers in social product configurators. These findings provide four major implications for marketing research and practitioners.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Our findings are also relevant for practitioners, as many industries have embraced the promising link between mass customization systems and SNs, while only little is known about the consequences of integrating elements of social interaction into mass customization systems. Our research illustrates the potential downsides of such integration. Narcissists can impact the mass customization buying process because they are often opinion leaders within social communities and strive to share information with peers. According to our findings, eWOM from narcissists may decrease consumer satisfaction with the customized product and result in a greater desire to reconfigure the product. The latter need not be a disadvantage for companies, which should, however, carefully integrate social sharing functions into product configurators and account for individual differences in narcissism when creating the configurators. They should also ask themselves where the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.Second, we contribute to the growing research on eWOM by showing that communication type determines message impact. We found that eWOM from narcissists is more influential, as consumers adjust their own consumption choice to a sample configuration if presented with narcissistic communication (Study 1). Prior research has</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>but also in communication characteristics (i.e., more I-centered communication). Whereas previous findings about narcissists' use of first-person pronouns (singular vs. plural) have been contradictory, we show that narcissists use more I-centered (vs. productcentered) communication in SNs and are more likely to share their customized product (pilot study and pretest). As shown, narcissistic (vs. non-narcissistic) communication (operationalized through I-centered communication) negatively influences peer satisfaction while increasing product reconfiguration willingness (Study 2). Interestingly, narcissists and non-narcissists are equally influenced by I-centered communication. Further, narcissism</figDesc></figure>
