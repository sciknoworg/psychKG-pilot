			<abstract>
				<p>We execute scoring movements by taking the uncertainty of motor outcomes into account for maximization of reward rates. 1,2 In many sports, the winning point could be determined by proximity to high gain or failure, and in such situations, the preference for high gain is evident. 3-7 However, findings were constrained when individuals planned a movement to increase the average reward over a large number of trials under the same conditions. Here, we examined the effects of the number of chances, one of the essential contexts for decision-making, on the planning of aiming points. 8-11 The results showed that when there was only one chance in a set, aiming points were more conservative than when there were more chances (5, 10, or 15). We proposed a risk-sensitive decision model that accounts for the modulation in aiming points, depending on the number of chances. Fitting the model to participants&apos; observed data showed that participants tended to be risk-averse and to underestimate their motor variability in general. The current study provides behavioral and computational evidence that number of chances is one of the variables to account for in motor variability.</p>

In a penalty kick, the kicker often aims to shoot on the left or right course, far from the goalkeeper, in which case, it is necessary to decide how close the goal post he or she will be to the goal. Aiming excessively close to the goal post increases the probability that the ball will be directed out of the goal; conversely, aiming too close to the goalkeeper increases the probability that the goalkeeper will stop the ball. For players with high motor variability, the closer they aim to the goal post, the more likely they are to miss the goal. Therefore, it is desirable for those players to have a greater margin of safety, compared to players with less variability. Thus, how close to the goal a kicker should aim for depends on the magnitude of the individual's motor variability. Previous studies have examined human behavior in deciding where to aim, emulating the situation described above. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Specifically, gain functions were set in which the closer the proximity to the reference point, the higher the gain; however, beyond the reference point, no score or loss was awarded. The theoretical optimal aiming point was estimated by integrating the gain functions, and probability of the motor outcome, determined by the average aiming point and motor variability. Consequently, bias in selecting risk-seeking behaviors (i.e., aiming more for the reference point and thus failing to maximize performance) was consistently confirmed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> However, it is unclear whether risk-seeking behavior always dominates motor decision making. Many previous studies attempted to understand the characteristics of motor decisionmaking by recording types of behaviors under the same conditions and from determining the averages of these behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> Trends in behavior with hundreds of chances could reflect only the features of a context in which many chances are given. As in the case of the penalty kick, there are moments with only one or a few plays. Indeed, it has been reported that the number of decisions affects economic decision-making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> The certainty effect, which is the psychological effect resulting from the reduction in probability from certain to probable, 34 tends to be found in a singular decision. Even if similar choices are assigned, such effects are not found in multiple decisions. If similar behavior patterns are considered in motor decision-making, a behavior with a higher safety margin could be observed when presented with fewer chances. Additionally, animal studies on decision-making have also reported the context dependency of risk sensitivity and suggested that animals modulate risk sensitivity using a reference frame dependent on their own state, such as reward (i.e., food) acquisition status. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36</ref> Here, we examined how human motor decision-making under risk depends on the number of chances, an essential context for any decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>Participants (N = 60, 21 males, age: 21.07 ± 2.52 years) were required to press the space key at an arbitrary time, after a red circle was presented at the center of the screen <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig 1a)</ref>. The score for each trial was determined by the time interval between the presentation of the red circle and the key press. Two types of gain functions were assigned to each set. In the cliff condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig 1b)</ref>, the gain (G) depending on the response time (t) was determined as follows: ( ) = 0 ( &lt; 500 1500 &lt; ), and ( ) = 100 + ( − 1500)/10 ( 500 ≤ ≤ 1500). In the cliff condition, how close to 1500 ms to aim for was the key decision in motor planning, and a shorter reaction time (RT) denoted a participant taking a conservative strategy. In the no-cliff condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig 1c)</ref>, the gain, depending on the response time, was determined as follows: ( ) = 0 ( &lt; 500 2500 &lt; ) , ( ) = 100 + ( − 1500)/10 ( 500 ≤ ≤ 1500) , and 4 ( ) = 100 + (1500 − )/10 ( 1500 ≤ ≤ 2500). The number of test trials was (C1), (C5), 10 (C10), and 15 (C15) for the cliff condition. In the no-cliff condition, both sets included 15 test trials (i.e., they did not include practice trials).</p><p>The RT was defined as the time interval between the target stimulus onset and keypress.</p><p>For each participant, the mean RT in the test trials, and in the test and practice trials, were calculated for each condition. Four participants, whose mean RT including all practice and test trials in the cliff condition was higher than ms or lower than 1000 ms, were eliminated from the following analyses because the participants did not correctly understand the requirements of the task. To evaluate how optimal the selected aiming points were (estimated as the mean RT), the maximizing expected gain (MEG) RT was estimated (detailed in the Methods section), and the distortion from the MEG RT was calculated ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RT Modulation depending on number of trials</head><p>To examine the modulation of the aim point according to the number of chances, the mean RT and distortion from MEG RT were compared across conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3)</ref> . Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between C1 versus C5 and C1 versus C15 (ps &lt;.01), a marginally significant difference between C1 and C10 (p =.063), and no significant differences between C5</p><p>and C10 (p =.743), C5 versus C15 (p =.743), and C10 and C15 (p =.482), indicating that RT tended to be shorter when there was only one chance, than in other conditions. Additionally, to confirm the tendency of the distortion from the optimal solution to maximize reward rates, onesample t-tests on mean distortion from MEG RT compared to zero, were conducted. The results showed that a significant difference was found only in C15 (p &lt;.05), indicating that the participants excessively aimed close to the cliff and thus failed to maximize their performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SL-MV model fitting for observed data</head><p>Based on the predictions of the set-level mean-variance (SL-MV) model (detailed in the Methods section), we confirmed that modulation of RT by the number of chances was consistent with the behavioral trend under the risk-averse assumption (α = -2) ( </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In past studies of motor decision-making comparing optimal and actual strategies, the characteristics of human decision-making were examined, based on behaviors under the same conditions, on the order of tens to hundreds of repetitions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> The analytical limitation would strongly constrain this experimental setting, in that a substantial number of samples of outcomes in the same situation are needed to evaluate an optimal motor plan for each participant;</p><p>individual motor variances cannot be estimated without a certain number of samples. Although it has been shown that there are several tendencies specific to motor decision-making in this setting, it should be noted that bias refers to a preference under the same condition multiple times. Hence, behaviors observed in such settings do not necessarily reflect the general characteristics of motor decision-making, but rather in situations where the same task can be challenged repeatedly.</p><p>Here, we examine the modulation of motor planning with respect to the aiming point according to the number of chances. Our data partially replicated a similar tendency observed in previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Specifically, we found that RT was longer than MEG RT (i.e., closer to the cliff of the gain function) when the number of chances was higher, indicating that the participants sought higher than optimal gain. In previous studies, a similar bias was identified even when the same task was repeated (9 days practice of 2250 trials), <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> even when the variability of the motor outcomes was presented visually, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and was independent of movement types <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In contrast, the current study found that the number of chances affected motor planning under risk. A more impulsive behavior could be evoked, since the impact of the success or failure of each trial on the overall outcome decreased with an increasing number of chances. Therefore, the tendency in motor decision making thought to be robust was shown to change simply by changing the number of chances.</p><p>To explain participants' behavior, we developed a decision model (SL-MV model) that considers risk sensitivity. Risk refers to variability of the outcomes. An alternative view to the consideration of risk in each trial (as used in previous studies 37 ) is to assess the risk in a subset of trials. When evaluating risk as the variability of the mean score across trials, risk varies greatly, depending on the target point in the set of one trial. However, in the set of 15 trials, there was little difference in risk depending on the target point. If participants are sensitive to risk, their aims will depend on the given number of chances. Therefore, the choice of the aiming point taken by the participants is reasonable, when considered, if they try to obtain a more stabilized outcome (i.e., to reduce risk). Additionally, the prediction of the SL-MV model using the assumption of risk aversion is compatible with the findings of previous studies using economic decisionmaking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> For instance, a previous study tested the impact of single-play versus multiple-play decisions made under risk in a simulated industrial purchasing setting and reported that for multiple decisions, individuals perceived lower risk than if the decision was one-shot. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> On the contrary, an important difference between previous studies regarding economic decision-making and the current study regarding motor decision-making is the distortion from the optimal decision (i.e., MEG RT in the current study) in multiple trials. Although decisions in the economic situation are close to the behavior, maximizing expected gain under multiple trials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> those in motor decision-making undercount safety margins in multiple plays. This difference reflects a consistent bias in the probability prediction of motor outcomes. Previous studies reported that motor outcomes were perceived as more biased toward success, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38</ref> and motor variability was underestimated relative to the actual outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> Consistent with these findings, the represented motor variance estimated by the SL-MV model tended to be smaller than the actual variance. These findings mean that in motor decision-making, metacognition of one's own motor system would induce a systematic bias (or error) from the optimal solution.</p><p>One possible factor not considered in our model is whether risk sensitivity varies with the number of chances or whether the subjective value itself varies with the number of chances.</p><p>The former explains the present behavior by making the motor plan in a risk-averse attitude when the number of trials is low, and risk-seeking when the number of trials is high. The latter also results in a greater subjective loss felt in response to failure (responding beyond 1500 ms in the current study). It is possible that the subjective value for the same failure may be more or less to correspond to foraging ecology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref> Moreover, studies on decision making in animals have</p><p>shown that a high valuation of immediate rewards is not necessarily a suboptimal strategy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref> Since several cost functions are related to decision making, in particular the risk of interruption or opportunity, the optimal solution could be to ensure rewards by taking a risk-averse attitude.</p><p>Thus, the behavior of the participants in the current study may also reflect an evolutionarily acquired optimal strategy selection.</p><p>The current study demonstrated behavioral modulation of the aiming point in response to the number of chances. We proposed a risk-sensitive decision model considering both expected gain and variability at the set level to account for the modulation of the aiming point; we found that participants tended to embrace risk aversion from the model fitting results. Future studies are required to clarify the mechanism underlying the adjustment of motor planning, depending on the given number of chances. </p></div>

Then, after a foreperiod of 1800-2200 ms, a red circle was presented at the center of the screen. The participants were required to press the space key arbitrarily. The score for each trial was determined by the time interval between the presentation of the red circle and the key press. After the red circle was presented for 3000 ms, the time interval (i.e., response time) and score were presented as feedback for 1500 ms.</p><p>Two types of gain functions were assigned to each set. Under the cliff condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig 1b)</ref>, the gain (G) depending on the response time (t) was determined as follows:</p><p>( ) = 0 ( &lt; 500 &gt; 1500), and ( ) = 100 + ( − 1500)/10 ( 500 ≤ ≤ 1500).</p><p>Under the no-cliff condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig 1c)</ref>, the gain depending on the response time was determined as follows:</p><p>( ) = 0 ( &lt; 500 &gt; 2500), ( ) = 100 + ( − 1500)/10 ( 500 ≤ ≤ 1500), and ( ) = 100 + (1500 − )/10 ( 1500 &lt; ≤ 2500). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>The reaction time (RT) was defined as the time interval between the target stimulus onset and keypress. For each participant, the mean RT in the test trials and in the test and practice trials were calculated for each condition. Four participants, whose mean RT including all practice and test trials in the cliff condition was higher than 1500 ms or lower than 1000 ms, were eliminated from the following analyses because the participants did not correctly understand the requirements of the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation of maximizing expected gain RT</head><p>To evaluate optimal selection of aiming points (estimated as the mean RT), the maximizing expected gain (MEG) RT was estimated and the distortion from the MEG RT was calculated. MEG RT was estimated as follows:</p><p>1. First, as an index of motor variability, the standard deviation was calculated using the data in the 15-test cliff condition.</p><p>2. Next, under the assumption that the distribution of motor outcomes follows a normal distribution as determined by the aiming point (μ) and SD ( ), the distribution of motor outcomes is defined as follows: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 2a</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( |µ, ) = ! √#$% ! exp (− ('()) ! #% ! )</formula><p>3. The expected gain dependent on the aiming point (μ) and motor variability (σ) was calculated by integrating the distribution of the motor outcomes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2a</ref>) and the gain function ( . The aiming point (μ) was set every 1 ms in the range of 1000-2000 ms, and the expected gain was calculated as a function of μ and σ. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 2c)</ref> 4. RT maximizing the expected gains was defined as MEG RT. The MEG RT, and distortion of the observed RT from the MEG RT, for each condition were calculated for each participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Set-level mean-variance model</head><p>As the model considered the influence of the number of chances, we proposed a model in which subjective utility was formed from both set-based variance of the score and expected gain. Markowitz's mean-variance model suggests that the value U(x) of an investment x is modeled as a trade-off between the expected gain (mean return) EG(x) and the variability of the outcomes Var(x). In the current experimental task, a closer aiming point to the cliff (i.e., 1500 ms) led to a larger score variance. Thus, the RT will be shorter (or longer) than the MEG RT if the participant is risk averse (or risk seeking) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 4a)</ref>.</p><p>Here, the critical issue is the size of the parts of a sample taken to consider the risk (variability of the outcomes). If the risk is defined as the variability of the score in each trial <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.    4b</ref>), the aiming point should not be changed depending on the number of chances, because the risk is independent of it. In contrast, if the risk is considered as the variability of score in the average (or total) score across a set, the number of chances will affect the risk; specifically, the risk is greatly affected by the differences in the aiming point when the number of chances is less.</p><p>Based on the mean-variance model, we assume that the expected utility is determined by the sum of the expected gain (EG) and the subjective value of variability in gain adjusted by risk attitude (αSDgain). The simulation results of the decision model considering both the mean scores and risks at the set level are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 4d</ref>-g. Motor variability was set to σ = 200 (ms). The outcomes (RT and gain) in each trial were determined by a random number following a normal distribution, depending on the motor plan (μ) and standard deviation (SD, σ). In each condition of 1-15 test trials, the sequences of the outcomes for 100 sets were simulated, and the mean and SD of the mean score for each set were calculated <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 4c)</ref>.

In particular, the modulation between one and five chances was conspicuous. The results of estimating the risksensitivity (α) and motor variance (σ), which explained well the modulation of RT for each5 participant, are shown in Fig. 4h-i. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the estimated α compared to zero revealed a trending difference (t[55] = -1.953, d = -0.261, p =.056), suggesting that the participants tended to engage in risk-averse behaviors. A paired t-test between the observed σ and estimated σ revealed a significant difference (t[55] = -2.305, d = -0.308, p =.025), indicating that the participants represented a smaller motor variability than the actual variability. In other words, participants overestimated their motor accuracy.6</figDesc></figure>

It may be difficult to separate changes in subjective values for loss and risk attitudes as each has a similar impact. Future studies are required to clarify the factors that influence subjective value representations and consequent motor decision-making by integrating cognitive modeling and physiological or neurological indicators. Furthermore, when viewed in the context of decision-making in animals, context dependency in human motor decision-making, as demonstrated in the current study, may indicate the necessity to incorporate the concept of biological fitness or survival strategy to clarify tendencies in decision-making. Namely, changes in risk attitudes and context-specific strategies may not merely reflect individual preferences, but also evolutionarily acquired functions. For example, differences in decision making between chimpanzees and bonobos have been reported</figDesc></figure>

The potential α was set at 0.1 from -20 to 20. The potential σ values were set every 1 ms from 10 ms to 400 ms. The sum of the residual squares between the observed RT modulation, and RT modulations estimated with 100 repetitions, was calculated for each combination of α and σ. The estimated α and σ to account for each individual behavior were determined as the values that minimized the mean sum of the residual squares. The risk attitudes of each participant were assessed based on the value of α. In addition, the accuracy of the motor variability representation was assessed by comparing σest and the observed σ in15 test trials in the cliff condition.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head>Figure 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>SL-MV model. (a) Concept of the mean-variance model. Markowitz's mean-variance model suggests that the value of an investment is modeled as a trade-off between the expected gain (mean return) and the variability of the outcomes (score). In the current task, the closer the aiming point to the cliff leads to the larger variance of the score. Therefore, the RT will be shorter (/longer) than the MEG RT if the participant is risk-averse (/risk-seeking).(b) Risk and EG based on trial-level data. Risk and EG are typically calculated by the variability of the outcomes using a large number of trials. This view does not take into account how many trials are included in each set. (c) Risk and EG based on set-level data. In situations where the goal is to maximize the overall outcome (i.e., mean or sum of outcomes) when multiple trials are conducted, participants may view the major outcome as a cohesive set of multiple trials, rather than considering the outcomes for each trial unit. Here, we assume that the number of trials in a set is 1 and 15. The gray squares indicate the outcome of each trial, and the black squares indicate the mean of the set. To simulate set-level risk and EG, they are calculated using the datasets of mean outcomes in each set. (d-g) SL-MV model simulation. The simulation was performed using σ = 200 ms, α = -2, 0, or +2, and the number of trials = 1, 2, 3 … 15. Aiming points were set every 1 ms from 1000 to 1500 ms. Here, simulation results using μ = 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, and 1500 were shown in Fig 3d-f. (d) Gain function and motor variability were shown. (e) Estimated EG. EG depending on the aiming points and on the number of trials were shown. The colors of the solid lines correspond to the motor variability in Fig.4d. Importantly, EG was not affected by the number of trials. (f) Estimated SD. Risk (variability of outcomes) depending on the aiming points and on the number of trials were shown. The greater the number of trials in a set, the smaller the risk and the smaller the difference in SD between different aiming points. (g) Estimated RT. Estimated RT indicates the RT maximizing the expected utility ( , , ) calculated as ( , ) + ( , ). It can be confirmed that modulation of the aiming point according to the number of trials is reversed, depending on whether riskaverse (α = -2) or risk-seeking (α = +2). (h) The relationship between risk-sensitivity (α) and subjective motor variability (σest) is shown in the left panel. The right panel shows the mean α among participants. A one-sample t-test on the estimated α compared to zero revealed a trending difference (p =.056), suggesting that risk-averse behaviors were observed. (i) Distortion of subjective motor variability (σest) from observed variability (σobs). The left panel shows the relationship between observed motor variability (σobs) and subjective motor variability (σest). The right panel shows the mean σobs and σest among participants.
