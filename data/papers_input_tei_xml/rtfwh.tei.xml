				<p>Social distance is one of the indicators of intergroup relations. It expresses the degree of intimacy, proximity or distance in relation to the members of specific social groups, making the concept an indirect form of referring to prejudice. The present study described in this article aims to evaluate the protocol for the use of an indirect measure of social distance, implemented by computers and specialized devices. We sought to assess the potential of the technique of virtual reality as a criterion for estimating social distance by comparing the results obtained in the virtual environment with the correlated measures obtained in a computer screen. This is an experimental study, developed to evaluate the pleasantness of four photographs and the registry of two classes of indirect measures. Social distance was</p>

A total of 150 university students participated in the study, 87 from Brazil and 61 from Mozambique. In the study, we show that the estimate for social distance is more associated with the response time than the attractiveness of the image, regardless of the country. When we introduce in the predictive models the variables sex and skin color of the individuals portrayed in the photographs, we note that the models obtained in the virtual environment present better indicators than those obtained in the screen, except for the predictive model for the evaluation of the distance of the Black woman portrait. The response time proved to be much more central in the model than the attractiveness of the image. In the screen environment, the increase in the image size was connected to the greater amount of time spent in decision-making while in the virtual environment the distancing from the image was connected to a greater amount of time spent making a decision. The country of origin had little influence over the final models. In conclusion, we may highlight that the effects of social distance, the response time and the attractiveness of the image were greater in the virtual environment, which inspires us to highlight the importance of using more sophisticated data collection procedures through the use of information technology.</p><p>Keywords: social distance, virtual reality, stereotypes, prejudice Resumo A distância social é um dos indicadores das relações intergrupais e expressa o grau de intimidade, contato ou afastamento em relação aos membros de determinados grupos sociais, o que torna o conceito um referente indireto do preconceito. A presente pesquisa relatada neste artigo tem por objetivo apresentar o protocolo de uso de uma medida indireta de distância social, implementada por computadores e dispositivos especializados. Procuramos avaliar o potencial de utilização da técnica da realidade virtual como um critério de estimativa da distância social, comparando os resultados obtidos no ambiente virtual com as medidas correlatas obtida em uma tela de computador. Trata-se de um estudo experimental que elaborado com a finalidade de avaliar a agradabilidade de quatro fotografias e o registro de duas classes de medidas indiretas, a distância social escolhida para avaliar as fotos e o tempo de resposta utilizado para escolher a estimativa, em duas modalidades de coleta de dados, uma em ambiente em tela e outra em ambiente virtual, no Brasil e Moçambique.</p><p>Participaram do estudo 150 estudantes universitários, 87 do Brasil e 61 de Moçambique. No estudo mostramos que a estimativa da distância social se encontra mais associada ao tempo de resposta do que à atratividade da imagem, independente do país. Ao introduzir nos modelos preditivos a as variáveis sexo e cor da pele dos personagens retratados nas fotografias constamos que os modelos obtidos em ambiente virtual apresentam melhores indicadores do que os obtidos em ambiente de tela, exceto no modelo preditivo para a avaliação da distância da foto da mulher negra. O tempo de resposta se mostrou muito mais central no modelo do que a atratividade da imagem. No ambiente de tela, o aumento da imagem estava vinculado ao maior tempo gosto na tomada de decisão e no ambiente virtual, o afastamento da imagem vinculou-se a um maior tempo para a tomada de decisão, enquanto o país de origem do participante pouco contribui para os modelos finais. Em conclusão, podemos destacar que os efeitos da distância social, do tempo de resposta e da atratividade da imagem foram mais acentuados no ambiente virtual, o que nos inspira a acentuar a importância da utilização dos procedimentos de coletas de dados mais sofisticados mediante o uso da tecnologia da informação.</p><p>Palavras-chave: distância social, realidade virtual, estereótipos, preconceitos</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social distance: a comparison between the screen and virtual environments</head><p>The concept of social distance was introduced in social psychology to identify the desirable degree of intimacy or distancing in relation to a group or social category. It has been used as an indirect indicator of some essential dimensions of stereotypes and prejudices <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Park, 1924)</ref>. The social distance measure, originally developed by sociologist Emory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bogardus (1927)</ref>, is a unidirectional measure, in which the items contain ordered statements with estimates on the different levels of contact that could be established with the members of specific groups or social categories. The social distance indicator represents an indirect measure of the degree of prejudice in relation to a series of social categories. It also offers some indications concerning stereotypes, especially with respect to their evaluative dimension.</p><p>The implementation of the distance measure was entirely dependent on the information technology and could not have been obtained without the use of computers and specialized devices. We aimed to assess the potential for the use of the technique of immersion in a virtual environment as a criterion for estimating social distance. We compared the results obtained in the virtual environment with the correlated measures obtained in a computer screen. Contrary to the results obtained with the traditional scalar methods through self-report techniques, the answers here were measured from the degree of physical proximity considered appropriate to pass judgment on the category being judged. Since the variations in the measure of social distance are correlated to the results obtained through other measures, we also sought to explore the relations between these measures and social distance through the development of exploratory predictive models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A new form of researching social distance</head><p>The measurement of stereotypes and prejudiced attitudes through the use of self-report methods represents a source of difficulty for research in social psychology for several reasons, ranging from lack of awareness of the phenomena being studied to the adoption by the participant of strategies to deliberately hide the beliefs and attitudes manifested in the private sphere. Furthermore, problems related to desirability and self-presentation strategies are commonplace, hence the emergence of a series of measures designed to obtain data not dependent on participants' verbal reports. The use of resources for immersion in the virtual environment has provided a satisfactory solution to overcome some limitations of the methods of self-report <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bailenson, Blascovich, Beall, &amp; Loomis, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Peña &amp; Blackburn, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sanches-Vives, &amp; Slater, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yee, Bailenson, &amp; Ducheneaut, 2009)</ref>. We can resort to two major traditions in this field of research. One is derived from neuroscience and dedicated to the analysis of the periscopic space, that is, the space within the reach of the arm <ref type="bibr">(Kalckert &amp; Ehrson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kilteni, Normand, Vives, &amp; Slater, 2012)</ref>. The other, from social psychology, focuses on estimating the distance that allows a relatively comfortable social interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Llobera, Spanlang, Ruffini, &amp; Slater, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">McCall, Blascovich, Young, &amp; Persky, 2009)</ref>. The present article is grounded in the second research tradition of psychosocial studies in an environment of virtual immersion. We assess not only the effect of the virtual social distance but also contemplate a research tradition dedicated to determining the interaction between gender and race characteristics of the participant and the avatar in the estimated social distance. Some studies have focused on assessing the impact of sexual <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Behm-Morawitz &amp; Schipper, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fox, Bailenson, &amp; Tricase, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang, Shen, &amp; Contractor, 2013)</ref> and racial characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dotsch, &amp; Wigboldus, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Groom, Bailenson, &amp; Nass, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Maister, Sebanz, Knoblich, &amp; Tsakiris, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Peck, Seinfeld, Aglioti, &amp; Slater, 2013)</ref>, as well as emotional expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Yang, Gibson, Leuke, Huesmann, &amp; Bushman, 2014)</ref>. Such studies show an increase in interaction distance in virtual environments, produced by avatars characterized as members of an exogroup or with a threatening facial expression. They also identified a reduction in the distance when the avatar was a female character. Regarding still the studies on the relations between immersion in virtual environments and the expression of prejudice, other studies adopt the notion of perspectivism <ref type="bibr">(Todd, Bodenhausen, Richeson, &amp; Galinky, 2011)</ref>, when they show that if the participant's avatar incorporates characteristics of the group that is the target of judgment, a significant reduction in the expression of prejudice and a more tolerant attitude are observed <ref type="bibr">(Avenati, Sirigu, &amp; Aglioti, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Peck, Seinfeld, Aglioti, &amp; Slater, 2013</ref>).</p><p>In the experimental study reported in the present article, our strategy was to ask the participant to evaluate four photographs in terms of their attractiveness while we simultaneously registered two classes of indirect measures: the social distance chosen to evaluate the photographs and the response time required for the decision. Given the nature of the photographs, of men and women with Black and White phenotypes, we included male and female participants with different tones of skin color, from Brazil and Mozambique, two countries with different demographic compositions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design</head><p>The research required a mixed 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, with the first two factors being independent measures relative to the participants, sex (male and female) and nationality (Brazilian and Mozambican) and the last two repeated measures, the sex of the faces represented in the photograph (male and female) and the racial profile of the portrayed individuals (White and Black individuals). Since two data collection procedures were adopted, the photographs were evaluated twice, first after having been projected on a screen and second with the participant immersed in a virtual environment, in which the characteristics of the virtual environment of the first measurements were repeated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent variables</head><p>The participants were informed that the fundamental goal of the experiment was to assess how attractive the images were. Three classes of objects were presented, the natural, the cultural, and the human faces when the additional measures were being collected. The natural and cultural photographs served only as distracting stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human faces</head><p>The photographs of four human faces were evaluated, two Black, one male and one female, and two White, one male and one female. The images selected for the experiment were created through morphing techniques using the image bank made available by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mendes, Arrais and Fukusima (2009)</ref>. They were equated in terms of physical attractiveness and ethnic-racial identification from 64 images of male and female faces, Black and White. All images were estimated to be attractive at an average level and equated in factors such as attractiveness, friendliness, and quality of the photographs (reference omitted).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures of the dependent variables</head><p>From the answers to each photograph, we obtained several classes of measures of the dependent variables: 1) judgment on the attractiveness of the image; 2a) size of the image used to decide on the attractiveness of each of the items in the screen environment; 2b) the distance used to evaluate the attractiveness of the faces in the virtual reality environment; and 3) the response time for the decision regarding the attractiveness of the images.</p><p>The measure of the attractiveness of the images was based on a score from 0 to 10, related to how attractive the participant found the image being evaluated. Although the participant received the feedback of the attributed score during the evaluation, for data registry, a continuous visual scale was used, which made it possible to register the intermediate values of the scale.</p><p>Two classes of measures of social distance were registered, one obtained in the screen environment and one in the virtual environment. In the former, the images were presented using a projector, on a screen placed approximately 280 centimeters away from the participant, who could increase or reduce the image size using a joystick, to the size they considered more comfortable for decision-making. The image size was registered and used as one of the measures of social distance.</p><p>The arrangement of the equipment in the laboratory where the experiment was conducted is presented in the diagram in the supplementary material. In the diagram, the elements identified are a camera for recording movements, located precisely 14.5cm above the participant's head, Computer 1, used to project the image on the screen, Computer 2, in which the virtual reality devices were configured, and Computer 3, used for collecting the online questionnaires.</p><p>In the stage of assessment of the photographs in the virtual environment, the participant was immersed in a room with the same dimensions as the physical environment where they made their prior evaluation. They were placed at the same distance from a virtual screen, in which the image for evaluation was rendered. By using the joystick, the participant could bring the screen closer or farther from themselves until they reached the distance they found more comfortable to judge the attractiveness of the face. The distance, measured in VR units (one unit = 1 meter) between the position of the participant and the screen, was registered and defined as the second measure of social distance.</p><p>The time needed for issuing an answer regarding the attractiveness of the objects and faces was registered, corresponding to yet another dependent variable of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional measures</head><p>In the last stage of the study, the participant was shown the way to Computer 3, in which they answered a set of self-report measures, as well as a sociodemographic questionnaire. The items of all the questionnaires were presented as questions in the Linkert format, with the same answer options for all the items. The order of presentation of the items was randomized and each sentence was presented on a screen. We will next list the scales additionally used.</p><p>1. Scale of perception of discriminating/being discriminated against. In the present study, we introduced a new measure of discrimination that refers to the degree to which the participant perceives having discriminated or being discriminated against by White and Black people.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Scale of motivation for the control of prejudice.</head><p>In the present research, two dimensions of the scale for the control of prejudice were used, one of internal motivation and one of external motivation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Scale of essentialism (biological bases).</head><p>Participants A total of 150 students participated in the study, from Brazil (32 men and 57 women) and Mozambique (30 men and 31 women). The chi-square value (x 2 (1) = 2.611, p = 0.106) indicated a balanced distribution between men and women. The mean age was 22.8 years and the standard deviation was 5.92 years among Brazilians and 24.0 years with a standard deviation of 5.32 years among Mozambicans, with the t-test for difference of means indicating no significant statistical differences in the mean age of the participants from both countries (t(148) = 1.230, p = 0.221). Regarding skin color, measured using a graphic scale with 20 bands, the scores for the Brazilian participants (mean = 6.47; SD =3.64) were statistically different from the Mozambicans (mean = 12.16; SD =3.46). Estimated by the ttest for difference of means, this indicates that the African participants had a much darker skin color than the Brazilian participants (t (148) = 9.591, p&lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments and equipment</head><p>Since the experiment required several stages, from the evaluation in the screen (hereafter referred to as the screen environment) to the immersion in virtual worlds (hereafter, the virtual environment), we must identify the technological resources (equipment and software) used. The notebook connected to the projector for the presentation of the stimuli in the non-virtual environment was a PC machine, Quad-core Processor, 16 MB of RAM, an Nvidia 960 graphics card, with a Windows 8 system. The images were projected onto a 2x2 meter screen by an Epson projector, model 2000s, with an illumination rate of 2000 lumens.</p><p>The output resolution was 800 x 600. The virtual immersion environment was generated using an Avell notebook, 16 MB of RAM, with an Nvidia GT 1060 graphics card and rendered using the Rift DK2 virtual reality goggles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Software</head><p>For the creation of the applications, the Unity environment version 5.2.2.f was used.</p><p>The C# programming language was used to generate the code necessary to present the stimuli, record the responses, and create the interaction environment required to conduct the experiments. Three applications were designed for the experiment, each installed on a computer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>Since the experimental sessions took place in a series of stages, it became necessary to define a research protocol describing the procedures. In stage 1, all participants initially filled out an informed consent form. Subsequently, the experimenter asked the participant for certain information: sex, age, skin color (estimated using a skin color scale), and selfidentified race/ethnicity. Following this, a training session was held, consisting of three trials in which the participant became familiar with the experimental environment, the experimental routines, and the handling of the systems for interacting with the experimental environment by using a joystick to bring the stimuli closer and farther away and make the measure slide appear and disappear.</p><p>Once the training stage was over, the participant evaluated eight stimuli, four photographs, two picturing objects of nature and two of culture, and four faces (White, woman; White, man; Black, woman; Black, man). Next, with the help of the experimenter, the participant put on the virtual reality device and began a training section in the virtual environment, also consisting of three trials, in which the participant interacted with the experimental environment, using the joystick to zoom in and out of the stimuli and to make the measure slider and the stimulus evaluation record button appear and disappear. Once familiar with the environment, the participant evaluated eight stimuli, the same images presented in the previous stage, this time presented in a virtual environment.</p><p>In the next step, the participant moved to Computer 3, where they responded to the selfreport measures. Finally, the experimenter conducted a follow-up interview, thanked the participant, and provided clarification regarding the objectives of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory analysis of the results</head><p>Since the estimation of social distance was performed by evaluating photographs of Initially, we sought to determine how social distance was related to the estimated attractiveness of the photograph and the time required to complete the evaluation. To do so, we ran two Bayesian linear regressions, one for each data collection modality, both designed to estimate the impact of the evaluation of image attractiveness, the time it took to make the decision, and the nationality of the participant on social distance estimation. In all models, an a priori uniform value [P(M)] of 0.125 was set for each of the 8 possible models.</p><p>Compared to the null model, the one obtained for predicting the social distance in a screen environment was robust (BF10 = 6.648e+10; r2 = 0.391), including the predictors response time (BFInc= 3.140e+11), being Brazilian (BFInc= 120.913), and evaluation of attractiveness in a screen environment (BFInc = 0.163). Also compared to the null model, the one generated for social distance in virtual environment was more robust (BF10 = 7.271e+13; r 2 = 0.416), also including the predictors response time (BFInc= 6.797e+10), being Brazilian (BFInc = 0.265), and attractiveness (BFInc = 0.141).</p><p>The relationships between the variables included in the regression models can be identified in the graphs found in figure 1. The graphs were generated with the Flexplot routine, available in the statistical analysis software JASP, version 0.10.1, in which social distance represented the dependent variable, while the variables attractiveness and response time (segmented into quartiles, and separated into three groups, the fast (between 2.6 and 9.5 seconds), the average (between 9.6 and 14.3 seconds), and the slow (between 14.4 and 29.1 seconds)) were the predictor variables. For each data collection modality, graphs were plotted with the data from the Brazilian and Mozambican participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure1</head><p>: social distance measures in screen and virtual environments, as a function of photograph attractiveness scores and response time, and separated by participants' country of origin Despite some localized differences, both in the graph prepared from the measures obtained in the screen environment (A), and in the measures obtained in the virtual environment (B), we identified the same trend when comparing the response patterns of the participants who responded more quickly. These presented lower scores on the social distance measure, followed by those who needed an average time to make the decision, and finally, those who decided more slowly. The latter presented higher scores on the social distance measures. This trend, observed in both countries and both data collection conditions, should, however, be carefully considered. The social distance measure in the screen environment indicates that lower scores represent greater distance, since the increase in the image size offers a greater sense of proximity. In the immersion environment, the lower the measure value, the greater the sense of proximity, since the image size remains the same, changing only the distance chosen by the participant to best observe it.</p><p>In both environments, we identified that in the case of participants with average decision speed, no associations were found between the evaluation of attractiveness and distance, although it is possible to identify that Brazilian participants increased the image more than Mozambicans. Among the participants who decided more quickly, the pattern found showed exactly the same pattern of responses between Brazilians and Mozambicans, and it was possible to identify a positive relationship, which shows that the more attractive the image was considered, the more the participants tended to increase the size to evaluate it.</p><p>The main difference found in the screen environment refers to the participants who took a long time to make a decision because a positive correlation between the size of the image and the photograph's attractiveness estimate could be identified. Among the Mozambican participants, it was clear that the increase in the attractiveness evaluation was negatively related to the size of the photograph.</p><p>The scenario found in the evaluation of photographs in the virtual environment was a little different. Among Brazilians, we identified a relationship between image attractiveness and distance from the photograph only among participants who required an average amount of time for decision-making. Among Brazilian participants who were faster or slower, we could not identify any systematic relationship between attractiveness evaluation and distance.</p><p>In the case of Mozambican participants, the results differed as a function of time, as the slowest tended to move closer to the images when they considered them attractive, while the average and the fastest tended to move farther away from the photographs they considered more attractive.</p><p>Taken together, and taking into account the models generated by the linear regression, we have a strong indicator that the social distance estimate is more associated with response time than with image attractiveness. Since the values of the BF Inclusion parameter of the Bayesian linear regression suggest a modest contribution of the variables attractiveness and country of origin, we introduced a second dimension of analysis, to identify whether the results obtained so far remained consistent with the inclusion of two variables, the gender and race of the image represented in the photograph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social distance: gender and race of photos</head><p>To identify predictive models for the two environments taking into account the gender and the race/skin color of the character presented in the photograph, we conducted four Bayesian linear regressions, adopting the same parameters exposed in the previous analysis.</p><p>A first consideration about the models is that, except for the predictive model for the evaluation of the distance of the Black woman's photograph, whose results were very similar to the previous one, the models obtained in the virtual environment were better than the ones obtained in the screen environment. If we consider the ratio between the Bayesian factors of each model, it is possible to identify that the model obtained in the virtual environment for the White man was 649 times better than the one obtained in the screen environment. In the case of the Black man, the virtual model was 6,650,140 times better than the one obtained in the screen environment. The model obtained in the virtual environment for the White woman was 352 times better than the one obtained in the screen environment.</p><p>It was also clear that the trend identified in the previous analysis remained consistent, since the response time had much more impact than the image attractiveness. Since the posterior summaries of the coefficients were always positive, this further supported the understanding that in the screen environment, the longer the time for decision-making, the more the participant increased the size of the image, while in the virtual environment, the longer the time required for the decision, the more the participant pushed the image away.</p><p>The participant's country of origin contributed little to the models, except in the case of the Black man, although the Bayesian factor value indicated an effect that can be considered anecdotal (BF10 = 2.536). Image attractiveness, although included in all the models, was always a low inclusion factor.</p><p>The relations between the four types of photographs and the variables discussed so far can be found in the graphs in figure 2, in which the impact of attractiveness and response time is estimated with regards to the distance from which the four photographs were evaluated in each of the data collection environments.</p><p>In the screen environment, it was possible to identify, in the case of the White man photograph, a positive association between attractiveness and image size only among Brazilian participants who decided in an average time. In the other cases, it was not possible to identify any relationship between attractiveness and distance. In the Black man photograph, we identified a negative association between attractiveness and distance only among the Brazilians who took longer to decide, and a positive association among the faster ones. Among Mozambicans, we could not identify systematic relations between attractiveness and distance. This association, however, proved inverse among participants who had an average decision time, although this effect was more intense among Mozambicans. The evaluation of the Black woman photograph showed a somewhat diverse pattern. For Brazilians and Mozambicans, the direction of the association differed between those who decided quickly and those who had average and slower decision times, since the latter showed a negative association, while the former increased the image while evaluating the photograph positively.</p><p>The results obtained in the virtual environment also showed that, depending on the response time, associations between attractiveness estimation and social distance can be identified. In the evaluation of the photograph of the Black man, we identified that a longer time for decision-making was a necessary condition for this association, with no relationship between attractiveness and distance being identified among Brazilian and Mozambican participants who decided quickly. This same trend can be observed in the data referring to almost all photographs, except for the Black man photograph among Brazilians and Black woman photograph among Mozambicans, in which we identified a very strong association between a positive evaluation and greater distance. In contrast, Brazilian participants who took longer to finish the evaluation almost always showed a positive association between attractiveness and greater distance when evaluating the White man photograph, while the evaluation of the attractiveness of the Black man photograph correlated positively with distance among Brazilian participants and negatively among Mozambicans. An important piece of evidence regarding the data obtained in the virtual environment was related to the positive association between the evaluation of the attractiveness and a greater distance from the photographs, observed in all cases and among Brazilians and Mozambicans who decided in an average time.</p><p>Reiterating the evidence presented in the previous section, the conclusion that social distance is more associated with response time than with image attractiveness is justified. It is also clear that the faster-deciding participants tended to reduce the size of the image in the screen environment and move the image closer in the virtual environment than the slowerdeciding participants. The analyses in the present section, in turn, help us identify that the association between distance and attractiveness is not negligible, but that it depends on the gender and race of the person depicted in the photograph, as well as on inherent differences of the participant, particularly the time required for decision-making. In this case, it is possible to emphasize that this effect was more visible in the virtual environment, and was particularly notable among those who decided in an average time.</p><p>Despite this evidence, we still found many gaps in our analysis. As the open request in the experimental procedure was to evaluate the attractiveness of the faces presented in the photographs, we believe that the gender and racial differences found in the photographs may have been decisive in the evaluation. Thus, we finalized the data exploration by developing predictive models for social distance considering the predictors gender, skin color, and age of the participant, as well as the psychosocial variables perceived discrimination, prejudice control motivation, essentialism, social dominance, and need for closure. The comparison of the models generated for the two environments (see <ref type="figure">figure 3)</ref> allowed us to identify that the models generated with the data collected in the virtual environment were always superior to those obtained with the data from the screen environment. It is also clear that the main predictor of the screen distance for evaluation was the response time, which contrasts with the practically negligible effect of the image attractiveness estimate. The posterior coefficients of the response time predictor were always positive, ranging from 0.030 to 0.052 in the virtual environment and 0.044 to 0.067 in the screen environment. Two socio-demographic variables were highlighted, age, included in the four models generated in the virtual environment, nationality, included in three models, and gender, included in two models. Among the psychosocial variables, motivation to control prejudice and social dominance were highlighted, as seen in figure 4. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results allow us to conclude that valid models were obtained in both screen and virtual environments, although in the latter the qualitative parameters measured by Bayesian analysis were almost always higher. These data support the interpretation that research conducted in virtual environments can overcome the limits of traditional methods of implementation of psychosocial experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Peña &amp; Blackburn, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bailenson, Blascovich, Beall, &amp; Loomis, 2003)</ref>. We sought to control the effect of physical attractiveness on social distance and identified that this relationship was mediated by the response time, particularly among respondents who were faster in the decision process, although this result proved quite different between participants of different nationalities. We believe that these differences can be explained by the particularities of the immersion environment we designed, characterized by a lower action potential for the character <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kalckert &amp; Ehrsson, 2012)</ref>, as well as a lower realism in the presentation of the target, a photograph and not an avatar.</p><p>The analyses taking into account the information regarding the race and sex of the images presented in the photographs showed, once again, that the racial and sexual characteristics of the photograph did not interfere with the difference in the quality of the models, since those obtained in the virtual environment almost always prove to be superior to those obtained in the screen environment. Concerning the effects associated with the participant, the results obtained in our study point to a more complex scenario of analysis, in which the relationship between distance and attractiveness depends on the sex, skin color, as well as the country of the participant, and these relationships are mediated by the sex and race of the photograph.</p><p>Few studies conducted in a virtual environment take into account psychological variables, most notably that of <ref type="bibr">Dotcsh and Wigboldus (2008)</ref>, in which Dutch participants with higher levels of implicit bias imposed greater distance on avatars with Moroccan facial features, with this effect being measured by the level conduction of the skin. Although we expected skin color to influence the distance imposed during the evaluation of the photographs, the results were tentative. Based on social identity theory, we expected that the lighter-skinned participants would evaluate the black photographs at a greater distance, as well as the reverse, a result that was also not confirmed. The evidence obtained in the study was not univocal, which prevents us from confirming some trends found in the literature, particularly that of keeping exogroup members at a greater distance or facilitating proximity with female characters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Considerations</head><p>The results presented here allow us to identify effects of both the presentation of the stimuli on the projection screen and in the virtual environment. The design we used, however, has limits, particularly regarding the movement of avatars in space and the type of avatar presented. The stimulus presentation technique, the diorama, required the participant to remain in a static position, although they had the power to move the picture closer or further away. The second limitation concerned the use of photographs rather than 3D modeled avatars, which significantly reduces the ecological validity of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hamilton &amp; Nowak, 2010)</ref>. In future implementations of the present study, it will be important to offer the participant the power to move freely through the scenario to choose the position that will produce their judgment, and the objects for judgment should be 3D-modeled avatars.</p><p>Despite the above limitations, we believe that the future of research in the field of stereotyping involves the development of non-obtrusive measures (as obtained in virtual environments) and that the path we are now following may lead to the development of studies of great interest to science and society.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>White men, Black men, White women, and Black women, two composite scores were created for each type of evaluation (screen environment and virtual environment), considering the four photographs in each case. The analysis of the internal consistency of the distance measure, conducted by Bayesian analysis, identified highly acceptable scores for both thescreen environment (posterior mean of McDonald's w = 0.809) and the virtual reality environment (posterior mean of McDonald's w = 0.881). Attractiveness scores were satisfactory for the screen environment (posterior mean of McDonald's w = 0.780), although they were lower for the virtual reality environment (posterior mean of McDonald's w = 0.587). The response time measures were also consistent, whether considering values obtained in the screen environment (posterior mean of McDonald's w = 0.742), or in the virtual reality environment (posterior mean of McDonald's w = 0.865). After ensuring the internal consistency of the measures, three variables were defined for each environment, distance, attractiveness, and response time, and then the internal relationships between the two sets of variables were identified.

The same positive association between attractiveness and distance was found in the evaluation of the picture of White women among the Brazilians, who were quick in deciding.</figDesc></figure>
