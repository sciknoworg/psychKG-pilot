			<abstract>
				<p>Differences in response time following previous losses relative to previous wins are robust observations in behavioural science, often attributed to an increased (or decreased) degree of cognitive control exerted after negative feedback, hence, posterror slowing (or post-error speeding). This presumes that the locus of this effect resides in the specific modulation of decision time following negative outcomes. Across two experiments, I demonstrate how the use of absolute rather than relative processing speeds, and the sensitivity of processing speeds in response to specific experimental manipulations (Experiment 1: win rate, Experiment 2: feedback), provide clarity as to the relative weighting of post-win and post-error states in determining these behavioural effects. Both experiments show that the speeding or slowing of decision-time is largely due to the flexibility generated by post-win cognitive states. Given that post-error speeding may actually represent post-win slowing, conclusions regarding the modulation of decision-making time as a function of previous outcomes need to be more carefully considered.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>Post-error speeding and post-error slowing are central findings in the cognitive control literature implying the acceleration or deceleration, respectively, of reaction time following the commission of an incorrect response <ref type="bibr">(eg, Pfister &amp; Foerster, 2022)</ref>. The observation of speeding or slowing is determined by both the nature of the task, and the proficiency with which the task is completed. For example, experimental psychology tasks tend to produce post-error slowing whereas simulated gambling paradigms tend to produce post-error speeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Eben, Chen, Billieux &amp; Verbruggen, 2022)</ref>. One reason for this is the difference in proficiency exhibited in each case: experimental psychology emphasizes accuracy (and hence a high degree of success) whereas gambling environments are designed to minimize player success. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dyson, Sundvall, Forder &amp; Douglas (2018)</ref> showed that both post-error speeding and post-error slowing could be observed within the same paradigm, where the direction of the effect was determined by the degree of wins and losses exhibited. Specifically, playing Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computerized opponent who could not be exploited (ie., win rate was low), post-error speeding was expressed. However, when participants were able to exploit their computerized opponent (ie., win rate was high), post-error slowing was expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dyson et al, 2018)</ref>. Both observations are consistent with an orienting account by <ref type="bibr">Notebaert, Houtman, Van Opstal, Gevers, Fias &amp; Verguts (2009, p. 275)</ref> whereby "infrequent events orient attention away from the task." If wins are frequent and losses are infrequent, then post-error slowing will result due to the rarity of error. In contrast, post-error speeding will result if the errors exceed the number of correct responses (see also <ref type="bibr">Notebaert et al, 2009, Experiment 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>What remains curious however is the implicit insistence that the locus of this effect is the degree of cognitive control exerted post-error. For example, <ref type="bibr">Dutilh, van Ravenzwaaij, Nieuwenhuis, van der Maas, Forstmann &amp; Wagenmakers (2012, p. 1)</ref> discuss post-error slowing in terms of "increased response caution" following an error, whereby greater control (or perceived control; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Eben et al., 2022)</ref> over responding increases the likelihood of correct responding on the following trial (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter &amp; Cohen, 2001</ref>). This characterization of posterror speeding or post-error slowing implies that decision-making is under volitional control following negative outcomes. In other words, the cognitive state generated by the error modulates the speeding or slowing of subsequent behaviour. However, this appears to be in contrast with several observations in the literature. First, the default observation of post-error speeding in contexts where individuals experience an equivalent degree of wins and losses (eg., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dyson et al., 2018)</ref> is consistent with the initiation of more intuitive and inflexible action following negative outcomes, relative to more rational and flexible decisions following positive outcomes (ie, System 1 rather than System 2; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kahneman, 2011)</ref>. Second, other studies have shown that neural signals generated by negative feedback (e.g., feedback-related negativity; FRN) modulate less than the FRN generated by positive feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cohen, Elger &amp; Ranganath, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Forder &amp; Dyson, 2016)</ref>, revealing a possible neurological origin of the inflexible behaviour observed down-stream following error. Therefore, the first step in adjudicating whether errors afford the flexible cognitive control allowing for variable speeding and slowing is to examine the degree to which post-error cognitive states are sensitive to experimental manipulation. Unfortunately, the use of a difference score obfuscates exactly what is speeding or slowing. Additional approaches to measurement such as estimating the variance in reaction time following error, or, calculating the difference between post-error and pre-error trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dutilh et al., 2012)</ref> are similarly uninstructive in testing a central assumption in the so-called post-error literature: that the speeding and / or slowing is the result of variable cognitive control following error. Therefore, the second step in adjudicating whether errors afford the flexible cognitive control allowing for variable speeding and slowing is to examine absolute post-error and post-correct RTs rather than the relative difference between RTs.</p><p>To examine the contribution(s) of putatively negative (post-error, post-loss) and positive (post-correct, post-win) cognitive states in producing effects traditionally attributed to post-error states, I examined the sensitivity of absolute post-loss and post-win decision time in response to two manipulations: win rate (Experiment 1), and, the presence or absence of feedback (Experiment 2). In both cases, a schematic 6 will help to disambiguate how to evaluate the relative contributions of both post-loss and post-win cognitive states in observing these effects (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kerzel, Balblani, Rosa &amp; Cong, 2022</ref>, for a similar logical argument for statistical learning effects in visual search). conditions were counterbalanced around the 50% condition (25%-50%-75%, or, 75%-50%-25%). Prior to each condition, participants were reminded of the rules of the game. At each trial, participants selected one of the 6 die sides and their computerized opponent did the same. For half of the participants, the rule was that if the sum of both dice was even they would win and if the sum of both dice was odd they would lose. This rule was reversed for the other half of the participants. In all cases, winning resulted in the sum of both dice being added to the participant's total, whereas losing resulted in the sum of both dice being subtracted from the participant's total.</p><p>Win rates were fixed within each condition in that the outcome of each trial was predetermined and the computer randomly selected a response from the category that would guarantee the required outcome. The game mechanics are set out in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table   1</ref>. To provide one specific example, the winning rule is to have an even sum and the trial is predetermined as a participant win trial. If the participant selected 3, the computer would randomly select another odd number <ref type="formula">(1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Median RTs at trial n+1 as a function of win rate condition (25%, 50%, 75%) and trial outcome at trial n (win, loss) for each participant were run through a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1d)</ref> 1 . Main effects of win rate (p = .001) and outcome (p &lt; .001) were subsumed in a two-way interaction between win rate x outcome (p &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1d</ref>). The interaction was due to the significant slowing of RT as a function of win-rate RT reduction post-win (25% = 687 ms; 50% = 604 ms; 75% = 506 ms ; all Tukey's HSD p &gt; .05) in contrast to the weaker winrate RT modulation post-loss (25% = 503 ms; 50% = 482 ms; 75% = 466 ms ; all Tukey's HSD p &gt; .05, apart from 25% vs. 75%). These data clearly favour the interpretation of post-win slowing (as opposed to post-loss speeding) given the flexibility of RTs following wins relative to the inflexibility of RTs following losses (see schematic <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>To test the generalizability of the results from Experiment 1, I moved from a 6-response, 2-outcome game (Dice Dual) to a 3-response, 3-outcome game (Rock, Paper, Scissors; RPS). In Experiment 2, we examined the sensitivity of post-loss and post-win RT in response to a different experimental manipulation: the presence or absence of direct feedback ('win', 'loss' or 'draw'). In the case of RPS, presenting both player and opponent responses prior to the delivery of 'win', 'loss' or 'draw' may allow individuals to resolve the outcome of the trial based on indirect feedback (eg., playing Paper against Scissors will result in a loss; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Forder &amp; Dyson, 2016,</ref> for a discussion). This is in contrast to a more potent delivery of feedback combining both indirect followed by direct feedback ('win', 'loss' or 'draw') regarding the outcome of the trial. Similar predictions can be made in terms of the difference between decision times following negative and positive feedback being caused by the modulation of a) post-loss RT only, b) post-win RT only, or, c) both post-loss and post-win RT (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 2)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Median RTs at trial n+1 as a function of direct feedback (present, absent) and trial outcome at trial n (win, loss) for each participant were run through a two-way repeated-measure ANOVA (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 2d</ref>). The main effects of outcome (p = .002) were subsumed in a two-way interaction between win rate x outcome (p = .004). As in Experiment 1, the interaction was due to the absence of RT modulation post-loss (Tukey's HSD p &gt; .05) in contrast to the significant slowing of post-win RT 11 due to the presence of direct feedback (Tukey's HSD p &gt; .05). Moreover, post-win RT following direct feedback was also significantly slower than both post-loss RTs.</p><p>The data from Experiment 2 again favour the interpretation of post-win slowing (as opposed to post-loss speeding) given the flexibility of RTs following wins relative to the inflexibility of RTs following losses (see schematic <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 2b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Differences in response time following previous losses (post-error) relative to previous wins (post-correct) are robust observations in behavioural science, often attributed to an increased (or decreased) degree of cognitive control exerted after negative feedback, hence, post-error slowing <ref type="bibr">(or post-error speeding)</ref>. This presumes that the locus of this effect resides in the specific modulation of decision time following negative outcomes. To test this idea, it is essential to examine a) absolute rather than relative decision-making times following wins and losses, and b) the degree to which post-win and post-loss time are modulated by experimental factors such as win rate (Experiment 1) or direct feedback (Experiment 2). Based on these data, I arrive at the alternative conclusion that the speeding or slowing of decisiontime is largely due to the flexibility generated by post-win cognitive states. That is, rather than describe an RT difference as post-error speeding, one can describe the same effect as post-win slowing. Indeed, research on operant conditioning and gambling reliably describe similar differences as post-reinforcement pauses, clearly identifying that the genesis of the effect is the result of a post-win cognitive state (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dixon, Larche, Stange, Graydon &amp; Fugelsang, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Laskowksi, Dorchak, Ward, Christense &amp; Euston, 2019)</ref>. This is, of course, not to deny that changes in reactivity following post-loss states do not contribute to the behavioural differences generated by negative and positive feedback (see Isheqlou et al 2022, <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>), simply to say such interpretations need to be more carefully considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Footnotes 1</head><p>To assess the effectiveness of our win rate manipulation in Experiment 1, average dice value at trial n+1 was assessed as a function of win rate condition (25%, 50%, 75%) and trial outcome at trial n (win, loss). The main effect of outcome (p &lt; .001) showed that participants selected higher values post-win relative to post-loss <ref type="bibr">(4.11 vs. 4.03)</ref>. The main effect of win rate (p &lt; .001) showed that participants selected higher values as win rate increased (25% = 3.92; 50% = 4.04; 75% = 4.24), although only the 75% win rate condition was significant from all other conditions (Tukey's HSD, p &lt; .05). Therefore, participants were more risky following wins relative to losses, and, in the win &gt; lose condition.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Problems in disambiguating the origin of decision-making speeding or slowing are also compounded by the traditional ways in which post-error speeding or post-error slowing measures are calculated. For example, Dutilh et al (2012, Table 1) summarize the standard way to assess speeding or slowing as calculating the difference between average reaction time post-error minus average reaction time post-correct for each participant. Therefore, positive values index post-error slowing (such as the +25ms observed in the 75% accuracy condition of Notebaert et al, 2009, Experiment 1) whereas negative values index post-error speeding (such as the -59 ms observed in the 35% accuracy condition of Notebaert et al, 2009, Experiment 1).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the central win = lose case represents the long-run equivalence of positive and negative outcomes (eg, in a 2 outcome game = 50%), with post-loss decisions taking less time that post-win decisions (so-called 'post-error speeding'; black dotted arrow). If it is only the impact of the negative outcomes that change decision time, then we would anticipate a reversal into post-error slowing (grey dotted arrow) when win rates exceed loss rates (win &gt; lose) but an exacerbation of post-error speeding when loss rates exceed win rates (win &lt; lose; as per Notebaert et al, 2009). However, it is possible to generate exactly the same empirical differences via the modulation of post-win behaviour only. Figure 1b represents the case where the same three time differences between post-win and post-loss are caused by the flexibility of responding following wins and the inflexibility of responding following losses. A final Figure 1c represents a third case where both positive and negative outcomes allow for the modulation of decision-making time on the next trial, and as such both contribute to the effects traditionally associated with the cognitive state following error. To foreshadow my results, our RT data produced a pattern similar to Figure 1b, identifying that the volitional control of decision-making time occurred following positive rather than negative outcomes. Method 96 individuals were recruited from the undergraduate community at the University of Alberta as part of the Psychology Research Participation scheme, and received performance-independent course credit (Research Ethics Board 2; Pro00116715). Of the participants who provided optional demographic information (81), 55 identified as female and 26 identified as male, and the mean age was 18.85 (SD = 1.82). Images of the individual sides of a 6-sided dice were used: white spots on a black background representing participant choices, and, black spots on a white background representing opponent choices. Stimulus presentation and response recording were coordinated through Presentation 23.0 (build 10.27.21; Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Albany, CA, USA). Participants completed 480 trials of a novel game Dice Dual (based on Hayes, 1975), divided into 3 conditions defined by fixed win rate (25% [win &lt; lose], 50% [win = lose], 75% [win &gt; lose]; 160 trials each). The order of the 25% and 75%</figDesc></figure>

Following participant response selection, both dice were presented for 1000 ms (opponent on left, participant on right) with the sum of the dice center screen. This was replaced by the outcome 'WIN (+x)' in green or 'LOSE (-x)' in red, with x representing the sum of both dice. Opponent and participant scores (bottom left and bottom right, respectively) would be updated for 1000 ms.

Of the participants who provided optional demographic information (59), 35 identified as female and 24 identified as male, and the mean age was 19.53 (SD = 2.31). Hardware was equivalent to Experiment 1. Participants completed 2 counterbalanced blocks of RPS each containing 66 trials, as part of a larger study examining the relationship between decision-making heuristics during RPS and multiple-choice question completion (to be reported elsewhere). In both conditions, the computer opponent used a variant of mixedstrategy (Bi &amp; Zhou, 2014) and played random 22 R, 22 P, and 22 S responses in random order. At each trial, participants were given the choice of R, P or S, with both participant and opponent score, and the trial number presented on the bottom of the screen. After participants made their selection, a corresponding static image showed both their decision (white glove on right) and the decision of their computer opponent (blue glove on left) for 1000 ms and then removed during a 500 ms blank screen. For the RPS block containing direct feedback, the words 'WIN [+1]' in green, 'LOSE [-1]' in red or 'DRAW [0]' in grey were presented for 1000 ms. For the RPS blocks without direct feedback, the blank screen was elongated for a further 1000 ms.</figDesc></figure>
