			<abstract>
				<p>The opioid system plays a key role in the regulation of affective processing including pain, pleasure, and reward. However, there is also increasing evidence that this system plays a broader role and can modulate cognitive function. In particular, increasing evidence suggests that the muopioid system influences how we choose between actions of different values and how we control our behavior in the face of distracting information. The present paper reviews the available evidence from studies that have used pharmacological manipulations of the mu-opioid system in healthy human volunteers. Our review covers experimental paradigms that have investigated reward-based decision making, impulsivity, neuropsychological tests of executive functioning, attention, inhibition and effort. The reviewed findings provide an emerging picture of how the mu-opioid system influences higher-level cognitive function via modulation of valuation, motivation and control circuits dense in mu-opioid receptors, including orbitofrontal cortex, basal ganglia, amygdalae, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex. The working model we put forward proposes that opioids influence decision making and cognitive control by increasing the subjective value of reward and reducing aversive arousal. The review highlights potential mechanisms that might underlie the effects of mu-opioids on decision making and cognitive control and provides important directions for future research.</p>

Much less is known about opioid effects in humans, however the available evidence from human opioid research is largely consistent with the rodent and primate findings. Some studies in humans have also examined opioid effects on cognitive function, for instance opioid modulation of higher level cognitive processes such as expectancies that underlie the placebo effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Pecina &amp; Zubieta, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The present review examines the role of the mu-opioid system in decision making and cognitive control, a topic which until recently has received little attention in healthy humans. Given its central role in modulating affective states <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Nummenmaa &amp; Tuominen, 2017)</ref>, understanding the role of the opioid system in decision making and cognitive control might also help to understand how affective states <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Braver et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chiew &amp; Braver, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Dreisbach &amp; Goschke, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Isen &amp; Means, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Notebaert &amp; Braem, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Vinckier, Rigoux, Oudiette, &amp; Pessiglione, 2018)</ref>, stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Shields, Sazma, &amp; Yonelinas, 2016)</ref>, and anhedonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barch, Pagliaccio, &amp; Luking, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Treadway, Bossaller, Shelton, &amp; Zald, 2012)</ref> modulate these functions.</p><p>The opioid system is made up of four different opioid receptor types, the mu-, delta, kappa-and the nociceptin receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Corbett, 2009)</ref>. Several types of endogenous ligands such as endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins, endomorphins and nociceptin activate these <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Calo, Guerrini, Rizzi, Salvadori, &amp; Regoli, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Fichna, Janecka, Costentin, &amp; Do Rego, 2007)</ref>. Drugs such as morphine and heroin are considered mu-opioid agonists, i.e. they act primarily on the mu-opioid receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Pasternak, 2001)</ref>. The drugs that block endogenous mu-opioid signaling (antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone) in humans typically inhibit activity at both mu-and kappa-receptors. To date, the mechanism of action of the mu-opioid receptor is best understood. Both the analgesic and the euphoric effects of opioid drugs are thought to be mediated by this receptor type <ref type="bibr">(Fields &amp; Margolis, 2015)</ref>. Molecular imaging studies have shown that mu-opioid receptors are highly expressed in brain areas such as the basal ganglia, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, but also expressed in prefrontal and parietal regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Henriksen &amp; Willoch, 2008)</ref>. Thus, opioid drugs could modulate valuation, decision-making, and cognitive control processes in the human brain through direct activation of mu-opioid receptors in these regions (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. Here we review studies that have used pharmacological manipulations in healthy humans to determine the exact role of the mu-opioid system in these functions. By doing so, our primary objective is to gain a better understanding of basic mechanisms. These insights will then also shed light on the possible role of the mu-opioid system in mediating the link between affective states on both decision making and cognitive control The present review focuses on the available evidence for the acute effects of opioid agonists and antagonists on cognition in healthy human volunteers. Our review covers studies using experimental paradigms to investigate decision making, impulsivity, executive functioning, attention, inhibition, and effort. We used Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar to search for relevant literature, using a combination of the keyword "opioid" or drug names such as "naltrexone", "naloxone", "remifentanil", "buprenorphine", "oxycodone" and "morphine" on the Mu opioid system review 4 one hand and the particular cognitive function (e.g. "attention", "impulsivity", "decisionmaking") on the other hand. In addition, we included articles cited in recent papers or described in the earlier reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Zacny (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ersek and colleagues (2004)</ref>. Studies were included if they have been published as an article in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, tested healthy human volunteers, included a pharmacological manipulation with an opioid agonist and/or -antagonist drug, and included one or more paradigm related to the domains of decision making or cognitive control. Both behavioral results and/or neural effects using EEG or fMRI were included in the review. Studies published before 1957 and studies that tested the interactive effect of the drug with pain or another drug were not considered.</p><p>Mu-opioid receptors are activated by a large number of different drugs. Since these medications are used to treat pain, they are commonly compared in terms of their efficacy to relieve pain at a particular dose and administration method. Opioid drugs are often given as pills (per oral; PO), but also intravenously (IV), transnasally (TN), subcutaneously (SC) and intramuscularly (IM). Here, we have calculated a rough estimate of 'morphine equivalence' on the basis of available evidence of analgesic effects. This conversion was primarily based on the values provided in earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Knotkova, Fine, &amp; Portenoy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Zacny, 1995)</ref>. It is important to emphasize that dosages with similar analgesic properties can have different effects on cognitive function and a simple conversion does not capture the different pharmacokinetics of different drugs. To emphasize that the conversion is coarse, we do not report the exact equianalgesic doses of morphine. Instead we have categorized the dose as a low, medium or high dose, using 4 mg and 7 mg IV morphine as the minimal cut-off values for the medium and high dose respectively. As for the opioid antagonists, these were categorized on the basis of available PET evidence about the proportion of mu-opioid receptors blocked by a given drug dose (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Mayberg &amp; Frost, 1990)</ref>. Doses covering 90-100% of receptors are considered full antagonism <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Weerts et al., 2013)</ref>. Where doses were much higher or lower than this range, this is specified in the text. In addition to drugs acting primarily as agonists or antagonist to opioid receptors, the literature also contains several reports from 'mixed agonists', i.e. drugs that act simultaneously as agonists and antagonists at different opioid receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Jacob, Michaud, &amp; Tremblay, 1979)</ref>. This category also covers drugs that act as partial agonists and antagonists, such as buprenorphine, which binds strongly to mu-opioid receptors, but causes less activation of the receptor than the endogenous ligand. Buprenorphine is also a kappa-opioid antagonist. These drugs were also categorized on the basis of their analgesic effects at the doses used in the literature.</p><p>We will proceed as follows. We will first briefly summarize the reviewed studies in the domains of decision making and cognitive control. This is followed by an integrative discussion of the reviewed literature in which we put forward a working model that aims to capture the reviewed findings which generates testable hypotheses for future research. We then highlight avenues for future research and draw some general conclusions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reward-based decision-making</head><p>Only a handful of studies have investigated the behavioral, neural and psychophysiological responses to reward-based decisions following pharmacological manipulation of the opioid system in healthy humans. <ref type="bibr">Petrovic and colleagues (2008)</ref> used opioid blockade (10 mg IV naloxone, placebo-controlled) to assess the role of endogenous Mu opioid system review 5 opioids during a gambling task with rewards and losses in 15 healthy men (within-subject). Opioid antagonism decreased subjective pleasure ratings and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) BOLD activity for the high-reward options. Monetary losses were rated as more aversive and opioid blockade increased activation in regions such as the ACC and anterior insula. Using a similar opioid blockade (50 mg naltrexone, n = 21) and placebo (n = 20) before a slot-machine task and roulette task, <ref type="bibr">Porchet and colleagues (2013)</ref> found somewhat contrary effects. While naltrexone did lead to a moderate attenuation of the motivational ratings after near-misses compared to placebo, participants also showed a larger change in the skin conductance response to wins and higher confidence following winning-streaks.</p><p>Using a Pavlovian instrumental transfer (PIT) task with chocolate reinforcement, Weber and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(2016)</ref> found a significant reduction in the difference between button presses for rewarded and unrewarded stimuli following 50 mg naltrexone (n = 40) compared to placebo (n = 40). <ref type="bibr">Eikemo and colleagues (2017)</ref> tested the effects of 50 mg naltrexone, 10 mg morphine and placebo on rewarded choice in healthy men (n = 30, within-subjects). Using a drift diffusion model, they found that mu-opioid agonism enhanced, and blockade decreased, the efficiency of processing in the reward task, which they interpreted as a measure of motivation to obtain reward. Morphine also increased the bias towards a response option associated with high reward probability. Results from a study of opioid effects on financial decisions (trading game) suggest decreased reinforcement learning after naltrexone (50 mg, n = 62) compared to placebo (n = 116) in healthy participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Efremidze, Sarraf, Miotto, &amp; Zak, 2017)</ref>. In contrast to these findings, one study reported no effects of opioid blockade (50 mg naltrexone) on BOLD responses to monetary wins and losses (Monetary Incentive Delay task) in 35 healthy participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Nestor et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To sum up, although there have been few pharmacological studies in healthy humans, the available evidence provides some support for involvement of the endogenous opioid system in value-based decision making, which echoes the extensive evidence from rodent research (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Berridge &amp; Kringelbach, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Laurent et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Lutz &amp; Kieffer, 2013)</ref>. More specifically, blocking opioid receptors may reduce, and stimulating receptors may enhance, the motivational value of high value stimuli and choices for these options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impulsivity</head><p>A handful of studies have investigated the role of the opioid system in impulsive behavior, typically assessing delay discounting. In a delay discounting task, subjects make choices between options that either result in smaller immediate rewards or larger delayed rewards. Two initial studies reported no significant effect of naltrexone (50 mg PO) on impulsive choice ratio in nine <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Mitchell, Tavares, Fields, D'Esposito, &amp; Boettiger, 2007)</ref> and 10 healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Boettiger, Kelley, Mitchell, D'Esposito, &amp; Fields, 2009)</ref>. In a larger study by <ref type="bibr">Weber et al. (2016)</ref>, a trend towards reduced impulsive choice was reported in 40 healthy people receiving naltrexone (50 mg) in comparison to a placebo group of the same size. Few studies report effects of opioid agonism on impulsivity measures in healthy humans. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Zacny and de Wit (2009)</ref>, a battery of five impulsivity task was administered following three separate doses of oxycodone (5, 10 or 20 mg PO) compared to placebo (within-subject; n = 12). They did not find any significant effect on any of the tasks, including delay discounting, despite observing some typical subjective effects of the higher oxycodone doses. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Eikemo and colleagues (2017)</ref> found no credible effects of either 50 mg naltrexone or 10 mg morphine on impulsivity as measured by speed-accuracy trade-off in a probabilistic reward task.</p><p>Together, these results indicate that blocking the majority (&gt;90 %) of the µ-opioid receptors in the brain using 50 mg of naltrexone <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Weerts et al., 2013)</ref> does not cause a large reduction in measures of reward impulsivity in healthy humans. Further, although few studies have tested effects of opioid agonism, the preliminary evidence is consistent with no large increases in reward impulsivity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding task</head><p>The coding task (also known as the digit symbol substitution task; DSST) has been the most commonly used task to test the effects of opioid drugs on psychomotor performance. This task requires participants to substitute symbols and digits using a particular key. A speeded subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, it is aimed to measure functions related to "processing speed" <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Wechsler, 2014)</ref>. However, recent work has shown that the coding task does not asses basic psychomotor speed, but instead is sensitive to processes that are more associated with executive functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Knowles et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>One of the first studies investigating the effect of an opioid agonist (a low dose of codeine) reported context-specific effects depending on altitude (simulated in a high altitude chamber), such that codeine impaired coding performance in medical troops tested at 2000 feet altitude but improved performance when they performed this test 15000 feet elevation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Evans &amp; Witt, 1966)</ref>. However, few studies have followed up on the idea to test context-sensitive effects of opioids on cognition. Instead most studies have simply included DSST performance as part of a cognitive test battery in a standard psychopharmacological protocol with no systematic manipulation of context. The effects of various types of opioid agonists have been investigated in more than 30 studies and the majority of these studies have observed coding impairments, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Two studies have used opioid antagonists <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(File &amp; Silverstone, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Zacny, Coalson, Lichtor, Yajnik, &amp; Thapar, 1994)</ref>, which did not affect coding performance.</p><p>As <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> (left panel) shows, most performance impairments have been reported in studies using high doses of opioid agonists only, although some studies have observed performance decrements at medium doses (of hydrocodone, oxycodone and partial agonists). This suggests that the effect on opioid agonists on coding performance might be dose-related, although a clear link between plasma morphine concentrations and DSST impairments is currently lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Strand, Arnestad, Fjeld, &amp; Mørland, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Logical reasoning The effect of opioids agonists on logical reasoning was first reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Evans and Smith (1964)</ref> who observed that a low dose of morphine in a group of four participants compared to placebo in a group of four other participants improved performance on a test assessing logical judgements. Taking into account the very small sample size it not surprising that more recent studies have failed to replicate this effect, observing null-effects in the majority of cases (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). However, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> (right panel) some studies have observed significant impairments in logical reasoning using medium and high doses both with full opioid agonists and mixed agonists, suggesting that higher doses of opioids can modulate logical reasoning, although the effect is less frequent in comparison to the effects on the DSST. We are not aware of studies that have reported the effects of opioid antagonists on logical reasoning.</p><p>Working Memory</p><p>Mu opioid system review 7</p><p>Across a wide variety of dosages and drugs, most studies did not observe an effect of opioid agonists and antagonists on working memory (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). Three studies did observe effect on working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ghoneim, Mewaldt, &amp; Thatcher, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Martín del Campo, McMurray, Besser, &amp; Grossman, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Székely, Török, Karczag, Tolna, &amp; Till, 1986)</ref>. However, since these findings were in opposite directions and the studies used limited samples (8 or 10 males per study), it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about these results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematical skills</head><p>The handful of studies assessing effects of opioid agonist and antagonist on mathematical skills is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Smith, Semke, and Beecher (1962)</ref> reported that a high dose of morphine or heroin impaired several aspects of mathematical skills including the speed at which participants complete oral and written addition tasks. Two other studies on arithmetic used low or moderate agonist dosages and failed to observe effects of opioids <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Cleeland et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Kornetsky, Humphries, &amp; Evarts, 1957)</ref>. Similarly, using a moderate dose of oxycodone, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Cherrier, Amory, Ersek, Risler, &amp; Shen, 2009</ref>) also failed to observe an effect on alphabet and number sequencing. Blocking opioid receptors using naloxone also did not modulate arithmetic skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Martín del Campo et al., 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Planning and switching The effects of opioids on tasks focused on planning and flexible switching of behavior have not been assessed in many studies. An old study by <ref type="bibr">Primac and colleagues (1957)</ref> did not find an effect of a low dose of the opioid agonist Meperidine administered to 4 female and 6 male participants on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Likewise, Quednow and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Quednow, Csomor, Chmiel, Beck, &amp; Vollenweider, 2008</ref>) using a low dose of 10 mg PO morphine in 18 males did not observe effects on the Stockings of Cambridge tasks, nor on extradimensional set switching. However, their low dose of morphine did reduce the error rate on intradimensional set shifts, suggesting that low doses of opioids might help to improve the application of a task rule within the same perceptual dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention</head><p>In a seminal study, based on their prior work in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnsten et al., 1981)</ref>, Arnsten and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnsten et al., 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arnsten et al., , 1984</ref> have tested whether blocking endogenous opioid activity might improve the selectivity of attention. Using a small dose (2 mg IV) of naloxone in an EEG study of 10 male participants, they indeed observed that naloxone increased a late frontal event-related potential component which is thought to reflect attention to auditory stimuli, in the absence of a modulation of overall processing capacity or global arousal levels. The authors proposed that this effect might be due to interactions with the locus-coeruleus-norepinephrine system, such that opioid blockade might facilitate norepinephrine transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnsten et al., 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, a more recent study testing 4 females and 9 males using a higher dose of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (50 mg PO) to block &gt; 90% of mu-opioid receptors failed to replicate this effect and observed an effect in opposite direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Jääskeläinen et al., 1998)</ref>. These authors suggested that the observed impairment in their study might be due to nausea induced by naltrexone in their participants. Interestingly, opposite responses to physical pain were also reported in a study employing both mu-opioid blockade (comparable to the dose in Jääskeläinen et al.) and a much smaller dose comparable to that employed by Arnsten et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Levine, Gordon, &amp; Fields, 1979)</ref>. Other studies using high doses of opioid agonists and reporting behavioral effects only have failed to observe clear impairments in divided attention tasks (Saarialho-Kere, <ref type="table">Mu opioid system review   8</ref> 1988; Saarialho-Kere, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Mattila, &amp; Seppälä, 1989</ref>; for procedural details of these studies see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref>). A recent study showed that a low dose of infused remifentanil (n = 14, within-subjects) impaired attention in a letter detection task when participants expected that the drug would be administered, but not when they did not expect the drug <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atlas, Wielgosz, Whittington, &amp; Wager, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The modulation of the startle reflex to a noise burst following a prestimulus, a phenomenon called prepulse inhibition, has been shown to be enhanced by a low dose of 10 mg PO morphine in 18 males <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Quednow et al., 2008)</ref>. This suggests that the ability to regulate sensory input by filtering out irrelevant stimuli (in order to prevent sensory overflow) can also be enhanced by opioid agonists. At first sight, these findings seem difficult to reconcile with the findings reported by Arnsten and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnsten et al., 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arnsten et al., , 1984</ref>. As we will discuss more detail later, one possibility is that the task by <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Quednow et al. (2008)</ref> involved increased levels of distress because of the loud auditory noise involved in the task. Opioids might help to downregulate stress responses under such conditions, perhaps improving sensorimotor gating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibition and effort</head><p>The effects of blocking opioid receptors on response inhibition as assessed by the Stroop task has been investigated by Marin del <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Campo et al. (1992)</ref> and more recently in a Stroop-like prime-probe task by van Steenbergen et al. <ref type="formula">2017</ref>. The first study used a cumulative infusion of naloxone in 8 males and the other administered 50 mg naltrexone PO versus placebo in two groups of 26 female participants. Both studies revealed that overall Stroop performance was not affected by the pharmacological manipulation. Likewise, no significant effects were reported by the earlier described study by Zacny and de Wit on impulsivity investigated the effect of 5, 10 and 20 mg of PO oxycodone in 6 females and 6 males participants on stop-signal performance and go/no-go performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Zacny &amp; de Wit, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The study by van Steenbergen and colleagues also analyzed post-error and post-conflict adjustments in behavioral performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(van Steenbergen et al., 2017)</ref>, which is thought to reflect adaptive increases in cognitive control triggered by aversive arousal integral to the task at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dreisbach &amp; Fischer, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Inzlicht, Bartholow, &amp; Hirsh, 2015;</ref>. Naltrexone was observed to increase reaction time slowing after participants made an error. This finding suggests that the aversive arousal associated with conflict and errors can be increased when endogenous opioid activity is blocked, which in turns increases adaptive cognitive control.</p><p>Two studies have investigated the effect of the opioid system on perceived task difficulty and required effort. <ref type="bibr">Grossman and colleagues (1984)</ref> reported a study that tested the effect of a medium dose of naloxone (12.2 mg IV) in 6 male participants performing a physical exercise task. This opioid antagonist increased the perceived difficulty of the task, possibly reflecting increased stress induced by the drug. Interestingly, a more recent study has observed that the opioid agonist oxycodone (10 mg PO) administered to 18 participants did not affect driving performance, whereas they did report increases in required effort while performing the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Verster, Veldhuijzen, &amp; Volkerts, 2006)</ref>. This finding points to the possibility that compensatory effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Hockey, 1997)</ref>  Considering all reviewed evidence together, one striking observation is the abundance of pharmacological studies observing null effects. This is true in particular for the delaydiscounting tasks, working memory task and overall measures of planning, switching and inhibition. However, the majority of these studies have used only small to moderate sample sizes which usually are only adequately powered to observe medium to high effect sizes. Considering that typical effects sizes in the field of psychology and affective neuroscience are small to moderate <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Lakens &amp; Evers, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Poldrack et al., 2017)</ref>, the majority of the published studies were underpowered to detect such effects. This makes it hard to draw firm conclusions with regard to these null effects, in particular if the study used low or moderate doses of opioid agonists only. On the other hand, relatively clear patterns have been observed for value-based learning and decision-making tasks, the DSST and the logical reasoning task. We will elaborate on these results below and highlight potential neural mechanisms.</p><p>Studies of reward and reward-based decision-making tasks show that opioid antagonism reduces choices for high-value options while agonism has the opposite effect (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>). This effect is in line with studies on primary reward processing. A large literature has demonstrated that opioid antagonism reduces food pleasantness and consumption in both animals and humans, especially for high-calorie foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Drewnowski, Krahn, Demitrack, Nairn, &amp; Gosnell, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Eikemo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Yeomans, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Yeomans &amp; Gray, 2002)</ref>. In contrast, opioid antagonism has been shown to enhance or maintain responses in aversive learning tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Eippert, Bingel, Schoell, Yacubian, &amp; Büchel, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Haaker, Yi, Petrovic, &amp; Olsson, 2017)</ref>. Very recently, studies have shown that social reward processes are similarly modulated by opioids. Indeed, opioid agonism increased and antagonism decreased the perceived attractiveness and motivation to view faces of beautiful women <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Chelnokova et al., 2014)</ref>, visual exploration of faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chelnokova et al., 2016)</ref> and altered perception of faces with emotional expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bershad, Seiden, &amp; de Wit, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Loseth et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Syal et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Wardle, Bershad, &amp; de Wit, 2016)</ref>. Overall, these findings are in line with the notion that mu-opioid receptor stimulation by endogenous and exogenous opioid peptides cause a shift in valuation along a 'hedonic gradient' ranging from displeasure to pleasure. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, we maintain that the increase in subjective value of rewarding stimuli underlies the observed changes in decision making. Studies in both rodents and humans indicate that these effects may be most pronounced for highly salient stimuli such as high-value rewards <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3</ref>). This shift is not limited to the "liking" of stimuli. Learning and motivation typically increase with increased valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Berridge, Robinson, &amp; Aldridge, 2009)</ref>. Microstimulation using opioid peptides has also been shown to directly increase motivation for rewards in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Mahler &amp; Berridge, 2012)</ref>. Consistent with these findings, the available evidence from studies in humans also support an opioid-induced shift in reward learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Efremidze et al., 2017)</ref> and motivation, e.g. effort invested to obtain reward (wanting) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Chelnokova et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Eikemo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Petrovic et al., 2008)</ref>. Considering the high density of mu-opioid receptors in the brain circuits involved in decision making and cognitive control (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), the opioid system can exert direct modulatory effects on these processes. Nevertheless, the networks and processes underlying the opioid mediation of these reward processes are not yet well understood in humans, although the available evidence from human imaging indicate a high degree of agreement with results from rodent studies. In rodents, wanting, liking and reward learning can be modulated by manipulations of opioid receptors in the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum and the central nucleus and basolateral parts of the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Berridge &amp; Kringelbach, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Wassum, Cely, Balleine, &amp; Maidment, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Wassum, Cely, Maidment, &amp; Balleine, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Wassum, Ostlund, Maidment, &amp; Balleine, 2009)</ref>. Recently, 'hedonic hot-and coldspots' involved in facial 'liking' responses were also identified in the rat insula and prefrontal cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Castro &amp; Berridge, 2017)</ref>. Studies using PET imaging and pharmacological MRI in humans suggest that opioids may indeed exert their effects on reward-related behavior through receptors in the OFC, amygdala, thalamus, insular cortices, ventral and dorsal striatum and cingulate cortices <ref type="bibr">(Hsu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Love, Stohler, &amp; Zubieta, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">E. Murray et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Nummenmaa et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Petrovic et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Rabiner et al., 2011)</ref>. A large meta-analysis of fMRI activation associated with subjective value processes showed that the striatum and ventro-medial prefrontal areas (including the OFC) are key to the valuation process, while a different network comprised of the anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and posterior striatum, and thalamus may be recruited in response to arousal or salience during valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bartra, McGuire, &amp; Kable, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>With respect to the cognitive control domain, studies showed the most consistent effects for the DSST. This is also the task that has been most frequently included in opioid drug studies as the primary measure of psychomotor skills. At moderate and high opioid drug doses, clear impairments on performance have been observed in many studies using this task (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>. Performance on the DSST is assumed to require a delicate coordination of many different control processes, including working memory updating, switching and inhibition. This might have rendered the DSST, and to a lesser extent logical reasoning, the most sensitive measures of cognitive control impairments. Other tasks in the cognitive domain, which are typically constructed to tap into a single subtype of control processes, were not associated with strong effects of opioids drugs. Combined, these results suggest that the effects of opioid drugs will be particularly strong when tasks require the orchestration of multiple cognitive control functions represented by different regions in fronto-parietal brain circuits.</p><p>However, it is important to realize that there is also some evidence for improved rather than impaired performance after administrating an opioid agonist relative to placebo. This was for example observed for logical reasoning and DSST performance in early studies by Evans and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Evans &amp; Smith, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Evans &amp; Witt, 1966)</ref> as well in more recent work on intradimensional set shifting and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Quednow et al., 2008)</ref>. These studies have in common that they used low doses of morphine (or codeine). One possible explanation for these findings might be that low doses of opioid might reduce the aversive arousal (a.k.a. tense arousal, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Thayer, 1989)</ref> or stress associated with a task. If the relationship between aversive arousal and cognitive control follows an inverted U-shape, as previous work has suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(van Steenbergen, Band, &amp; Hommel, 2015)</ref>, low doses of opioid drugs might compensate for arousalinduced impairment that occurs in the placebo condition (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4)</ref>. Opioids indeed tend to reduce arousal. For example, in humans and some other species opioid drugs reduce pupil size (miosis), which might be related to autonomic nervous system modulations, although the exact mechanisms of action are not known and species-specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Lee &amp; Wang, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">R. B. Murray, Adler, &amp; Korczyn, 1983)</ref>. In addition, opioid antagonism increases cortisol responses, and this is thought to reflect blockade of a tonic endogenous opioid inhibition of cortisol in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Lovallo et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The view that a low opioid drug dose could enhance cognitive performance by reducing aversive arousal also dovetails with recent rodent work on stress-alleviating properties of opioids <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Valentino &amp; Van Bockstaele, 2015)</ref>. At the same time, endogenous opioid brain activation in response to stress might help to prevent otherwise profound stress-induced impairments (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Shields et al., 2016)</ref>, as indeed suggested in some human <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bandura, Cioffi, Taylor, &amp; Brouillard, 1988</ref>) and animal studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Laredo et al., 2015)</ref>. Our view also fits prior work showing that cognitive control tasks elicit affective responses (i.e., integral emotions; Inzlicht et al., 2015) that might drive (mal)adaptive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Botvinick, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">e.g. van Steenbergen, Band, &amp; Hommel, 2009)</ref>, and which are likely under opioid regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(van Steenbergen et al., 2017)</ref>. Another possibility to consider is that cognitive improvements after low doses of opioids are caused by increases in appetitive motivation. Such effects are particularly likely when the task itself involves external rewards (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Eikemo et al., 2017)</ref>, or when performance on tasks is perceived to reflect intelligence or capability. In addition, tasks perceived to be of high relevance might also generate internal 'pseudo-rewards' <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Holroyd &amp; Yeung, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Ribas-Fernandes et al., 2011)</ref>, in particular when effort is intrinsically valuable <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Inzlicht, Shenhav, &amp; Olivola, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Given these considerations, it is plausible that cognitive control, just like decisionmaking, is modulated by opioids via brain networks involved in valuation and saliency, shifting the cost-benefit trade-off that determines allocation of cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Shenhav, Botvinick, &amp; Cohen, 2013)</ref>. In addition, prefrontal networks involved in maintaining task-goal representations can be modulated directly via binding to its opioid receptors. In line with this suggestion, a recent PET study observed that high mu-opioid signaling (lower binding potential) in a ventral region of the lateral PFC was positively related to performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test in a group of depressive patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Light, Bieliauskas, &amp; Zubieta, 2017)</ref>. A possible mechanism at a neuronal level could be that stimulation of mu-opioid receptors suppresses interneuron spiking and increases glutamate-coded output of prefrontal neurons at multiple projection targets, which in turn might engender disorganized control and decision processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baldo, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directions for future research</head><p>The previous section provided some initial insights into the role of the mu-opioid system in higher-level cognitive function. Yet, numerous issues require future investigation. One unresolved challenge is that opioids might reduce cortical signaling without directly affecting performance in cognitive tasks because participants use strategies to compensate for these deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Hockey, 1997)</ref>. Future studies might include physiological measures, such as cardiovascular measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gendolla, Wright, &amp; Richter, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kuipers et al., 2017)</ref> and taskevoked pupil dilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kahneman, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">van der Wel &amp; van Steenbergen, 2018)</ref> to investigate such compensatory mechanisms. In addition, behavioral impairments in control tasks might reflect shifts in motivation instead of reflecting a cognitive incapability <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kurzban, Duckworth, Kable, &amp; Myers, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Shenhav et al., 2017</ref>). As we have alluded to earlier, cognitive control shares many processes and brain circuits that are also important for value-based decision making and future studies are warranted to understand the role of opioids in these processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Berkman, Hutcherson, Livingston, Kahn, &amp; Inzlicht, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Although opioid drugs do not typically produce strong subjective effects at low doses <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Hanks, O'Neill, Simpson, &amp; Wesnes, 1995)</ref>, changes in self-reported mood and arousal are typically reported in many of the studies reviewed earlier, most consistently at higher doses. Interestingly, mood inductions appear to modulate endogenous opioid neurotransmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Koepp et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Prossin et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Zubieta et al., 2003)</ref>. One important avenue for future research is to understand the role of mood changes in altered cognitive function. For example, studies might investigate whether endogenous variation or drug-induced changes in subjective state correlate with behavioral outcomes, as some recent work has started to do <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Light et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weber et al., 2016)</ref>. Studies investigating the effect of hedonic states on cognitive control and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Dreisbach &amp; Goschke, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Isen &amp; Means, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">van Steenbergen, Band, &amp; Hommel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Steenbergen, Band, Hommel, Rombouts, &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2015)</ref> could use antagonist drugs to block the opioid system to determine the role of endogenous mu-opioid neurotransmission in these effects. On a related note, more broadly defined control processes such as mental flexibility and creativity have often been related to positive affective states <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ashby, Isen, &amp; Turken, 1999)</ref> and it is interesting to study the role of the opioid system in these processes as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Streufert &amp; Gengo, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Zacny, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Opioid administration at higher doses can also produce other subjective effects that may influence task performance, such as nausea, difficulty concentrating or sedation <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Zacny &amp; de Wit, 2009)</ref>. Aversive side-effects could counteract a positive hedonic shift induced by opioid agonists, or inflate the negative shift induced by opioid antagonism. Drowsiness and feeling spaced out from large opioid drug doses could of course also directly impact performance on cognitive as well as value-based tasks. Such confounds can be avoided by employing smaller drug doses (counteracting any loss in statistical power e.g. by increasing sample sizes), or by employing active placebo treatments to ensure that drug conditions are matched on relevant side effects. Whether interoceptive changes related to drug effects also contribute to the observed modulation of decision making and cognitive control remains to be seen. Anecdotal evidence suggests that opioids can induce pain asymbolia, i.e. intact detection of pain but without the affective-motivational component <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Berthier, Starkstein, &amp; Leiguarda, 1988)</ref>. Future studies might therefore implement measures of motivation/detachment to measure the effects of opioid drugs on engagement with cognitive and decision-making tasks.</p><p>Another unresolved question is whether opioid drug modulation would induce a shift in liking and appetitive motivation towards high-value rewards when presented in the context of pain or possible economic loss. It is possible that mu-opioid stimulation causes a shift primarily of aversive stimuli but not rewards in these cases, probably because aversive stimuli are more salient <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Kahenman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. Studies of opioid drug effects on both facial expressions provide some initial evidence in this direction, with opioid drug effects observed for negative affective stimuli only <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ipser et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Loseth et al., 2018)</ref>. Also, two studies have reported decreased pleasantness of opioid drug effects during physical pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Conley, Toledano, Apfelbaum, &amp; Zacny, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Zacny, McKay, et al., 1996)</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Comer, Sullivan, Vosburg, Kowalczyk, &amp; Houser, 2010)</ref>, which is consistent with a preferential effect of opioid drugs on aversive processing in contexts with potential for both positive and negative affective responses. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Petrovic et al. (2008)</ref> did report opioid blockade effects on responses to both wins and losses in a monetary gambling task. Well-powered studies including both rewarding and aversive outcomes are needed to resolve these inconsistencies. In addition, opioid effects on value-based decision making tasks should also be addressed during ongoing pain states <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Gandhi, Becker, &amp; Schweinhardt, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Although opioid drugs can exert direct effects on mu-opioid receptors expressed in the important hubs of the neural decision-making and cognitive-control networks <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), they can also act indirectly via other neurotransmitters. For example, the canonical disinhibition model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Johnson and North (S. W. Johnson &amp; North, 1992)</ref> proposed that opioid drugs induce reward via increased dopamine signaling due to opioid inhibition of GABA interneurons in the ventral tegmental area. More recent work has shown that we are only at an early stage of understanding the exact role of dopamine signaling for opioid drug effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Badiani, Belin, Epstein, Calu, &amp; Shaham, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Nutt, Lingford-Hughes, Erritzoe, &amp; Stokes, 2015)</ref>. For instance, mu-opioid receptor activation can have a net excitatory or net inhibitory effect on VTA neurons depending on a variety of pre-and postsynaptic mechanisms <ref type="bibr">(Fields &amp; Margolis, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, work in rodents has shown that mu-opioids and dopamine play functionally different roles in the hedonic and motivational properties of reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Berridge, 2007)</ref>. Moreover, dopamine modulates cognition via different receptors types and pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Bromberg-Martin, Matsumoto, &amp; Hikosaka, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Cools, 2015)</ref>, making direct comparisons difficult. Together, this evidence renders it unlikely that effects of opioid drugs can simply be explained in terms of dopaminergic modulation alone. The mu-opioid system also interacts with other neurotransmitters systems. For example, interactions between opioids and the locus-coeruleusnorepinephrine system are well-documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnsten et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Chaijale et al., 2013)</ref>, and futures studies might investigate whether opioid drugs modulate cognitive processing via norepinephrine. There is also evidence that the endocannabinoid system interacts with opioid mechanisms that support reward (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Rowland, Mukherjee, &amp; Robertson, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Solinas &amp; Goldberg, 2005)</ref> Although the focus of the present review was on acute effects of opioids in healthy participants, there is increasing evidence that the opioid system also plays a central role in psychopathology. For example, chronic opioid antagonist administration in different patient groups may increase cognitive control and decrease the value of reinforcers in different patient groups, and there is some evidence for dysregulation of MOR function across addictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Ghitza et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Mick et al., 2016)</ref>. While chronic opioid misuse has been associated with maladaptive decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Giordano et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Landes, Christensen, &amp; Bickel, 2012)</ref>, opioid antagonism may reduce drug craving and drug consuption in individuals with substance use disorder (B. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Johnson, 2006)</ref>, and the efficacy of opioidergic drugs for addiction treatment may be modulated by opioid gene polymorphisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bauer Isabelle, Soares Jair, &amp; Nielsen David, 2015)</ref>. Interestingly, in addition to reducing craving and relapse in addiction, opioid blockade may also reduce impulsive behaviors in kleptomania, pathological gambling and "sex addiction" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bostwick &amp; Bucci, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Grant, Kim, &amp; Odlaug, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">B.

The gray line plots a typical value function for reward and punishment according to prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Kahenman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. Opioid drugs might modulate decision making by shifting this value function, such that opioid agonists increase (white line) and opioid antagonists decrease (black line) subjective value.  . U-shaped relationship between aversive arousal and cognitive control. Opioids agonist might reduce aversive arousal (white) whereas opioid antagonist might increase it (black). Drug effects depend on the baseline level of aversive arousal, such that an opioid agonist might improve performance in high stress contexts, yet impair performance under low stress.</p></div>
