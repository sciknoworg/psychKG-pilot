			<abstract>
				<p>The gaze cueing effect is the tendency for people to respond faster to targets appearing at locations gazed at by others compared to locations gazed away from by others. The effect is robust, widely studied, and is an influential finding within social cognition. Formal evidence accumulation models provide the dominant theoretical account of the cognitive processes underlying speeded decision making, but they have rarely been applied to social cognition research. In this study, using a combination of individual-level and hierarchical computational modelling techniques, we applied evidence accumulation models to gaze cueing data (three data sets total, N = 171, 139,001 trials) for the first time to assess the relative capacity that an attentional orienting mechanism and information processing mechanisms have for explaining the gaze cueing effect. We found that most participants were best described by the attentional orienting mechanism, such that response times were slower at gazed away from locations because they had to reorient to the target before they could process the cue. However, we found evidence for individual differences, whereby the models suggested that some gaze cueing effects were driven by a short allocation of information processing resources to the gazed at location, allowing for a brief period where orienting and processing could occur in parallel. There was exceptionally little evidence to suggest any sustained reallocation of information processing resources neither at the group nor individual level. We discuss how this individual variability might represent credible individual differences in the cognitive mechanisms that subserve behaviourally observed gaze-cueing effects.</p>

This tendency is referred to as the gaze cueing effect (as initially demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Driver et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Friesen &amp; Kingstone, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The gaze cueing effect is a particularly interesting phenomenon because following the direction of other people's gaze is considered to be critical in the development of human social cognition (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Argyle &amp; Cook, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baron-Cohen &amp; Belmonte, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Emery, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kleinke, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Renfrew et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stephenson et al., 2021, for theoretical reviews)</ref>.</p><p>This interest has been reflected in the published literature, with the gaze cueing effect being studied widely and across a range of contexts. A recent meta-analysis of more than 400 gaze cueing effects found that it is remarkably robust, emerging irrespective of a number of task-and cue-feature parameters in healthy adults (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">McKay et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, despite the gaze cueing effect being studied extensively, there is still little known about the specific cognitive mechanisms involved in or necessary for its emergence.</p><p>One way in which the nature of these faster response times at gaze cued rather than gaze miscued locations can be better understood is through mathematical 'process models' also referred to as 'computational models' of human cognition. These models are a causal theoretical explanation for how a cognitive phenomenon, like decision-making, occurs, rather than simply a mathematical summary of a functional form, such as curve fitting.</p><p>Computational models attempt to describe mechanisms underlying cognitive processes by constructing mathematically defined theoretical predictions with clearly identified assumptions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Lewandowsky &amp; Farrell, 2011)</ref>. These models can then be applied to empirical datasets in order to test and compare the efficacy of these predictions and the THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 5 utility of different models' assumptions for explaining the given behaviour. Thus, these computational models hold many advantages over traditional statistical analyses of observable behavioural data alone because these models directly map on to theories of cognitive processes and their predictions can be directly assessed against observed data (for more detail on the advantages of a computational modelling approach, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Guest &amp; Martin, 2021)</ref>. These features of computational models are also useful for discerning whether two ostensibly equivalent patterns of empirical data can be understood in terms of a common psychological mechanism, or whether they require different explanations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Imhoff et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Evidence accumulation models are a class of computational models that jointly address response time and accuracy data to infer several cognitive mechanisms underlying a decision, and have become the dominant theoretical framework for describing speeded decisions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Evans &amp; Wagenmakers, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ratcliff et al., 2016, for reviews)</ref>. However, although the gaze cueing effect arises from data derived from a speeded decision task, it is still unclear how evidence accumulation mechanisms contribute to the emergence of the gaze cueing effect, despite recent calls for their wider use in social cognition research <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Parker &amp; Ramsey, 2022b)</ref>. Indeed, there has only been one other study that has attempted to model the gaze cueing effect using an evidence accumulation framework, and that study only tested one potential underlying mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Parker &amp; Ramsey, 2022a)</ref>.</p><p>In this study then, we investigated multiple possible mechanisms driving the gaze cueing effect by adapting an established and commonly used evidence accumulation model of decision-making, the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Stone, 1960)</ref>, and fitting these adaptations to pre-existing data from several gaze cueing studies. In the following sections, we summarise the current understanding of the gaze cueing effect and show how this understanding could be strengthened by investigating the gaze cueing effect within a computational modelling framework. We then describe evidence accumulation models, summarising their impact THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 6 within cognitive psychology, their properties, and how they may apply to the emergence of the gaze cueing effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Gaze Cueing Effect</head><p>The gaze cueing effect has been studied broadly and has implications for a variety of theoretical frameworks (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Stephenson et al., 2021)</ref> and clinical applications (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Catalano et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">de Araújo et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Langdon et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Magnée et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Senju et al., 2003)</ref>. Empirically, the gaze cueing effect has been demonstrated using the gaze cueing paradigm (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Driver et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Friesen &amp; Kingstone, 1998</ref>, for seminal studies). In this paradigm, participants are presented with a face with averted eyes in the centre of the screen and then a target to be responded to at the peripheral left or right (e.g., the sudden onset of an asterisk; as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Gregory and Jackson, 2020)</ref>. On cued trials, the target appears at the gazed-at location -that is, the side of the screen that the central faces averted gaze is oriented towards. On miscued trials, the target appears at the gazed-away from location -that is, the side of the screen that the central faces averted gaze is oriented away from. The gaze cueing effect describes the typical finding that faster mean response times arise for cued versus miscued trials.</p><p>The gaze cueing effect is commonly characterised as a covert, stimulus-driven, reflexive shift of attention towards the gazed at location via the eye gaze cue. To borrow <ref type="bibr">Posner et al.'s (1980)</ref> terminology, this characterisation reflects the attentional orienting capacity of eye gaze. The initial orienting of attention, in turn, enables more detailed processing of stimuli that fall within its focus. Behaviourally, the gaze cueing effect emerges even when the cue is presented after a very brief cue-target stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Friesen and Kingstone, 1998)</ref>. The effect has been observed when the cue is presented very briefly and then masked ( e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Sato et al., 2007)</ref>, when cues are non-predictive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Galfano et al., 2012)</ref>, counter predictive <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Kuhn &amp; Kingstone, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Tipples, 2008)</ref>, and even when participants are explicitly told to ignore the cue (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Gregory &amp; Jackson, 2020)</ref>. Taken together, this suggests that the effect is rapidly, THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 7 unconsciously, and involuntarily produced. Supporting this, neural evidence has suggested that the gaze cueing effect emerges very early in the attentional processing hierarchy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Hietanen et al., 2008)</ref>, activating brain regions associated with pre-conscious, exogenous attention shifts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Joseph et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to its attentional orienting properties eye gaze has also been found to influence subsequent information processing. For example, infants tend to process stimuli more efficiently when they are looked at by others, and have better memory for gazed-at targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Reid &amp; Striano, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Reid et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Wahl et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wahl et al., 2013)</ref>, which is consistent with broader theories of joint attention suggesting people allocate more information processing resources to locations that they are aware another person is looking at <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Shteynberg, 2015)</ref>. Additionally the reverse is also true. Elements in the environment typically characterised as requiring more information processing, including various aspects of person perception and the relationship between the observer and the gazing person, influence the magnitude of gaze cueing effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dalmaso et al., 2020)</ref>. A recent study applying evidence accumulation models also suggested that the response time boost to gazed at locations could be a result of more efficient information processing at the gazed-at location <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Parker &amp; Ramsey, 2022a)</ref>, however they only considered an information processing mechanism, so could not distinguish between other mechanisms (such as an attentional orienting mechanism) that could potentially be driving the effect. Moreover, despite these studies describing how information processing may be affected by gaze cues, the precise nature of these theorised shifts in information processing efficiency to gazed at locations has not previously been defined. Particularly, whether eye gaze results in a sustained boost in information processing to the gazed at location or whether it is only an initial information processing boost that dissipates or is re-distributed across the visual field over time.</p><p>In this section we have outlined different ways that the emergence of the gaze cueing effect has been described in the literature. According to some accounts, gaze cues serve to THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 8 automatically orient attention to stimuli, speeding the onset of early encoding processes.</p><p>Other accounts place less emphasis on gaze cues altering the time course of stimulus processing, instead focusing on enhanced processing of encoded information. These competing perspectives align with the different classes of processing mechanisms that have also been discussed in the wider visual attention literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Sewell and Smith (2012)</ref> considered the distinction between gain (or resource allocation) and orienting models of attention. Resource allocation models conceive of attention as a mechanism for distributing a limited capacity of processing resources among stimuli in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kahneman, 1973)</ref>. According to these models, the spatiotemporal distribution of processing resources determines the efficiency of stimulus processing, such that processing of attended stimuli is enhanced relative to unattended stimuli, resulting in more robust and higher quality stimulus representations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Sperling &amp; Weichselgartner, 1995)</ref>. By contrast, orienting models view attention as a mechanism for selecting stimuli for subsequent processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Broadbent, 1958)</ref>. According to these models, attention must first be oriented to the stimulus before processing can begin, an idea perhaps most influentially expressed by <ref type="bibr">Posner et al.'s (1980)</ref> spotlight metaphor for attention. In orienting models, attention primarily controls the time course of processing, resulting in more rapid encoding of attended versus unattended stimuli.</p><p>To date, there has not yet been a model based attempt to distinguish between resource allocation and orienting accounts of the gaze cueing effect, or alternatively, to quantify the relative contributions of resource allocation and orienting mechanisms to producing the gaze cueing effect. One approach to this issue is to use evidence accumulation models to decompose the gaze cueing effect into processing components that map onto attention orienting mechanisms that control the time course of processing and resource allocation mechanisms that control the quality of stimulus encoding. In the next section, we elaborate on these different mechanisms described by evidence accumulation models, and propose how these mechanisms could be driving the gaze cueing effect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence Accumulation Models of Two-Choice Decision-Making</head><p>Evidence accumulation models, also known as sequential sampling models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Donkin &amp; Brown, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Evans &amp; Wagenmakers, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Forstmann et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ratcliff et al., 2016, for reviews)</ref>, are a well-established class of computational models that provide a widely used, robust theoretical framework from which the cognitive processes underlying speeded decisions can be inferred. According to these models, decision-making is described as the accrual of evidence for (or drift towards) different choices over time at some rate (referred to as the "drift rate") from some starting point to some decision-triggering threshold. Once that threshold is reached, a response is initiated (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for a visual depiction).</p><p>Evidence accumulation models have been used to model decisions across a range of contexts, tasks, and paradigms, and have strengthened our theoretical understanding within a variety of cognitive fields such as memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ratcliff et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>, attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hawkins et al., 2019)</ref>, perception (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2012)</ref>, decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2007)</ref>, intelligence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Lerche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2011)</ref>, performance optimality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2012)</ref>, emotion processing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Lerche et al., 2021)</ref>, and alcohol consumption <ref type="bibr">(e.g., van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2012)</ref>. Additionally, the processes described in these models map onto neural activity observed during decision-making tasks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brosnan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Liu &amp; Pleskac, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">van Maanen et al., 2021)</ref>, acting as convincing convergent evidence supporting the theoretical assumptions of these models and their explanations of decision-making processes. Given that these models provide the dominant theoretical account of decision-making to date, it is important that we understand the gaze cueing effect through the lens of formal evidence accumulation theories of decision-making.</p><p>Using the DDM evidence accumulation model specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998)</ref>, in this study we consider three potential components that could plausibly subserve gaze THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 10</p></div>

Specifically, it shows noisy evidence accumulation (v) from some starting point (z), until the decision threshold for one of two choices is reached. In the context of the localisation gaze cueing paradigms used in the current study, the two choices could be either the left-sided decision (a lef t ) or right-sided decision (a right ). t0 refers to the components unrelated to accumulation over the decision such as perceptual encoding and motor response.</p><p>cueing effects: starting point (z), drift rate (v), and/or non-decision time (t0). Each of these three components assumed to be an index of a specific psychological construct that is directly estimated in evidence accumulation models. We describe how each of these components map onto psychological constructs in detail in the following paragraphs and we direct the reader to <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for a visual representation of each of the model components.</p><p>The time course of processes not related to decision-making (i.e., those not involved THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 11 in the evidence accumulation process) is summarised by the non-decision time parameter.</p><p>Non-decision time encompasses the necessary early, preconscious perceptual encoding of the cue as well as the post-decision motor responses required to behaviourally indicate the decision. In cueing paradigms, we interpret this parameter as being sensitive to attention orienting effects for cued versus miscued trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Sewell &amp; Smith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2009)</ref>, and recognise it is indexing the time course of attentional selection more generally 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Lilburn &amp; Smith, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Sewell et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Shepherdson, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Smith et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, a reflexive orienting of attention to the gazed-at location results in the target being processed later in miscued trials compared to cued trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Sewell &amp; Smith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2009)</ref>. The delayed onset of stimulus processing (and therefore decision-making) is naturally reflected in the non-decision time parameter.</p><p>As such, a non-decision time interpretation of gaze cueing describes the gaze cueing effect to be caused by orienting costs that are separate from the processing of encoded information. An alternative explanation is that response time differences to cued and miscued targets are driven by increased allocation of information processing resources to the cued location, consistent with resource allocation theories of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kahneman, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Sperling &amp; Weichselgartner, 1995)</ref>. These information processing mechanisms can be represented by two parameters in the DDM: starting point and drift rate. Typically, the starting point parameter reflects a priori decision-making biases, where the participant is biased towards a particular response alternative before the onset of a specific decision. In gaze cueing tasks with an equal number of cued and miscued trials (i.e., non-predictive tasks, which is what we use in the current study), this typical characterisation of starting point as a response bias is not particularly plausible given that there is no reason for a 1 Though non-decision time can also represent post-decision motor response, in gaze cueing paradigms we suggest that the most plausible explanation for the cueing paradigms used in this study is that non-decision time would represent attentional selection, which is supported by research showing that gaze cues do not induce automatic motor-response activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Vainio et al., 2014)</ref>. THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 12 participant to think that the cue is actually predictive of the target location. A more plausible interpretation of starting point in in these contexts involves the presence of more complex processing dynamics than the standard model assumes. If the effect of the cue is to shift a very brief burst of information processing resources to the cued location as the system configures to a regular mode of stimulus processing, the standard model would characterise the evidence accumulated during this initial burst as a shift in the start-point of regular evidence accumulation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Weigard et al., 2019)</ref> 2 . For an unbiased decision, or one with no initial information processing benefit, the starting point of evidence accumulation is situated exactly in the middle of the two response boundaries (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). If a person has a an initial information processing boost, the starting point of evidence accumulation would be shifted toward the cued response boundary. This means less evidence will be required to trigger the cued response, resulting in faster response times and a greater number of responses relative to the non-favoured response alternative.</p><p>Importantly, any influence of starting point will exert the same effect regardless of whether the eventual target was cued or miscued, as these processes would be occurring after the appearance of the cue but before the appearance of the target. In terms of the specifications of the model parameters themselves, a key difference between non-decision time and starting point is that starting point is a function of both response time and accuracy whereas non-decision time is only a function of response time.</p><p>The other parameter that maps onto resource allocation theories of attention in the DDM is drift rate. Drift rate corresponds to the overall quality of evidence driving the evidence accumulation process. Or in other words, the rate of evidence accumulation from 2 Note that a more accurate representation of these more complex processing dynamics would be a two-phase piecewise model, where the first phase involves a substantially higher drift rate that is based on the cueing information, and the second phase involves regular processing of the target (e.g., similar to the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Hübner et al., 2010)</ref>. However, due to the computational difficulties associated with piecewise models <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Evans, Trueblood, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Holmes et al., 2016)</ref>, we restrict our modelling assessments to the standard diffusion model framework. THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 13 the initial appearance of the target until the decision threshold is reached, with higher drift indicating higher-quality stimulus information and more efficient information processing (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Voss et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">White &amp; Poldrack, 2014)</ref>. Importantly, whereas starting point in non-predictive gaze cueing contexts represents an initial boost in information processing to the cued location that dissipates over time, drift rate represents a sustained boost in information processing from cue presentation until the response. According to a drift rate account of gaze cueing, information processing resources are preferentially allocated to the cued location, meaning that stimulus information that appears at the cued location (e.g., the target on cued trials) is processed more efficiently compared to stimulus information appearing at the miscued location, resulting in a more robust representation of the stimulus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Sewell &amp; Smith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2009</ref>, consistent with resource allocation models of attention). The only other study to investigate the gaze cueing effect using evidence accumulation models suggested that drift rate underlies response time differences between cued and miscued trials. However, their modelling approach did not allow them to assess the influence of starting point and non-decision time, meaning that their results could just be due to the fact that that they did not test any alternative mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Parker &amp; Ramsey, 2022a)</ref>. In relation to resource allocation theories of attention, drift rate and starting point vary in the way that that information processing resources are allocated across the duration of the trial. While both drift rate and starting point predict a boost of information processing to the cued location, starting point predicts that this boost only happens initially, after which these resources are gradually redistributed across the visual field.</p><p>This capacity for evidence accumulation models to differentiate between underlying cognitive mechanisms is what makes them valuable for understanding gaze cueing effects.</p><p>Another advantage of these models is that they can make these inferences at the level of individual participants which is helpful because much of gaze cueing research has focused on identifying differences in the magnitude of gaze-cueing between different populations, THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 14 such as younger versus older people (e.g., for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">McKay et al., 2022)</ref> or autistic people versus control groups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Sato et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Senju et al., 2003</ref>), yet these studies predominantly assess for mean group level differences rather than differences across individuals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Sets</head><p>We were able to access the raw data of three studies that applied cueing paradigms appropriate for use in the current study: Gregory and Jackson <ref type="formula">2020</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). All of the data used in this study were derived from non-predictive localisation cueing paradigms. That is, targets were cued or miscued by the centrally presented gaze cue an equal number of times and participants had to decide whether the target appeared either at the left or at the right hand side of the screen (more detail on each specific experiment is provided in the following sections). While there are several types of cueing paradigms commonly used in the literature such as categorization, detection, and localisation paradigms, in this study we only used localisation cueing paradigms in order to facilitate comparison across data sets. These tasks are also the most commonly used in healthy adult populations, according to a recent meta analysis that found almost half of the gaze cueing effects in the published literature are derived from localisation paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(McKay et al., 2021)</ref>. Our method for selecting our data sets was as follows. We searched open data repositories such as the Open Science Framework for localisation gaze cueing paradigms with a sufficient number of trials to be modelled by the DDM (a minimum of 100 trials per cue condition), which yielded two data sets (Data Set 1 and 3). We also contacted the authors of several studies that had suitable paradigms which THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 16 is how we obtained Data Set 2.</p><p>To maintain consistency, we applied the same exclusion criteria to each data set.</p><p>Any trials where the response time was less than 100ms or greater than 5000ms were excluded (these criteria are more liberal than was used in Carlson, 2016, who excluded trials with response times &lt;150ms and &gt;750ms). Further, any participants with less than 80% accuracy were excluded (as is common practice in gaze cueing experiments, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chen et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Coy et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that we ignored the distinction between several potential moderating factors in the data sets used, such as cue emotional expression and stimulus onset asynchrony. The main reason we did this was because in most of the data sets there were not enough trials per condition to model these moderating factors (except for Data Set 3 where we do analyse some potential moderating factors in supplementary materials 14 and 15, and conclude that these factors did not affect our main findings). Further, ignoring these distinctions facilitated comparison across data sets because these potential moderating factors were not always manipulated the same way across data sets. In the following paragraphs, we briefly describe each experiment that we extracted data from, but refer the reader to the original studies for more information on the original study methods.</p><p>In these paragraphs we also provide more detail on the potential moderating factors in each of the data sets.

There were three types of cues used in the original study, with 240 trials per cue type: gaze cues, arrow cues, and line cues (where the cue was an off-centre vertical line placed over a longer horizontal line) but for the current study we only analysed gaze cues 4 . Other manipulations in the original study were within-subject cue validity (cued or miscued) and SOA (100ms, 300ms, 500ms, 700ms, 1000ms). We ignored the distinction between SOA in our analyses to keep consistency across data sets. It is worth pointing out recent meta analytic findings which suggest that the magnitude of the gaze cueing effect is equivalent across these SOAs, suggesting that there may not be any moderating effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(McKay et al., 2021)</ref>.

There were three cue validity conditions: cued, miscued, and forward (where the eye-gaze was forward rather than left or right). In the current study, we did not analyse forward trials, only cued or miscued trials because the forward gaze cues were non-directional. Carlson (2016) also manipulated facial expression of the cue (fearful or neutral).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation of Analyses</head><p>We analysed the data in three stages (described in detail in the following sections).</p><p>In stage one, we performed a simple descriptive analysis in order to identify which participants exhibited cueing magnitudes in a direction consistent with a positive cueing effect (i.e., faster responses for cued trials compared to miscued trials). In stage two, we fitted eight variants of the DDM to each participant's data. Different model variants allowed different subsets of parameters to vary across cuing conditions. By comparing the performance of each model using model selection criteria, we were able to identify which model performed best and by extension, assess the relative importance of allowing each parameter to vary with cueing. Importantly, Stage 2 provided an opportunity to examine any individual differences in the processes driving the emergence of any positive gaze cueing effects. In stage three, we identified whether parameter estimates varied at the group-level across cued and miscued trials using a hierarchical model where the parameters each had equal opportunity to vary across cuing conditions. This group-level analysis provided another method of identifying subserving cognitive mechanisms because shifts in group-level parameter estimates that correspond to systematic differences in response times across conditions may suggest that those parameter shifts are driving observed differences in response times. Further, this method allowed us to asses the uncertainty of any shifts in parameter estimates at the group level.</p><p>THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 21</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stage 1: Cueing Magnitudes</head><p>All of the preexisting data sets used in the current study published significant (p &lt; .05), group-level cueing effects; such that their participants had faster response times for cued compared to miscued trials. None of these studies investigated individual differences in the emergence of cueing effects within participants. As described above, we identified mean response time differences for each participant (hereafter, 'cueing magnitudes').</p><p>Identifying individuals who showed cueing effects in this way was important to provide context for the individual-level computational modelling analyses described later since we did not expect the same models to perform best for participants who responded slower to cued trials compared to miscued trials. Separating gaze cueing magnitudes by subject also provided useful insight on its own because the gaze cueing effect is rarely investigated at the individual level.</p><p>In addition to calculating gaze cueing magnitudes for each individual, we also calculated the mean and SD of the gaze cueing magnitudes associated with each data set (i.e., at the sample level).

Weighted Model Probabilities. The purpose of this inference method was to identify the probability of each model being the best model relative to the other candidate models. We fitted the models to each participant separately and evaluated the models' performances using two respective model selection criteria: Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). BIC and AIC are both probabilistic model comparison methods that make different trade-offs between the quantitative ability of a model to describe the data (or model "fit") and model complexity (or "parsimony"), with one key difference between criteria being that BIC penalises complexity more than AIC (for more information on the differences between each criterion see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Evans, 2019)</ref>. We then converted the model selection criteria scores into weighted probabilities (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Wagenmakers &amp; Farrell, 2004)</ref> as this allowed us to better assess the uncertainty in each criterion's scores and the relative performance of each model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter Inclusion Probabilities.</head><p>After assessing the weighted probabilities of each respective model, we then assessed the relative influence of each parameter of THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 25 interest (non-decision time, starting point, and drift rate). This was achieved by combining the relative probability, according to BIC, of models that contained the same assumption about each respective parameter (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boehm et al., 2021</ref>, note that only the BIC parameter inclusion probabilities are presented in this manuscript as the qualitative trends were equivalent for AIC, but the AIC inclusion probabilities can be found in supplementary material 6). We then compared them to models that do not make the same assumption in order to identify the relative importance of that assumption. For example, to assess the inclusion probability for the parameter v, we compared the relative performance of models that assume v varies across cue validity conditions <ref type="bibr">(v, v-t0, z-v, and complex)</ref> to models that did not assume a drift rate difference across validity conditions (z, t0, z-t0, and simple).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stage 3: Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling</head><p>In this stage, rather than comparing the performance of competing models, we identified differences in parameter estimates across cued and miscued trials for just one model-the complex DDM variant described above, which allowed each of the parameters to vary across cued and miscued conditions. If a parameter is explaining differences in response times across cued and miscued cue trials, then there should be reliable differences in the estimates of those parameters across those conditions. Similarly, if a parameter is not explaining any differences in response time across cued and miscued trials, then there should be no reliable differences between estimates across those conditions(for more detail on estimation approaches versus model selection approaches to inference, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kruschke, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kruschke &amp; Liddell, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>To make inferences about the magnitude of these parameter differences, we compared the distributions of the differences in parameter estimates across cued and miscued trials. We also assessed the mean differences and the 95% Bayesian credible intervals, which we use to assess the variability in the distribution of posterior parameter estimates and gauge the probability that there were meaningful (or credible) differences in THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 26 parameter estimates across conditions. If zero lies within the 95% credible interval, there is less than 95% probability that there were reliable differences across parameter estimates in cued and miscued trials. Importantly, we used Hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation.</p><p>In hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation, each participant's parameters are constrained to follow a group level distribution. Here, the group-level pertains to the trial type (i.e. miscued trial or cued trial). Hierarchical parameter estimation is advantageous because individual participants mutually inform parameter estimates of one another.</p><p>The constraints on this model were different to the constraints that were placed on the individual-level complex model. In the individual-level modelling stage, we fully constrained the models so that they could not make theoretically implausible predictions.</p><p>However, that would not work for these analyses where we were making inferences about parameter shifts across conditions (rather than directly comparing the performance of models), because if the models were completely constrained, the parameter estimates would be forced to shift across conditions even if they were not driving the effect. In other words, constraining the parameter estimates effectively prevents the models from identifying no differences because virtually all of the probability mass is forced to take on non-zero values.</p><p>Because hierarchical methods pool parameter estimates on both the group level and the individual level, parameters can be constrained on either of those levels. However, if we forced each individual's prediction to only vary in the theoretically plausible direction, it would ensure that no single individual's differences in parameter estimates could cross zero, making it much less likely that the group level parameter estimates would cross zero, even if there were no differences in that parameter across conditions. Therefore, for this analysis, the group level parameter estimates were unconstrained. Importantly though, we ran a unique model for each parameter of interest in each dataset, where on the individual level, all of the parameters, except for the specific parameter of interest for that model, was constrained 7 . For example, for the parameter z in dataset 1, we ran a model where the 7 These constraints on the individual level differed slightly from the preregistered analysis plan. Originally, THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 27 individual-level estimates of t0 and v were constrained, but the estimates for z were completely unconstrained (this process was then repeated for to and v for each dataset).</p><p>We then looked at the parameter estimates for the unconstrained parameter to see whether it reliably shifted in a theoretically plausible direction. This process meant that the models were constrained enough to not make completely theoretically implausible predictions, but were still flexible enough such that the parameters could actually cross zero if they were not driving the effect.</p><p>As with the individual-level estimates, we used reasonably uninformed priors (see exact priors in Supplementary Material 3). The R package "rtdist" <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Singmann et al., 2020)</ref> was used for the likelihood function of the diffusion model, and the R package "msm" <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Jackson, 2021)</ref> was used to calculate the likelihood function of the truncated normal distribution.</p></div>

Assessment of these fits we had planned to completely constrain the individual-level estimates, but after running the analyses we realised that this did not permit sufficient flexibility, resulting in differences in parameter estimates which looked reliable but were most likely artifacts of the model constraints. Specifically, the previous results showed a highly reliable but extremely small z change, which was most likely caused by the fact that we were forcing the individual-level estimates to move in that direction. We discuss this more and show the results of the original preregistered analysis in Supplementary Material 4. revealed all of the models seemed to provide a reasonably good account for the data except for the simple model which could not account for the qualitative group-level differences in response times across across cued and miscued trials, and the v model, which under-estimated earlier response time differences across cued and miscued trials. Models that permitted t0 to vary across conditions appeared to be the only models that could account for a shrinkage in the effect later in the response time distribution, although there was still some misfit in those predictions. Specifically, they tended to over predict the variance of the response time distributions such that they predicted response times earlier in the distribution should be faster than what was observed and response times later in the distribution should be slower than what was observed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The gaze cueing effect has been widely studied and is considered a critical component of social cognition (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Frischen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Stephenson et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this, relatively little research has sought to understand the cognitive processes underlying its emergence. Evidence accumulation models represent the dominant framework through which the cognitive processes underlying speeded decisions can be inferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Donkin &amp; Brown, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Evans &amp; Wagenmakers, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Forstmann et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref> and have recently been identified as an important (but underused) tool for studying social cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Parker &amp; Ramsey, 2022b)</ref>. Here, we focused on three particular cognitive mechanisms described by evidence accumulation models: non-decision time, starting point, and drift rate. We applied theoretically informed variants of the DDM evidence accumulation model to three preexisting gaze cueing data sets with the aim of better understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying the gaze cueing effect.</p><p>Overall, at the group level and when collapsing across individual participants, we found that the gaze cueing effect was generally best described by an attentional orienting account (the non-decision time parameter in the DDM) rather than a transient information processing account (the starting point parameter in the DDM) or sustained information processing account (the drift rate parameter in the DDM). Specifically, our findings suggest that for most people, gaze cues tended to elicit an early, reflexive shift of attention to the gazed at location which resulted in a response time benefit when the target appeared at the gazed-at location and a response time orienting cost when the target appeared at the gazed-away from location. This is consistent with previous characterizations of the gaze cueing effect as a covert, reflexive shift of attention to the gazed at location (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Friesen &amp; Kingstone, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Frischen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">McKay et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">McKay et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Sato et al., 2007)</ref> as well as orienting theories of attention that describe orienting and processing as a serial process, whereby people must first orient towards the target before they can process it.</p><p>Although we found that non-decision time provided the best account for the gaze cueing effect overall, we also found considerable individual variability, such that some people's gaze cueing effects were best described by the starting point parameter. This was particularly evident in Data Sets 2 and 3, where almost everyone showed a positive gaze cueing effect, but what tended to vary across participants was whether the gaze cueing effects were better described by non-decision time or starting point. These data sets also had the most trials per person, the most participants, and the largest gaze cueing effects, suggesting that this individual variability might represent credible individual differences.</p><p>Previous research has suggested that gaze cueing effects could be representative of both an initial reflexive attentional orienting response followed by a top down, decision-level response <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hill et al., 2010)</ref>, which one could interpret as requiring increased allocation of THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 43 information processing resources to cued locations. Our findings generally do not support this explanation however, as most people tended to be best described by either an attentional-orienting account or a resource allocation account, but models that integrated both of these perspectives very rarely performed well.</p><p>For those participants whose gaze cueing effects were best described by starting point, there are two ways that this could have occurred according to evidence accumulation models. One common interpretation of starting point shifts is that people had an a priori expectation that the target would appear at the gazed-at location before it actually appeared <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Voss et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">White &amp; Poldrack, 2014)</ref>. This would suggest that, consistent with the view that eye-gaze is a highly informative social cue people innately use to infer the intentions of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Calder et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Emery, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Pellicano &amp; Rhodes, 2003)</ref>, these participants believed that the cues were informative, so they adjusted their expectation to account for where the target was likely to appear. However, given that the gaze cueing effects analysed in this study were non-predictive (there was an even amount of cued and miscued trials), this interpretation seems unlikely, since there was no reason for participants to believe that the cues were informative of the actual location of the target.</p><p>The interpretation that we think is most likely given the tasks used in the current study is that shifts in starting point were indicative of short-lived allocation of information processing resources to the cued location. This interpretation of starting point comes from two-stage evidence accumulation theories that describe the first stage of evidence accumulation as an initial, quick burst of information processing -which in the standard DDM used in our study would be captured by starting point -followed by a second stage of slower, sustained evidence accumulation which is captured by drift rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Weigard et al., 2019)</ref>, and is consistent with resource allocation theories of visual attention that suggest attention acts as a mechanism for distributing limited cognitive resources (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Sewell &amp; Smith, 2012)</ref>. This finding is also broadly consistent with research in joint attention suggesting people allocate more information processing resources to gazed at locations THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 44 <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Reid &amp; Striano, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Reid et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Shteynberg, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Wahl et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wahl et al., 2013)</ref>. Our findings suggest that for some people (i.e., those best described by non-decision time), gaze cueing effects are driven purely by orienting costs, where a time cost occurs because people need to re-orient to the cued location before they begin to process the target <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Broadbent, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Sewell &amp; Smith, 2012)</ref>. Other people however (i.e., those best characterised by starting point), seemed to engage in attentional orienting and information processing in parallel, whereby the gaze cue prompts them to simultaneously orient attention and allocate information processing resources to the cued location <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Sperling &amp; Weichselgartner, 1995)</ref>. After the initial presentation of the cue however, people best characterised by starting point then gradually re-distribute their information processing resources more evenly across the visual field.</p><p>It remains unclear precisely why these individual differences in the mechanisms underlying gaze cueing effects have emerged, as there are very few previous studies that have looked at individual differences in the gaze cueing effect in healthy adult populations.</p><p>Some studies have found that self-reported sex-category membership modulates the magnitude of gaze-cueing effects. Specifically, participants identifying themselves as female show larger gaze cueing effects than those identifying themselves as male in some contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bayliss et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">McCrackin &amp; Itier, 2019)</ref>. However, as we have shown in our study, a mean difference in gaze cueing magnitudes is not enough to conclude that the cognitive mechanisms underlying male and female cueing effects are different. We were unable to assess this possibility further as participant sex was not linked with each individual's responses in all of the raw data sets. Research has also found, in some contexts, a negative association between autism-like traits and gaze cueing magnitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bayliss et al., 2005</ref>), but we are unable to test this possibility given the available data. Further, it is important to note that more recent investigations of this association have yielded mixed findings at best, with some studies failing to replicate the association all together <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Lassalle &amp; Itier, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">McCrackin &amp; Itier, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Sato et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Sato et al., 2010)</ref>. This variation on the THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 45 individual-level found in our study also calls into question whether positive gaze cueing effects actually occur for all people. We showed that some people's gaze cueing magnitudes were negative or close to zero, but it was beyond the scope of the current study to infer whether this meant these people do not actually display gaze cueing effects rather than simply representing noise in data collection. One way that future research could assess whether there is genuine individual variability in who actually displays positive gaze cueing effects would be to use a constrained Bayesian mixed-modelling approach as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Haaf and Rouder (2017)</ref>.</p><p>A natural question that arises from our study is whether the results are exclusive to gaze-cues or whether we would expect the same kind of results for arrow cues or other equivalent non-biological cueing paradigms. Indeed, this question as to whether gaze cues elicit unique cueing effects has been of substantial interest within the gaze-cueing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Caruana et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chacón-Candia et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ha &amp; Hayward, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hermens &amp; Walker, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Hietanen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Joseph et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kuhn &amp; Kingstone, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Marotta et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Singh et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Stevens et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Tipper et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Tipples, 2008</ref>), yet conflicting results continue to emerge. In supplementary material 12, we analysed arrow cueing data from participants in Data Set 1 (as those participants were exposed to arrow cues and gaze cues). Overall, we found that the arrow cues from Data Set 1 elicit very similar responses compared to the gaze-cues from the same data set, such that non-decision time was the parameter most likely to be underlying arrow cues when collapsing across participants. However, also similar to the gaze cues in Data Set 1, among the arrow cueing data there was a high proportion of participants who were best described by the null model, and the relative confidence for the best performing models was fairly low, particularly compared to Data Sets 2 and 3. This noise in the data is not unexpected given the relatively small number of participants and trials per participant, and it could be why on neither gaze nor arrow cued responses in Data Set 1 do we observe the reliable individual differences for starting point. There was also low internal consistency within THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 46 participants' comparative responses to gaze and arrow cues, whereby many of the same participants who had large positive cueing magnitudes for arrows, had cueing magnitudes that were very small or negative for gaze. Of course, this could suggest that some people respond differently to gaze and arrow cues, but given the problems with this data set that we have already discussed, we are reluctant to make any strong inferences.</p><p>While it is important to be clear that we do not have sufficient data to make any particular claims about arrow cueing from our data, it is possible that the presence of the individual differences in starting point could indicate a unique effect of gaze cued faces.</p><p>Resource allocation models of attention tend to perform best in tasks that involve more complicated processing (such as near-threshold target discrimination tasks, or tasks with perceptual noise or distractors) compared to the localisation tasks used in the current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Sewell &amp; Smith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Voss et al., 2004)</ref>, suggesting the gaze cues could, in theory, be prompting the increased allocation of information processing resources for some participants. In support of this idea, some social-cognitive research suggests that people allocate more information processing resources to jointly attended locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Reid &amp; Striano, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Reid et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Shteynberg, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Wahl et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wahl et al., 2013)</ref>, and individual differences in facial processing are widely documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">(Wilmer, 2017)</ref>, so it is possible that when analysing a more robust data set of equivalent non-biological cues, we might not see these individual differences in attentional orienting versus resource allocation mechanisms, and instead only observe attentional orienting mechanisms for non-biological cues. In the current study we can only speculate about this possibility, but it highlights how evidence accumulation models could be used to differentiate gaze cues from non-biological cues in future research.</p><p>We found by far the least support for a drift rate account, suggesting that it is very unlikely that gaze cues have a sustained influence on information processing such that people allocate more information processing resources to the gazed-at location for the duration of the evidence accumulation process. These results contrast with the only other THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 47 study applying evidence accumulation modelling to the gaze cueing effect by <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Parker and Ramsey (2022a)</ref>, which suggested that drift rate was responsible for the gaze cueing effects observed in their study. Critically however, in their study drift rate was the only mechanism that was allowed to vary across cued and miscued trials, meaning that it was impossible for them to identify whether any other mechanism was driving the effect. Our results suggest that had they allowed starting point or non-decision time to vary across cued and miscued trials, the effect of drift rate may be substantially reduced (although it is important to note that they implemented a more complicated gaze cueing paradigm to what we used in our study). This lack of a drift rate effect found in our study qualifies the generalisability of previous finding that suggest suggest people recruit greater cognitive resources when another person is looking at the same object <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Reid &amp; Striano, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Reid et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Shteynberg, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Wahl et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wahl et al., 2013)</ref>. Specifically, according to our study, most localisation gaze cueing effects are not driven by increased allocation of information processing resources to the gazed-at location and for the minority where this is the case, this shift in resource allocation is very short and dissipates over time. However, it is possible that the localisation paradigms we used were too simple to necessitate this re-allocation of information processing resources. In more difficult gaze cueing paradigms that require more information processing to initiate a correct response, such as those requiring a target-categorization response, it is plausible that an information processing mechanism could have a stronger influence on gaze cueing effects. Future studies should apply the models used here to other kinds of gaze cueing paradigms that require more information processing resources, to see whether they generate different cognitive responses.</p><p>An important limitation of our design was that we ignored the distinction between several potential moderating factors present in the data sets used, such as cue emotional expression and cue-target SOA. The presence of these moderating factors in the data could potentially explain why there appeared to be some noise in the data sets or why there were differences between data sets more broadly, since many of these moderating factors did THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 48 attenuate cueing effects in the original studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carlson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chen et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Gregory &amp; Jackson, 2020)</ref>. One of the reasons we did not investigate moderating factors in our study was in part because there were not enough trials per person and per cell in the original studies to allow for reliable parameter estimates of each moderating factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Evans, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Lerche et al., 2017)</ref>. The only data set which had sufficient trials per participant and per condition to look at moderating factors was Data Set 3, though there did not appear to be any obvious qualitative differences in subserving mechanisms as a function of those moderating factors (SOA and emotional expression; see Supplementary Material 7).</p><p>Although this requirement of a large number of trials per person could be considered a more general constraint of evidence accumulation models, we believe that the advantages of an evidence accumulation modelling approach far outweigh the costs of needing to collect more data per person (which would usually be beneficial to the reliability of any results anyway). Further, we have demonstrated in our study that it is important to investigate the gaze cueing effect at the individual-level, which necessitates a substantial number of trials per person even without an evidence accumulation modelling approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Rouder et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Smith &amp; Little, 2018)</ref>. We encourage future research to use evidence accumulation models to investigate whether different moderating factors influence people's underlying cognitive responses to gaze cues.</p><p>Although we believe the DDM was an appropriate initial model to begin understanding the gaze cuieng effect within a computational modelling framework due to its simplicity and common use, future research should consider whether other types of models provide a different insight into the mechanisms underlying the gaze cueing effect.</p><p>While the DDM did a reasonable job accounting for the data, it was limited in its ability to describe some trends, such as the tendency for cueing effects to reverse at later stages of the response time distributions. One logical next step for future research would be to assess whether models of conflict tasks, such as the conflict diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Evans &amp; Servant, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Hübner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Ulrich et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">White et al., 2011)</ref> are better able to THE COGNITIVE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GAZE CUEING 49 capture the patterns of data in the gaze-cueing task. Conflict evidence accumulation models hold many of the same assumptions as standard evidence accumulation models, but have been designed to assess the influence of task-irrelevant information, such as the type of distractors found in Stroop or flanker tasks. These models would therefore be able to assess the degree to which people are trying to suppress gaze cues and disregard them as task-irrelevant information. Conflict models have also been found to be able to account for the ordering of response times between conditions to overlap or reverse later in the response time distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Ulrich et al., 2015)</ref>, which suggests they could be useful for further understanding the gaze cueing effect in future investigations. We would like to emphasise, however, that although assessing other models in gaze-cueing task is a useful future direction, we believe that the DDM was an appropriate first model to use.</p><p>Keeping in mind the various constraints discussed here, we posit that our study suggests three main takeaways. Firstly, the process that underlies the majority of people's localisation gaze cueing effects is most likely to be an attentional orienting process.</p><p>However secondly, there are individual differences such that not everyone's gaze cueing effects are best described by that process. Thirdly, localisation gaze cueing effects are probably not the result of a sustained shift in information processing resources to the cued location. Above all, we hope that we have shown the value of applying computational models to cueing paradigms and studies of social cognition more broadly. We have demonstrated that evidence accumulation models in particular provide a theoretically grounded method for going beyond the observed behaviour to make inferences about underlying cognitive mechanisms driving an effect. We hope that our study promotes further application of these models to gaze cueing research in future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, Carlson (2016), and Chen et al.
