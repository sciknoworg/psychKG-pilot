			<abstract>
				<p>Institutions are a pervasive feature of human social life, but psychological science has largely ceded the study of institutions to disciplines such as economics, sociology, political science, history, and law. These other disciplines treat institutions as the abstract &apos;rules of the game&apos; in society (economics), or as enduring social structures such as the family, law courts, and government, around which society is organized (sociology; law). Missing from these other disciplines is a serious attempt to place the study of institutions on secure psychological and neurobiological microfoundations (including understanding why humans alone create and maintain institutions, for institutions do not feature in the social life of any other social species (including of our closest non-human primate relatives). Here, I argue we should treat institutions as vital objects of psychological enquiry, viewing them as dynamic, human, robust and resilient, time-traveling, cognitive communities. In this framework, institutions are not rulebooks, social structures, or the &apos;rules of the game&apos; in a society, but are living, adaptive, action-oriented, networks of collective memory, shared narratives, and distributed decisionmaking which generate an enduring cognitive surplus (the additional resources and capacities emerging when individuals engage in shared, collective cognitive processes). Individual neurocognitive processes-like language, memory, mental time travel, and social learning-when exercised collectively and cooperatively enable us to form time-travelling, cognitive communities (institutions). This approach enriches other disciplinary approaches by grounding them in the empirical realities of human behavior, as well as opening a new field of scholarly inquiry-a transdisciplinary domain integrating cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, organizational theory, economics, and sociology.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Institutions As Robust and Resilient, Dynamic, Human, Time-Travelling, Cognitive Communities</head><p>Institutions are everywhere: look around. We interact with institutions all the time -right throughout our lives -from the institutions (formally and informally) centering us at birth within particular communities, to the schools we might attend, to the authorities that levy taxes on us, to the entities we work for, and beyond to the entities that govern us (legally, politically, normatively) at local, national, and even at international levels. That 'institutions matter' was noted long ago by Charles <ref type="bibr">Darwin (1836)</ref>, who observed that: 'If the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin'. Darwin here provided an early articulation of the view that our institutions are something we humans create and control, and our institutions can, somehow, enrich or impoverish our collective social and economic lives. At supranational level, the World Bank agrees, stating bluntly that 'institutions matter', claiming they are central to our economic and social development <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burki &amp; Perry, 1998</ref>) -a claim which is the basis of an important strand of thinking in social sciences such as economics and sociology.</p><p>Institutions pervade human life (prosaically, several academic and non-academic institutions had to work and coordinate together over a period time to support the writing, peer reviewing, publication of, and access to, this paper). Yet, institutions are utterly absent from the social lives of every other social species on this planet. This is something of a mystery, still to be explained.</p><p>Presumably, differences between species in cognitive and affective processes arising from particular brain systems (structures and functions) explain why humans have institutions, and other animals, (including our closest non-human primate relatives) do not.</p><p>Institutions have come under intense scrutiny and even outright attack in recent times. Some scholars contend that the alleged corruption and takeover of civil society institutions by authoritarian governments lie at the heart of much of the current political malaise observed in various countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bermeo, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Levitsky &amp; Ziblatt, 2018)</ref>. Equally, others argue that the gradual "long march" through-and ultimate domination of civil society institutions (particularly in sociocultural and academic domains) by proponents of a particular political position is both factually grounded and deeply problematic. Critics of this view warn that such a process may erode democratic pluralism and constrain intellectual diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mudde &amp; Kaltwasser, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>International surveys of confidence and trust in institutions carried out by entities such as the Organization for Economic <ref type="bibr">Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2024)</ref>, shows declines in general confidence in institutions in recent years, but this decline is nuanced. Analytical ambiguities in the study of political trust arise primarily because trends vary significantly by institution, country, and time-period. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Valgarðsson et al. (2025)</ref> analyzed 3,377 surveys from 50 projects conducted in 143 countries between 1958 and 2019. While considerable differences exist across countries and regions, a notable pattern emerges -trust in 'representative' democratic institutions, such as governments and parliaments, has generally been declining worldwide in recent decades. In contrast, trust in 'implementing' institutionsincluding civil services and the legal system-has either remained stable or even increased, challenging the prevailing narrative of a uniform global decline in institutional trust. While citizens may be losing faith in institutions representing them politically, they continue to maintain or develop trust in those institutions with which they have more direct, sustained, contact over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorizing 'institutions'</head><p>Institutions and institutional theory have traditionally been examined within disciplines such as economics, sociology, and political science, with each discipline defining institutions in their own way. For instance, sociologists describe institutions as: "a complex of positions, roles, norms and values lodged in particular types of social structures and organising relatively stable patterns of human activity with respect to fundamental problems in producing life-sustaining resources, in reproducing individuals, and in sustaining viable societal structures within a given environment" <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Turner, 1997)</ref>, a definition that appears to embrace every human activity across the whole of the human life course. <ref type="bibr">Voss (2001, p. 7561</ref>) elaborates further, stating that the concept of "…'institutions' is … used in a dual way. First, it denotes rules, constraints, or norms of human interaction. Second, it describes the resulting stable patterns of interaction among a set of agents and the social mechanisms generating this outcome." In this view, the family, as an institution, is not simply a collection of individual households, but a standardised pattern of social behavior, subject to both social norms and a bureaucracy supporting and legitimating family formation, as well as associated legal and other (perhaps religious) processes. Other institutions <ref type="bibr">(financial, governmental, medical, educational, religious, etc.)</ref> are considered similarly.</p><p>In economics, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics Laureate, <ref type="bibr">Douglass North (1989</ref> and, separately, later Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, have argued influentially that institutions are more than written laws or formal social structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Acemoglu et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acemoglu &amp; Robinson, 2012)</ref>, but, echoing Darwin, are central to our economic and social development and our prosperity. <ref type="bibr">North (1991, p. 91</ref>) defines institutions as "humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social interaction. They consist of both informal constraints (sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, and codes of conduct), and formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights)." Thus, institutions are formal rules (including constitutions, statutes, and regulatory frameworks) complemented by informal norms and shared understandings. Jointly, these elements constrain and prescribe the interactions of political actors, shaping the incentives driving economic and social behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">North (1990)</ref> famously described institutions as the "rules of the game" coordinating social interactions within society, and which in turn influence a particular society's distribution of power and resources. Acemoglu and Robinson extend this analysis further by contrasting 'inclusive' institutions, which promote broad participation, secure property rights, and uphold the rule of law, and 'extractive'</p><p>institutions, which concentrate power in the hands of a few, stifling innovation, fostering a zero-sum, robber-baron society, thereby hindering economic and social development.</p><p>Thus, in economics (as in sociology), institutions, whether formal or informal, are foundational to societal order, and involve the interplay of historical experience, shared culture, rules, norms, and political and legal negotiation. The essence of optimal institutional design, as suggested by North, Acemoglu, and other economists, lies in creating a coherent, stable (yet flexible) framework governing interactions, shaping incentives, and thereby determining the path of societal progress. While this definition overlaps with the sociological perspective in recognising the structured nature of institutions, it emphasises the regulatory role of these shared understandings in shaping social, economic, and political interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Critique: Analyses of institutions in economics and other social sciences consider humans as</head><p>'black boxes' -aggregating behavioral outcomes generated by these 'black boxes' to infer higher-order 'institutional' structures. These analyses do not consider the mechanisms (neurocognitive and social) within (and interactions between) the black boxes generating behavioral outputs which are aggregated to give rise to the higher-level structures dubbed 'institutions'. The argument made here is that these 'higher-order structures' result from the actions of the mechanisms in the black boxes (like the rules creating molecules from their constituent atoms). Thus, these views of institutions lack the 'micro-level foundations' based on the neurocognitive functions generating our individual thoughts, behaviours, social interactions, and how these aggregate to create larger-scale social phenomena. These theories are 'castles in the air', if not grounded in the reality of human cognition and interaction, for without human cognition and agency, an institution simply ceases to exist.</p><p>The 'rules of the game' are not inscribed in our genome or written in some inerrant 'bible of rules'; rather, they are surface manifestations of a deeper human capacity for cooperation, deliberation, and forward planning (dynamic, collective, mental time travel), among other cognitive and social capacities. These views neglect how information is generated, selected, and transmitted within institutions, or how institutions come to be founded in the first place. Any robust theory of institutions must account for the dynamic, cognitive, and social processes underpinning human interaction over time and at scale. Only by integrating insights from psychology and neuroscience can we hope to understand how institutions truly emerge, evolve, and endure at a societal scale.</p><p>These perspectives cannot, in principle, account for why every other species (including our closest nonhuman primate relatives) lack institutions. Nonhuman primates exhibit complex social behaviors, including cooperation and hierarchical structures; however, they lack the neural architecture necessary for high-level abstraction, long-range planning, and language-mediated cooperation, which are essential for the development of human-like institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Tomasello, 2014)</ref>. While species such as chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys display proto-institutional behaviors, such as dominance hierarchies and social conventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Perry et al., 2003)</ref>, these behaviors are closely tied to immediate utility and lack the symbolic ritualization characteristic of human institutions. For instance, capuchin monkeys engage in unique social rituals like hand-sniffing and eye-poking, which are group-specific and persist over time, yet they do not exhibit the decoupling from immediate utility seen in human rituals <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Perry et al., 2003)</ref>. Moreover, nonhuman primates do not demonstrate the capacity for nested episodic simulation-the ability to collaboratively model multi-generational futures-a cognitive process supported by the human default mode network <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buckner &amp; Carroll, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schacter et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Yeshurun et al., 2021)</ref>. Nonhuman primate metacognitive abilities, while present to some extent, do not extend to deliberative metacognitive governance, as they lack the collective sociocognitive mechanisms to critique and update shared social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Subias et al., 2025)</ref>. Moreover, has episodic simulation has distinctive social roles in human groups, as episodic simulation can increase intentions to help others, and by enabling individuals to imagine the experiences of outgroup members, episodic simulation has also been shown to reduce intergroup bias in prosocial intentions and behavior <ref type="bibr">(Gaesser and Schachter, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gaesser et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, while nonhuman primates display complex social organization and specialization, the absence of shared norms, explicit rules, and symbolic meanings governing behavior precludes the formation of institutions akin to those in human societies.</p><p>While nonhuman primates possess multi-level social hierarchies, engage in alliances, and social behaviors such as grooming or ritualized conflict, these are largely the product of instinctual interactions and immediate social cues rather than deliberate, codified agreements. Non-human primates do not engage in deliberative assembly, codification of laws, or conduct disputations in court, or levy taxes for the greater good, for they simply lack the sociocognitive capacity to engage in foresight, planning and the other elements of institutional life. Nonhuman primates lack interacting language systems and memory networks for abstracting and transmitting symbolic representations (such as laws, myths, and cultural narratives) which are the building blocks of institutions as cognitive communities.</p><p>Finally, these views are silent on why certain types of neuropsychological patients with damage to particular brain circuits (think of the impulsive, aggressive, Phineas Gage, or the famous amnesic patient HM (Henry Molaison) as exemplars) could not initiate an institution with others, nor maintain the institution through sustained cooperative effort. An institution requires ongoing social cooperation, consistency, and the ability to adjust to new circumstances-functions relying on intact cognitive systems and emotional regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Horne et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Siddiqi et al. 2025)</ref>. These kinds of patients, respectively suffering from frontal lobe-insult-induced dysexecutive and related syndromes (Gage), or profound anterograde amnesia (HM; impaired mental time travel and imagination), will come under the care of institutions, but neither will contribute effectively to ongoing institutional life. Impulse control and memory are critical for the reflective, deliberative processes forming the backbone of institutions.</p><p>Foreseeing future consequences, learning from past experiences, and aligning personal actions with a collective vision are compromised when key neural circuits are damaged. Affected individuals lack the strategic foresight and social insight to articulate and propose a system of shared norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What are we trying to explain?</head><p>A comprehensive theory of institutions must be capable of addressing a wide range of foundational questions, such as the following. How do institutions come into being in the first place? What minimal cognitive individual and collective capacities underlie institutions? Do our cognitive capacities, collectively exercised, create a surplus greater than that we can achieve alone? How do individual and collective brain processes-encompassing social learning, memory, imagination, and adaptationenable the formation of these complex social structures? How do institutions organize our behavior across time, seamlessly absorbing some individuals and managing loss of others? How do institutions become objects of shared affection, despite existing solely as cognitive constructs? Why do no other species have institutions? What specific brain systems, structures, and functions support our predispositions toward formalizing impersonal relationships and engaging in impersonal trust? How do institutions serve as tools to manage and reduce the complexity of our world? What mechanisms allow the codification of deliberative processes (such as law-making or even intra-company communications) to translate into effective behavioral change? Why do we attribute agency to, and feel affection or hatred, for our institutions?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Evolutionary Trade-Off: Costs and Benefits of Institutions</head><p>The metabolic investment in a high-capacity brain is offset by the adaptive advantages gained from distributed cognition and collective intelligence-a balance that would not be maintained if the costs outweighed the benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Wilson &amp; Sober, 1994)</ref>. The unique convergence of cognitive capacity, symbolic language, and cumulative cultural evolution enables humans to absorb the high metabolic and energetic costs associated with maintaining sophisticated neural circuitry and social cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dunbar, 1998)</ref>. Human institutions as cognitive communities are collective outcomes of evolved neural systems supporting complex social cognition and collaborative problem solving, allowing for the accumulation and transmission of cultural knowledge laterally across individuals and horizontally across generations.</p><p>They are a unique kind of social technology -a kind of a collective, cognitive, exoskeleton -one generating a considerable cognitive surplus, only found in humans.</p><p>From an adaptationist perspective, every trait or behavior incurs costs and must provide net benefits to be maintained by natural selection. Human institutions, though expensive in terms of energy and neural resources, generate a significant 'cognitive surplus' enhancing problem-solving, innovation, and coordinated action <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hinsz et al., 1997)</ref>. Cognitive surplus is the "excess" capacity-encompassing creativity, problem-solving, abstract reasoning, and accumulated knowledge available arising from cooperative and collective efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Shirky, 2010)</ref>. Cognitive surplus is what remains when human societies have met their basic survival needs and can channel their advanced cognitive abilities into building and maintaining systems (cognitive communities or "institutions") further enhancing collective cognition and social coordination.</p><p>The collective collaborative action enabled by these cognitive communities ('institutions') enables efficient resource management and conflict resolution by providing a common framework guiding behavior and expectations laterally across individuals and horizontally through time, thereby maintaining social order and fostering environments where innovation and adaptation can thrive.</p><p>Furthermore, structured coordination translates into enhanced survival and reproductive success <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ford, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">King, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kirkebøen et al. 2021)</ref>. Effectively harnessing collective cognitive surplus-through distributed cognition and pooled expertise ensures societies are better equipped to innovate and adapt in the face of environmental, social, and technological challenges. This adaptive advantage stabilizes societies in the short-term and improves long-term reproductive outcomes across generations by creating conditions favorable to raising offspring in a secure and resource-rich environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Views within psychology of institutions</head><p>Psychological science has paid relatively little attention to understanding institutions, despite their centrality in human affairs. However, we now have a good body of theory and empirical evidence to address many of the questions listed in the previous section, and provide the 'micro-level foundations' for how individuals and groups process information and learn from experience, and place the macro-theorizing of economics and other disciplines on a more secure footing.</p></div>

Notably, individual cognition does not operate in isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Rabb et al., 2019)</ref>; it is amplified and extended when exercised collectively through various interlocking cognitive mechanisms (detailed and elaborated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, where neurocognitive functions are mapped by mechanism to a particular function; interconnections between function, mechanism, and action are elaborated, and empirical tests are illustrated). Institutions, for example, embody distributed cognition by extending individual mental capacities through external tools like records, protocols, and digital systems, allowing them to preserve and build on shared knowledge over time, much like how individuals offload memory to notebooks or apps-facilitating cumulative learning and collective problem-solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hutchins, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Norman, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sprevak et al. 2018)</ref>.</p></div>

These shared symbols underpin the creation of institutional memory-a repository of accumulated cultural knowledge that helps societies adapt and evolve over time. Human language is uniquely flexible and symbolic, permitting the communication of abstract ideas, negotiation of social contracts, and transmitting of complex information across generations. When individuals use symbols to communicate, they create a shared repository of knowledge-a form of cultural memory-transcending personal experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Halbwachs, 1925</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Halbwachs, /1992</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What institutions are not</head><p>The analysis here implies institutions do not and cannot exist without human brains acting together. We tend to view institutions as autonomous, agentic entities, sometimes even conferring upon them a kind of legal personhood: our narratives may anthropomorphize institutions for ease of understanding. According to this analysis, institutions are not autonomous, agentic, self-executing mechanisms. Institutions are not self-executing systems; they are cognitive communities which depend on the continuous, active engagement of individuals who, through routine interactions and shared experiences, refresh and renew the institution. Similarly, rather than being self-executing mechanisms, institutional norms and bureaucratic practices require active interpretation, enforcement, and adaptation by individuals. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> compares the view that institutions are robust and resilient, dynamic, human, timetravelling, cognitive communities to conventional economic and sociological views of institutions. These frameworks differ markedly, and make very different empirical predictions, as elaborated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6;</ref> columns 2 and 3, rows 1-5 compare and contrast predictions made by both theories, whereas predictions from rows 6-10 are unique predictions generated by the cognitive community point of view. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Theorizing institutions as robust and resilient, dynamic, human, time-travelling cognitive communities recovers these complex sociocognitive systems as objects of psychological inquiry. Our developing of institutions is an adaptive response, allowing us to create increasingly complex and interdependent societies, while emphasizing our institutions are fundamentally shaped by collective cognition, drawing on memory, imagination, and shared culture. This perspective also explains how institutions have come to be, and provides insights into how they can be designed to be more adaptive, participatory, and resilient.</p><p>Our unique combination of enhanced brain capacity, sophisticated language, cumulative cultural evolution, and our ability to form extensive, cooperative social networks has allowed us to create, maintain, and continually refine institutions. Institutions generate a significant cognitive surplus outweighing their metabolic and neurobiological costs-a balance critical to the evolutionary success of our species, setting us apart from all other species. The benefits outweigh the drawbacks: otherwise, we could not afford to maintain these cognitive communities in their distinctive and demanding forms over such prolonged periods of time.</p><p>Our evolutionary trajectory endows us with an energy-intensive yet highly adaptable brain, advanced social cognition, and a capacity for symbolic language and cumulative cultural evolution. The net fitness advantages-evidenced by improved survival, enhanced reproductive success, and the ability to adapt to complex and dynamic environments-explain why institutions have become a defining feature of human societies, setting us apart from all other species. Our institutions underscore the distinctive interplay between our biological heritage and cultural evolution-a dynamic that has enabled human societies to create institutions that dramatically amplify our cognitive capabilities and secure our adaptive success. Their "time-travelling" quality may come from reviving lost or marginalized cultural practices and blending them with contemporary ideals.</p><p>-Legal and ethical ambiguities from operating outside mainstream structures -Limited scalability and safety issues (vulnerability to infiltration/suppression ) -Legal advocacy and gradual reform to transition cultural practices into protected forms -Strengthened internal security protocols to balance secrecy with accountability</p></div>

I propose that we should think of them explicitly as shared realities where we do cognitive work together. This 'cognitive view' of institutions suggests that interacting persons are necessary to support their continued existence…[this means that] …Institutions have formal and informal decision-making processes, as well as explicit and tacit repositories of memory supporting norms, customs and practices. In turn, these shared cognitive processes (decision making, memories) allow the institution to adapt and survive. When these processes fail, institutions also fail. (O'Mara 2023). Institutions, O'Mara argues, must be understood in terms of how human brains collectively function and interact to do some form of work together: institutions are dynamic cognitive communities-living systems continuously integrating collective memory, imagination, prospective thinking, and social learning to adapt and endure-evolving human sociocognitive realities built through interaction, rather than simply the 'rules of the game' that (somehow) govern our economic and social behavior. By this view, institutions are a shared cognitive endeavor providing a cognitive surplusdynamic human realities continuously constructed through interaction. This view implies institutions rely fundamentally on collective human effort, or rules and procedures remain inert. O'Mara's view is under-theorised and needs elaboration. Here, I suggest that institutions are best understood as robust and resilient, dynamic, human, time-travelling cognitive communities; institutions are living networks extending our individual cognitive capacities by integrating memory, foresight/prospection, and collective learning into enduring frameworks shaping our social world. This view emphasises human agency, interaction, and cognitive co-creation as at the core of institutional life. Table 1 provides examples of normative (or conventional) institutional types, as well as examples of non-normative (or unconventional) institutional types which can be analysed under the present framework. Traditional universities conform to standard thinking regarding institutions -they are longestablished academic institutions that evolve their curricula and contribute to new knowledge over time. They preserve intellectual traditions and connect modern ideas with centuries of scholarship. Crowdsourced knowledge platforms like Wikipedia are a non-normative institutional example; they rely on decentralized editing to continuously update information, while their open structure and commitment to accuracy make them dynamic, ever-evolving repositories of collective human knowledge.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>For example, mental time travel is supported by the default mode network (DMN;<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aggleton &amp; O'Mara, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Buckner &amp; Carroll, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Menon, 2023;</ref> Schacter et al., 2012). These neurocognitive systems underpin the ability of individuals, and by extension institutions, to integrate historical precedents with prospective reasoning, enabling continuity and adaptation across generations. For example, when the U.S. Supreme Court cites Marbury v. Madison in deliberating novel issues such as AI ethics, it exemplifies institutional mental time travel: drawing on foundational legal memory to scaffold normative simulations of an uncertain future.Table 4 applies this analysis to a nonnormative institution, namely Wikipedia.Distributed cognition is supported by the frontoparietal control network (FPCN, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL)), both implicated in goal-directed coordination and task management (Cole et al., 2013; Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001). Within institutional contexts, distributed cognition enables the division of cognitive labor across human agents and technological systems, facilitating complex collaborative tasks such as citation verification, peer review, and content curation. A salient example is the coordinated effort of over 100 editors to maintain a single Wikipedia page on climate change (Wikipedia, 2025) -an emergent cognitive system in which humans, algorithms, and shared norms co-construct and represent knowledge at scale. Extending this analysis Conflict and Power Struggles Conflict, dissent, and power struggles are a part of institutional life. Institutions often persist amid deep-seated disagreements and coercive enforcement of norms; despite dissent, there is enough shared identity and common narrative to hold them together. This shared narrative is not static; it is rewritten as different factions challenge the status quo. Even during conflict and power struggles, there exists a dynamic process of collective meaning-making that both binds and transforms the institution. These tensions become part of the collective memory and narrative of an institution-shaping, contesting, and even transforming it over time. Internal disagreements and power imbalances are negotiated through processes of social learning, ritualized conflict resolution, and even the periodic reconfiguration of shared narratives; the dynamics of adversarial conflict can catalyze institutional evolution. Institutional Resilience Resilience is the collective adaptive response capacity mitigating functional institutional decline under continuing acute or chronic stress (financial, budgetary, environmental challenge, attacks on values, etc.). Institutions as cognitive communities can actively develop collective resilience by estimating, distributing, and responding ahead of time, to sources of risk, allocating anticipatory functions across agents, roles, and technologies. For example, early warning systems, scenario planning teams, and risk audits can act as institutional equivalents of metacognitive monitors, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities before they escalate. This capacity hinges on the effective functioning of networks like the frontoparietal control system and the default mode network at the individual level, which when scaled collectively through institutional design, enable coordinated planning, error detection, and adaptive reconfiguration.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Broader</head><label></label><figDesc>Cultural and Legal Ecosystems Institutions exist within broader cultural and legal ecosystems shaping their operational boundaries and informing their norm-generating and rule-making processes. While they develop their own internal procedures, these boundaries and rules are embedded within a larger context of laws, standardized practices, and historical precedents. The interpretation, enforcement, and adaptation of these guidelines affects the organisational life of institutions. Economic factors-such as property rights, transaction costs, and coercive forces are material incentives deeply interwoven with human cognition. Our perceptions of fairness, risk, and opportunity, for instance, are shaped by both economic realities and cognitive processes.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Viewing institutions as robust and resilient, dynamic, human, time-travelling, cognitive communities, opens new research domains. Novel metrics to measure individual cognitive capacities relating them to collective institutional outcomes might include behavioral tests, experience sampling, neuroimaging (hyperscanning), large language models (LLMs), and psychometric assessments-to quantify cognitive diversity, memory, and mental time travel capabilities during key institutional processes (such as deliberative assembly). Such metrics would provide a more concrete basis for correlating individual-level cognitive performance with macro-level institutional resilience, adaptability, and innovation.Other methods might include:Computational Models Computational modeling, particularly agent-based models (ABMs), offers a powerful approach for simulating the cognitive and social dynamics underlying institutions. By incorporating elements such as mental time travel, social learning processes, and neurobiological constraints that reflect underlying brain structures, these models enable researchers to simulate how individual cognition aggregates to form shared narratives and dynamic decision-making networks. ABMs serve as a computational laboratory bridging micro-level cognitive processes with macro-level institutional phenomena by simulating key variables-including conflict, status, hierarchy, and powerand by assigning diverse attributes (e.g., memory, learning ability, risk tolerance, and personality traits).This framework not only provides valuable insights into the emergence of institutions as adaptive and resilient cognitive communities but also acts as a test bed for formalizing theoretical accounts of institutional dynamics.Appendix 1 will include several ABM simulations. Longitudinal Studies Longitudinal studies examining institutions through their long-term documentation will be particularly fruitful, especially now that Large Language Models (LLMs) can harvest and analyze texts at a scale difficult for individuals or teams, and determine macrotrends that might be invisible at a microlevels -such as subtle language shifts, the shaping of institutional policies and practices through new ideas, etc. Case Studies Understanding the cognitive foundations of institutional change requires engaging with key actors-policymakers, organizational leaders, and innovators-who shape new frameworks. Large language models (LLMs) enable sophisticated, multi-perspective interviews that analyze dialogue among diverse stakeholders, illuminating how individual cognition and social learning drive institutional formation and transformation. This qualitative data complements quantitative findings from financial and personnel records. The de novo creation of formal institutions begins with conversations among parties with vested interests, as seen in agreements like the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement and the development of European Union institutions. Advanced LLMs can conduct large-scale analyses of public media, documents, and other sources, capturing shifts in conversational centres of gravity. This dynamic approach offers new avenues for testing hypotheses regarding the formation, evolution, and operation of institutions. Cross-Cultural Analyses Cross-cultural analyses can test the hypothesis that all institutions, regardless of their specific form, derive from a similar, cross-cultural, class-common suite of brain structures and functions, thereby explaining why institutions worldwide obey certain deep generalizations, such as predictable patterns of collective memory and decision-making, and exhibit a limited range of hierarchical and heterarchical structures. Crisis-Driven Developments of Institutions How institutions respond to crises (such as those in the European Union during economic or political shocks) deserves greater scholarly attention. Future research might examine how crises accelerate the reformation or destabilization of institutional frameworks by actors within these cognitive communities, and investigate the cognitive and emotional processes driving such rapid adaptation. Such research may offer insights into the mechanisms by which institutions harness collective stress to reinvent themselves, balancing short-term imperatives with longterm sustainability. Integrating Vertical and Horizontal Structures Vertical institutions (like governments and hospitals) are essential for social stability, while horizontal networks (like social media communities) drive rapid, sometimes volatile opinion formation. By establishing channels for horizontal-lateral input (a hybrid, porous interface such as participatory budgeting or online public consultations) alongside traditional decision-making structures, institutions can create a more adaptive and inclusive framework that dampens extreme polarization, fostering gradual, meaningful change.</figDesc></figure>
