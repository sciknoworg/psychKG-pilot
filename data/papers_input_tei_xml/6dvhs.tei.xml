				<p>Background Despite the critical role of choice processes in substance use disorders, the neurobehavioral mechanisms guiding human decisions about drugs remain poorly understood. We adapted a neuroeconomic framework to characterize the neural encoding of subjective value (SV) for cannabis versus non-drug rewards (snacks) in near-daily cannabis users. We also assessed the impact of cannabis and snack stimuli (&apos;cues&apos;) on SV encoding. Methods Twenty-one non-treatment-seeking cannabis users (≥4 days/week; 1 female) participated in an inpatient, crossover experiment with four counterbalanced conditions: 1. neutral cues/cannabis choices; 2. cannabis cues/cannabis choices; 3. neutral cues/snack choices; and 4. snack cues/snack choices. In each condition, participants were exposed to cues before an fMRI scan during which they repeatedly chose between 0-6 cannabis puffs/snacks and a set monetary amount, with randomly-selected choices implemented. The SV signal was operationalized as the neural correlates of the strength of preference for cannabis/snack choices. fMRI data were analyzed for twenty participants. Results Despite equivalent choice behavior, SV signals for cannabis, but not snacks, were observed in regions known to encode SV for various rewards (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, vmPFC; ventral striatum; dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, dPCC). SV encoding in vmPFC was stronger for cannabis than snacks. In the dPCC, the impact of cues on SV signals was moderated by the reward type. Conclusions Near-daily cannabis users had expected neural value encoding for cannabis but disrupted non-drug SV encoding, despite equivalent choice behavior. Results provide support for models identifying dysregulated neural valuation of non-drug rewards as a hallmark of problematic substance use. non-drug reward neural SV signals. We hypothesized that: (1) SV signals for both cannabis and snacks would be found in the vmPFC, VS, and dPCC; (2) SV signals would be stronger during choices about cannabis compared to snack food; and (3) the presence of cues would augment the cannabis SV signals more than snack SV signals. 6 MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants We recruited 21 right-handed 21-50-year-old participants (one female; 20 males) who smoked cannabis in &apos;blunts&apos; or &apos;joints&apos; ≥4 days/week. None were seeking treatment for cannabis use, and none used other illicit drugs &gt;2 days/week. They had no DSM-IV Axis 1 disorder requiring intervention and no contraindications for participating. Full eligibility criteria are in the Supplement. Participants provided written informed consent and were compensated as approved by the New York State Psychiatric Institute&apos;s (NYSPI) Institutional Review Board. Experimental Protocol Following screening and training, participants were admitted for six days to the Clinical Research Unit at NYSPI (Table 1). Urine toxicology, carbon monoxide, and breathalyzer tests confirmed sobriety at arrival. Upon admission, participants underwent two sessions, wherein they sampled the cannabis (6 puffs) and personally-selected snacks (6 snacks) about which they would make decisions. Snack sessions always occurred before cannabis sessions. On inpatient days 1, 2, 5 and 6 (&apos;choice&apos; days), participants underwent four conditions in counterbalanced order, with one condition daily: (1) cannabis (i.e., active) cues, cannabis versus money choices; (2) neutral cues, cannabis versus money choices; (3) snack (i.e., active) cues, snack versus money choices; and (4) neutral cues, snack versus money choices. They were reminded that: (1) the cannabis or snacks would be identical to those sampled; (2) they would complete two tasks (behavioral and fMRI), making repeated choices between cannabis/snacks and money; (3) one choice per task (two in total-one from the behavioral and one from the fMRI task) would be randomly selected and implemented that afternoon; and (4) because any choice could be implemented, the best strategy was to treat each choice as</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Persistent choice for drugs at the expense of healthier rewards is a cardinal pathology in substance use disorders (SUDs) <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. Indeed, it has been argued that SUDs are, in essence, pathologies of choice and decision-making <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. A fundamental question about SUDs thus concerns the neurobehavioral mechanisms guiding these choices: why do decisions to use drugs continue, often despite negative consequences?</p><p>Novel approaches to this question have recently come from the fields of neuroeconomics and decision science, which have made substantial progress in characterizing the neural processes guiding choices for various rewards in healthy humans <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. A major focus has been neural representation of subjective value (SV). This emerges from a fundamental computational problem that must be resolved by the brain during choices: how to compare qualitatively different options <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. A central tenet of economics is that individuals make choices 'as if' using a single SV scale, calculated as a 'common currency'. Moreover, economists hold that this SV scale is revealed in the choices themselves <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>, such that an individual who chooses a bag of cannabis over $10 must -by definition -have a greater SV for that amount of cannabis than for $10, under those precise circumstances.</p><p>Within the past 20 years neuroeconomics has investigated the neurobiological basis of SV calculations in healthy populations. Intriguingly, results indicate that the brain appears to calculate SV signals as predicted by standard economic theory <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12)</ref>. There is strong evidence that SV signals are parametrically encoded during decisions in the ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) <ref type="bibr">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">13)</ref>, the Ventral Striatum (VS), and dorsal Poster Cingulate Cortex (dPCC) <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12)</ref>. These findings are particularly relevant for addiction, given that individuals with SUDs are believed to overvalue drugs while simultaneously undervaluing other rewards <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. Dysregulated encoding of SV may thus be a key substrate for continued decisions to take drugs. A small number of studies have investigated the neural correlates of drug-related decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. To our knowledge, only one has investigated neurobiological SV signals during drug-related decision-making, and that was in cigarette smokers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. SV encoding for other substances remains unexamined.</p><p>A second key outstanding question concerns the degree to which neural processing underlying drug-related decisions differs from that during choices about other rewards. Blunted valuation of non-drug rewards coupled with heightened drug valuation is theorized to contribute to the maintenance of SUDs <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. The only prior study assessing this question observed, in frequent cigarette smokers, normative SV signals for cigarettes but not for shop vouchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</p><p>A preferential disruption to valuation processes underlying non-drug versus drug reinforcers may influence treatment response <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, especially for treatments like contingency management, which requires that patients be motivated by non-drug rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>A third question concerns the mechanisms underlying the influence of drug-related cues on choices for drugs. In preclinical models, exposure to drug-paired stimuli elicits drug-seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. In humans, conditioned drug-related stimuli ('cues') elicit craving, and cue exposure usually, though not always, increases drug-taking <ref type="bibr">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. Despite the link between cue exposure and drug use, nothing is known about the impact of cues on SV encoding during drug choice.</p><p>Here, we used a highly-controlled experimental medicine approach to address these questions in a population that uses drugs. We studied cannabis-related choices because cannabis is the most commonly used controlled recreational drug globally, and problematic use continues to rise against a backdrop of changes to the drug's legality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>. We aimed to examine: (1) drug (cannabis) neural SV signals relative to (2) non-drug reward (snack food) neural SV signals, and (3) the influence of cues (cannabis, snack food, neutral) on drug and real.

On choice days, participants were maintained on a low salt, sugar and fat diet, i.e., they were not hungry, but the snacks would remain reinforcing. Participants knew that the only way to receive cannabis or palatable food on choice days was via their decisions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S1</ref> presents a schedule for choice days.

Multisensory cues preceding the fMRI task comprised visual, olfactory, tactile, and auditory stimuli. For cannabis, participants rolled a blunt/joint and smelled it. For snacks, they unwrapped, smelled and touched the snacks. For neutral cues, participants touched and smelled a scented candle and then gift-wrapped it (see Supplement).</p><p>Subjective effects of cues were measured with Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) before and after both the visual and multisensory cues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Choice Tasks</head><p>The behavioral choice tasks served to determine the fixed, individualized monetary alternative for that day's fMRI choice task, which was calculated as the estimated indifference point for 3 cannabis puffs or 3 snacks i.e., the monetary value equivalent to the worth of 3 puffs/snacks for that participant on that day (see Supplement). Participants made 30 choices between 0-6 puffs/snacks (dependent on condition) and monetary values from $0 to $30 to enable this calculation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>fMRI Choice Tasks</head><p>We used novel event-related fMRI tasks, based on previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, in which participants repeatedly chose between 0-6 cannabis puffs/snacks (dependent on condition) and the fixed monetary alternative determined in the behavioral task. A stable monetary alternative was used so that fMRI signal changes could be attributed to the changing SV of the cannabis/snack options. The individualized monetary value for 3 puffs/snacks was used as the alternative to ensure that choices would vary, and to approximately normalize choice behavior in the fMRI tasks so that differences in SV encoding could not be attributed to differences in behavior. fMRI tasks consisted of four runs of 35 choices presented in randomized order. The tasks ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) started with an Options screen presenting the cannabis/snack and monetary options; followed by a Choice screen, requiring a 1-5 response, where 1 (strong yes) or 2 (yes) was a choice for the left option, 4 (yes) or 5 (strong yes) was a choice for the right, and 3 (neutral) was determined by a coin toss (32); followed by a Decision screen, which highlighted the participant's choice; then a jittered inter-trial-interval. The decision strength ratings provided a behavioral measure of the participant's SV for that cannabis/snack option relative to the monetary option <ref type="bibr">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>, and was subsequently used for parametric modulation in analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>SUDs can be conceptualized as pathologies of decision-making <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. We used an experimental medicine approach to study the neural valuation of drug (cannabis) and non-drug (snack) rewards in people who use cannabis on a near-daily basis, following neutral and active (cannabis/snack) cues. We found positive cannabis SV signals within pre-specified ROIs (vmPFC, dPCC and VS), but the expected positive snack SV signals could not be detected. In the vmPFC and VS, cannabis SV signals were larger than snack SV signals. Additionally, within the dPCC, active cues had differential effects on cannabis and snack SV signals.</p><p>Numerous studies <ref type="bibr">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref> and meta-analyses <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12)</ref> have demonstrated that SV signals exist in a valuation network including the vmPFC, striatum, and dPCC. We observed cannabis SV signals in these regions, revealing that the brain's computation of value for cannabis functions as expected in near-daily cannabis users (comparable to that for non-drug rewards in other populations). This is contrary to theories that in addiction the valuation of drugs is impaired, with decision-making habitual <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. The only prior study to directly investigate neural SV signals in relation to substance use (19) also observed expected cigarette SV signals in cigarette smokers. Moreover, three other studies -while not modelling SV encoding -found that cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco users recruited valuation circuitry during drug purchase decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. This converges with current findings to indicate that the brain's computation of drug value is not "impaired" in frequent drug users.</p><p>Conversely, the expected snack SV signals were not observed. Several studies have investigated value computation guiding choices for food rewards (e.g., <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>; these have overwhelmingly reported SV signals for palatable food in the regions investigated. We therefore expected to observe positive snack SV signals. That these could not be detected with the fMRI measure employed -either in ROI-based or exploratory whole-brain analyses -may be indicative of dysregulation of the neural valuation of non-drug rewards in our sample. Similarly, weaker SV signals for shop vouchers (but not cigarettes) were found in the PCC of dependent compared to occasional cigarette smokers in a prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Together, these results support theories that non-drug reward value processing may be compromised in SUDs <ref type="formula">14</ref>, i.e., valuation system function may be moderated by reward type. It is possible that progressive changes to non-drug reward SV signaling plays a causal role in the pathophysiology of addiction, such that relative SV encoding for drug vs. non-drug rewards shifts during development of addiction <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. Disrupted SV processing for non-drug rewards may also have implications for treatment modalities aiming to engage patients with alternative rewards, like contingency management.</p><p>At a behavioral level, participants interacted with snack rewards in a typical way, as they did with cannabis rewards. They were motivated to receive snacks, willing to forego money in favor of snacks in choice tasks, and they responded to snack cues with increased craving.</p><p>Hence, the apparent lack of a typical SV signal for non-drug rewards warrants further investigation as a potential early marker of choice dysregulation in cannabis and other substance-using populations.</p><p>How might near-daily cannabis use itself affect valuation processes? The endocannabinoid system is thought to modulate reward circuitry <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref> and CB1 receptors are expressed densely in the vmPFC and VS <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. Frequent recent cannabis use could, via downregulation of the CB1 receptor (41), alter neural reward processing, as has been shown in some (42), but not all <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>, studies of people who regularly use cannabis. However, it remains unclear why such effects would preferentially affect SV encoding for non-drug, but not drug, rewards.</p><p>Our results are concordant with literature demonstrating that people who frequently use drugs are oftentimes economically rational, and not compulsive, when they use drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>.</p><p>Although the value assigned to drugs is higher in people with SUDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> and the SV signals potentially stronger <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, value-based decision-making about drugs remains intact.</p><p>Findings did not support our hypothesis that active cues would preferentially augment cannabis SV signals. In the dPCC, there was an interaction between reward and cue; the cannabis SV signals were differentially affected by the presence of active cues relative to snack SV signals. The PCC is thought to be particularly sensitive to cues and craving <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49)</ref>. A similar pattern was also observed in whole-brain analyses in the angular gyrus, another region considered important in the valuation network <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. This may indicate that the presence of cues weakens the relationship between encoding in some regions and subjective valuation of cannabis rewards. However, the current results do not present a clear picture regarding cue effects; further investigation into the impact of cues on drug SV encoding is therefore warranted.</p><p>As the first investigation of SV encoding in relation to cannabis use, this study had limitations. We did not include a non-cannabis-using control with which to compare the nondrug SV signals of the cannabis users. However, a wealth of evidence indicates that healthy participants show positive non-drug-reward SV signals in these ROIs <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>, including snack SV signals observed during a similar task <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. A second limitation was cue exposure occurred outside of the scanner, with some small delays between exposure and scan initiation.</p><p>This may have contributed to the relatively minor effects of the cues observed. To counter this, cues were designed to be highly potent (e.g., multisensory including engagement with personalized cannabis paraphernalia). However, future studies could valuably explore the possible impacts of value-encoding during choices for drugs in the presence of drug-paired cues, rather than after exposure. A third limitation is that we did not have sufficient power to assess the impact of factors such as gender, or variables known to be clinically-relevant markers in cannabis use, such as tobacco smoking.</p><p>Limitations notwithstanding, the current results suggest that this novel, controlled, multidisciplinary methodology represents a promising approach to further elucidate the neurobehavioral choice processes subserving the development and maintenance of substance use and SUDs. There are numerous potential avenues for future research. It remains unclear whether similar patterns of preferentially disrupted SV encoding would be observed in people using drugs other than cannabis and cigarettes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Similarly, the effects of state factors like withdrawal on SV encoding for drug and non-drug reinforcers in different populations remains unknown. A key question for future investigation will be the extent to which this apparent dysregulation is reversed over the course of treatment. To recover from SUDs, individuals need to engage with non-drug rewards; hence the extent to which SV encoding of non-drug rewards normalizes with treatment could have important implications for treatment outcomes.</p><p>This was the first study to investigate neural SV signals for a real, tangible, illicit drug: other studies of drug-related choice used hypothetical rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> or drug images <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> or studied legal drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. In near-daily cannabis users, cannabis SV signals were intact, while snack SV signals could not be detected, suggesting dysregulation of these neurobiological choice processes. Results suggest that near-daily cannabis use is associated with normative valuation of cannabis but compromised neural valuation of other rewards, providing support for the relevance of choice and decision processes in the pathophysiology of addiction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Data</head><p>When data met relevant assumptions, they were analyzed using repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA. RM-ANOVA used within-subjects factors of reward (cannabis, snack) and cue (active, neutral), and, depending on the analysis, time. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was employed when Mauchley's test of sphericity indicated departure from sphericity. Alpha was set at 0.05 for the omnibus ANOVAs. Significant main effects and interactions were followed up with local Bonferronicorrected t-tests. When data did not meet relevant assumptions, non-parametric Wilcoxon-Signed Ranks tests were conducted, with manually Bonferroni-adjusted alpha thresholds.</p><p>All behavioral data apart from demographic and drug use data were subject to winsorizing. Outliers were identified using Tukeys' method as data points that were greater than three times the interquartile range (IQR) from the lower quartile or upper quartile. These outliers were replaced with the closest non-outlying data point. Data were holistically examined for normality using: visual inspection of histograms; skewness and kurtosis scores &gt;1; and Kolmogrov-Smirnov tests.</p><p>Graphs were produced using winsorized data. All data are graphed using means and standard errors, even if data were non-normal.</p><p>Missing data were left missing in a pairwise fashion and not imputed. Missing behavioral data are highlighted in the relevant Results sub-sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective effects from sampling sessions (Figure S2)</head><p>The following clusters/variables were analyzed with RM ANOVA with within-subjects factors of time (1-8) and reward (cannabis, snack): tired, on edge, content and want cannabis. The following clusters were analyzed with Wilcoxon-Signed Rank tests due to substantive departures from normality: high, miserable, bad effect and confused. Within these four clusters, several outliers that were winsorized. Four participants were excluded from these analyses due to incomplete datasets (leaving n=17).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective effects of cues (Figure S3a-c)</head><p>For want cannabis, there was a substantive departure from normality, so we used nonparametric Wilcoxon-Signed Ranks tests. We compared pre-visual and post-multisensory cues want cannabis ratings within each cue day separately. Four outliers were winsorized in the postmultisensory cannabis-active condition. Data were missing for one participant (n=20).</p><p>For aroused, we conducted a RM ANOVA with factors of time (pre-visual cues, post-visual cues, pre-multisensory cues, post-multisensory cues), cue (neutral, active) and reward (cannabis, snack). For want snack we conducted a RM ANOVA with factors of time and cue, for the snack days only.</p></div>

On the active cue day, want snack was higher at post-multisensory cues compared to post-visual cues (t20=3.250, p=0.024) and to the pre-multisensory cues (t20=3.584, p=0.011), but there were no significant differences on the neutral cue day.

The only significant effect was time (F3,57=4.181, p=0.019, ηp 2 =0.180). All other terms were non-significant (ps&gt;0.095). Post-hoc t-tests showed that, compared to post-multisensory cues, all other timepoints had non-significantly lower aroused levels (pre-visual vs. post-multi: t19=2.495, p=0.132; post-visual vs. post-multi: t19=2.554, p=0.116; pre-multi vs. post-multi: t19=2.585, p=0.115).</p><p>This demonstrates that the cues increased craving for snacks and cues (operationalized as ratings of want cannabis and want a snack), with no effect on subjective arousal.</p><p>Indifference point in the behavioral choice task ( <ref type="figure">Figure S4)</ref>.</p><p>We conducted an RM-ANOVA with factors of reward and cue.

There was a main effect of reward (F1, 20=4.425, p=0.048, ηp2=0.181), with the indifference point for cannabis (Mean=USD1.46, SEM=0.229) higher than that for snacks (Mean=USD1.34, SEM=0.219).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proportion of choices for cannabis/snack (vs. money) during fMRI task</head><p>The average proportion of choices for cannabis or snacks were similar in each condition. Following active cues, cannabis was chosen 45.0% (SD=12.0) of the time, and following neutral cues, cannabis was chosen 40.7% (SD=16.7) of the time. Following active cues, snacks were chosen 41.8% (SD=11.0) of the time, and following neutral cues, snacks were chosen 39.4% (SD=18.8) of the time. There was no significant interaction between reward and cue (F1,19=0.097, p=0.758, ηp 2 =0.005) and no significant effect of cue (F1,19=2.588, p=0.124, ηp 2 =0.120) or reward (F1,19=0.370, p=0.550, ηp 2 =0.019).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Inclusion criteria were: (1) smokes cannabis ≥4 days/week (self-report and positive THC urine toxicology); (2) smokes ≥2 cannabis cigarettes/day-of-use; (3) aged 21-50 years old; (4) righthanded; and (5) using effective contraception (if female). Exclusion criteria were: (1) uses illicit drugs other than cannabis (&gt;2 days/week); (2) regularly smokes cannabis in forms other than 'blunts' or 'joints'; (3) requesting drug treatment; (4) current DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorder (1) requiring medical intervention; (5) contraindicated medical illness or medications; (6) contraindication for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); (7) clinically-significant dietary restraint (2); and (8) pregnant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic assessments</head><p>Educational level was measured as years spent in formal education. Race was self-reported as one of the following categories: Caucasian, African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Mixed. Ethnicity was self-reported as Hispanic or non-Hispanic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mental health assessments</head><p>During screening, Axis 1 psychiatric disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) (6). Depression symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (3) total score. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (4) total score. Exposure to traumatic events was measured using the Trauma Assessment for Adults (5) total score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug use assessments</head><p>Cannabis use was quantified via structured interview as: days/week of cannabis consumption, 'joints'/day on days when cannabis was used, and amount spent weekly on cannabis (USD). Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking were measured with days/week of use. Problematic cannabis consumption was measured using the 21-item Cannabis Problems Questionnaire (7) and the Marijuana Problem Scale <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. Problematic alcohol consumption was measured using the Short Michigan Alcohol Screening Test <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. Recent drug use was assessed using urine drug screens (5-Panel drug screen, All Test North America, Gilbert, AZ), alcohol breathalyzer tests (Select S80, BACTrack, San Francisco, CA), and a carbon monoxide monitor (Vitalgraph, Lenexa, KS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other baseline assessments</head><p>Biologically female participants were tested for pregnancy using a urine pregnancy test at screening and admission (Alere hCG Dipstick, Alere, Orlando, FL). All participants completed clinical blood tests and electrocardiogram during screening to assess for contraindicating medical conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice tasks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral choice tasks</head><p>A behavioral choice task was completed on each choice day before the fMRI scan. The purpose of this task was to estimate that participant's monetary value (i.e., the indifference price point) for 3 cannabis puffs or 3 snacks (dependent on condition) on that day. This represented the dollar value at which the participant was equally likely to choose 3 puffs/snacks or money. It was calculated using a logistic regression method <ref type="bibr">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11)</ref>. This value was then entered into the fMRI task as the stable monetary alternative <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. The value for 3 puffs/snacks was chosen as the midpoint between the total number of puffs/snacks available in the fMRI task (which had a range of 0-6 puffs/snacks), so that participants would vary their choices in the scanner and choice behavior between conditions would be approximately normalized. This aimed to allow us to isolate SV neural activity from</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-processing</head><p>Pre-processing was carried out using FSL (FMRIB Software Library, version 5.0.9, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) as in a previous study <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. For quality control, the raw fMRI data were first inspected to detect scanner or intensity inconsistencies, and to detect any obvious movement; next translational and rotational movement were checked for each run of data; and the two-step registration process was checked. Data were all acceptable, specifically no run of data showed a maximum movement of greater than 3.5mm (the size of one dimension of the voxel).</p><p>Standard pre-processing was applied, including brain extraction, motion correction (MCFLIRT), slice-timing correction, high pass temporal filtering (90-second cut-off) and spatial smoothing (5 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel). The anatomical images were subject to inhomogeneity correction using N4 bias field correction processes (ANT, http://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ants/) and FSL's Brain Extraction Tool (BET) process. Manual adjustments were made if required, to ensure that the brain was accurately extracted. <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Masking using Regions of Interest (ROI) (</head><p>Previous meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref> showed the vmPFC had three centers of activity: <ref type="bibr">[-2, 40, -6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[4, 30, -16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[-4, 60, -10]</ref>; the ventral striatum had two centers of activity: <ref type="bibr">[-10, 8, -6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[10, 12, -10]</ref>; and the dPCC had one center of activity: [0, <ref type="bibr">-34, 42]</ref>. Spheres were formed around these centers and combined to create three separate masks. The average diameter of the vmPFC spheres was 21mm, the average diameter of the ventral striatum was 15mm, and the dPCC sphere had a diameter of 15mm. These were used as masks for the primary analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First level analyses</head><p>The confounding regressor was used to scrub volumes exceeding a framewise displacement threshold of 0.9mm. The events were modelled as boxcar functions with the whole duration of the event and convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response, using the double-gamma function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary ROI analyses</head><p>We conducted secondary analyses in which we extracted average betas for SV signals from the ROIs described above. We analyzed the extracted betas using 2x2 RM ANOVAs. Extracted betas were winsorized before analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole brain analyses without masking</head><p>For hypotheses generation for future studies, we conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses using the same 2X2 RM ANOVAs, but without masking the third-level analyses with ROIs. We used a cluster-defining threshold of z=2.3 and a corrected cluster extent threshold of p&lt;0.05 using FWE. <ref type="table">Tables   Table S1</ref>.
