			<abstract>
				<p>Decision-making models of memory retrieval hold that across-trial variability in memory representations and within-trial variability in matching the contents of memory to the retrieval cue both contribute to variability in the speed and accuracy of retrieval decisions. In contrast, most recent studies of visual working memory (VWM) using continuous-outcome decision tasks, in which responses are made on continuous scales, do not distinguish between memory variability and decision-process variability in characterizing retrieval errors and are silent on decision times. We combined a successful model of continuous-outcome decisions, the circular diffusion model (CDM), with a peaked, heavy-tailed distribution of memory representations, the Jones-Pewsey distribution, to characterize the speed and accuracy of continuous-outcome decisions about the hues of saturated and desaturated color patches in four experiments that varied the difficulty of the decision task and the memory load of the VWM task. The CDM provided a good account of the marginal and joint distributions of response times and response errors and the anisotropies of stimuli in different parts of the color space across all experiments. VWM precision followed either an inverse square-root law or power law in set size, depending on saturation, as predicted by sample-size and attention-weighted sample-size models, respectively. The results support a model in which the capacity limits of VWM reflect the statistical properties of a population of noisy neurons that are divided among items in memory under attentional control and determine the precision of recalled items.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The idea that memory retrieval involves an evidence accumulation decision process was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Ratcliff (1978)</ref>, who characterized memory retrieval in two-choice decision tasks as a Brownian motion, or Wiener, diffusion process, with normally-distributed drift rates. Ratcliff assumed that the drift rate, which determines the rate at which the diffusion process accumulates evidence, is normally distributed across trials, representing variability in the quality of the information entering the decision process from memory. An implication of his analysis is that distinct sources of variability contribute to the speed and accuracy of retrieval decisions: across-trial variability in memory representations and within-trial variability in the process of matching the contents of memory to the retrieval cue. The first of these sources of variability is represented by drift rate variability; the second is represented by moment-to-moment diffusive variability in the evidence accumulation process. Prior to Ratcliff's work, signal detection theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966</ref>) was used to model both perceptual and memory-based decisions -as it continues to be used today <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Wixted, 2020)</ref>. However, signal detection models are unable to distinguish between memory variability and decision-process variability and, critically, are unable to predict empirically observed decision times.</p><p>Recent studies using continuous-outcome tasks to study retrieval from visual working memory (VWM) have raised new questions about the memory and decision processes that determine the speed and accuracy of retrieval. In VWM tasks, subjects make decisions about members of sets of briefly-presented perceptual stimuli that have been stored in memory. Continuous-outcome VWM tasks use continuously-distributed perceptual attributes like color and orientation as stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Wilken &amp; Ma, 2004)</ref> and the decisions about them are expressed on continuous spatial scales. Studies of VWM using both two-choice and continuous-outcome decisions have shown that VWM is sharply capacity-limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Phillips, 1974)</ref>, possibly to as few as three or four items <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pashler, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cowan, 2001)</ref>. It therefore represents a significant bottleneck in the translation of perception into action. Understanding the capacity limitations of the human processing system has been one of the main aims of cognitive psychology since the foundational work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Broadbent (1958)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kahneman (1973)</ref> and the study of VWM capacity has accordingly been one of the most heavily researched areas during the last two decades.</p><p>Our aim in this article is to use a successful model of continuous-outcome decisions, the circular diffusion model (CDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Smith, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Smith, , 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al., , 2022</ref> to study the speed and accuracy of VWM retrieval and to provide a theoretical characterization of the memory and decision processes involved and of the relationship between them. Like the original diffusion model, the CDM models the decision process as evidence accumulation by a Wiener diffusion process, but in two evidence dimensions (2D), which define the Cartesian axes of a circular space, rather than one. Also like that model, it assumes that across-trial variability in evidence entering the decision process and within-trial variability in evidence accumulation both contribute to the speed and accuracy of retrieval. We combine the CDM with a flexible model of across-trial variability in memory representations, the Jones-Pewsey distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jones &amp; Pewsey, 2005)</ref>, to characterize how memory precision varies with set size and stimulus discriminability.  used the Jones-Pewsey distribution to model across-trial variability in stimulus encoding in a continuous-outcome decision task that used noise-perturbed color patches as stimuli. They showed that the distribution characterized drift rates in the CDM as a function of stimulus noise, including trials on which noise caused perceptual encoding to fail and responses to be very inaccurate. We show that the combination of the CDM and a Jones-Pewsey memory distribution (the JP-CDM model) provides a good account of the joint distributions of accuracy and decision times in four experiments that varied the cognitive load of the memory task (Experiments 1 and 2) and the difficulty of the decision task (Experiments 3 and 4).</p><p>We show that the estimated parameters of the JP-CDM model behave in simple and interpretable ways as both memory load and the difficulty of the perceptual matching task are varied, and provide evidence for a sample-size model of VWM capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Palmer, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schneegans et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">, Sewell et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Smith et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Tomić &amp; Bays, 2024)</ref>. The sample-size model conceives of VWM as a limited-capacity resource made up of noisy evidence samples, which can be interpreted as activity in a population of statistically variable Poisson neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bays, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schneegans et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Smith, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith &amp; Sewell, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sewell et al. (2014)</ref> showed that the sample-size model provided a parameter-free account of retrieval accuracy as a function of set size and exposure duration in a two-choice VWM task that used decisions about oriented grating patches.  subsequently showed that a diffusion process model in which drift rates follow the sample-size model successfully characterized the speed and accuracy of decisions in this task at the level of the response time (RT) distributions for correct responses and errors.  showed that a sample-size process in which the evidence samples are allocated unequally among items led to an increase in the set-size effect that could be described by a more general power law. In this article we show that the same combination of a sample-size memory representation and a diffusion decision process can account for retrieval performance in continuous-outcome VWM tasks. Our article therefore provides a theoretical bridge between, and unification of, two complementary approaches to the study of VWM retrieval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concepts and Controversies in Visual Working Memory</head><p>The catalysts for the contemporary study of VWM include: the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Phillips (1974)</ref>, who provided evidence for a purely visual form of short-term memory that does not rely on verbal, or articulatory, codes; the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Luck and Vogel (1997)</ref> who showed that the capacity of VWM for such material depends on the number of stored objects irrespective of their complexity (although limits on this property were later identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alvarez and Cavanagh (2004)</ref>); and the integrative review of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cowan (2001)</ref>, who argued that, for most people, the capacity limit of VWM is around four items. Cowan suggested that the number four constitutes a "magical number" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Miller's (1956)</ref> sense of the term in recognition of this fact. Most early studies of VWM followed Phillips and used some version of a change detection task, in which subjects decided whether there was a change in the second of two consecutively presented visual arrays, either anywhere in the array, or at a location probed at the time of the second array, and made a yes/no decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Donkin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Vogel et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Wilken &amp; Ma, 2004)</ref>. A smaller number of studies have used a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task in combination with <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Downing's (1988)</ref> poststimulus probe method, which she developed to study attention in briefly-presented, near-threshold, visual displays, in which a decision is made about a single location that is probed after display offset <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Palmer, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lilburn et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sewell et al., 2014;</ref>. Changes in accuracy as a function of set size in both change detection and 2AFC tasks can be characterized using signal detection methods. Some studies have used confidence ratings combined with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which can again be characterized using signal detection methods <ref type="bibr">(Donkin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rouder et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The first study to use a continuous-outcome decision task to investigate VWM was that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Wilken and Ma (2004)</ref>, who used the task, along with a change-detection task, to investigate VWM for color, orientation, and spatial frequency. The continuous-outcome task is a contemporary version of the method of adjustment of classical psychophysics, in which sensory thresholds were measured by asking subjects to adjust the intensity of a variable stimulus until it matched a standard <ref type="bibr">(Woodworth &amp; Schlossberg, 1954)</ref>. It was reintroduced to modern psychology by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blake et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prinzmetal et al. (1998)</ref> to study VWM for motion and the effects of attention on perceptual variability, respectively, and was adapted by Wilken and Ma to study VWM. Unlike two-choice tasks, which yield a single error proportion in each condition, continuous-outcome tasks yield entire distributions of errors, which characterize the distance between the true stimulus value and the value recalled by the subject on each trial as a function of memory load. The typical distribution of errors is a peaked, heavy-tailed distribution, with a bell-shaped central region flanked by flat tails. The usual experimental finding is that the precision of the central region -defined as the reciprocal of the standard deviation -decreases with increasing set size while the height of the tails increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Wilken &amp; Ma, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Zhang &amp; Luck, 2008)</ref>. Many VWM researchers have come to prefer continuous-outcome tasks to two-choice tasks because they offer increased data degrees of freedom for model testing.</p><p>Since the introduction of the continuous-outcome task to VWM research, a rich body of theory has grown up around it, which has tried to explain why distributions of errors have the form they do and why they change in systematic ways with set size. The first wave of theories contrasted item-capacity limited models (colloquially, "slot models") and resource models. Slot models assume that the distribution of errors comprises a mixture of high-accuracy responses, associated with items in memory, and uniformly-distributed guesses, associated with items that are not <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Awh et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rouder et al., 2008)</ref>. These two components make up the bell-shaped central region and the heavy tails of the error distribution, respectively. As the set size increases relative to the item-capacity limit, the probability of guessing increases, which reduces the height of the central peak and increases the height of the tails. Resource models represent memory as an allocatable resource, which can be concentrated on a few items or distributed among many <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bays et al., 2009)</ref>, as first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kahneman's (1973)</ref> capacity model of attention. As set size increases and the share of the resources available to each item decreases, memory precision also decreases. In pure resource models the share of resources allocated to any item never goes to zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bays &amp; Husain, 2008)</ref>, regardless of set size, but in working versions of the model, like that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bays et al. (2009)</ref>, resource allocation is augmented with guessing and swap errors. The latter arise from misreports of distractor items at unprobed locations and are interpreted as failures of feature binding. Guessing and swap errors both increase the probability of very inaccurate responses on some trials and contribute probability mass to the tails of the error distribution. Importantly, slot models and resource models are not mutually exclusive: Resource limitations may exist within slot limits and are theoretically compatible with them. For example, the slots-plus-averaging model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Zhang and Luck (2008)</ref>, which is related theoretically to the sample-size model discussed below, conceives of memory as a set of noisy, allocatable slots, and so can be viewed as a form of hybrid slots-plus-resources model.</p><p>The second wave of theories, comprises the variable precision models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fougnie et al. (2012)</ref> and van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Berg et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Berg et al. ( , 2014</ref> and the interference model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Oberauer and Lin (2017)</ref>. These models sought to move beyond the basic slots versus resources dichotomy and to capture features of the error distributions that simpler forms of the models could not. Instead of assuming that items in memory are represented with a constant precision, the variable-precision models assume that precision varies randomly across items and trials. Fougnie et al. modeled variable precision with a wrapped t-distribution; van den Berg et al. modeled it with a power-law with a randomly varying exponent. Variable precision is closely related to the idea, mentioned earlier and developed in relation to the JP-CDM model below, that the drift rate in the diffusion model varies randomly across trials. Van den Berg et al.'s model replaces the idea of fixed slots with a probabilistic encoding process, such that the number of items encoded into VWM on any trial varies randomly according to a Poisson distribution with a given mean. Poisson encoding imposes a form of "soft slots" constraint that can be interpreted as expressing the metabolic cost of VWM encoding, as distinct from earlier models in which the number of slots was treated as a hard-wired property of the cognitive system. Van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Berg et al. (2014)</ref> reported that the variable precision model with Poisson item encoding performed better than competitor slot and resources model, including the slots-plus-averaging model, on 10 published data sets.</p><p>The interference model assumes that performance decreases with increasing set size, not because of limits in the storage capacity of VWM, but because items in memory interfere with one another, as assumed in other areas of working memory research <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Oberauer et al., 2012)</ref>, such that the amount of interference increases with the number of stored items.</p><p>Response accuracy in the model is represented by a Luce choice rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Luce, 1959)</ref>, in which the response strength of the cued item is divided by the sum of the strengths of competitor items. Although it is formalized in a different way, the response rule in the interference model endows it with similar properties to those of normalization models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carandini &amp; Heeger, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Reynolds &amp; Heeger, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith &amp; Sewell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Smith et al., 2015)</ref>, in which competitive interactions among items lead to divisive normalization of the item strengths, so that the strength of any item representation is divided by the sum of the strengths of other, active items. Smith and Sewell showed that a suitably-scaled competitive interaction model with divisive normalization implements the sample-size model. In one sense, then, models like the sample-size model, which is a resource model, and divisive normalization or interference models are not mutually exclusive, but can instead be seen as complementary ways to characterize the same phenomena.</p><p>The third wave of theories comprises the population code models, including the target confusability competition (TCC) model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schurgin et al. (2020)</ref>, the neural resource model of Bays and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bays, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Schneegans &amp; Bays, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Schneegans et al., 2016)</ref>, and a miscellany of models that share properties of these models that <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Oberauer (2023)</ref> termed "measurement models." An illuminating analysis of these models was provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Tomić and Bays (2024)</ref>. Population code models assume that the memory representation of a stimulus consists of a uniformly-distributed array of noisy detectors, together with a tuning function that describes how strongly a detector at a particular location responds to stimuli at other locations. The location of the peak of the tuning function corresponds to the detector's preferred stimulus and the shape of the tuning function describes how its response decreases as a function of distance in stimulus space. For commonly-used stimuli like isoluminant colors, orientation, and direction of motion, the stimulus space is circular and the detectors are arranged around the perimeter of a circle ±π rad. (±180 • ). The tuning function in the TCC model was derived theoretically from <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Shepard's (1987)</ref> exponential law of generalization and estimated from perceptual similarity judgments using the scaling method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Maloney and Yang (2003)</ref>. The similarity function is well described by a Laplace distribution, which consists of a pair of back-to-back exponential distributions, suitably scaled <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Oberauer, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Tomić &amp; Bays, 2024)</ref>. (The Laplace distribution is sometimes termed the "double exponential" distribution, but this terminology is also used for the Gumbel distribution, which has distribution function exp(−e −x ), so is probably best avoided.) The outputs of the detectors in the TCC model are independently perturbed by Gaussian (normally-distributed) noise, and the response on any trial is given by the most strongly responding detector. These kinds of maximum-of-outputs, or, more briefly, MAX, models -which may be thought of as generalized signal detection models -are widely used to model decision accuracy in sensory psychophysics and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Eckstein et al, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Palmer et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Graham et al., 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Schurgin et al. showed that the VWM error distribution can be predicted from the empirical tuning function and an amplitude parameter, which determines the peak response of the detector, which varies with set size. The theoretical interest of their work is they showed empirically that the shape of the tuning function and the amplitude are separable (our terminology, not theirs): The amplitude of the tuning function varied with set size but its shape, as characterized by the exponential similarity parameter, remained constant. A related result was reported earlier for a two-choice task by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lilburn et al. (2019)</ref>, who studied VWM for the orientations of sinusoidal gratings. They found that accuracy was well-described by a combination of a separable tuning function, modeled, as is common in visual psychophysics, as a Gaussian density <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Thomas &amp; Gille, 1979)</ref>, and a samplesize-dependent amplitude parameter. As in Schurgin et al.'s study, the tuning parameter (the Gaussian standard deviation σ) remained constant across stimulus exposure duration and set size while the amplitude parameter varied. It was not the case, as might have been predicted, that channel tuning worsened with increasing set size. Rather, across three different stimulus exposure durations and four different set sizes the channel tuning remained constant and only the amplitude, expressed as signal detection d ′ , changed.</p><p>The demonstrations of separable tuning and amplitude parameters in the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schurgin et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lilburn et al. (2019)</ref> are important theoretically because they identify invariants of the underlying memory representations -that is, properties that remain unaltered as set size or perceptual encoding changes. Outside of psychology, the search for invariants is an important part of the discovery of physical laws, because they identify properties of a physical system that remain unaltered as its superficial features, like the coordinates in which it is represented, change. Indeed, a deep theorem in classical mechanics, Noether's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Noether, 1918)</ref>, asserts that associated with every symmetry (i.e., invariant) of a physical system is a conservation law, and vice versa. The search for invariants of VWM is one of the main themes of this article, which we characterize via the parameters of the Jones-Pewsey distribution, as described below.</p><p>The neural resource model of Bays and colleagues is similar to the TCC model, in that it also consists of an array of noisy detectors and a tuning function, but the latter is a bellshaped, von Mises, distribution rather than a Laplace distribution and the noise is Poisson distributed rather than normally distributed and is assumed to reflect the firing rates in a population of Poisson neurons. As in the TCC, the tuning function describes how the firing rate of a neuron tuned to a particular stimulus attribute (color, orientation, direction, etc.) changes as a function of distance in stimulus space. The response rule in the model is described as "maximum likelihood decoding," which essentially means it is based on the point of maximum activity in the neural population, like the signal detection MAX model in the TCC model. There is a finite pool of neurons available to represent items in memory, which means the number of neurons available to represent an item is inversely proportional to set size. Because of the statistics of Poisson processes, the model predicts that decoding precision will follow a sample-size relationship (Schneegans et al., 2020). Smith <ref type="formula">2015</ref>derived a diffusion decision model for two-choice VWM based on pairs of excitatory and inhibitory Poisson processes and showed that the drift rate follows a sample-size model while the diffusion coefficient, which describes moment-to-moment variability in evidence accumulation, remains constant. The model provides a neural resource interpretation of the sample-size diffusion model used to fit RT and accuracy data from a two-choice VWM task by <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sewell et al. (2016)</ref>. The work of Bays and colleagues implies that the same scaling relationship can be expected to hold in continuous-outcome VWM decisions as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Tomić and Bays (2024)</ref> compared the neural resource model to several versions of the TCC model on four VWM tasks: a color task; an orientation task; a source memory task, in which subjects were cued with a colored dot and recalled the location at which it had previously been presented; and a task that used circularly-distributed abstract shapes developed by <ref type="bibr">Li et al. (2020)</ref>. They compared the neural resource model to two different versions of the TCC model, one in which the exponential tuning parameter was estimated from a perceptual similarity task, as was done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schurgin et al. (2020)</ref>, and another in which it was estimated directly from the VWM data. In both cases, the neural resource model performed better than the TCC model and they showed that the reason for its better performance was because of the difference in the tuning functions rather than the noise distributions. A version of the TCC model with a von Mises tuning function, Gaussian noise, and a signal detection MAX rule performed better than the original Laplace-tuning form of the model. Oberauer (2023) generalized these findings by considering population code models in which he factorially compared different tuning functions, noise distributions, and response rules. Specifically, he compared models with Laplace and von Mises tuning functions, and models with Gaussian and Gumbel noise, and models with either a signal detection MAX or a Luce choice model decision rule -the latter as assumed in the interference model. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Tomić and Bays (2024)</ref>, he found the best model combined a von Mises tuning function and a MAX decision rule, while the choice of noise function mattered relatively little. He highlighted the theoretically interesting special case of the Gumbel noise model, for which the MAX rule and the Luce choice model become identical. Proof of the equivalence of the two decision rules with Gumbel noise is due to Holman and Marley <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Luce, 1994)</ref> and was given by <ref type="bibr">Yellott (1977, Theorem 5)</ref>. (Yellott calls the Gumbel distribution the "double exponential.") Oberauer reported that, to a good approximation, the width or precision of the tuning function appears to remain relatively constant across set size, in agreement with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schurgin et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lilburn et al. (2019)</ref>. As we show below, a somewhat different picture emerges when we combine a model of VWM representation with a diffusion decision process in the JP-CDM and we consider why this might be the case in the General Discussion.</p><p>An attractive features of the population code models, shared with the variable precision and interference models, is that they move the field beyond the slots versus resources debate, which has remained unresolved after more than two decades of research. A recent attempt to settle the issue was made by Adam et al. (2017) who used a free-recall, wholereport task in which subjects tried to recall every item in the display in whatever order they preferred. On average, recall was in order of inverse item strength (best to worst) and, for six item displays, accuracy for the last and the next-to-last recalled items was indistinguishable from chance, which Adam et al. interpreted as evidence for a fouritem slot limit. However, Oberauer (2022) tried to replicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adam et al. (2017)</ref> (his Experiment 4) and found better-than-chance recall for the last two recalled items from six item displays. The reason for the difference between the two studies remains unclear, but may simply reflect different amounts of time on task: Oberauer tested his subjects over four one-hour sessions whereas Adam et al. tested them in a single 90 min session and it may be that subjects become better at encoding larger set sizes with practice. 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bays et al. (2011)</ref> showed that VWM encoding is slower for large set sizes, implying it is not effortless, and we know from automaticity studies that effortful tasks can become less so with practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Shiffrin &amp; Schneider, 1977)</ref>. Graded slot-like behavior as a function of changes in encoding efficiency would only be possible if the number of items encoded reflects resource-dependent properties of the cognitive system rather than hard slot limits, which should be immune to practice effects.</p><p>Graded slot-like behavior is consistent both with variable precision models with Poissondistributed item encoding, as proposed by van den Berg et al. <ref type="formula">2014</ref>, and with population code models. The latter assume that performance depends on the height of the peak of the encoding function relative to the background noise in the detector array. Poorly-encoded stimuli will be associated with lower amplitudes and their memory representations will tend to become submerged in the noise floor of the detector array, leading to near-chance performance. This is a graded rather than an all-or-none phenomenon, and if encoding quality varies randomly among items in a display on individual trials, as proposed by variable precision models, then individual differences in encoding efficiency could either produce chance performance on the last-recalled items from large displays, as found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adam et al. (2017)</ref> or poor, but better-than-chance performance, as found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Oberauer (2022)</ref>.</p><p>Evidence for graded slot-like behavior was provided by a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Donkin et al. (2016)</ref>, who investigated performance on a change-detection task in which set sizes of 2, 4, 6, and 8 items were either blocked across sessions or randomized across trials. They found stronger evidence for item-capacity limits when set sizes were randomized than when they were blocked and argued that blocked set sizes made subjects more "resource-like" whereas unblocked set sizes made them more "slot-like." The message from their study seems to be that subjects are more likely to be able to encode large set sizes if they are predictable than if they are unpredictable. The estimated item-capacity parameter in Donkin et al.'s model was in the range of three to four items, suggesting some degree of underlying slot-like 1 Partial support for this conjecture comes from an unpublished study from our laboratory by King (2022), which used the procedure of Adam et al. <ref type="formula">2017</ref>and Oberauer's (2022) Experiment 4. King collected data over three one-hour sessions and, like Oberauer, found better-than-chance performance for the last two recalled items from six-item displays.</p><p>behavior. Its context-dependence is inconsistent with a hard-slots limit, but is consistent with a soft-slots constraint like the one in the variable precision model, in which the average number of items in VWM reflects the cognitive effort of encoding. We report results related to those of Donkin et al. in our Experiments 1 and 2, in which we found that VWM precision depends not only on the set size on a trial but also on the range of set sizes within a block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current State of the VWM Literature</head><p>VWM research over the last few decades has yielded a body of well-replicated findings and sophisticated theory, but also shows some significant limitations. For our purposes, the most important of the established findings is that heavy-tailed error distributions do not necessarily imply a guessing process and do not require an item-capacity model to explain them -although they are broadly consistent with such models. Variable precision models, interference models, and population code models all have mechanisms that can predict heavy-tailed error distributions without item-capacity limits. Resource models can also predict these distributions if they are augmented with swap errors and guessing. The next most important finding is that, if there are item-capacity limits, then they are more likely to be soft limits, as characterized by Poisson encoding in van den Berg et al.'s (2014) model, rather than hard limits, as the colloquial usage "slot model" would imply. Item-capacity limits, when they appear, are more likely to reflect the cognitive effort of the encoding process rather than any hard-wired property of the memory system and are likely to be affected by variables like practice and features of the context, like predictability, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Donkin et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>The first limitation is that the literature has become increasingly paradigm-bound. Contemporary theories of VWM have become, in practice, theories about the shapes of error distributions in continuous-outcome tasks. An exception is <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schurgin et al. (2020)</ref>, who showed that signal detection d ′ from a 2AFC VWM task using perceptually nonconfusable stimuli scales linearly with the TCC amplitude parameter from a continuous-outcome VWM task. Apart from them, however, most studies have not tried to characterize the relationship between different kinds of decision task or to analyze its theoretical implications. In his original paper on the diffusion model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Ratcliff (1978)</ref> deprecated the paradigm-bound memory research of the era and proposed the diffusion model as a retrieval mechanism that could unify multiple paradigms. We propose the JP-CDM model in the spirit of the ideas in his article.</p><p>The second limitation is that existing theories do not distinguish the independent contributions made by memory and decision processes to retrieval errors. Some studies have acknowledged the role played by variability in either perceptual or motor processes and have attempted to correct the distribution of retrieval errors in some way. Van den Berg et al. (2014) assumed a component of motor error is added to the retrieval error to determine the total error on any trial. Tomić and Bays (2024) assumed that perceptual variability during stimulus encoding affects the similarity function and used an empirical estimate of perceptual variability to correct for it. However, many other studies have more or less tacitly proceeded as if the empirical error distribution were a veridical representation of the variability of memory. These approaches suffer from the limitation that they lack a well-articulated theory of the decision process that specifies how the decision process and memory jointly determine observed precision.</p><p>The third limitation, which is intimately related to the preceding two, is that existing models of VWM retrieval explain only one margin, or dimension, of what is in reality a 2D joint distribution of decision outcomes and RTs. Studies of the RT and accuracy of continuous-outcome decisions have shown the joint distributions possess a rich empirical structure that is highly constraining for model testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kvam, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kvam et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ratcliff, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al., , 2022</ref>. Models like the JP-CDM we develop here assume that across-trial variability in memory representations determines the drift rate of a diffusion process. This combines with diffusive variability in the evidence accumulation process to determine both the speed and accuracy of responding. The critical difference from existing theories of VWM is that, even if there were no variability in VWM -that is, if the value of the stimulus attribute retrieved from memory were a perfectly faithful representation of the presented stimulus -then the JP-CDM would still predict trial-to-trial variability in the speed and accuracy of responding. Indeed, under these circumstances it predicts von Mises distributions of decision outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Smith, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Smith, , 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al., , 2022</ref>, as discussed below. This property of the model is striking because many existing VWM models represent the error distribution as a mixture of von Mises components. Consequently, there is a natural interlock between models like the variable precision model that assumes a continuous distribution of von Mises error components and the JP-CDM, which predicts von Mises components from the properties of the evidence accumulation process. The ability of the JP-CDM to distinguish independent contributions of memory variability and decision process variability comes from the additional constraints provided by the joint distributions of error and RT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Sample-Size Model</head><p>The sample-size model can be thought of as a form of resource model in which the resource is a set of independent, noisy, evidence samples that are recruited to represent stimuli. It can be given a neural interpretation by assuming that the evidence samples characterize firing rates in a population of Poisson neurons, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Smith (2015)</ref> and Bays and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bays, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schneegans et al. 2020)</ref>. In VWM applications, memory is resource-limited because the population of samples (neurons) available to represent items is finite and fewer samples are available to represent each item as the number of items in memory is increased. The predictions of the model follow from elementary sampling theory, specifically, from the fact that the standard error of the mean of a sample is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. In signal detection applica-tions to VWM, the model predicts that d ′ for an m-item display will be proportional to d ′ for a single-item display, with a constant of proportionality equal to the inverse square-root of the set size, because the samples must be distributed among m items. Symbolically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d ′ m = d ′ 1 √ m .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The model has found a diverse range of applications in psychology, including cross-modal attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bonnel &amp; Hafter, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bonnel &amp; Miller, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Lindsay et al., 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Taylor et al., 1967)</ref>, divided attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Eckstein et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Palmer, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Shaw, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Shaw, , 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Shaw, , 1984</ref>, and object-based attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Corbett &amp; Smith, 2017)</ref>. Corbett and Smith, for example, found a √ 2 cost in an object-based attention task when decisions required attentional selection of a pair of simultaneous targets into VWM, compared to when they required only one target. The earliest account of the sample-size idea we are aware of was given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Swets et al. (1959)</ref> who reported a square-root law improvement in auditory detection sensitivity in a "multiple look" task as a function of the number of presentations of a stimulus, which they attributed to integration of information across samples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lilburn and Smith (2020)</ref> adapted this idea in a multiple-look VWM experiment in which some stimuli were presented in either the first, the second, or both of two observation intervals, each of 50 ms or 100 ms duration, presented 400 ms apart. VWM sensitivity, as measured by d ′ m , showed a √ 2 improvement for stimuli that were presented in both intervals as compared to those that were presented in only one of them, while performance as a whole followed the sample size model, where m was defined as the total number of filled display locations across the two intervals. These results are striking in showing that the sample-size model successfully predicts both the costs of increasing set size and the benefits of redundancy in the same experimental task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Palmer (1990)</ref> found evidence for a sample-size model in a divided attention task using the poststimulus probe method, in which the probe both identified the target and acted as a reference standard for a 2AFC decision about it. He found that difference thresholds, defined as the minimum stimulus difference needed to achieve 79% accuracy using an adaptive staircase procedure, followed a sample-size model for displays of 1, 2, and 4 items. Palmer attributed the set size effect to divided attention rather than VWM capacity, but noted that divided attention sets a limit "on how much visual information is remembered from a brief presentation." <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sewell et al. (2014)</ref> argued that the sample-size relationship is a measure of VWM capacity rather than attentional capacity per se and showed that Equation 1 holds both for simultaneous presented items, like those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Palmer's (1990)</ref> study, and also for successively presented items, in which only one item is present in the display at a time. Indeed, there was a slight statistical advantage for simultaneously presented items, but the effect was very small (the error bars were almost completely overlapping), which is the opposite to what would be predicted if the set size effect were due to divided attention. There has been some debate about whether the simultaneous versus successive manipulation can effectively distinguish the capacity limitations of attention from those of VWM <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bundesen, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sewell et al., 2018)</ref>, because of the confounding effects of attentional dwell times <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Duncan, 1994)</ref>, which may result in capacity being allocated to empty display locations. However, the virtually identical estimates of d ′ m found for simultaneous and successive presentation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sewell et al. (2014)</ref> makes an attentional capacity explanation unlikely. The dwell-time argument seems to equate the attentional load to the number of potentially filled rather than actually filled display locations, in which case the model would not predict a set size effect at all.</p><p>The slots-plus-averaging model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Zhang and Luck (2008)</ref> is related theoretically to the sample-size model, and appears to have been inspired in part by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Palmer's (1990)</ref> article, but the two models should not be confused. The slots-plus-averaging model is like the sample-size model except that the number of samples is identified with the number of slots, estimated by Zhang and Luck to be around four. When there are fewer items in the display than there are slots, the model assumes that redundant copies of some display items will be stored in the available vacant slots, leading to a √ 2 improvement in precision for items that are stored twice. We can think of the model as a "coarse-quantized sample-size model," to distinguish it from the original. Zhang and Luck made the coarse-quantization assumption because of the way in which VWM precision changed (or failed to change) with a predictive precue. They expected that precision for cued items would be high because all of the samples would be concentrated on the cued item, but they found only a small increase compared with neutral (uncued) items. That cues did not improve precision in the expected way suggested to them there must be some resolution limit on precision, which they argued was captured by the coarse quantization assumption, which limits the precision with which any item can be represented. From the perspective of the theory developed in this article, what is missing from Zhang and Luck's analysis is a recognition of the role played by decision processes. As described above, in the JP-CDM the effect of noise in the decision process means that errors will follow a von Mises distribution, even if mnemonic fidelity is perfect. To put this in other terms, the slots-plus-averaging model equates mnemonic precision with the empirical precision of the error distribution whereas the JP-CDM views mnemonic precision and empirical precision as different things.</p><p>The slots-plus-averaging model has been tested empirically and found to perform more poorly than competitor models <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fougnie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Oberauer &amp; Lin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">van den Berg et al. 2014</ref>), as we noted above. However, these tests should not be mistaken for tests of the sample-size model in general, but only of the coarse-quantized version of it. Apart from the comparatively poor empirical performance of the slots-plus-averaging model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sewell et al. (2014)</ref> highlighted an unattractive theoretical feature of it, namely, that it seems to require a complex bookkeeping system to implement the proposed storage and retrieval process. To obtain the proposed benefits of redundant coding, the bookkeeping system would need to tag each slot with the identity of the item stored there, keep track of the relationship between slots and items during the retention interval, and then reassemble a representation of redundantly coded items at recall by combining the contents of the slots that contain the item. It is difficult to envisage the kind of neurocomputational mechanism that could implement such a storage and retrieval scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Power Law Generalization</head><p>The sample-size model provides a parsimonious account of the set-size effect in many 2AFC VWM studies, but does not hold universally. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bays and Husain (2008)</ref>, for example, found that the set-size effect in a change discrimination task was better described by a power law relationship, which predicts a larger set-size effect than the one predicted by the sample-size model. Bays and Husain used the inverse standard deviation of the psychometric function relating stimulus strength to accuracy as a measure of precision instead of d ′ . The two measures should scale in the same way with memory load because the standard deviation of the psychometric function corresponds (at least approximately) to the standard deviation of the noise distribution in the denominator of d ′ . Expressed in signal detection terms, the power law model holds that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d ′ m = d ′ 1 m −β ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where β is a free exponent, which Bays and Husain estimated to be β = 0.74. The samplesize model is a special case of the power law model with β = 0.5 because m −0.5 = 1/ √ m.</p><p>Bays and Husain's estimate of the exponent is appreciably greater than this. There have a been numerous reports of set-size effects using 2AFC, change detection, and continuous-outcome tasks, some of which have found a sample-size relationship and some of which have found effects that are better described by a more general power law. As noted above, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lilburn et al. (2019)</ref> found that the set-size effect for 1 to 4 items in a 2AFC fine orientation discrimination task with grating stimuli was well-described by a tunedchannel model with a separable memory strength parameter that followed the sample-size model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sewell et al. (2014)</ref> reanalyzed data from a change detection task by <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Vogel et al. (2006)</ref> and again found the set-size effect for sets of 1 to 4 items was well-described by the sample-size model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Donkin et al. (2016)</ref> fitted a resources-within-slots model to data from a change-detection task that used displays of up to eight items and found the set-size effect in d ′ was well-described by the power law model of Equation 2. They did not report an exponent in their article, but the estimated value was very close to 0.5, which is the sample-size model <ref type="bibr">(Donkin, personal communication, April 2, 2016)</ref>. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Smith et al. (2016)</ref> ran a version of the 2AFC VWM task of <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sewell et al. (2016)</ref> using a phase discrimination judgment in which subjects decided whether Gaussian-filtered, luminous disks were darker on the left or the right side. Unlike the orientation judgment used by Sewell et al., visual search for phase targets is attention-demanding and likely requires serial search <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Thornton &amp; Gilden, 2007)</ref>. Smith et al. characterized the set size effect in the phase discrimination task using a generalization of Equation 1 in which they treated m in the denominator as a free parameter that they estimated from the data, which they termed the "effective set size." For displays of 1, 2, 3, and 4 items the estimated effective set sizes were 1, 3.2, 5.5, and 7.7, which corresponds fairly closely to a power law with β = 0.75, in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bays and Husain (2008)</ref>.</p><p>Estimates of the set-size effect in continuous-outcome tasks, using a range of different set sizes, have yielded values that tend to be larger than the one predicted by the samplesize model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schurgin et al. (2020)</ref> commented that the set-size effect in their data, as characterized by the d ′ m amplitude of the similarity function in the TCC model, appear to follow a power law. They did not report an exponent but the values of d ′ m for sets sizes 1 to 8 are well-described by a power law with an exponent of around β = 0.75. Van den Berg et al. <ref type="formula">2014</ref>used Fisher information to characterize the set-size effect in their analysis of the variable precision and related models. Fisher information is a variance rather than a standard deviation measure, so the predicted set-size effect should scale as 1/m rather than 1/ √ m. For the better models analyzed by van den Berg et al., the exponents were in the range 1.25 to 1.67, which corresponds to β ≈ 0.6 to 0.8 when expressed in standard deviation instead of variance units. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Oberauer and Lin (2017)</ref>, unlike the sample-size model, which provides a process account of the set-size effect, the power law model is unattractive because the exponent is a free parameter with no clear theoretical interpretation. Oberauer and Lin discussed previous attempts to explain why the empirical exponent should be greater than the sample-size model and argued they are unconvincing. As an alternative,  proposed that the exponent is an index of the attentional demands of the stimuli used in the task and showed that larger exponents are predicted when processing resources, expressed as a proportion of the available evidence samples, are allocated unequally across items in VWM rather than equally.  reported data from five 2AFC VWM experiments, rank-ordered according to the attentional demands of the stimuli they used. They found the magnitude of the set-size effect across the five experiments was well-predicted by the a priori attentional demands of the stimuli and spanned a range from β = 0.5 for the least demanding to β = 0.75 for the most demanding. They showed that larger exponents were predicted theoretically by an attention-weighted sample-size model. The model, which is related to the weighted sample-size model of divided attention of Bonnel and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bonnel &amp; Hafter, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bonnel &amp; Miller, 1994)</ref>, assumes that when stimuli are attentionally demanding one of them captures attention and receives some fraction, c, of the available n samples. The remaining fraction, 1 − c, is divided equally among the other m − 1 items. When c = 1/m the samples are allocated equally and the model reduces to the sample-size model and predicts β = 0.5. As c increases above this, the exponent also increases. If stimuli in a VWM task are presented simultaneously, then attention capture occurs essentially at random. If stimuli are presented sequentially, as in one of the phase-discrimination VWM experiments reported by Smith et al. <ref type="formula">2016</ref>, then the first item presented captures attention and receives a disproportionate share of the samples resulting in a large primacy effect.  showed that, with simultaneous presentation, deviations from the sample-size model were found only for exposure durations longer than about 150 ms, which is the time course of the exogenous attentional orienting system. In the attention weighted sample-size model, this is assumed to be the minimum time needed for attention capture to occur. Unlike the general power law model, which is atheoretical, the attention-weighted sample-size model provides a process interpretation of why power law deviations from the sample-size model should occur. The deviations are predictable from the attentional demands of the stimuli used in the VWM task, rank-ordered according to external criteria, and exhibit a time course consistent with the time course of the attentional mechanism assumed to underlie the allocation of samples to stimuli. In the modeling work described below we consider both sample-size and power law models of the set size effect, which we relate to the properties of the Jones-Pewsey memory distribution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the main elements of our modeling framework. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref> shows the CDM, which we use to model the retrieval of evidence accumulation from VWM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Circular Diffusion Model</head><p>In the CDM, evidence is accumulated by a two-dimensional Wiener diffusion process, with Cartesian coordinates, X t = (X 1 t , X 2 t ) ′ , on the interior of a disk of radius a. In what follows, we use bold-face symbols to denote vector or matrix valued quantities, primes to denote matrix transposition, and superscripts to index coordinates. We denote random variables by upper-case Roman symbols, and constants and deterministic functions by Greek or lower-case Roman symbols. The growth of evidence over time is characterized by a vector-valued stochastic differential equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dX t = µ dt + σ dW t ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dW t = (dW 1 t , dW 2 t ) ′</formula><p>, is the differential of a 2D Wiener, or Brownian motion, process. The two components of dW t describe the horizontal and vertical parts of the random change in the process X t during a small interval of length dt. The information in the stimulus is represented by a vector-valued drift rate, µ = (µ 1 , µ 2 ) ′ , shown in the figure as an arrow at π/4 rad (45 • ). The rate at which the process diffuses towards the boundaries is represented by a dispersion matrix σ = σI, where I is a 2 × 2 identity matrix. The dispersion matrix describes a Wiener process composed of two independent components, each with infinitesimal standard deviation σ (diffusion coefficient σ 2 ). In polar coordinates, the drift rate has a length or norm, µ = µ 2 1 + µ 2 2 , and a phase, or polar, angle, θ µ = arctan(µ 2 /µ 1 ). The polar angle determines the average direction in which evidence diffuses and the norm determines the average rate at which it does so. Psychologically, the polar angle represents the encoded stimulus identity and the norm represents the encoded stimulus strength or quality. of radius a by a 2D Wiener process, X t , with components (X 1 t , X 2 t ) ′ . The point at which the process hits the bounding circle, X θ , is the decision outcome and the time, T , taken to hit it is the decision time. The drift rate is vector-valued, µ, with components (µ 1 , µ 2 ) ′ , with norm µ and direction, or polar angle, θ µ . The polar angle represents the encoded stimulus identity and the norm represents the quality of the encoded representation. (b). Jones-Pewsey distribution of across-trial variability in drift rate polar angles. The curves in the figure, from least to most peaked, are for ψ = 0, -0.5, -1.0, -1.25, all with κ µ = 2. The ψ = 0 case is a von Mises distribution.</p><p>At the beginning of a trial, the process starts at the center of the disk, X 0 = (0, 0) ′ , and on presentation of a stimulus, diffuses until it hits a point on the bounding circle. The radius of the circle, a, represents the decision criterion for the task and is assumed to be under the decision-maker's strategic control, like boundary separation in the two-choice diffusion model. The irregular trajectory in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> represents the sample path of the process (i.e., the accumulating evidence) on a single experimental trial. The hitting point on the boundary is denoted by X T , where the use of capitalized symbols for both the process and the time subscript indicates that the hitting point and hitting time are both random variables. This is represented in the notation in the figure as a pair, (X θ , T ), which denotes the hitting time and the hitting point as independent variables, where θ is the polar angle of the hitting point. The polar and Cartesian representations of the hitting point are related by the expressions X 1 T = a cos θ and X 2 T = a sin θ. To characterize the joint distribution of decision outcomes and decision times explicitly, we denote by dP t (θ) the joint probability density that a 2D Wiener diffusion process with drift rate µ hits the bounding circle a at the point X T = (a cos θ, a sin θ) ′ at a random time T .

If a zerodrift Wiener process starts at the origin then its first-passage time distribution through a circular boundary will be circularly symmetrical and identical, up to a scaling factor of 2πa, to that of the 1D Bessel process. The denominator of Equation 5 includes a factor 2πa that transforms the first-passage time function for the 1D Bessel process into that of a 2D zero-drift Wiener process whose probability mass around the circumference of the response circle integrates to unity when it is combined with Z t (X T ) in Equation 4. When the 2D model is evaluated by integrating over outcomes, θ, in polar coordinates, the integral involves an area element of the form adθ. In previous presentations of the model we have absorbed the polar scaling factor into the implementation in part or in full, but here we write it explicitly. In Equation 5, J 1 (x) is a first-order Bessel function of the first kind <ref type="bibr">(Abramowitz &amp; Stegun, 1965, p. 360)</ref> and the j 0,k terms are the zeros of a Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, J 0 (x), that is, they are the points at which the function crosses the x-axis. The terms J 1 (j 0,k ) in the denominator represent values of J 1 (x) evaluated at the zeros of J 0 (x). Note that dP t (a) is a function of time only and is independent of the hitting point on the criterion circle. Mathematically, it depends only on the diffusion coefficient, σ 2 , and the radius of the criterion circle, a. The distribution of hitting points on the criterion circle is characterized by the second term, Z t (X T ), given by the Girsanov change-of-measure theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Karatzas &amp; Shreve, 1991)</ref>, which takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Z t (X T ) = exp 1 σ 2 (µ • X T ) − 1 2σ 2 µ 2 t ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where (µ • X T ) = aµ 1 cos θ + aµ 2 sin θ is the dot product of the drift rate vector and the vector of coordinates of hitting points on the boundary. The function Z t (X T ) factorizes into a product of two exponential terms: one that depends on time and is independent of the hitting point and another that depends on the hitting point and is independent of time.</p><p>As noted above, the CDM predicts that the decision outcomes are von Mises distributed.

Equation 9 provides a theoretical decomposition of the von Mises precision parameter into components of the decision process. The predicted precision is equal to the decision criterion multiplied by the drift rate norm divided by the diffusion coefficient. Otherwise put, it is equal to the amount of evidence used to make a decision multiplied by the quality of evidence in the stimulus divided by the noisiness of the evidence accumulation process. When there is across-trial variability in drift rate, Equation 6 is replaced by an expression whose form depends on whether the components of the distribution of drift rates are independent or correlated. When the components are independent and normally-distributed, with means ν 1 and ν 2 and standard deviations η 1 and η 2 , the expression has the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Smith &amp; Corbett, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al., , 2022</ref>. A related expression was derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Tuerlinckx (2004)</ref> for a two-choice diffusion process with normally-distributed drift rates. As in Equation 6, X T denotes the locus of hitting points on the criterion circle, with components X 1 T = a cos θ and X 2 T = a sin θ. The overbar notation suggests averaging or marginalization and conveys the idea that the distribution of hitting points and hitting times is obtained by marginalizing Equation 6 across a distribution of drift rates. When the components of drift rate are correlated rather than independent Equation 6 is replaced by a more complex expression given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Smith (2019)</ref>. The distribution of drift-rate variability in Equation 10 is a 2D generalization of the distribution of drift rates in the two-choice model and, as in that model, represents trial-totrial variability in the evidence entering the decision process. When η 1 = η 2 , the contours of equal likelihood of the drift-rate distribution are circular and the CDM is circularly symmetrical. If η 1 = η 2 then the contours of equal likelihood are ellipses rather than circles. When the mean drift-rate vector aligns with the positive x-axis, such that ν = (ν 1 , 0), we say the model is in canonical orientation. In canonical orientation, η 1 is the radial component of drift rate variability and η 2 is the tangential component. The radial component characterizes variability along the length of the mean drift rate vector while the tangential component characterizes variability perpendicular to its length. Psychologically, the radial component characterizes variability in the encoded stimulus quality and the tangential component characterizes variability in the encoded stimulus identity. Even when the model is not in canonical orientation, the first and second components of η = (η 1 , η 2 ) can still be identified with the radial and tangential components of drift rate variability by using the rotationally invariant form of the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Smith (2019)</ref>, in which a general expression forZ t (X T ) is obtained by a coordinate transformation of Equation 7.

In this equation, θ is the polar angle of the stimulus, ϕ is its center, κ µ is the precision, and ψ is a parameter that controls the distribution shape. The term P 1/ψ (•) in the denominator, which makes the function a probability distribution, is an associated Legendre function of the first kind of degree 1/ψ and order 0 <ref type="bibr">(Gradshteyn &amp; Ryzhik, 2007, 8.7-8.8)</ref>.

In CDM applications of the JP distribution, it is used to describe across-trial variability in the encoded stimulus identity. Computationally, the normally-distributed tangential component of drift rate variability in Equation 10 is replaced by a Jones-Pewsey (JP) distribution. The reason for wanting the greater generality of the JP distribution is it provides a way of characterizing how memory representations change across trials as a function of set size and other experimental manipulations.  used the JP distribution to model encoding failures in a continuousoutcome, eye-movement decision task using colored patches as stimuli in which the colors were perturbed by chromatic noise. Response errors increased with increases in noise and, when noise levels were high, heavy-tailed distributions of errors were obtained, reminiscent of those obtained in VWM studies with large set sizes. An example of this kind of distribution, together with the JP-CDM fit for one condition for one subject (the high noise condition for S1), is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref>. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> of Smith et al. for other examples. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref> shows examples of the JP distribution with fixed precision κ µ = 2.0 and the shape parameter, ψ, varying from 0 to -1.25. When ψ = 0 the distribution reduces mathematically to the von Mises distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jones &amp; Pewsey, 2005)</ref>, which is the least peaked, bell-shaped density in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref>. As ψ becomes more negative the distribution becomes more leptokurtic, with a central peak of probability mass and a heavy tail. When ψ becomes very large and negative (e.g., ψ = −2.0) and precision is high, the distribution approximates a single spike of probability mass (i.e., a Dirac delta function), concentrated at ϕ.</p><p>Smith et al. (2020) evaluated two models of encoding failures. Their first model was a mixture model comprising a high-precision central component and a uniformly-distributed component to represent trials on which encoding fails. The mixture model is analogous to VWM models comprising a mixture of memory-based responses and guessing. The second model was a JP model that described the drift rates on encoding failure trials and regular trials using a single distribution. Because of its three-parameter form the JP distribution can describe performance on both low-noise trials, in which encoding failures are negligible, and high-noise trials, in which encoding failures occur regularly and the distribution of errors has high tails extending out to ±π rad.</p><p>In VWM applications of the JP distribution, the normally-distributed, tangential component of drift rate, represented by the η 2 term in Equation 10, is replaced by the JP distribution of Equation 11. We have written the precision parameter of the JP distribution as κ µ to emphasize the fact that it represents tangential, or angular, variation of the drift rate, µ, in the CDM; it is not the precision of the empirical error distribution. The JP distribution is not intended to represent any particular theoretical model of VWM but it expresses properties shared by most if not all of them -namely, that the distribution of memory representations has a central peak flanked by high tails. In slots models the tails arise from guessing; in variable precision models they arise from across-trial variability in item representations; in population code models they arise from background noise in the detector array. We use the JP distribution in order to avoid making a commitment to any of these competing models, which allows us to focus on the role of decision processes in VWM retrieval.</p><p>In addition to tangential, or angular, variability in drift rate, the JP-CDM has a second component of drift rate variability, represented by the parameter η 1 , which describes radial variability in the drift-rate vector. It can be viewed, with some theoretical looseness, as variability in the drift-rate norm, µ , represented by the length of the arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref>, with the proviso that the norm cannot be negative but the radial component of drift-rate variability can be so if it is normally distributed. We have retained the normality assumption for the sake of computational efficiency, because Equation 10 provides an explicit expression for the associated component ofZ t (X T ), which would otherwise need to be integrated numerically. For the parameter estimates we report here this property creates no interpretive difficulties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al. (2022)</ref> described an application of the CDM to a random-dot motion task in which a normally-distributed radial component of drift-rate variability predicted the bimodal distributions of errors found for some participants. In general terms, the radial component of drift-rate variability characterizes across-trial variability in the quality of stimulus information entering the decision process. This is distinct from variability in the tangential component of drift rate which describes across-trial variability in the identity of the stimulus information. The two components of drift-rate variability have different meanings and different theoretical interpretations. Even if mnemonic precision were perfect, which would be represented in the model by zero tangential variability (i.e., a JP distribution with ψ approaching -2.0 in the JP-CDM), there may nevertheless be variability in the quality of the representation, which is characterized by radial variability.</p><p>In models that only seek to characterize error distributions, the distinction between the radial and tangential components of drift-rate variability does no predictive work, but be-comes important when we are seeking to model RT. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the decision time is the time required for the accumulating evidence to hit the bounding circle, a (technically, the first-passage time of the process X T through a). When there is no drift rate variability, the model predicts that the decision time will be independent of the decision outcome -a property shared with the two-choice Wiener process and sequential-probability ratio random walk models <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Luce, 1986)</ref>. Under these circumstances, the RT properties of the model are completely characterized by the marginal distribution of decision times, an example of which is shown in the right-hand panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref>. The predicted distribution of RTs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref> was obtained as the sum of the decision time and a uniformly-distributed nondecision time with mean T er and range s t .</p><p>When there is variability in the radial component of drift rate, the model predicts a continuous-outcome version of the slow-error property of the two-choice Wiener diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>. In difficult two-choice tasks in which accuracy is stressed, error RTs are typically longer than correct RTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Luce, 1986;</ref>. In the two-choice model, errors are more likely to occur when the absolute magnitude of the drift rate is low. RTs on such trials are likely to be longer than on trials on which drift rate is high, so the model predicts slow errors. The continuous-outcome form of the slow-error property is represented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>, which shows a Q × Q (quantile-byquantile) plot of the joint distribution of errors and RTs. In the plot, selected quantiles of the conditional distributions of RTs (the .1, .3, .5, .7, and .9 quantiles) have been plotted against quantiles of the error distribution. The plot has a characteristic dish-shaped form, in which RTs for inaccurate responses (i.e., responses close to ±π rad.) are longer than those for accurate responses (responses close to 0 rad.). As in the two-choice diffusion model, the slow-error property is most evident in the tails of the RT distribution (the .7 and .9 quantile RTs); the leading edge (the 0.1 quantile RTs) shows only a small effect. The radial component of drift rate variability determines the magnitude of the predicted slow-error effect. When η 1 = 0 the predicted Q × Q plot is flat and the RT properties of the model can be characterized completely by the marginal distributions. The fit shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref> was obtained with a moderate value of η 1 . One of the attractive features of the CDM, which results from the fact that the model predicts both decision outcomes and decision times, is that it provides separate estimates of across-trial variability in the quality and the identity of stimulus representations in VWM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus Anisotropies</head><p>As well as predicting marginal and joint distributions of errors and RT, the third point of contact between the model and data is to variations in RT and accuracy as a function of the location of the stimulus in stimulus space (here color space), which we term "stimulus anisotropy." In the case of color, anisotropies have been linked theoretically to the categorical properties of nameable colors. Color category effects have been found in long-term memory (Persaud &amp; Hemmer, 2016), short-term memory (Bae et al., 2015; Hardman et al., </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2017)</head><p>, and in perceptual decisions with no retention interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bae et al., 2015)</ref>. Categorical effects have also been found in memory for random dot motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Blake et al., 1997)</ref>. Such effects have typically been ignored in the VWM literature, although they are compatible with the theoretical framework of variable precision models, which assume variability in precision across items and trials. However, these model do not distinguish between systematic and random sources of across-trial variability. Although categorical effects are not our main focus here, we believe it is principled to include them in the model to try to distinguish them from other sources of variability. To that end, we use the color category model for continuous-outcome decisions about noisy color patches described by  and adapted for decisions about random dot motion in a 3D (spherical) diffusion model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al. (2022)</ref>. The properties of the category model are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3</ref> and an example of its predictions are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>.</p><p>The model assumes that categorical effects in continuous-outcome decisions reflect differences in the rate of evidence accumulation for stimuli in different parts of the stimulus space and are modeled as drift-rate biases. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>, the biases are represented by a set of bias vectors, b i , i = 1, 2, . . ., in stimulus space. The number, locations, and norms of the bias vectors are assumed to be subject-specific. A stimulus presented at a particular location, θ, is represented by a mean drift-rate vector, ν θ , which has an associated norm and polar angle. The drift rate for the stimulus is the sum of the stimulus-driven component, ν θ , and its nearest neighboring bias vector, b ϕ . The vectors add nose-to-tail in the usual manner of vector addition as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref>. This relationship means, first, that evidence accumulation will be biased in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction towards the nearest bias vector, and second, when the polar angles of the stimulus and bias vector coincide, the vectors will be collinear and the norm of the sum will be maximized. Evidence will accumulate more rapidly under these circumstances and the RTs will be shorter and precision will be greater. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al. ( , 2022</ref> reported evidence for effects of this kind.</p><p>The full bias model assumes that the effect of a bias vector located at ϕ on a stimulus at θ is given by Proj(ν θ |b ϕ ), the projection of the stimulus on the bias vector, exponentially attenuated by the difference in their polar angles measured in the 1 − cos(•) circular distance metric, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3c</ref>. The attenuation of bias with distance is equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ν θ exp{−α[1 − cos(θ − ϕ)}b ϕ ,</formula><p>where α is a generalization parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Shepard, 1987)</ref> that characterizes the spatial extent of the bias.

We have found that for both color and direction of motion judgments the number and the locations of the bias vectors are subject-specific and idiosyncratic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blake et al. (1997)</ref> likewise reported that biases in memory for motion direction were similarly idiosyncratic and did not align, for example, with the cardinal or subcardinal axes of the stimulus space. The data for the subject shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> were best-described by a model with three bias vectors, but other data are better described with two, four, or five bias vectors. The bias model of Equation 12 captures some of the stimulus-dependent effects on errors and RT in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>, but not completely. In the fitted model, the same set of bias vectors was used to represent anisotropies at three different levels of stimulus noise simultaneously and, for the subject shown, the data and the fitted values coincided more closely in the other two conditions (see Subject S1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> of . Although the bias model does not capture stimulus anisotropies in their entirety we think it is important to retain them in the overall model because they allows us to distinguish systematic from nonsystematic variability in drift rates -at least partially. Being able to do so allows us to draw sharper inferences about representations of stimuli in VWM than would otherwise be possible.</p><p>To apply the bias model of Equation 12 to VWM we made one critical change to it, based on preliminary fits to data. The model of Equation 12 predicts that the effects of bias on errors and RTs will be highly correlated. Errors will be least biased and RTs will be shortest for stimuli that coincide with a bias vector. For single-stimulus identification decisions this model performs fairly well, but in VWM the RT effects are attenuated while error biases are nevertheless present. In the bias model of Equation 12, anisotropies in mean drift rate and the drift rate radial variability, η 1 , both contribute to the slow-error effect. The drift-rate bias and slow error predictions are tightly coupled: large stimulus biases imply large bias vectors, which in turn lead to a large slow-error effect. In the VWM tasks we present below the slow-error effect is appreciably smaller than comparable effects in single-stimulus identification tasks. Often there is a slow-error effect only for set size m = 1 but not for larger sets, but stimulus bias effects are nevertheless present at all set sizes. The modified bias model we used here was designed to reflect this fact.</p><p>The slow-error effect predicted by the CDM depends only on the radial component of drift-rate variability, but is independent of its tangential component. Random variability in the polar angle of the stimulus has no effect on the rate of evidence accumulation and, consequently, no effect on RT if the drift-rate norm remains constant. However, angular variability can have an appreciable effect on the signed angular errors, as shown in the left-hand panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>. To capture this property we used an extended version of the drift-bias model, in which the bias effect (the vector labeled "bias" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref> and ν θ, bias in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3c</ref>) is decomposed into its radial and tangential components and in which the contribution of the radial component varies parametrically as ν θ, bias = ν θ, tan. + δν θ, rad. , where 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1.0. When δ = 1.0 the bias model is the same as the model of Equation 12; when δ = 0 the radial component of bias is set to zero and only the tangential component is retained. When fitting the model to data, the value of δ combines with the radial component of drift-rate variability, η 1 , to determine the magnitude of the slow-error effect. If both η 1 = 0 and δ = 0, all of the drift-rate vectors for a given mean drift-rate ν will have the same norm and there will be no slow-error effect.</p><p>We do not have strong theoretical grounds for the decomposition of the bias vectors in the extended drift-bias model. Rather, we have adopted it in the pragmatic spirit that it provides a way to decouple the predicted error-bias and slow-error effects in a way that is compatible mathematically with the structure of the JP-CDM model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Panichello et al. (2019)</ref> proposed another model of category effects in VWM that has nice theoretical properties, in which color categories are identified with the attractor states of a dynamical system. This model has similar properties to our extended bias model. Potentially, their model could provide an alternative model of drift-rate bias in the CDM, but harmonizing the two models computationally would be challenging, in part, because their model makes no RT predictions. We have chosen instead to use the generalized version of Equation 12 because it is comparatively straightforward and has the advantage that it allows our analysis of VWM data to be related theoretically to previously published analyses of single-stimulus identification tasks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Stimuli and Design</head><p>We applied the JP-CDM to data from four color VWM experiments in which subjects encoded a variable number of colored patches into VWM and, after a short retention interval, reported the color of a probed patch by indicating its position on a surrounding color wheel. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> gives an example of the stimuli used in our experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 followed  and used an eye-movement decision task, in which subjects made saccadic eye movements from a central home position to points on the color wheel to indicate their decisions; Experiments 3 and 4 used mouse movements, in which subjects moved a mouse from a home position to points on the color wheel. Ratcliff (2018) compared continuous-outcome decisions expressed using eye movements, mouse movements, and finger-pointing responses and reported that the response modality had only minor effects on performance and did not alter any of the inferences about the decision process. Full details of the experiments can be found in Appendix A; we restrict ourselves here to those features of them that are relevant to the modeling of data and evaluation of the theory.</p><p>All experiments used small-N psychophysical designs in which a large number of experimental trials were collected from each of a small number of highly-practiced subjects (five in each of our experiments) and all of the modeling was done at the individual subject level. As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Smith and Little (2018)</ref>, these kinds of designs, which are widely used in visual and auditory psychophysics and in single-cell studies in neuroscience with awake, behaving animals, have several advantages. Each subject is treated as an independent replication of the experiment and the consistency of the results (or otherwise) across subjects provides an indication of the reproducibility of the findings. The focus of studies using these designs is on measurement rather than population inference, specifically, on the question of whether a model and data agree with one another within the limits of measurement error. The use of large samples of data from highly-practiced subjects and stimuli materials calibrated to individual subjects' performance are effective ways to reduce measurement errors. The properties of theoretical interest in the JP-CDM are expressed in the joint distributions of decision outcomes and RT (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>) and these distributions require large samples (around 400 trials in each condition) to estimate reliably. Small-N designs provide the right kind of test bed to evaluate such models.</p><p>Experiments 1 and 2 were identical to one another except for the range of set sizes used. Experiment 1 used set sizes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 items; Experiment 2 used set sizes of 1, 2, 4, and 6 items. The studies of the sample-size model and the attention-weighted sample-size model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sewell et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Smith et al. (2016</ref> restricted the maximum set size to four items to limit the effects of guessing and we restricted the range of set sizes in Experiment 1 for the same reason. However, much of the recent work in VWM has focused specifically on what happens at large set sizes because performance under these conditions is regarded as central to resolving the slots versus resources debate. We therefore replicated the experiment using a larger range of set sizes, using some of the same subjects in Experiment 2.</p><p>Experiments 3 and 4 manipulated the difficulty of the decision task, which required subjects to match a memory representation of a stimulus color to the corresponding hue on the color wheel. In Experiment 3, we did this by manipulating the color saturation of the stimulus patches (Appendix A). Most color VWM studies have used saturated colors to ensure stimuli are highly distinguishable from one another. Color saturation has sometimes been used in studies of visual search to manipulate search efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Santhi &amp; Reeves, 2004)</ref>, but it has not, to our knowledge, been used in VWM. Matching the memory of a desaturated color to a saturated display is more challenging than matching a saturated color and leads to lower accuracy and longer RTs. By simultaneously varying the memory load and the difficulty of the decision task we were able to characterize the independent contributions of memory variability and decision process variability to speed and accuracy. In Experiment 4, we extended this logic, by factorially varying the saturation of the stimuli and the color wheel. In this experiment, the saturation of the stimuli and the color wheel could be independently high or low. The saturation manipulation was crossed with set size, with all variables randomized across trials within experimental blocks. Experiment 3 used set sizes of m = 1, 2, 4, 6 items; Experiment 4 used only set sizes of m = 1, 2, 4 items to ensure there were enough experimental trials in each condition when set size was crossed with stimulus and color wheel saturation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fitting the JP-CDM</head><p>We fit the JP-CDM to the individual subjects' error and RT data using maximumlikelihood estimation (MLE) using the methods described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al. ( , 2022</ref>. The predictions were generated using a combination of Matlab and C, again as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al. ( , 2022</ref>, but making use of a correction factor to stabilize them numerically for large drift rates and decision criteria, as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Smith et al. (2023)</ref>. Because the model predicts joint distributions of RT and errors, conditional on the locations of the stimuli in color space, it unavoidably requires a large number of parameters, and the focus of our modeling was to find a psychologically meaningful, reduced form of the model that identifies invariants of the memory representations and the decision process. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref> lists the parameters of the JP-CDM that we estimated to fit the model to data. The numbers of parameters of each kind varied with the particular designs in each experiment and are described below. For each experiment we fitted the model by minimizing minus the log-likelihood ratio (−LL) using the Matlab implementation of the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm (fminsearch).</p><p>The parameters of the models fall into four general classes: parameters of the stimulus representation in memory; parameters of the decision process; parameters of the stimulus bias model, and nondecision time parameters. Each stimulus condition is represented by a distribution of drift rates with a mean drift rate (drift rate norm) ν , which determines how rapidly, on average, evidence accumulates in the CDM. The drift rate norms could either vary freely across conditions or be theoretically constrained, as described below. The polar, or angular, components of drift rate variability, which characterize across-trial variability in the encoded stimulus identity, were described by the shape and precision parameters of the JP distribution, ψ and κ µ , which could also freely vary or be theoretically constrained. The radial components of drift rate variability, which characterize across-trial variability in encoded stimulus quality, were described by the normal standard deviation, η 1 in Equation 10. Subsequently, we write the radial component of drift-rate variability as η i , where the subscript i denotes the experimental condition.</p><p>The only unique parameter of the decision process is a, the radius of the criterion circle. As the set sizes in our experiments were randomized across trials within blocks we made the selective influence assumption, common in studies of two-choice and continuous-outcome decisions, that the same decision criterion is used for all stimuli and, in particular, for all set sizes. Recently, Fennell and Ratcliff (2023) reported a continuous-outcome VWM study in which they compared slot, resource, and guessing models, using <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ratcliff's (2018)</ref> spatially-continuous diffusion model (SCDM) to characterize the decision process. They found they needed to use different criteria for each set size to account for their RT and accuracy data and justified this choice by arguing that people adjust their criteria on a trial-to-trial basis in response to the properties of the display before they make a decision about it. Although this argument is defensible it requires one of the core selective influence assumptions of evidence accumulation models be relinquished. In contrast, we found we were able to model the set size effect in RT and accuracy in our experiments using the JP-CDM using a single decision criterion. We consider the relationship between our results and those of Fennell and Ratcliff in the General Discussion.</p><p>Anisotropies in stimulus representations were described by the stimulus bias model of Equation 12 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, which characterizes bias by a set of bias vectors, b ϕ , at locations ϕ. The bias vectors are characterized by a set of bias norms, B ϕ , and bias angles, A ϕ , which specify their lengths and locations in stimulus space (±π rad.). For simplicity, we used a four-component bias model for all subjects in all four experiments. Because the bias norms were allowed to vary freely in our fits this model subsumes models with fewer bias vectors as special cases. We have rarely found that data are better fitted with more bias vectors (e.g., Smith et al., 2020, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>) and in these cases the individual vectors are not wellidentified because they trade off with the stimulus similarity parameter. The remaining components of the bias model are the similarity parameter α, which describes the spatial extent of the bias and, in the case of the extended bias model, the parameter δ, which allows bias to be decomposed into its radial and tangential components.</p><p>We modeled nondecision time as an independent, uniformly-distributed, random variable with mean T er and range s t , as is common in studies of evidence accumulation models. Recent theoretical and empirical work on nondecision times has advocated other representations, like cascaded decision and motor stages, or nonuniformly-distributed nondecision times <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bompas et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dendauw et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Verdonck &amp; Tuerlinckx, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Verdonck et al., 2021)</ref>. For our purposes, however, the additive, independent decomposition of decision and nondecision times has the advantages of being simple, of involving the fewest auxiliary assumptions, and has been shown to work well in a range of applications. Many studies have made the selective influence assumption that T er should remain fixed across experimental conditions because it represents processes outside the decision process whose durations should be constant, but other studies have found this assumption breaks down in various ways. Discussions can be found in <ref type="bibr">Dutilh et al. (2019)</ref> and . In a two-choice VWM study using the diffusion decision model with set sizes 1, 2, 3, and 4, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sewell et al. (2016)</ref> found T er progressively increased with set size. Short values of T er are to be expected with set sizes of m = 1 because the relevant stimulus is known before the report cue and the decision process can begin before it is presented. Sewell et al. linked the increase in T er with set sizes of m &gt; 1 to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Oberauer's (2002)</ref> idea that an item in working memory must be brought into the focus of attention before it can be retrieved and this takes longer when there are more items in memory. We followed Sewell et al. and allowed T er to vary with set size, but constrained it to be constant across other experimental manipulations, such as the saturation manipulations in Experiments 3 and 4. We held s t constant across all conditions in all cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linking Sample-Size and Power Law Models to the JP Distribution</head><p>For two-choice VWM tasks, in which performance is characterized using the Gaussian signal detection model, the sample-size model follows straightforwardly from elementary sampling theory. If d ′ is computed from the mean of a set of n noisy evidence samples that are distributed equally among m items, then an inverse square law in set size is predicted because the denominator of d ′ depends on the standard deviation of the mean of the set of samples (i.e., the standard error of the mean), which increases as √ m, while the numerator is a consistent estimator of the population mean for all m. For continuous-outcome decisions about stimuli on a circular space the situation is not so straightforward because the statistics of distributions on circular spaces do not behave like those of distributions on the real line. The circular standard deviation (CSD) of a collection of n randomly-oriented unit vectors with polar angles R i , i = 1, 2, . . . n, is defined as (− lnR 2 ) 1/2 , where the resultant,R, is the length of the average of the vectors. It is obtained by decomposing the vectors into their sine and cosine components, averaging the components, ( i cos R i )/n and ( i sin R i )/n, and then computing the length of the average by Pythagoras's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mardia &amp; Jupp, 2000)</ref>. The intuition behind this measure is that the length of the averaged vectors gets closer to zero as their distribution becomes more uniform, which is reflected inR. Bays and colleagues have used the reciprocal of the CSD as a measure of recall precision in continuous-outcome VWM tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bays et al., 2011)</ref>. As an alternative, as noted earlier, van den Berg et al. (2014) characterized the set-size effect in their variable precision model using Fisher information. Fisher information describes the curvature of the likelihood function in the vicinity of its maximum and, for normally-distributed random variables equals the reciprocal of the variance, which is another definition of precision. For a von Mises distribution with precision κ, given by Equation 7, the Fisher information is equal to κI 1 (κ)/I 0 (κ), where I 1 (κ) and I 0 (κ) are modified Bessel functions of the first kind of order one and zero, respectively. The Fisher information of the von Mises distribution is approximately linear in κ, so it provides a natural way to characterize the set-size effect.</p><p>In the case of the JP distribution, the expression for the Fisher information has an unattractively complex form <ref type="bibr">(Jones &amp; Pewsey, 2005, Appendix A.</ref>2) that has little intuitive content. Instead, we considered two simpler alternatives. The first was the JP precision parameter, κ µ , in Equation 11. The precision parameter provides a natural characterization of the dispersion of the distribution and, in the special case of ψ = 0, in which the JP distribution reduces to the von Mises, is asymptotically proportional to the Fisher information used by van den Berg et al (2014). The second was to use 1/CSD, the reciprocal of the circular standard deviation of the JP distribution. The theoretical CSD is defined analogously to the empirical CSD for a sample, in terms of the resultantR, but with expectations replacing averaging. For a distribution like the JP, which is symmetrical around θ = ϕ (zero in our applications), the resultant reduces to E θ [cos(θ − ϕ)], where the expectation is taken with respect f (θ), the density function of the random variable θ, because the product f (θ − ϕ) sin(θ − ϕ) is an odd function, so E θ [sin(θ − ϕ)] = 0. Values of E θ [cos θ] for the JP distribution are easily computed by numerical integration. The two characterizations of the set-size effect gave similar results, but we found 1/CSD gave more consistent and regular results across subjects and experiments, so we have confined ourselves to reporting sample-size and power law relationships using this measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Evaluation</head><p>Model comparison in cognitive psychology is most often performed using model selection methods like the Akaike information criterion (AIC; <ref type="bibr">Akaike, 1973)</ref> and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Schwarz, 1978)</ref>, which penalize models for their numbers of free parameters. The BIC uses a more conservative sample size dependent penalty and is preferred by some researchers because it is less prone to selecting more complex models than the AIC, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Oberauer and Lin (2017)</ref> reported that the BIC had poorer model recovery in simulated data. These methods are easy to apply but they have limitations and should be interpreted with caution. One limitation is that they penalize models based on their numbers of free parameters but do not take into account differences in model complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pitt et al., 2002)</ref>. A second, more pervasive, problem is that they assume the fit statistic is a true likelihood, derived from a sample of independent, identically-distributed random variables -an assumption unlikely to ever be true in cognitive experiments, because of the effects of learning, fatigue, attentional fluctuations, and other sources of trial-to-trial heterogeneity <ref type="bibr">(Luce, 1986, Section 6.6</ref>). These kinds of variability lead to a phenomenon called overdispersion, in which data are more variable, and computed likelihoods for otherwise well-fitting models are reduced, compared to what would be obtained if the assumption of independent, identically-distributed random variables were true. When overdispersion is present, <ref type="bibr">Burnham and Anderson (2002, p. 69</ref>) recommend use of a modified AIC, called the QAIC, defined as QAIC = −2 log LL max /c + 2k,</p><p>where LL max is the maximized log-likelihood, k is the number of free parameters in the model, "log" is the natural logarithm, and c is an estimate of overdispersion. The QBIC is defined similarly, as QBIC = −2 log LL max /c + k log(N),</p><p>where N is the total sample size. To estimate overdispersion, Burnham and Anderson follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cox and Snell (1989)</ref> who recommended using the estimator c = χ 2 /df , where χ 2 is a Pearson chi-square statistic computed on the most complex model of the class of models under consideration and df is its associated degrees of freedom. The logic of this estimator is that the expected value of χ 2 for a well-fitting model is equal to its degrees of freedom, so the expected value of c will be 1.0. Burnham and Anderson report that values of c estimated in the way typically range from about 1 to 4, with values greater than 4 indicating systematic misfit of the model rather than overdispersion. The formal justification for dividing the log-likelihood in Equation 13 by c to correct for overdispersion was given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kim et al. (2013)</ref>, who noted that the rescaled log-likelihood in Equation 13 leads to a Fisher information matrix in which the variance terms are rescaled in the same way as the log-likelihood ratio, allowing c to be interpreted as a variance inflation factor. Smith and Corbett (2019) used <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cox and Snell's (1989)</ref> procedure with a G 2 likelihoodratio statistic and, consistent with Burnham and Anderson's observation, found that most c values were clustered around 2 with one of 12 estimates ranging as high as 4. The idea that fit statistics in choice tasks are systematically inflated by overdispersion accords with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Smith (1998)</ref> and the observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Ratcliff and Childers (2015)</ref>. Smith used a method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">McCullagh and Nelder (1989)</ref> based on the heterogeneity of multiple variance estimates computed across blocks and sessions, and found that individual two-choice psychophysical data were overdispersed by a factor of 1.2 to 2.5 relative to the theoretical binomial variance. Ratcliff and Childers reported that chi-square fits of the two-choice diffusion model tend to vary between the critical value of χ 2 (roughly df + 2 √ 2 df ) and twice the critical value, implying overdispersion of around 1.3 to 2.6, in agreement with Smith's estimates and Burnham and Anderson's observations.</p><p>To implement Cox and Snell's procedure, we computed a minimum Pearson χ 2 based on a 5 × 5 discretization of the predicted joint distributions for the most highly-parameterized CDM for each subject in each experiment, summed across conditions, using the 0, .2, .4, .6, .8 and 1.0 quantiles of the theoretical distributions of RT and error as bin boundaries. The estimates of c obtained in this way agree fairly well with estimates obtained using other methods and in other settings and are reported below. The effect of using the QAIC and the QBIC rather than the standard AIC and BIC (with c = 1) is that they are less prone to selecting the most complex model in a set of candidate models. Although we computed both the continuous maximized log-likelihood, LL max , for all models, and the minimum χ 2 for the most complex model, we prefer the log-likelihood for model evaluation because it does not lose information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable Range Set-Size Experiments</head><p>JP-CDM Modeling, Experiments 1 and 2 Experiments 1 and 2 used an eye-movement decision task to characterize VWM for set sizes m = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and m = 1, 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Data were collected from five experienced subjects in each experiment, each of whom served in 10 experimental sessions, following one or two sessions of practice. Three of the subjects (DF, PG, and YW) served in both experiments; one of them (PG) is an author. Each subject provided around 400 trials of experimental data at each of the four set sizes, which were randomized within experimental blocks, allowing estimation of the joint distributions of error and RT. As described in Appendix A, RT was defined as the first time that the eyes made an excursion of more than 90% of the distance from a central home circle to the surrounding color wheel. The response was defined as the location of the first corrective eye movement after the initial saccade. A similar procedure was used by  in their eye-movement study of continuous-outcome decisions.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(4ν, 4κ, 4ψ)</ref> 4 drift rates, 4 precisions, 4 shapes (4ν, 4κ, 1ψ) 4 drift rates, 4 precisions, 1 shape (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ) 4 drift rates, sample-size precision, 1 shape (1ν, 1κ, 1ψ) 1 drift rate, sample-size precision, 1 shape (2ν, 1κ, 1ψ) 2 drift rates, sample-size precision, 1 shape (2ν, 1κ, 1ψ, β) 2 drift rates, power law precision, 1 shape The questions of theoretical interest to us were, first, whether the JP-CDM, equipped with the extended bias model, can account for the joint and marginal distributions of RT and error and the anisotropies of the stimulus space and, second, to identify the most parsimonious characterization of the VWM distributions. Our specific aim was to identify lawful regularities in the memory distributions as a function of set size, as characterized by sample-size or power law models. The JP-CDM makes a sharp distinction between the distribution of memory representations and the distribution of responses errors and the question therefore arises as to the appropriate level to seek regularities of this kind. Most published analyses, mainly using the power law model, have focused on the empirical distribution of errors, but the more relevant level of analysis in the JP-CDM is the level of the latent distribution of memory representations. This distribution contributes only one of the sources of variability in the distribution of errors, along with variability in the decision process. Note. Bold face type indicate the best models in a QAIC or QBIC sense.</p><p>To identify lawful changes in the memory distributions we compared models that were more or less constrained across set-size conditions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> summarizes the notation we used to distinguish among models. The models differed according to the number of free drift-rate norms and JP shape parameters and in whether the JP precision varied freely or was constrained to follow a sample-size or power law model in 1/CSD. The constrained models are characterized by a single JP κ µ parameter (written without the subscript for brevity) for set size one that determined the precision for all other set sizes. For sample-size models, the m = 1 precision wholly determines the precision at larger set size; for power law models, the precision at larger set sizes was characterized jointly by the m = 1 value of κ µ and a free exponent, β.</p><p>The remaining models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> parameterize the drift-rate norms in different ways. In addition to models in which the drift rate norm either varied freely as a function of set size or was the same for all set sizes, we considered models with two drift rate norms, one for set size m = 1 and another for all other set sizes. These models investigated whether set size one is in some way special because the identity of the target stimulus is known earlier than it is for larger set sizes. All six models in the table had the same extended bias model and made the same assumptions about nondecision times. The extended bias required a total of 10 parameters: four bias vector locations, four bias vector norms, a similarity parameter, α, and a bias decomposition parameter, δ. All of the models assumed that mean nondecision time, T er , varied across set size, while nondecision time variability, s t , remained the same. We defer discussion of drift-rate bias effects until after presentation of all four experiments. The results of the analysis are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 3 and 4 and Figures 5 to 8. Table  3</ref> summarizes the mean fit statistics averaged across subjects for each experiment. The entries in the table are minus the maximized log-likelihood and the QAIC and QBIC, together with the number of estimated parameters for each model (k). Readers are reminded that log-likelihoods cannot be compared across different data sets to assess the relative fit to different subjects or in different experiments because the maximum achievable LL depends on the variance of the distribution being fitted. Values of −LL are greater for Experiment 2 than Experiment 1 because the variance of the empirical distributions in Experiment 2 was greater. For Experiment 1, the individual overdispersion estimates from the χ 2 /df method ranged from 1.84 to 3.65 with a mean of 3.02; for Experiment 2 they ranged from 1.17 to 2.92 with a mean 2.20. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows estimated parameters for selected models, averaged across subjects, as discussed below. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 5 and 6</ref> show examples of fitted marginal and joint distributions of errors and RT. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 7 and 9</ref> characterize the sample-size relationship in the latent memory distributions of the fitted models. Although the results for the two experiments in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> are not identical, they are more similar than might appear at first glance, with the differences attributable to a minority of subjects, as discussed below. Overall, the JP-CDM did a good job of accounting for the marginal and joint distributions of errors and RTs for all subjects, but to conserve space, we have reproduced the fits for one subject for each experiment (YW in Experiment 1 and OS in Experiment 2) only. We chose these subjects because their data were well-described by the simple <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">model, (2ν, 1κ, 1ψ)</ref>. The patterns for these subjects are typical of those shown by the remaining subjects, apart from small deviations from the sample-size model for a minority of subjects, discussed below. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows the fitted marginal distributions of errors and RTs for YW for Experiments 1 and 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows the joint distributions in the form of a Q × Q plot, as discussed in relation to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>. The slow-error pattern again appears as a dishing of the upper quantiles of the Q×Q plot. The two subjects in the figure both show small-to-moderate slow error patterns at all set sizes; for other subjects it was most apparent at small set sizes, particularly m = 1. The attenuated slow-error effect contrasts with the robust effects reported for a single-stimulus identification task using noise-perturbed color patches by . The following inferences can be made from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3 and the accompanying figures:</ref> 1. The shape of the memory distribution, as characterized by the JP parameter ψ, remained invariant as a function of set size while the precision of the distribution changed. The invariance is characterized by the better performance of model (4ν, 4κ, 1ψ) than (4ν, 4κ, 4ψ), in both a QAIC and a QBIC sense, for both experiments. The shape invariance was true on average, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, and for all five individual subjects in both experiments.</p><p>2. The JP memory distributions of the best-fitting models were strongly leptokurtic, typically with a ψ parameter of around -1 or less (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b)</ref>. These distributions resemble the perceptual similarity functions in Schurgin et al.'s (2020) TCC model, which can be approximated by a Laplace distribution. Unlike their model and related models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Oberauer (2023)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Tomić and Bays (2024)</ref>, however, the shape of the memory distribution does not directly determine the shape of the empirical error distribution. Rather, in the absence of memory variability the CDM predicts pure von Mises error distributions, as noted above. Variability in memory changes the shape of the error distribution, as it does in variable precision models, and allows the JP-CDM to predict increased probability mass in the tails of the error distribution.</p><p>3. For Experiment 1, the changes the JP precision parameter κ µ were well-described by a sample-size model in 1/CSD. To generate predictions for the sample-size model, we estimated a value of κ µ for set size m = 1 from fits to the JP-CDM to data. We computed the CSD of the JP distribution for set size m = 1 numerically and used it to predict 1/CSD for m &gt; 1 using the sample-size model. We then inverted these values numerically to obtain the corresponding values of κ µ and used them to predict JP distributions for m &gt; 1. For Experiment 2, the JP precision was again welldescribed by the sample-size model, although it was not the best model statistically. Instead, on average, the QAIC-best model was the free-κ model, (4ν, 4κ, 1ψ), and the QBIC-best model was the power law model, (2ν, 1κ, 1ψ, β). These results reflect the performance of two subjects whose κ µ parameters were, surprisingly, a little better than sample size, as discussed below.</p><p>4. The rate of evidence accumulation in the CDM depends on the drift rate norm, ν , which is theoretically independent of the precision of the encoded stimulus representation, characterized by the JP distribution. The comparison of the models (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ) and (1ν, 1κ, 1ψ) tested whether the rate of evidence accumulation and the precision of the memory representation are separable, that is, whether the rate is the same for precise and imprecise representations. The first model allowed the drift-rate norm to vary with set size; the second model constrained it to be the same for all set sizes. The remaining model, (2ν, 1κ, 1ψ), and its power law generalization, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(2ν, 1κ, 1ψ, β)</ref>, tested whether set size m = 1 is special, for the reasons described above -namely, that the identity of the probed item is known at the time of stimulus presentation. For both Experiments 1 and 2 models with two drift-rate norms (one for set-size one and another for all other set sizes) performed better in both a QAIC and QBIC sense than models with either fewer or more drift rate norms. Drift rate norms for models with two and four ν parameters are compared in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  4</ref>. Their magnitudes decrease with set size, but the largest difference is for m = 1 versus the others. The idea that the decision process starts earlier on m = 1 trials and is associated with a higher rate of evidence accumulation is supported by the nondecision times, T er , in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. Nondecision times for the JP-CDM increased progressively with set size, as previously reported for the two-choice diffusion model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sewell et al. (2016)</ref>. However, the largest differences in nondecision times were again for m = 1, which were 70 ms to 100 ms shorter than those for the other set sizes, consistent with the idea that the decision process on m = 1 trials begins earlier. The important relationships theoretically for the JP-CDM are those at the level of latent memory distributions, as noted above. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 7 and 8</ref> show pairs of JP memory distributions estimated from fits of the JP-CDM to the individual subject data from the two experiments. One set of distributions is from the unconstrained model with four κ µ precision parameters and four ν parameters. The second set are from a model with sample-size constrained κ and two ν parameters. In most cases, the constrained and unconstrained estimates are in very good agreement, consistent with the idea that the quality of the memory representation depends on the allocation of neural resources to items, as predicted by the sample-size model. There is no evidence of any additional decline for m = 6 in Experiment 2 of the kind associated with a guessing process, as predicted by slot models. The estimated JP distributions imply that, for some subjects in some conditions, particularly in Experiment 1, there is comparatively little across-trial variability in the encoded stimulus identity. The difference between the JP memory distributions and the empirical error distributions (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>) is due to the variability added by the decision process. The effects of decision process variability are characterized by Equation 9, which says that, for a single encoded stimulus value with drift rate µ, the precision of the von Mises error distribution will be a µ /σ 2 , the product of the decision criterion and the drift-rate norm divided by the diffusion coefficient. Importantly, however, the CDM distinguishes between variability in the encoded stimulus identity and variability in the encoded stimulus quality, so it is not the case that the distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> and 8 mean there is little or no acrosstrial variability in the encoded stimulus representation at small set sizes. In the JP-CDM, variations in identity are characterized by the JP distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 7 and 8,</ref> whereas variations in quality are characterized by the radial component of drift rate variability (η in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>), which were moderate. In intuitive terms, the JP distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 7 and  8</ref> imply that someone might be unlikely to cognitively represent a pink stimulus in memory as a red stimulus, but the quality of their representation of pink could nevertheless vary across trials, leading to variability in the retrieved values of pink on different occasions. We develop this point in relation to Experiments 3 and 4 in which we varied the difficulty of the decision task by varying the color saturation of the stimuli and the response wheel.</p><p>Although there is a good correspondence between the estimated JP distributions for the sample-size model and the free model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 7 and 8</ref>, there are small discrepancies for set size m = 6 for subjects LF and YW in Experiment 2. For these subjects the precision of the free JP distribution was a little better than predicted by the sample-size model (i.e., the peak of the continuous curve is higher than the broken curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>). The model selection results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> reflect the results for these subjects. For both subjects, the free-κ model, (4ν, 4κ, 1ψ), and the power law model, (2ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 1β), were preferred to the constrained model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(2ν, 1κ, 1ψ)</ref>, whereas the constrained model was preferred for the remaining subjects, in agreement with Experiment 1. The exponents for these subjects were β = .40 and β = .38, respectively. These values differ from previous reports of power law relationships in which the exponents are typically greater than 0.5.</p></div>

The extension follows the work of  who showed that stimulusdriven trials and encoding failure trials could both be characterized by the JP distribution. They found that the CDM with a JP distribution of polar drift-rate angles performed about as well as a two-process model in which performance was a mixture of CDM processes with different precisions. One process was a stimulus-driven process with high precision, described by a normal distribution with small variance; the other was an encoding failure process with zero precision. We proposed the JP distribution as a model of the memory distribution in a similar spirit, as a distribution that can flexibly capture the memory representations of models that assume a narrow central peak flanked by heavy tails. Strikingly and fortuitously, the estimated JP memory distributions resemble the similarity-scaled stimulus distributions in the TCC model, which can be well-described by a Laplace distribution, as noted above.</p><p>There was no evidence in our data of a slot-like limit, which should have been most evident in the m = 6 condition of Experiment 2. Rather, the set-size effect in both experiments was, for the most part, well described by the sample-size relationship out to the largest set sizes used. Any deviations from the sample-size model at large sets in Experiment 2 were small and in the direction of slightly better than sample-size performance. We consider a possible mechanism that might produce better than sample-size performance in relation to Experiments 3 and 4. There was no need to include a guessing component in our models. Rather, the JP distributions of drift rates in the CDM predicted heavy-tailed error distributions without explicit guessing. These distributions predict large deviations from the true stimulus value, and hence in the polar angle of the drift rate, on a small proportion of trials.</p><p>The main contribution of the JP-CDM is that it provides a unified account of the mechanisms that underlie the speed and accuracy of continuous-outcome VWM outcome decisions, not just their accuracy. The theoretical framework we used to do this was the same as the one we have used to account for performance in stimulus identification tasks with noisy color stimuli. Our approach emphasizes that the continuous-outcome VWM task is a decision task, and so should be amenable to the same kind of theoretical analysis as other decision tasks. What such tasks have in common, whether they involve twochoices or continuous-outcome choices, and whether they involve perception or memory, is that they require an encoded perceptual representation be matched against a set of alternatives in memory. The matching process is both noisy and time-consuming, and has been successfully represented in many settings using diffusion models. The JP-CDM links the continuous-outcome VWM task to this broader literature.</p><p>One of the implications of this change in viewpoint, of representing continuous-outcome VWM retrieval as a decision task, is it predicts that performance will be limited both by the quality of the memory representation and the noisiness of the decision process, which in the CDM is determined by the statistical properties of the diffusion process. If this idea has theoretical merit, then it should be possible to experimentally manipulate the difficulty of the decision task independently of the memory representation, and show how manipulations of the two processes jointly affect performance. This idea motivated our next two experiments, which manipulated the color saturation of the stimuli and, in Experiment 4, also of the color wheel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable Color Saturation Experiments JP-CDM Modeling, Experiments 3 and 4</head><p>Experiments 3 and 4 used a mouse-movement decision task to characterize VWM for set sizes m = 1, 2, 4, 6 and m = 1, 2, 4, respectively. Full details of the experiments can be found in Appendix A. In Experiment 3, the set-size manipulation was crossed with a manipulation of stimulus saturation, using color patches similar to those in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, the color patches were either saturated, within the limits of the monitor gamut, or desaturated. Desaturated colors appear duller, or more washed-out, than their saturated counterparts. The desaturated colors were constructed by mixing the saturated colors with a gray of equal luminance, which shifted them towards the center of the isoluminant plane. Set size and color saturation were randomly varied across trials within a block. (There were no mixed-saturation trials: Stimuli on any trial were either all saturated or all desaturated.) Subjects made their responses by moving a mouse from a central home circle and to a point on a surrounding, saturated, color wheel. The RT was defined as the first time the mouse crossed the inner border of the color wheel and the response was defined as the point of the inner border crossing. In Experiment 4 the saturation of the stimuli and the saturation of the color wheel were varied factorially and crossed with set size. Set size, stimulus saturation, and wheel saturation were randomly varied within a block and the stimuli on a given trial were, again, all saturated or all desaturated. Data were collected from five subjects in each experiment, including two of the authors (PG, ES), each of whom served in 10 experimental conditions. Subjects in Experiment 3 each completed a total of 3,200 trials, 400 in each of eight conditions; subjects in Experiment 4 each completed a total of 4,080 trials, 340 in each of 12 conditions.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(8ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 1β) 31 2,838 1,997 2,171 (8ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 1β) 29 2,728 2,126 2,285  (8ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 2β) 30 2,823 1,993 2,174 (8ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 2β) 30 2,723 2,123 2,288  (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 1β) 27 2,894 2,014 2,163 (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 1β</ref>) 25 2,740 2,127 2,263 (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 2β) 28 2,884 2,010 2.165 (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 2β) 26 2,736 2,126 2,269 Note. Bold face type indicate the QAIC and QBIC best models.</p><p>Our primary interest in the analysis was in whether, and to what extent, the effects of stimulus and wheel saturation and memory set size were separable. The JP-CDM assumes that set size affects the precision of the JP distribution, which characterizes the polar variability of memory, while saturation affects the strength of the match between the color wheel and memory, which should affect the drift-rate norms. The simplest model is one in which JP precision follows either the sample-size model or a power law model and is wholly prescribed by precision for set size one, while drift rate norm varies with stimulus saturation, or the combination of stimulus and wheel saturation in Experiment 4. The most complex model is a nonseparable model in which JP precision and drift rate norms vary with all combinations of set size and saturation. In between those extremes are models in which JP precision varies freely with set size but is independent of saturation and models in which drift rate norm varies with set size in a restricted way, including the "m = 1 is special" models which allow drift rates to differ for m = 1 and m &gt; 1 trials. Based on the results of  and our conjecture that encoding may be more demanding for desaturated than saturated stimuli, we considered versions of the power law model in which the exponent varied with stimulus saturation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> summarizes the main models we considered. We also considered models in which the JP ψ shape parameter varied across conditions, which we used to compute overdispersion from χ 2 /df in the QAIC and QBIC statistics. For Experiment 3 the overdispersion estimates ranged from 2.52 to 4.89; for Experiment 4 they ranged from 2.12 to 3.46. Models with a single ψ parameter were preferred by the QBIC for both experiments, so we focus here on fixed-shape models. When ψ was allowed to vary freely it did not do so in a predictable, monotonic way, implying any advantages of shape-varying models were likely due to model flexibility rather than systematic effects.</p><p>The models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> are organized factorially with JP precision varying within drift rate norm. The numbers of parameters of the models for the two experiments reflects differences in the experimental conditions: Experiment 3 had eight conditions (two saturation conditions crossed with four set sizes); Experiment 4 had 12 conditions (four saturation conditions crossed with three set sizes). The 8κ and 12κ models for Experiments 3 and 4, respectively, allowed JP precision to vary with both set size and saturation. The 4κ and 3κ models allowed JP precision to vary with set size but remain constant across saturation conditions, while the 1κ models assumed JP precision followed the sample-size model. The (1κ, 1β) and (1κ, 2β) models are power law models; in the latter, the exponent varied with stimulus saturation. The models with varying numbers of drift-rate norms were: (a) norms varied freely with both saturation and set size (8ν and 12ν models for Experiments 3 and 4, respectively); (a) norms varied with saturation only (2ν and 4ν models); and (c) "m = 1 is special" (4ν and 8ν models).</p><p>The main inferences from the fits in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> and the accompanying figures are as follows:</p><p>1. The best models in a log-likelihood sense were the most highly parameterized, nonseparable, models. These models also performed well in a QAIC, but not a QBIC sense. In an absolute sense, however, all of the models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> performed fairly well. For Experiment 3, the log-likelihoods of the most complex and the simplest models, (8ν, 8κ, 1ψ) and (2ν, 1κ, 1ψ), differed by only 7%. For Experiment 4, the log-likelihoods of the most complex and the simplest models, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(12ν, 12κ, 1ψ)</ref> and (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ), differed by only 2%. Qualitatively, the fits of the simplest and most complex models to the marginal and joint distributions and to the stimulus-dependent error and median RTs showed only minor differences that are difficult to discern in plots.</p><p>2. The separable models in which JP precision varied freely with set size performed uniformly better than the sample-size models in a QAIC sense but worse in a QBIC sense for Experiment 3; for Experiment 4 the separable models also performed better than the sample-size model in a QBIC sense for some drift-norm models. The differences most likely reflect the fact that the free-κ models had more parameters in Experiment 3 than in Experiment 4 because there were more set-size conditions, and so were penalized more heavily.</p><p>3. For both Experiments 3 and 4, drift rate norms varied with both set size and saturation. Although models in which the norms varied with saturation and were independent of set size performed well in a log-likelihood sense, they were not the best models in either a QAIC or QBIC sense, nor were the "m = 1 is special" models, at least not consistently. These results point to a more complex dependency of mean drift rates on both set size and saturation, which we characterize in more detail below.</p><p>4. The results of both experiments favored a power law model with a large exponent over a sample-size model and, for some subjects, favored a model in which the exponent varied with stimulus saturation. These results contrast with those of Experiments 1 and 2 and support the idea that the exponent indexes attentional engagement. Exponents were greater for desaturated than for saturated stimuli, consistent with the idea that encoding desaturated stimuli is more attention demanding.</p><p>Figures 9 and 10 show the JP memory distributions for individual subjects for Experiments 3 and 4 as a function of set size estimated from the fitted models. Each panel contrasts plots of a free-κ model with a large number of free drift rate norms and the 2β power law model with a small number of drift rate norms. In most cases, the correspondence is very good, although the distributions for the free-κ models are a little more sharply peaked than those for the constrained models. To construct these models we have used the most restrictive power law models in which there was only one norm per saturation condition (i.e., two for Experiment 3 and four for Experiment 4). The implication of these figures is that the power law model successfully captures the across-trial variability in the encoded stimulus identity, as expressed in the JP distribution, as a function of set size. The similarity of the individual JP distributions for simple and complex models shows graphically why the differences among the log-likelihoods for the fitted models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> are all comparatively small: Within the limits of estimation variability, the simple and complex models converge on similar characterizations of the underlying memory distributions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 11 and 12</ref> show, respectively, marginal and joint distributions of error and RT for Experiment 4, for one subject only, again to conserve space. The patterns reproduce those for Experiments 1 and 2 and for Experiment 3, which we have not shown. The model  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">-κ model (8ν, 4κ, 1ψ)</ref>; the broken dark curves are for the power law model (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 2β) with separate exponents for low and high saturation stimuli (β − and β + , respectively).

The RT distributions show the characteristic shape of distributions predicted by diffusion process models and the JP memory model captures the way in which the shapes of the error distributions vary with set size and the change in probability mass in the tails. As with Experiments 1 and 2, there is a comparatively small slow error effect in the joint distributions. For this subject, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>: Estimated Jones-Pewsey distributions of memory variability for individual subjects for Experiment 4. The continuous light curves are for the free-κ model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(12ν, 12κ, 1ψ)</ref>; the broken dark curves are for the power law model (4ν, 1κ, 1ψ, 2β) with separate exponents for low and high saturation stimuli (β − and β + , respectively).

The red curves are for high stimulus and low wheel saturation (S + W − ); the purple curves are for high stimulus and high wheel saturation stimuli (S + W + ). The curves for the four sets of stimuli have been shown offset from zero for clarity. the model predicts a small slow error effect for m = 1 and m = 4, but essentially none for m = 2.</p><p>Although there were individual differences in drift-rate norms there were some clear and robust effects shown by all subjects. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows average drift rate norms as a function of set size and saturation in the two experiments when the norms were free to vary. For Experiment 3, drift rate norms were systematically lower for desaturated than for saturated colors, implying that rates of evidence accumulation were lower when making decisions about desaturated colors. However, there was also a set size effect, similar to the one in Experiment 2, in which norms decreased with set size, which interacted with saturation, such that the difference between saturated and desaturated norms decreases with set size. Despite the small number of subjects, the group effect of saturation and the Saturation × Set Size interaction were both significant in a repeated measures ANOVA: Saturation, F (1, 4) = 9.69, p = 0.036; Saturation × Set Size, F (3, 12) = 7.07, p = 0.006. The main effect of set size was not significant: F (3, 12) = 2.29, p = 0.13. The difference in norms for saturated and desaturated stimuli is as predicted by the JP-CDM, but the interaction with set size was not, and is discussed below.</p><p>A similar pattern is evident in the drift norms for Experiment 4. The norms were high when the saturation of the stimuli matched the saturation of the color wheel and low when they mismatched. The lowest norms were for desaturated stimuli matched to a saturated color wheel; the next lowest were for saturated stimuli matched to a desaturated wheel. As in Experiment 3, the effects of saturation were reduced at larger set sizes, although there was no evidence of a set size main effect. The group effects were again significant in a repeated measures ANOVA, which showed significant effects for both stimulus and wheel saturation: Stimulus, F (1, 4) = 81.19, p = .0008; Wheel, F (1, 4) = 15.72, p = 0.017, and a significant Stimulus × Wheel interaction, F (1, 4) = 20.02, p = 0.011. The main effect for stimulus reflected the fact that, regardless of whether the saturation of the stimuli and the wheel matched or mismatched, norms were higher for saturated stimuli (M desat. = 4.02 vs. M sat. = 4.25), as found in Experiment 3. The reduction in the magnitude of the saturation effect with set size is reflected in the interactions. The highest order interaction, Stimulus × Wheel × Set Size, was significant, F (2, 8) = 8.59, p = 0.010, as was the Stimulus × Set Size interaction, F (2, 8) = 11.13, p = 0.005. These results show that drift rate norms reflect the difficulty of the matching task, with lower norms when the saturation of the stimuli and the color wheel mismatched. There is a clear asymmetry in the mismatch effect: Norms were lower with desaturated stimuli and a saturated color wheel than the converse. The interaction with set size effect is again not predicted by the JP-CDM and is discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of Variable Saturation Experiments</head><p>The main results from Experiments 3 and 4 complement and extend those of Experiments 1 and 2. The effects of set size were quantified by the inverse circular standard deviation, 1/CSD, which are characterized approximately by the sample-size model and more accurately by a power law. The set-size effect in both models depends on a single value of the JP precision parameter, κ µ , for set size one. Stimulus and color wheel saturation had clear effects on mean drift rates. In Experiment 3, mean drift rates for decisions about desaturated stimuli were systematically lower than decisions about saturated stimuli, implying that desaturation increased the difficulty of the decision task and reduced the rate of evidence accumulation. This pattern was confirmed in Experiment 4, in which mean drift rates reflected an interaction of stimulus and color wheel saturation. Drift rates norms were high when the saturation of the wheel matched that of the stimuli and low when they mismatched; they were highest when the stimuli and wheel were both saturated and lowest when the stimuli were desaturated and the wheel was saturated.</p><p>The costs of decisions involving differences in stimulus and wheel saturation were reduced with larger set sizes in both Experiments 3 and 4, as reflected by the magnitudes of the drift rate norms. These results imply some kind of nonlocal, or reference, effect in the memory retrieval process, which makes decisions about the contents of memory more precise when there are other stimuli in the display. The most well-known effect of this kind is the superiority of two-alternative forced-choice discrimination over detection in signal detection theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Santhi and Reeves (2004)</ref> studied a form of visual search they called "oddity" search, which required identification of an unspecified outlier, or oddball, stimulus in brief color displays. Unlike conventional visual search, in which performance decreases with set size, in oddity search they found performance increased with set size. Although their search task was different to our VWM retrieval task, their oddity search results imply that subjects can make global judgments about the statistical characteristics of arrays of colored elements and use them to improve the speed and accuracy of decisions about individual items. Importantly, they found benefits of large set size only with heterogeneous distractor stimuli, not when they were homogeneous (i.e., all of the same hue and saturation). Based on their results, it seems plausible to us that judgments about the hues of cued color patches in VWM retrieval might be made more precisely when the patches are presented among sets of items against which they can be compared. Intriguingly, Santhi and Reeves found a set-size benefit in oddity search with both saturated and desaturated stimuli. Two of our subjects in Experiment 2 showed slightly better than sample-size performance when making decisions about saturated stimuli with a saturated color wheel, which is the opposite of what is predicted by resource allocation models, but is consistent with a reference effect that has the opposite dependency on set size than the memory precision effect.</p><p>Experiments 3 and 4 emphasize the nature of the continuous-outcome VWM as a decision task -something often neglected in recent theory. They emphasize, in particular, that the process of matching an item in memory to a point on a color wheel is noisy and error-prone and is made more or less difficult by varying the color saturation of the stimuli relative to the wheel. The model fits in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> show that the difficulty of the matching task is captured by the drift rate norm in the CDM and that these effects are separable from those of set size on the precision of the memory representation, which are characterized by the JP κ µ parameter. Separability of the effects of set size and matching strength does not mean, however, that the empirical error distributions will be invariant across Rather, the precision of the error distribution in the JP-CDM decreases with decreasing norms, as stipulated by Equation 9, and is accompanied by increases in RT. The JP-CDM is able to identify these effects in data because its parameters predict both RT and accuracy. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> shows estimated parameters for the best-fitting, on average, power law models for Experiments 3 and 4, in which the exponent varied with set size. The tabulated models in both cases had four drift rate norms and the set size effect was characterized by a single JP precision, κ, a JP exponent, ψ, and the power law exponent, β. The radial component of drift rate variability, η, varied with set size, giving four η parameters for Experiment 3 and three for Experiment 4. For Experiment 3, the tabulated drift norms are, using the notation of Figures 9 and 13, S − m=1 , S − m&gt;1 , S + m=1 , and S + m&gt;1 . For Experiment 4, using the notation of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> and 13, they are S − W − , S − W + , S + W − and S + W + . For Experiment 3, they show that norms were greater for saturated than desaturated stimuli and lower for m &gt; 1 than for m = 1 displays. For Experiment 4, they show the interaction between stimulus saturation and wheel saturation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13b</ref>, in which the largest norms were for matching high-saturation stimuli and color wheel and the smallest norms were for lowsaturation stimuli and a high-saturation color wheel. The subtler interactions with set size in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> are not captured in the 4ν models.</p><p>The shapes and the single-item precisions of the JP memory distributions, as represented by the ψ and κ 1 parameters, respectively, were estimated consistently across the two experiments, suggesting that the model is capturing an invariant of the memory representation that is independent of the properties of the decision process. The average estimated exponents were β = .79 and β = .89 which are large, but not too dissimilar to the values reported by other researchers continuous-outcome decisions and for two-choice decisions with attentionally demanding stimuli by . These values contrast with the exponents in Experiments 1 and 2, which used saturated stimuli and a saturated color wheel, which were consistent with the sample-size model or slightly better for some subjects in Experiment 2. The marked change in the exponents in Experiments 3 and 4 are consistent with the idea that encoding desaturated stimuli requires attention -presumably because desaturation makes the decision task more demanding -and leads to an unequal distribution of resources across items. When exponents varied with stimulus saturation, their values, which are shown inset in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 9 and 10</ref>, were uniformly greater for desaturated stimuli than for saturated stimuli, again supporting the idea that the exponent in the power law is an index of attentional engagement.</p><p>The exponents for desaturated stimuli in the 2β models were larger than the values reported elsewhere in the literature (although see the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fennell and Ratcliff (2023)</ref> described in the General Discussion). This may reflect something about the unique characteristics of the VWM task with desaturated stimuli, but may also reflect differences in the role of the exponent in the JP-CDM compared to other models. In other models in the literature the exponent characterizes set-size dependent changes in the error distribution; in the JP-CDM it represents changes in the latent memory distribution, which contributes only part of the variance of the error distribution. The estimated JP distributions for individual subjects in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 7, 8, 9</ref>, and 10, are much less variable than the corresponding error distributions (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 5 and 11</ref>), especially for small set sizes. For m = 1, in particular, the JP distributions imply there is minimal variability in the encoded stimulus identity, just like the low-noise stimuli in the chromatic-noise task of . With desaturated stimuli, however, the variability of the memory distributions increased rapidly with set size, which is captured by the larger exponents in the figures.</p><p>The radial components of drift rate variability, η, were moderate for all conditions in Experiments 3 and 4 (i.e., around η ≈ 1.0) or a bit less, with a tendency to be larger for m = 1 than for larger set sizes. The larger values of η are responsible for the slow error effects in the joint distributions, which tended to be most apparent for m = 1 displays. The estimates imply that the rates of evidence accumulation are larger, and more variable across trials, with single as compared to multi-item displays. These effects were accompanied by differences in nondecision times, T er , similar to those in Experiments 1 and 2, in which mean nondecision times tended to increase with set size (there is a reversal for m = 4 in Experiment 4), with the largest differences being for m = 1 and m &gt; 1 trials. The T er estimates imply that the decision process begins earlier on m = 1 trials than on trials with larger set sizes, which is consistent with the psychological properties of the task.</p><p>One noteworthy difference in the parameter estimates of the models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 4 and  Table 6</ref> is the size the nondecision time parameter, s t . For Experiments 1 and 2 they ranged from 0.14 to 0.25 s; for Experiments 3 and 4 they ranged from 0.31 to 0.48 s. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Matzke and Wagenmakers (2009,</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref>) reported distributions of parameter estimates for the two-choice diffusion model based on several hundred experimental conditions. The s t estimates ranged from essentially zero to 0.6 s, with a modal value of around 0.1-0.2 s. The estimates from our eye-movement task in Experiments 1 and 2 are close to their modal estimates but the estimates from the mouse-movement task in Experiment 3 and 4 fall towards the upper end of the range. We think these differences likely reflect differences in the motor processes engaged in eye-movement and mouse-movement tasks, with the latter being inherently more variable because they involve grosser movements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus Anisotropies</head><p>As noted in the Introduction, there are differences in how stimulus anisotropies have been treated in different parts of the literature on continuous-outcome tasks. In VWM, anisotropies, although sometimes acknowledged, are usually ignored, and the variance in the error distributions is attributed wholly or substantially to memory processes. In contrast, in the literature on biases, especially categorical biases in color perception and color memory, anisotropies have been a major focus of the modeling effort. Like other VWM studies, our theoretical focus here was not on anisotropies per se, but unlike them, we have chosen to include them in our model. Our reason for doing so is because if there are known sources of variability in a process under investigation then it is better to be able estimate and attribute them rather than pooling them with variability from other processes, which is likely to be misattributed. We used an extended version of the drift-rate bias model of  for this purpose, an example of whose predictions was shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>. As we noted in the Method section, this added a total of 10 parameters to all of the models in Tables 4 and 6: four bias vector amplitudes, B ϕ , four bias vector locations, A ϕ ; an exponential similarity parameter, α, and a radial-tangential weighting parameter, δ. The model can characterize subjects with fewer than four bias vectors, because one or more of the amplitudes can be zero, but not subjects with more than four bias vectors. However, as we noted, models with more than four bias vectors become difficult to identify because the individual bias effects tend to become smeared by interactions with the similarity parameter.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref> show estimated parameters of the extended bias model for the QBIC-best model for the four experiments. As in previous applications of the bias model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al. ( , 2022</ref>, there were large individual differences among subjects in the magnitude and location of the bias parameters. There was no indication, for example, that the bias vectors aligned with the nameable colors in color space. The average value of B 3 was zero for Experiment 3 and 0.12 in Experiment 4, suggesting a model with fewer bias vectors when desaturated colors are used, consistent with the reduced perceptual salience of such stimuli. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> shows one example of the effects of the bias model, again to conserve space, for Subject MH for Experiment 3. As in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>, the panels on the left show the signed angular error as a function of the location of the stimulus in color space; the panels on the right show the median RT plotted in the same way. In our experiments we rotated the color wheel after each experimental block (see Appendix A), which allowed stimulus biases to be distinguished from motor biases in the speed and accuracy of eye or mouse movements in different directions. These kinds of motor effects are likely to be present in our data, but are distinguished from stimulus biases in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>, which plots errors as a function of the position in color space and not the orientation of the color wheel. The extended bias model captures some of the anisotropies in the error data, but not all of them. However, the effects themselves are noisy and not completely consistent across set sizes and saturation levels, which sets a ceiling on the performance of the bias model, which assumes the same set of bias vectors for all conditions. Angular errors increase as a function of set size and become less systematic, but these effects reflect the worsening of performance with increasing set size (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>) and are not attributable to stimulus bias.</p><p>The δ-parameter in the extended bias model allowed decoupling of the effects of bias on the radial and tangential components of drift rate. The tangential component produces the oscillatory pattern in the signed angular error; the radial component produces the slow-error pattern <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figures 6 and 12)</ref> and also leads to anisotropies in RT. Unlike stimulusidentification tasks, the effects on RT in our VWM experiments were comparatively small (as they were in the VWM study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fennell &amp; Ratcliff, 2023)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, these effects are shown in terms of median RT (i.e., the .5 distribution quantile). The average values of δ for the four experiments are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref>. Smaller values of δ lead to smaller effects on the radial component of drift rate, as noted previously. The values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table  7</ref> imply a partial decoupling of the radial and tangential components of drift rate, with smaller radial components when stimuli are desaturated, possibly because they are less salient perceptually and have smaller effects on drift rate norms.</p><p>There were appreciable individual differences in the values of δ in all experiments. The standard errors of the mean δ for Experiments 1 to 4 were 0.18, 0.19, 0.08, and 0.08, respectively. Subject MH in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> had a value of δ = 0.35, which was one of the larger estimates for this experiment. With this δ the model predicts small, but systematic, stimulus-dependent variations in RT which capture, at least approximately, similar variations in the data. Other subjects showed anisotropies in the error data but none in RT. For these subjects, the plots of median RT as a function of stimulus location were essentially flat, which is represented in the extended bias model by near-zero values of δ. These effects could not have been predicted by the bias model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al. ( , 2022</ref> and were the reason we introduced the extended bias model here. They highlight what appears to a systematic difference in the effects of stimulus manipulations on accuracy and RT in continuous-outcome stimulus identification and VWM tasks. In the former, stimulus manipulations that have large effects on accuracy also have large effects on RT. In the latter, the effects on RT are smaller. The difference may be due to differences in the way responses are made in the two kinds of tasks: In stimulus identification tasks, presentation of a stimulus is also a signal to respond; in VWM tasks, the response must be delayed until the report cue, which may reduce the effects of stimulus bias on RT.</p><p>In the diffusion process literature there has been a lively debate about the relative merit of simple versus complex models <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lerche &amp; Voss, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ratcliff et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Evans et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2021)</ref>. "Complex models" are models that include all of the components of processing that may affect performance on the task, including acrosstrial variability; "simple models" include only the smallest number of components needed to characterize the main features of speed and accuracy, such as drift rate, boundary separation, and mean nondecision times. Often, the debate has focused on "measurement models," in Oberauer's (2023) sense of the term -that is, models that seek to link constructs like caution, quality of stimulus representation, and relative durations of decision and nondecision times to individual differences in performance on some task. The aim of such models is to identify a small number of parameters that can be measured reliably, which is different to the aim of establishing the scientific ground truth and leads to different choices in the way models are developed. In the case of the two-choice diffusion model, much of the debate has centered around drift-rate variability (η in the standard notation, as here), and its utility or otherwise in accounting for data. Researchers like <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lerche and Voss (2016)</ref> have argued that the main parameters of the two-choice diffusion model are estimated more reliably if η is not included, despite the fact that the reduced model cannot account for established and theoretically-important features of data like the relative speeds of correct and error responses.</p><p>In electing to include the extended bias model in our drift-rate model, we have deliberately placed ourselves in the complex models camp, for the reasons given above, namely, that when the goal is to establish the scientific ground truth, it is important to correctly identify and attribute sources of variability, and to distinguish systematic sources of variability due to differences among stimuli from other, apparently random, sources that cannot (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Evans et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ratcliff et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Smith et al. (2022)</ref> carried out a parameter-recovery study on a spherical generalization of the CDM, equipped with the drift-rate bias model, and showed that parameter recovery was good. We therefore believe that the inclusion of stimulus bias effects in the JP-CDM enhances our ability to draw inferences about the variability of stimulus representations in VWM and its dependence on set size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Our aim in this article was to characterize VWM retrieval as a decision process and to identify the separate contributions of decision process variability and memory variability to the speed and accuracy of retrieval decisions. We have chosen to use a diffusion decision model for this purpose. The two-choice diffusion model was originally proposed as a model of memory retrieval and our work belongs to this theoretical tradition, as noted in the Introduction. From a decision process perspective, the empirical error distributions in continuous-outcome VWM tasks are not veridical reflections of memory variability, but rather give a picture of memory as seen through the lens of the decision process, which contributes variability of its own.</p><p>The benefit of this change in perspective is that it avoids the kinds of theoretical paradoxes that beset models like the slots-plus-averaging model, which was developed to explain why precuing did not produce a predicted reduction in error variance. The diffusion process account holds that noise in the decision process sets limits on the achievable response precision, even when the memory representation is essentially error-free. In two-choice settings, diffusion models have successfully accounted for decisions about the contents of VWM in tasks in which set size is manipulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Sewell et al., 2016)</ref> and in tasks in which people make decisions about brief, backwardly-masked stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Smith et al., 2004)</ref>. Because backward masks destroy the stimulus icon, such decisions must be based on stable stimulus representations in VWM <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith &amp; Sewell, 2013)</ref>. In diffusion process models of such tasks, the strength of the VWM trace determines the drift rate in a diffusion process.</p><p>We have chosen to use the JP distribution to characterize the polar variability of memory and to investigate its dependency on set size because of its flexibility and because it combines in a natural way with the CDM. As we stated in the Introduction, the JP distribution is not intended to represent any one of the existing models of VWM, but has features in common with all of them, so it can function as a generic "front end" to the CDM. Most directly, it can be thought of as a form of variable precision model, but in which variability is represented differently than it is in the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fougnie et al. (2012)</ref> and van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Berg et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Berg et al. ( , 2014</ref>. Unlike those models, there are two sources of memory variability in the JP-CDM. Polar, or angular, variability is given by the JP distribution and is analogous to the variability in other variable precision models. Radial variability is normally distributed and is analogous to drift-rate variability in the two-choice decision model.</p><p>To distinguish the effects of memory and the decision process on speed and accuracy, in Experiments 3 and 4 we varied the saturation of the stimuli and in Experiment 4 we also varied the saturation of the color wheel. These manipulations changed the difficulty of the decision task independently of the difficulty of the memory task because they required subjects to match remembered hues to points on a color wheel across different levels of saturation. We found that manipulations of saturation affected drift rate norms in the CDM, leading to slower and less accurate responses when the task required matching across different levels of saturation, especially when matching a desaturated color in memory to a saturated color wheel.</p><p>With some qualifications, the effects of memory set size on the precision of the memory distribution and the effects of saturation on drift rate norms were separable, highlighting the independent contributions of memory and the decision process to the RT and error distributions. The main qualification is that drift-rate norms showed an overall decrease with set size in Experiments 2 and 3 in which a larger range of set sizes was used. When saturation levels were varied, the costs associated with a mismatch in stimulus-wheel saturation decreased with set size rather than increased, implying some degree of nonlocality in the decision process. The decrease in costs implies that decisions about items in memory benefited from the presence of other items when they involved matching across saturation levels. It implies that decisions are affected, to some degree, by the contents of the entire array, not just the probed item.</p><p>Our experiments here, in which we varied memory set size and, in Experiments 3 and 4, the difficulty of the perceptual matching task, offer an illuminating contrast to the single stimulus identification task of Smith et al. (2020), in which difficulty was manipulated by perturbing stimuli with chromatic noise. There, noise increased the polar variability of the stimulus distribution and decreased drift-rate norms. That is, it both increased stimulus variability and decreased the rate of evidence accumulation. In our experiments here, memory-set size had a similar effect to that of noise in the stimulus identification task, increasing the polar variability of the stimulus distribution, but it had a comparatively small effect on drift-rate norms. In contrast, varying the difficulty of the decision task by varying the color saturation of the stimulus relative to that of the wheel had a systematic effect on drift-rate norms while the leaving polar variability of the stimulus representation unaffected. In other words, external stimulus noise and memory set size affect stimulus representations in a similar way, but noise also reduces the rate of evidence accumulation.</p><p>One of our theoretical objectives was to look for evidence of a sample-size model of memory precision. The sample-size model is theoretically attractive because it provides a precise and parsimonious characterization of VWM capacity, which spans cognitive and neural levels of description. The concept of cognitive "resources" has been popular since <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kahneman's (1973)</ref> capacity model of attention, but it led historically to disillusionment <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Navon, 1984)</ref> because of a lack of a metric in which capacity can be denominated. In contrast to this imprecision, the sample-size model provides an explicit metric for how performance changes as resources are spread more thinly. The simplest expression of this relationship is the inverse square-root law that arises when samples are equally distributed, which becomes a power-law when they are distributed unequally. As well as providing a metric in which to denominate capacity, the sample-size model spans neural and cognitive levels of description. The samples can be viewed as abstract statistical entities whose allocation predicts how performance changes as a function of cognitive load. They can also be viewed as representing activity in a population of noisy Poisson neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bays, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schneegans et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Smith, 2015</ref>). Previously we have found good support for the sample-size model, or a power law model with attention demanding stimuli, in twochoice VWM tasks using either signal detection theory or two-choice diffusion models. The analysis of Bays and colleagues implies that similar effects should be found in memory precision in continuous-outcome tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Tomić &amp; Bays, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Our results showed separable effects of color saturation and set size on the parameters of the JP-CDM. When the stimulus and color wheel were both saturated the set-size effect was well described by the sample-size model, with a slight deviation for a minority of subjects in Experiment 2, which may reflect the nonlocality of the decision task. These results are consistent with the idea that VWM comprises a limited capacity resource represented by a population of noisy evidence samples that are recruited during stimulus encoding and distributed among items in memory. The fact that JP precision was worse for all set sizes with a larger range of items in Experiment 2 than with a smaller range in Experiment 1 highlights the overall metabolic costs of VWM encoding and the fact that encoding is an effortful process, as originally envisaged by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kahneman (1973)</ref>. The sample-size interpretation of the set-size effect is that increasing set size makes VWM representations noisier because they are each based on fewer samples. These changes in internal noise produce changes in the memory distribution that resemble those produced by external chromatic noise in the identification task of .</p><p>The magnitude of the set-size effect increased when stimulus saturation was varied, and was better described by a power law with an exponent β &gt; 0.75. In two-choice VWM tasks, large exponents are related to the use of attention-demanding stimuli and are predicted by an attention-weighted sample-size model in which samples are allocated unequally among the items in memory . We have not attempted to implement an attention-weighted version of the JP-CDM to avoid further complicating an already complex model, but the occurrence of larger exponents with desaturated stimuli is consistent with the idea that encoding them is attention demanding. The likely reason is because the proportion of the primary hue is reduced in desaturated colors, effectively reducing the signal-to-noise ratio, making them more attention demanding to encode. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the data for some subjects were better fitted by a two-β model with a larger value for desaturated than for saturated stimuli.</p><p>We did not need to invoke a guessing process of any kind to account for our data. The polar variability in memory was well described by the JP distribution for all set sizes, including m = 6 in Experiments 2 and 3, with sample-size or power law precision. The larger set size exceeds the typical estimates of the slot limit in slots-plus-guessing models and is where guessing is most likely to occur. We remain skeptical about the utility of guessing as a theoretical construct and note that in the variable precision model of van den Berg et al. (2014), for example, guessing ceases to be well-defined. In their model, an item may be in memory but be represented with very low precision (cf. their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>), in which case the decision maker will have essentially no information about it. Alternatively, it may not be in memory, in which case the decision maker will again have no information about it. The latter decision is a guess; the former is not, but the distinction has no behavioral consequences.</p><p>The fact that van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Berg et al. (2014)</ref> found their data were best-fit with a Poisson encoding model -which predicts guessing on a proportion of trials -likely says more about the mathematical structure of their model than about the role of guessing in memory per se; specifically, it reflects the amount of probability mass their model puts in the tails of the error distributions. Their particular representation of variable precision, which consisted of a mixture of von Mises components with gamma-distributed precision parameters, although it predicts heavy tails, did not predict the tails as well as did a similar model augmented with a guessing component. We adopted the JP distribution to model polar variability in memory based on the results of  who showed that with a large negative value of the shape parameter, ψ, it made equivalent predictions to an encoding-failure model that predicts uniformly distributed errors on a proportion of trials. The shape parameter of the JP distribution plays the same role in the JP-CDM model of VWM as it does in stimulus identification, namely, it allows the model to predict a proportion of very inaccurate responses. Whether or not these responses are viewed as "guesses" is more a matter of taste than theoretical substance, because they emerge as a natural consequence of the representational assumptions of the model without the need to invoke a mixture of memory-based and guessing processes.</p><p>The distinction between memory-based and guessing processes, which is partially abolished in the variable precision model, is wholly abolished in the population code models, which we characterized in the Introduction as the third wave of VWM theories. Instead of guessing, these models assume that the probability mass in the tails of the error distribution arises from noise in an array of tuned detectors. The peak of the tuning function decreases with set size, which increases the probability that a detector far from the peak will respond most strongly, increasing the likelihood of very inaccurate responses.</p><p>Although the JP-CDM is in broad agreement with the population code models in abolishing the distinction between memory-based responses and guessing, the models parameterize the effects of set size in different ways. The JP-CDM parameterizes the set-size effect via the inverse CSD of the JP distribution. This is consistent with the idea that the sample-size model is fundamentally a theory of variance, as it is in the two-choice signal detection model, even though the set-size predictions in that model are expressed in terms of d ′ . In contrast, in the population code models the shape of the tuning function remains invariant while its peak amplitude changes with set size. In the TCC model, the error distribution is represented by a similarity gradient that is invariant with set size and a set-size dependent d ′ parameter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Oberauer (2023)</ref> likewise found that the most parsimonious representation of data in the population code models was one in which the width of the tuning function -represented either by the concentration of a von Mises distribution or exponential decay in a Laplace distribution -remained invariant, while the amplitude changed.</p><p>In agreement with Oberauer's (2023) results, in a companion project to the present one, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Qian et al. (2024)</ref> investigated the class of measurement models studied by Oberauer, focusing particularly on his preferred Gumbel-max model, and found evidence for a samplesize relationship expressed in the amplitude of the tuning function. If the inferred tuning function is the aggregate of many independent, individual, neural tuning functions, with the same centers but random amplitudes, whose number depends on set size, then such a relationship is theoretically plausible. Given the differences in the way the sample-size relationship is expressed in the JP-CDM and the population code models, a fruitful avenue for further research would be to combine the CDM with one or more of the population code memory models and to investigate how the set-size effect is expressed when the model is used to predict drift rates.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fennell and Ratcliff (2023)</ref> proposed another approach to modeling the speed and accuracy of decision making in VWM based on Ratcliff's (2018) SCDM model. The SCDM is an alternative way to extend diffusion models to continuous-outcome decisions. The CDM, used here, can be viewed as a generalization of the original diffusion model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ratcliff (2018)</ref>, in which evidence is accumulated by a single signed process, in which the sign of the drift rate encodes the identify of the stimulus. The CDM extends the same idea to two evidence dimensions. The SCDM can be viewed as extending the class of parallel, racing diffusion models, which includes the dual diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ratcliff et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Smith, 2023)</ref> and the leaky competing accumulator model <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001)</ref>, in which each choice alternative is represented by own accumulator. The SCDM extends the idea of parallel accumulators to the continuum limit, in which the accumulating evidence is represented by a Gaussian random process with a prescribed correlation function, which smoothes the function and makes responses at adjacent points similarly probable. Instead of a scalar or vector-valued drift rate, as assumed in the original diffusion model and the CDM, respectively, the drift rate in the SCDM is a continuous function, which determines how rapidly evidence accumulates for each of the choice alternatives. In the model in its current form, the drift rate follows a normal distribution with a prescribed standard deviation and a stimulus-dependent amplitude that varies across trials. Evidence is accumulated until the process reaches a criterion level, analogous to the radius of the criterion circle in the CDM. The point at which the process first reaches the criterion determines the response and the time taken to reach it determines the decision time. Unlike the CDM, there are no explicit expressions for the RT and accuracy distributions for the SCDM and its predictions must be evaluated by simulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fennell and Ratcliff (2023)</ref> applied the SCDM to several color VWM experiments in which responses were made using eye movements, a mouse, or a touch screen, focusing on what we have termed "first wave" theories, comprising slots, resources, and guessing. They found the SCDM gave a good account of the RT and error data when the driftrate amplitudes and decision criteria both varied with set size and the memory process was augmented with guessing, represented as a Gaussian process with a zero drift-rate function, in which evidence accumulation was driven by noise alone. Like the free-κ models we reported here, they did not constrain the amplitudes of the drift rate functions, but they reported that the set-size amplitudes followed a power law with exponents that varied from 0.5 to 1.0, depending on the memory model, in agreement with the JP-CDM estimates reported here. They argued that trial-to-trial criterion setting is possible in VWM because the set size is known at the beginning of the retention interval, prior to the cue that initiates evidence accumulation. Allowing criteria to vary with stimuli relinquishes one of the core selective influence assumptions of evidence accumulation models, as we noted earlier. Somewhat counterintuitively, criteria were lower with large set sizes, suggesting that people become less conservative in their criterion settings as the task gets harder rather than more conservative. In contrast, in the JP-CDM, we were able to retain the selective influence assumption that decision criteria are independent of stimulus discriminability.</p><p>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fennell and Ratcliff (2023)</ref> focused on first-wave memory models, there is a natural correspondence in the representational assumptions of the SCDM and the population code models, which we termed third-wave theories, because both it and they assume that memory is represented as a continuous array of noisy detectors. The max-rule used in the signal detection models considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Oberauer (2023)</ref> corresponds closely to the first-finishing decision rule in the SCDM, and the normally-distributed drift rate function in the SCDM likewise corresponds to the von Mises tuning function in his models. Potentially, then, versions of the SCDM with Laplace tuning functions could be considered and compared, allowing the SCDM to be brought into contact with the full range of population code models. Here, we adopted the JP distribution as a front end for the CDM because of its flexibility and to avoid restricting ourselves to a specific VWM model, but versions of the CDM in which it is combined with population code models would also be of theoretical interest. We see these possibilities as fruitful directions for future research.</p><p>Another potentially fruitful future direction, intersecting the previous one, would be to compare the CDM and SCDM as models of decision making in other tasks. As we noted above, these two models generalize the two main classes of diffusion models, single accumulator and racing accumulator models, respectively, to the continuum. In two-choice decisions, models of both classes have been shown to give good accounts of choice probabilities and RT distributions and have proven difficult to distinguish in data with any certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Smith, 2023)</ref>. There have been many fewer applications of diffusion models to continuous-outcome tasks compared to the voluminous literature on two-choice tasks, but the published applications suggest that both models can provide good accounts of choice probabilities and RT distributions. The lack of explicit expressions for the SCDM means direct comparison of it and the CDM presents some methodological challengesit precludes maximum-likelihood fitting of the SCDM, for example, although there are approximation methods that might be extended to continuous-outcome tasks <ref type="bibr">(Turner &amp; Sederberg, 2012)</ref>. The results of such a comparison would be informative, both in their own right and as an aid to the characterization of VWM retrieval as a decision process. The combination of different memory models and different decision models represents a rich and untapped vein of possibilities for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this article we have sought to reframe the continuous-outcome VWM task as a decision task and to apply a model of continuous-outcome decisions, the CDM, to model the RT and error distributions from this task. We used a stimulus saturation manipulation to decouple the difficulty of the decision task from the difficulty of the memory task and showed that the speed and accuracy of retrieval decisions were well described by the JP-CDM, in which the polar variability of memory follows a Jones-Pewsey distribution. This distribution includes other models of memory variability, like the von Mises distribution, as special cases. We found that drift rates norms in the CDM, which determine rates of evidence accumulation, were lower when the decision task required matching across saturation levels, independent of the memory load in the task. The set-size effect was well described by either a sample-size model or a power-law model in the CSD, depending on whether saturation levels varied. The sample-size model implies that VWM is a limited capacity resource comprised of a population of noisy evidence samples that are shared among items in memory. When the evidence samples are allocated unequally, as occurs when one or more items captures attention, a power-law relation is predicted. Our results are consistent with a statistical model of resources of this kind. Our data were well described by a JP distribution with a large negative exponent, which predicts very inaccurate memory representations on some trials. This form of variable precision allowed us to account for the heavy tails of the error distribution without an explicit guessing process. The JP-CDM we have proposed here links VWM retrieval theoretically to continuous-outcome and two-choice decision tasks in other settings where diffusion models have been successfully applied. The success of the JP-CDM points towards a common process that underlies the speed and accuracy of decisions in discrete and continuous tasks in both perception and memory.</p><p>the two experiments, five in Experiment 1 (three females, two males) and five in Experiment 2 (two females, three males).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The experimental sessions were run individually in a dimly-lit booth. The Eyelink II provides automatic calibration and drift-correction procedures, and we verified during pilot testing that it reliably recorded the endpoints of eye movements made to targets on the circumference of a circle of the same diameter as the color wheel. The calibration procedure required subjects to fixate on each of nine fiducial markers on the screen in turn and was carried out at the start of the session and repeated at the start of each 48-trial block. The subject's eye position was shown on an external monitor outside the experimental booth where it could be assessed for calibration and drift artifacts by the experimenter.</p><p>Each subject completed 10 experimental sessions, each of 160 trials, yielding a total of 1,600 trials per subject, 400 in each of the set size conditions. Subjects were instructed to fixate on a central cross on the display at the beginning of each trial and maintain fixation until they had made a decision. Once fixation was achieved, the stimulus display, consisting of 1, 2, 3, or 4 color patches in Experiment 1 or 1, 2, 4, or 6 color patches in Experiment 2, was presented for 300 ms. At the end of a 900 ms retention interval, a probe stimulus instructed subjects to recall the color of the patch presented at that location. They expressed their decisions by making saccadic eye movements to points on the color wheel that corresponded to the remembered colors. Reaction time (RT) was measured as the first time that deflection of the eyes exceeded 90% of the distance from the fixation point to the inner circle of the color wheel, and the response was taken as the location of the first corrective fixation after the eyes had crossed the inner circle.</p></div>

The stimuli were square color patches in Experiment 3 and circular patches in Experiment 4, subtending 0.97 • of visual angle, presented on a black background, and were equidistantly positioned on an imaginary circle subtending 4.7 • of visual angle. The stimuli were generated in Matlab in CIELUV space to ensure a constant luminance as color saturation varied and were viewed in a dimly-lit room.</p><p>Experiment 3 presented either high or low saturation colors, and subjects always responded on a high saturation color wheel. Experiment 4 factorially varied the saturation of the stimuli and the color wheel. The color wheel was an annulus of width 2.12 • and inner radius of 12.19 • . The color wheel was rotated randomly at the start of each experimental session and again at its midpoint. High saturation colors were centered at the CIELUV white-point (L = 54, U = 0.0037, V = −0.0275) with a UV radius of 127.97, while low saturation colors had a UV radius of only 51.59. Color sets comprised 360 colors selected at one-degree increments and converted to RGB for online display in the JSpsych-Javascript environment. Experiment 3 presented either 1, 2, 4, or 6 color patches in random order on each trial; Experiment 4 presented either 1, 2, or 4 color patches.</p></div>

In Experiment 3 the stimuli were displayed for 1,500 ms; in Experiment 4 the exposure duration was reduced to 400 ms to increase the difficulty of the decision task. At the end of the exposure period, the stimuli were extinguished and a 1,000 ms retention interval began. At the end of the retention interval, gray masks were displayed at each of the stimulus locations, one of which had a distinctive white border that acted as the report cue for the trial.</p><p>Subjects made their responses by moving the mouse from a central 1.26 • home circle to the point on the color wheel that matched their memory of the cued color. The response was the point at which the mouse first crossed the inner radius of the color wheel, and the RT was the time elapsing from the report cue to the time of the first inner radius crossing. Accuracy feedback was given on each trial via an exterior arc on the color wheel showing the subject's response relative to the target color for 1,000 ms before the trial ended. Fast and slow responses, defined as RTs shorter than 300 ms or longer than 3,000 ms, were penalized by a 4,000 ms timeout delay before the start of the next trial, accompanied by a text message explaining the reason for the penalty.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(a).

(a) A stimulus presented at location θ is represented by a drift rate vector, ν θ . Drift-rate bias is represented by a set of bias vectors, b i . (b) The resultant drift rate is the vector sum of the drift rate associated with the stimulus and the nearest bias vector.(c) The drift-rate biases are exponentially decaying functions of the distance between the stimulus at θ and the bias vector at ϕ in the 1 − cos(•) circular distance metric. The total bias is the sum of the biases associated with each of the bias vectors. In the extended bias model the distancedependent bias, ν θ, bias , is decomposed into tangential and radial components, ν θ, tan. +δν θ, rad. , where δ parameterizes the radial component.</figDesc></figure>

The panel on the left shows the displays used in the eye-movement experiments (Experiments 1 and 2). A wider color wheel was used because subjects had to fixate on points on the wheel to express their responses and the overall luminance was lower because the experiments were run in neardark conditions. The panels on the right show the displays in the mouse-movement experiments (Experiments 3 and 4) that varied the color saturation of the stimuli and the wheel. Clockwise from top left: (a) desaturated four-element display; (b) desaturated six-element display with desaturated color wheel: (c) saturated display with saturated color wheel; (d) retrieval cue and post-trial feedback arc.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and Apparatus</head><p>The experimental setup and stimulus display for Experiments 1 and 2 closely resembled the one used in the chromatic noise decision task of . The experiments were run on a pair of linked computers, one controlling a Cambridge Research Systems ViSaGe framestore that presented the stimuli with 12-bit color resolution and the other controlling an Eyelink II eye movement monitor with head-mounted infrared sensors that recorded responses. The stimuli were presented on a gamma-corrected 21" Sony Trinitron Multiscan CRT monitor with a resolution of 1024 × 768 px and a refresh rate of 100 Hz viewed from a distance of 100 cm. Stimulus presentation and response recording were carried out by custom C++ software. The stimuli were viewed in a near-dark room to facilitate eye-movement recording.</p><p>The stimuli were specified in CIELUV space, which is one of two isoluminant, equidiscriminability color spaces defined by the <ref type="bibr">CIE in 1976</ref><ref type="bibr">(Wyszecki &amp; Stiles, 1982</ref><ref type="bibr">pp. 164-169)</ref>, the other being CIELAB space. Stimuli defined in these spaces have the properties of being isoluminant and, if they are separated by equal distances, equally discriminable. The two spaces are similar, but CIELUV space is thought to be superior for luminous devices like monitors and preserves the relative location of color hues as luminance changes, while CIELAB space is thought to be superior for reflective devices like offset printers and has less reliable hue positions across changes in luminance. The stimuli were circular color patches of 38 pixels (0.81 • ) diameter with colors chosen from a CIELUV white-point (L = 16, U = 0.1792, V = 0.4276) with a UV radius of 20, presented on a uniform gray background centered on the same white-point. The comparatively low values of the luminance coordinate and UV radius (cf. Experiments 3 and 4 below) were chosen to minimize screen glare when viewed under low-light conditions.</p><p>Experiment 1 presented either 1, 2, 3, or 4 color patches in random order on each trial; Experiment 2 presented either 1, 2, 4, or 6 color patches. The possible patch locations were equally spaced points on the circumference of an imaginary wheel of 72 pixels (1.5 • ) radius, centered on a 5 px fixation cross. On each trial, subjects were required to indicate the remembered hue of a color patch that was probed at the end of the retention interval and to express their decisions by making a saccadic eye movement from the fixation cross to a point on a surrounding color wheel. The color wheel was an annulus of width 1.5 • whose inner and outer circle subtended an angle of 6.1 • and 9.1 • , respectively. The wheel was rotated randomly after each 48-trial block.</p></div>
