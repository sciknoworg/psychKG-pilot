				<p>Understanding how people assign subjective value to outcomes with multiple attributes, such as risk and delay, is central to understanding the structure and manifestation of economic preferences. However, multi-attribute preference has been primarily studied through binary choices. The price at which a person would buy, sell, or equate each prospect offers another measure of subjective value that may diverge from multi-attribute choice. In both risky and intertemporal domains, choice and price preferences exhibit systematic preference reversals, where a smaller, sooner, or safer option is chosen while a larger, later, or riskier alternative is assigned a higher price. The present study takes a deep dive into how subjective value is assigned in each case in an attempt to reconcile these diverging measurements and methods of assessing value. To explain how and why preferences change across choice and price, the domains of gains and losses, price frames of buying and selling, and varying levels of time pressure, we develop a two-step neural network-based modeling approach. First, we tested cognitive mechanisms underlying value-based judgments and decisions using a switchboard model comparison. Next, we fit and evaluated individualized joint models, where all data from an individual is modeled using parameters and mechanisms that are specific to their best-fitting model structure. While mechanisms like delay discounting and risk aversion are common to both models, our results suggest that anchoring and payoff sensitivity diverged between pricing and choice. Extensive differences across elicitation procedures indicate that a common representation of value may remain elusive.</p>

It is based upon the idea that an individual can assign a continuous value or utility to a prospect based on a weighted combination of its attributes or features. An item's utility can be compared against the value of a dollar to assign prices, or compared against the value of other prospects to determine which one should be favored. In theory, utility should be solely determined by the prospects' attributes, such as the amount of an outcome to be gained or lost, the likelihood of realizing the outcome, and the outcome's delay to receipt can all affect the value of a prospect. Yet true preferences and subjective value are influenced by contextual factors, such as whether options are gains or *Corresponding author. 945 Center Dr, Gainesville, FL 32611.

However, it is unclear whether changes in preference are due to differences in representations of subjective value, due to differences in decision-making processes mapping subjective value onto a response, or differences in both. The answer to these questions has serious implications for whether, and how, we can consistently and reliably assess a common "subjective value" construct using different measurement procedures.</p><p>Three key determinants of subjective value are what payoffs a decision-maker could potentially experience, the likelihood of realizing those payoffs, and when the payoffs would be realized (E. U. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Weber &amp; Johnson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tversky et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fudenberg &amp; Levine, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wu et al., 2022)</ref>. Understanding how these three attributes are combined in different types of judgments and decisions is therefore central to forming a coherent theory of value and how preferences arise out of objective attributes. In this paper, we take the first steps toward an integrated theory of subjective value by uniting descriptive theory and dynamic cognitive process models to accommodate preferences as they are expressed in both binary choice and price elicitation procedures. We build on the literature on preference reversals between choice and pricing in risky choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Slovic &amp; Lichtenstein, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson &amp; Busemeyer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020)</ref> and intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kvam et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tversky et al., 1990;</ref> to evaluate cognitive mechanisms contributing to reversals when both risk and delay are considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahlbrecht &amp; Weber, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">B. J. Weber &amp; Chapman, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Components of subjective value</head><p>When judging the value of an option, the first component is the utility or usefulness of possible outcomes. Potential payoffs are particularly important to utility because they can directly and independently confer value, as opposed to modifying or discounting the value of other attributes. Typically, increasing payoffs x are related to their subjective utility u(x) by a power-law utility function <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1944)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u(x) = x α<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Typical values of α &lt; 1 yield a concave function representing diminishing marginal utility, so that each consecutive unit of x adds less value to the utility u(x) of x. Conceptualized in terms of value similarity, $1 and $2 are subjectively less similar than $11 and $12. This utility function does not necessarily rule out values of α greater than 1 that represent increasing marginal utility, where each consecutive unit x adds greater value to the utility u(x) of x, although such situations are relatively rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kvamme et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The second economic component of subjective value that we consider is how people value outcomes that are realized in the future. Delayed outcomes tend to decrease in value v(t) as the delay t to their receipt increases by a hyperbolic function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ainslie, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mazur, 1987)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v(t) = 1 1 + k • t<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In other words, each consecutive unit of time reduces the value of an outcome less than the previous unit of time. Higher values of k indicate a higher rate of delay discounting. However, unlike payoffs, delays do not inherently confer value. Positive payoffs tend to decrease in value as they are delayed, while negative payoffs tend to increase in value as they are delayed (i.e., they become less bad). Delay therefore functions as a secondary attribute that modifies the utility of a potential payoff.</p><p>The third economic component of subjective value we focus on is the likelihood that an outcome occurs. Risky outcomes are thought to decrease in value by multiplying the utility of an outcome by the subjective weight assigned to each outcome, where the weight is proportional to its likelihood of being realized. Like delays, probabilities modify the value of a payoff -decreasing the probability of a positive outcome decreases its value, but decreasing the probability of a negative outcome increases an option's value. In prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>, the subjective weight of an outcome w(p) is related to the explicit probability of an outcome p by an inverse s-shaped probability weighting function <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Prelec, 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w(p) = e (−(− ln(p)) b )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Values of b less than 1 result in low probabilities being subjectively more likely, and high probabilities being subjectively less likely. Values of b greater than 1 result in a sshaped function where low probabilities are subjectively less likely, and high probabilities are subjectively more likely. When options are beneficial (gains), lower values of b indicate greater risk-seeking, while higher values of b indicate relatively risk-averse behavior. When options are harmful (losses) this interpretation flips, where higher values of b are considered risk-seeking because, in a choice context, an individual has a relative preference for larger, riskier gambles.</p><p>The way that delay and risk affect payoff value is central to understanding the functions that are used to combine them. Because payoffs confer independent value, their utilities are added together to compute the overall utility of a prospect or choice option. However, risks and delays must be transformed (into probability weights and discount factors) and then multiplied by the utilities of payoffs rather than added, because they only modify an existing utility. In traditional models combining the three, the overall value of a prospect v(x, p,t) is defined as a function of the payoffs x, probabilities p, and delays t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v(x, p,t) = ∑ j u(x j ) • v(t j ) • w(p j )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>However, it is not obvious that they should combined in such a straightforward way. In the last thirty years, there is increasing interest in multi-attribute decisions that are both delayed and risky <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Keren &amp; Roelofsma, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahlbrecht &amp; Weber, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson &amp; Stafford, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sun &amp; Li, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baucells &amp; Heukamp, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Vanderveldt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hardisty &amp; Pfeffer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Luckman et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Luckman et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Konstantinidis et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Xu et al., 2022)</ref>. Much work has investigated the effects of adding a fixed level of risk to intertemporal choices or fixed delays to risky choices as a way to examine how (if) the two attributes interact with one another. The presence of a fixed delay added to two risky gains increased risk-seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sun &amp; Li, 2010)</ref>. However, a fixed risk added to intertemporal choice options can produce various effects. Some studies find that the presence of a fixed risk added to two intertemporal gains increased impulsivity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson &amp; Stafford, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sun &amp; Li, 2010)</ref>, others suggest increased self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Keren &amp; Roelofsma, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">B. J. Weber &amp; Chapman, 2005)</ref>, and others find no differences in delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hardisty &amp; Pfeffer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Xu et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Because of these apparent interactions, there are also questions about how delay and risk should be concatenated: additively <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Killeen, 2009)</ref> or multiplicatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ho et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Vanderveldt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cox &amp; Dallery, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Konstantinidis et al., 2020)</ref> as in Equation 4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Killeen (2009)</ref> found an additive solution by using power functions to describe the utility of amount, delay, and risk and subtracted the disutility of delay and risk from the utility of amount. However, this does not explain why negative payoffs are modified in a positive way by delays and risks to become less bad. More recent work featuring descriptive models supported delay and risk concatenating multiplicatively as in Equation 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Vanderveldt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cox &amp; Dallery, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Konstantinidis et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Together, these descriptive models have provided a good account of intertemporal and risky choices. For any fixed set of payoffs, delays, and probabilities, a decision-maker should be able to compute and compare a fixed subjective value. However, this is at odds with the observation that value orders are not consistent across different methods of eliciting subjective values. Different measurement contexts -such as pricing and choice, buying and selling, with and without time pressure -result in apparent differences in preference that must be accounted for in a unified theory of subjective value.</p><p>The reason for these differences between studies is unknown, but may be ameliorated by the use of cognitive process models when analyzing behavior. In this paper, we develop "individualized" joint cognitive models -where bestfitting models for separate conditions are identified, and then a person's data is fit altogether (including covariances among parameters) to evaluate how performance in different conditions is related. In the next section, we examine theoretical components and explanations that have been considered to account for these effects, allowing us to build the models for both choice and pricing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulations influencing subjective value</head><p>Although the economic components of utility, delay to receipt, and risk comprise basic properties of each option, their interactions with each other are apparently nontrivial. The choice-price preference reversals that are common in risky choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Slovic &amp; Lichtenstein, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bostic et al., 1990)</ref> -where participants will assign a higher price to a risky option (e.g., 40% chance of $20) than a safe option (e.g., $9 for sure), but select the safe op-tion when they are presented side by side -also extend to intertemporal choice and pricing <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kvam et al., 2021;</ref>. Therefore, we might expect reversals in risky intertemporal choice and pricing, such that participants assign greater prices to risky, delayed prospects than to safe, immediate ones.</p><p>It has been suggested that having multiple attributes may reduce the prevalence of preference reversals <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. For example, studies comparing choices between two risky intertemporal options against choices between a risky intertemporal option and an individual's previously elicited price equivalent revealed bi-directional preference reversals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahlbrecht &amp; Weber, 1997)</ref>. Most individuals had stable preferences with a similar number of reversals toward the risky and safe alternatives -a pattern not easily explained by scale compatibility or attribute prominence effects that predict unidirectional reversals. By modeling the influence of risk and delay in both choice and pricing tasks, our goal is to understand (a) how the three interact to produce overall subjective values, and (b) how they affect the effects that lead to preference reversals between pricing and choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alós-Ferrer &amp; Ritschel, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the theoretically interesting aspects of choice-price preference reversals, pricing tasks may also be a more efficient method of measuring preferences and the effects of amount, delay, and probability on subjective value. Choice tasks tend to either present a fixed set of choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kirby et al., 1999)</ref> or present two options and titrate the properties of the options over multiple trials until a static indifference point is found <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Becker et al., 1964)</ref>. For example, if a person is indifferent between $5 now and $10 in a week, $10 in a week has the same subjective value as $5 now. In contrast, a price task can determine the present or certain value of a delayed or risky outcome through a single trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 1971)</ref>. From an information theoretic standpoint, price responses are much more efficient measurements than binary choices, making them more easily fit by statistical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sokratous et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Losses. In this study, we aim for a more complete picture of risky intertemporal choice by also exploring whether and when valuation of gains and losses lead to different patterns of behavior. Specifically, avoiding losses tends to be assigned a higher value than seeking gains, referred to as loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1991)</ref>. For example, most people would not engage in a prospect that has a 50-50 chance of gaining $100 or losing $100 because the $100 loss is subjectively worse than the $100 gain is beneficial. Beyond this, more recent work has identified that losses retain more value after a delay than gains, commonly referred to as the sign effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Frederick et al., 2002)</ref>, and losses entail more risk-seeking behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. However, others find no evidence of loss aversion in risky gambles with small payoffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Zeif &amp; Yechiam, 2022)</ref>. Therefore, we compare decisions between gains and decisions between losses to test for differences in the value assigned to outcome utility, delay to receipt, and risk. Unlike typical accounts of loss aversion where the subjective value of a loss in a mixed gamble is multiplied by the coefficient λ as a free parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>, we instead compare preferences and prices for the same prospects when they are presented as a pair of gains or a pair of losses. Systematic differences between the two can be modeled to test for differences in parameters relating to payoff utility, delay, and risk between gains and losses in choice and pricing tasks.</p><p>Buying and selling. Beyond simple valence, differences in the prices assigned to buying a prospect compared to selling a prospect, referred to as the endowment effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Thaler, 1980)</ref>, have commonly been thought of as an example of loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kahneman et al., 1991)</ref>. Buying a prospect resembles a bid to gain an outcome, while selling a prospect resembles a price to lose an outcome. However, the dynamics distinguishing buying from selling may be more complicated, because it is inherently advantageous to buy a prospect at the lowest agreeable price and sell a prospect at the highest agreeable price, regardless of valence (gain or loss). Additionally, recent work suggests that the endowment effect may be driven by ownership rather than gains or losses, where participants assigned higher value to items already owned than those not yet owned regardless of whether they were buyers or sellers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Morewedge et al., 2009)</ref>. We compare buying and selling for both gains and losses to elucidate whether buy-sell differences are simple manifestations of the sign effect, or whether they have a unique effect not captured by differences in valence.</p><p>By evaluating the combination of losses and buying/selling here, we evaluate the role that loss aversion plays in valuation differences between willingness to pay (buying) and willingness to accept (selling) judgments. Theoretically, losses should flip the effect of ownership; instead of accepting money to give up a prospect you have, one must pay money to offload a prospective liability. If ownership has inherent value, then the liability should have inherent value and participants should not be willing to pay as much; however, if it being a loss is the concern, then participants should pay more to offload the liability than they would to pay to acquire an equivalent gain. The design we pursue below therefore allows us to test competing theories of loss aversion and the buy-seller gap.</p><p>Time pressure. The final factor we examine that might influence choice and price responses is time pressure. Generally, a response deadline results in decision-makers being more strongly influenced by their biases and stochastic variability in the decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Olschewski &amp; Rieskamp, 2021)</ref>. The effects of time pressure may be particularly clear when comparing prices to buy versus prices to sell. If time pressure increases the influence of biases on pricing responses, then sell trials under time pressure may produce relatively higher price responses, while buy trials under time pressure may produce relatively lower price responses.</p><p>At this point, we have discussed the descriptive models of how people consider the value of outcomes that are delayed and risky and some of the experimental manipulations that change apparent preferences. Accounting for this behavior through only descriptive models requires one of two solutions. First, there may be genuine differences in subjective value between conditions, such that the parameters in equations 1, 2, and 3 change between conditions. Second, additional parameters, such as a loss aversion parameter, can be added to the utility calculation. These parameters necessarily have conditional dependencies. For example, loss aversion applies only to outcomes that are negative and does not influence positive outcomes, while other parameters like α in equation 1 may be shared across gains and losses. The first option has the benefit of a single function or concatenation of functions accounting for a wide variety of behavior, but an individual's parameter estimates necessarily fail to represent a general cognitive process. Rather than characterizing a person as relatively more or less impulsive, we would need to always include the contextual conditions under which a person displays impulsive characteristics. With this approach, our ability to predict the behavior of an individual across tasks or conditions within a task is limited by how strongly related parameters are between tasks and conditions for that person.</p><p>If we instead pursue the second option, where manipulations introduce additional mechanisms not present in other conditions, we end up with models that have increasingly many interchangeable parts for every new effect. This approach more closely represents a general process but requires an extensive modeling toolbox to account for all specifics in a task. Though, this may be appropriate given the vast number of manipulations that influence apparent preferences. However, both approaches relying on descriptive models fail to explain the cognitive phenomena that generate behavior. A third approach is to introduce additional sources of data that go beyond choices and prices to explore a different class of models -cognitive process models -where both responses and process data like response times or eye-tracking are used to estimate underlying cognitive processes that play an explanatory role in behavior. While the majority of research on the subjective value of risky and delayed decisions has been in choice contexts described by static models, dynamic evidence accumulation models that jointly account for responses and response times have been shown to provide a competitive account of risky choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993)</ref>, intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dai &amp; Busemeyer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rodriguez et al., 2014)</ref>, and risky intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Konstantinidis et al., 2020)</ref>. Recent advances in evidence accumulation models have allowed them to account for con-tinuous responses, like price responses under risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sokratous et al., 2023;</ref>. In most cases, dynamic and descriptive models compete to explain a phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Konstantinidis et al., 2020)</ref> -however, it is also possible to allow the accumulation process to be driven by components inherited from descriptive models so we can test whether parameters traditionally related to subjective value change across experimental manipulations even when constrained by a dynamic model.</p><p>A related approach to providing explanatory power to cognitive models related to subjective value is through attentional mechanisms that influence evidence accumulation patterns and/or parameters from descriptive models. For example, choice phenomena can be accounted for by modulating sampling probabilities in Decision Field Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bhatia, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kellen et al., 2020)</ref>. Process data, like mouse-tracing or eye-tracking has also been used to link attention and descriptive theories of choice, like option attention  and attribute attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Zilker &amp; Pachur, 2022)</ref> influencing the shape of a person's probability weighting function <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Zilker &amp; Pachur, 2023)</ref>. Attention can thus be an approach to either sidestep descriptive theories of subjective value, allowing attentional dynamics in evidence accumulation to account for apparent distortions of attributes, or attention can explain changes in the parameters of descriptive theories in different contexts. In this paper, we include an anchoring and adjusting process in the price model that can, in principle, explain choice-price preference reversals <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020)</ref>. This anchoring process effectively represents a period of attention dedicated to the scalecompatible payoff, before attention is directed towards secondary attributes, like delay and risk, to adjust bids. Therefore, shorter response times tend to have a stronger anchor on the payoff from greater relative attention paid to the payoff.</p><p>While the present study does not feature attentional process data, like eye-tracking, future work should compare competing attentional mechanisms. In the alternative-wise versus attribute-wise section, we test additional modeling approaches that integrate attention as part of their structurecorresponding to extended versions of decision field theory and the direct difference model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dai &amp; Busemeyer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993)</ref>. Because of the relative fit of these models, a weaker link to traditional economic models of expected utility and delay discounting, and their inability to explain behavior in the pricing condition, they ultimately do not take center stage in our conclusions. Instead, we aim to bridge the psychological and economic modeling approaches using dynamic cognitive process models that characterize each unique individual and how they respond to different conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical motivation</head><p>A key aim of this paper is to synthesize descriptive-level and process-level theory into a common modeling framework, providing dynamic models of preference that converge asymptotically to the descriptive models presented above. Choice-price reversals were first identified in risky decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 1971)</ref>, followed by delayed decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tversky et al., 1990)</ref>. When separated, delay and risk both produce similar patterns of choice-price reversals: larger outcomes are assigned a greater value despite long delays or low probabilities, but smaller outcomes with more attractive short delays and high probabilities are preferred when choosing between two options. This phenomenon -specifically the unidirectional nature of preference reversals -was called into question when outcomes are concurrently delayed and risky. When comparing choices between a previously elicited immediate and certain value of a delayed and risky prospect and the prospect itself, people shift their preferences, but the observed shift does not systematically produce relatively greater assessments of value for larger outcomes in pricing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahlbrecht &amp; Weber, 1997</ref>). Ahlbrecht and Weber pose two potential explanations for why preferences diverge bidirectionally: attribute prominence effects during choice and scale-compatibility effects during pricing, but conclude that their data do not support either.</p><p>Since this time, much work has investigated delay and risk concurrently in choices, but to our knowledge, no other studies featuring both delay and risk have included pricing tasks. Models of preferential choice tasks have significantly evolved, with modern cognitive process models frequently invoking evidence accumulation processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ratcliff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011)</ref>. Some models use descriptive psychoeconomic theories to drive the drift rate of an accumulation process in risky choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Diederich &amp; Trueblood, 2018)</ref> and intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Zhao et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dai et al., 2018)</ref>. Despite the prevalence of evidence accumulation models in two-attribute choice (e.g., risky choice), risky and delayed choices have been primarily modeled through descriptive, static models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Luckman et al., 2020)</ref>. A recent paper investigated risky-intertemporal choices by separately modeling them through prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting or evidence accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Konstantinidis et al., 2020)</ref>. A clear next step is to unify these three models into theories where the rate of evidence accumulation is driven by the subjective value of a prospect as described jointly by prospect theory and hyperbolic delay discounting models. Using response times to constrain parameter estimates can help to identify if manipulations that influence preference are due to genuine differences in perceived subjective value.</p><p>A modeling framework that unites process-level theory (sequential sampling) and descriptive-level theory (utility theory, prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting) may help explain how and why people make risky intertempo-ral choices -something that appears to be necessary given the numerous methodological discrepancies between studies that manifest in seemingly inconsistent effects. Here, we show that both decision-making and pricing models can be formed from these elements, and compare patterns of behavior across the two in order to understand the underlying valuation process that gives rise to different types of responses.</p><p>Beyond explaining choices, there appears to be much to learn regarding choice-price preference reversals in multiattribute prospects. While we might expect preference reversals to be less common for multiattribute stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref>, we do not see a clear reason as to why reversals should not maintain the trend of assigning relatively greater prices to larger outcomes despite choosing the smaller <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahlbrecht &amp; Weber, 1997)</ref>. Therefore we see this as an opportunity to also independently test whether we observe choice-price preference reversals and use a unified modeling framework to compare the two elicitation procedures in terms of common psychological processes. To compare choice and pricing in this way, we must develop an analogous model that produces price responses. Our previous work regarding the pricing of risky prospects has laid the foundation for the model we present in this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sokratous et al., 2023;</ref>. This paper aims to develop a unified modeling approach applicable to choice and price for risky delayed prospects with the flexibility to explain sign effects, buy/sell framing manipulations, and the consequences of time pressure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental methods</head><p>To explore how delay and risk concurrently affect the value of an outcome, we ran an experiment where participants chose between two delayed and probabilistic prospects. Prospects were presented as either a pair of gains or a pair of losses. Participants also priced each prospect individually as if they were selling or buying the prospect. A total of 10 participants (50% female, ages 18-34) completed 4 sessions of the experiment on different days within 4 weeks. This small-N approach was chosen to dovetail with our statistical models, where all manipulations are delivered within subjects twice. This gives us precise estimates of common cognitive processes between manipulations while allowing the models to flexibly capture changes in key parameters of interest. In this design, each subject can function like a case study, replicating each effect, and we can assess the testretest reliability of our measures and effects. Each session lasted approximately 60 minutes.</p><p>The sample size also allowed us to create personalized, or "individualized," cognitive models. Part of the challenge of comparing choice and pricing is that the two may feature different cognitive mechanisms. Likewise, different individuals might approach each condition or respond to different manipulations in diverging ways. As a result, we aimed to model each individual and their response to condition manipulations separately. This required (1) identifying the best-fitting model for each participant in each condition, and then (2) constructing a joint model <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Turner et al., 2013)</ref> that predicted each participant's behavior across all conditions, simultaneously estimating parameters and their covariances <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wall et al. (2021)</ref>. Because each individual could potentially be characterized with an entirely different joint model, it is not practical to carry out with a large number of participants.</p><p>Participants were incentivized in each condition by receiving one of the outcomes they chose or priced highly (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020)</ref>. They received an average of $20.49 with a minimum of $10 and a maximum of $40 per session via a prepaid, reloadable debit card as compensation. Compensation for each session was determined by a base payment ($17.54 for gains; $22.46 for losses) and the random selection of one trial from the experiment being played out. Thus, for some sessions, a portion of the payment beyond the $10 minimum was delayed by 1-250 days. Participants were informed about the outcome of the trial that was drawn to be played out after each session and knew if and when they would receive a bonus payment from their decision. This allowed every decision and price that participants completed during the experiment to be potentially meaningful in terms of its consequences.</p><p>Sessions began with participants giving written informed consent, followed by a total of 250 experimental trials delivered through MATLAB. The experiment featured three response types: choice trials, where participants chose between two prospects, and two types of pricing trials, where participants selected either a price to bid for (buying) or a price to accept in order to sell each prospect (selling). These three response types were crossed with a time pressure manipulation. Each trial could be delivered either as precision trials, with unlimited time to make a decision and an emphasis on making careful or exact responses, and speed trials with a response deadline. Each unique condition was delivered in blocks within subjects (full factorial design; 3 x 2). All blocks were delivered in a random order. In addition, gains and losses were alternately delivered on different sessions, so that a participant saw only gains or only losses on any particular day they attended an experimental session. The order of exposure to all conditions was randomly generated for each of our participants. After completion of all experimental trials, participants completed a self-report demographics survey delivered through Qualtrics.</p><p>Response types. Participants initiated each trial by clicking on a fixation cross presented in the middle of the screen (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Choice trials presented one prospect on the left and one prospect on the right side of the screen. Choice responses were made by pressing the left mouse button to select the left option or pressing the right mouse button to select the right option. Pricing trials presented one prospect in the bottom-center of the screen and a radial scale on the top half of the screen that ranged from $0-$20. Pricing responses were made by using the mouse to click on a location along the radial scale. As participants moved their mouse, the current response was displayed as text below the semi-circle. Response times were recorded from the onset of stimuli to when the participant made a response by clicking.</p><p>Stimuli. Each prospect, or pairs of prospects presented in price or choice trials featured a payoff ranging from $1 to $20, a probability of occurring ranging from 5% to 100% (a single certain prospect was included, all others had some degree of risk), and a delay to receipt ranging from 1 to 250 days. To reflect the patterns of real decisions, across all prospects payoff was slightly negatively correlated with probability (r = −.19), so that large payoffs tend to have more risk. Additionally, delay was slightly positively correlated with payoffs (r = .19) and probabilities (r = .23), so larger payoffs tended to occur later and longer waits were associated with higher probabilities. Specific to the choice task, prospects were paired such that three choices were dominated, where all attributes favored one alternative (Larger, safer, sooner). Eight choices were dominated by the payoff, meaning that the payoff was the only attribute favoring the larger-payoff alternative (Larger, riskier, later). Seven choices were dominated by delay, such that earlier receipt was the only attribute favoring the smaller-payoff option (Larger, safer, later), and 7 were dominated by probability (Larger, riskier, sooner).</p><p>Gain / Loss. Each participant completed 4 sessions alternating between Gain sessions, where prospects had a chance to gain money and Loss sessions, where prospects had a chance to lose money. Order of exposure was counterbalanced across participants. During Buy and Sell trials, participants were provided with the examples of buying or selling a lottery ticket (Gain) and buying or selling insurance liability (Loss) to improve comprehension.</p><p>Time pressure. Each trial was delivered twice during a session, once as a Precision trial and once as a Speed trial. Precision trials gave participants unlimited time to make their decision carefully. During Buy and Sell trials, participants were asked to make their response within 10 cents of the price they wanted to enter. Speed trials required participants to decide quickly with a response deadline. During Choice trials, participants had 3.5 s to respond. During Buy and Sell trials, participants had 7.5 s to respond. Response deadlines were chosen to be slightly lower than the typical response time in similar valuation tasks. Price responses had a more lenient deadline because they tend to take slightly longer to enter in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Schkade &amp; Johnson, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson &amp; Busemeyer, 2005)</ref> and the non-decision time is particularly long with the radial scale used here <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Repeating the same stimuli across gains, losses, speed, and accuracy manipulations allowed us to assess the reliability of participants' responses as well as how they shifted across conditions. Below, we first present the models we used for choice and pricing conditions, then describe the basic and model-based results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling approach</head><p>To investigate the cognitive processes that use amount, delay, and risk to judge the subjective value of choice and price options, we implement two generative cognitive models, one model for choices based on decision field theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Johnson &amp; Busemeyer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993)</ref> and another model for price responses based on a geometric framework for modeling continuous outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kvam, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kvam et al., 2023)</ref>. The choice and price models incorporate information from both responses and response times to estimate cognitive parameters involved in valuation and response elicitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Johnson &amp; Busemeyer, 2005)</ref>. This approach allows us to not only identify potential choice-price preference reversals but pre- Response types. Trials began with clicking on a fixation cross. Choice trials feature a decision between two risky intertemporal prospects. Pricing trials feature a willingness to pay or a willingness to sell for a single risky intertemporal prospect. cisely quantify differences or lack thereof in the valuation processes between these two tasks. If cognitive parameters involved in utility, delay discounting, or probability weighting are significantly different between choice and price tasks, that would suggest that both differences in value and response processes that map value to choices and prices contribute to choice-price preference reversals. Conversely, if the only differences between tasks are attributable to anchoring on the payoff, the pricing model will be able to account for reversals resulting from the difference in task structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>Choice model diagram. The evidence accumulation process begins after some non-decision time and unfolds until the difference in support between the options reaches threshold. If the drift rate (d) is positive, where option A is judged as more valuable than option B, evidence will tend to accumulate in support of option A during gains and option B during losses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice model</head><p>Choice behavior was modeled using a diffusion decision model based on decision field theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Johnson &amp; Busemeyer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993</ref>). The choice model is a utility comparison model based on a decision maker repeatedly simulating the possible outcomes of the options they are choosing between to accumulate evidence in favor of one of the two options. Over time, they will stochastically drift towards option A or option B, until the relative difference in support between the two options crosses a threshold (θ choice ) for eliciting a response. The corresponding response time is determined by the number of steps n taken to reach threshold and the time between steps t drawn from an exponential distribution (i.e., a Markov process) and added to non-decision time (τ) accounting for the encoding of stimuli and response elicitation. Thus, the overall response time of a trial is given by the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">RT = Γ(n,t) + τ (5)</formula><p>Naturally, the number of steps it takes before a choice is made will vary from trial to trial, and its distribution will depend on the drift alongside within-and between-trial variability. The overall direction of drift is determined by the difference in subjective value between the two options. If the difference in subjective value between the two options is large, the decision maker will have a strong drift rate, meaning that they will quickly reach the threshold, yielding faster and more consistent responses in favor of the highvalue option. However, if the difference in subjective value between the two options is small, the decision maker will have a weaker drift rate and will take more time to reach the threshold, leading to longer response times and less consistent choices because stochastic drift rate variability accounts for more and more of the accumulated evidence. A drift rate of 0 between two choices can be thought of as an indifference point <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Mazur, 1988)</ref>, where choices are purely up to chance.</p><p>To determine the difference in subjective value (drift rate) between choice options, we use an alternative-wise model of subjective value comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cheng &amp; González-Vallejo, 2016</ref>). In this model, the decision maker computes the value of each option independently and then compares the subjective value of option A and option B. This type of model has fallen out of favor in recent years with the rise of attributewise models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cheng &amp; González-Vallejo, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dai &amp; Busemeyer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lee &amp; Hare, 2023;</ref>, where evidence accumulation is driven by comparisons between options on each attribute (payoff, delay, probability). However, there are no points of comparison in pricing -meaning that price judgments cannot arise from attribute comparisons. Therefore, we focus here on alternative-wise models of choice instead, in order to enable parallels and direct comparisons between choice and pricing.</p><p>If the choice options are a pair of gains, the decision maker will drift towards the more valuable option, but if they are a pair of losses, drift will favor the option that is less harmful, i.e., has a lower absolute value. The subjective value of each option is formed by the utility of the amount of the option (u(x)) multiplied by the subjective probability of receipt (w(p)), and the proportion of value retained after the delay to receipt (v(t)). To account for between trial variability, drift rate variability is added to the drift rate where N(0, v d ) is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation based on the drift variability parameter v d . Thus, the drift rate d is given by the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d = (u(x 1 ) • w(p 1 ) • v(t 1 )) − (u(x 2 ) • w(p 2 ) • v(t 2 )) + N(0, v d )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>To account for within-trial variability, stochastic noise is added to the drift rate at each step in the diffusion process where N(0, v s ) is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation based on the drift variability parameter v s .</p><p>Each step is assumed to take an average of 30 ms, allowing us to closely approximate a continuous-time and continuousspace Wiener diffusion process. The overall time taken to form a choice response is given by Equation 5.</p><p>The choice model uses choices and their corresponding response times to estimate the cognitive parameters involved in subjective valuation outlined above, including the utility / risk aversion parameter α, the probability weight b, and the discounting rate k. In addition, we estimate the threshold of support needed to elicit a choice response θ choice , nondecision time τ, drift rate variability v d , and within-trial noise (v s ). Unlike many applications of the diffusion model, the unit or scale of the model is set by the dollar value of the outcomes, meaning that we should not fix the within-trial noise to avoid overconstraining the resulting model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Donkin et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Price model</head><p>Behavior on the price task was modeled using a similar approach of sequential sampling, corresponding to an accumulation process driven by repeated mental simulation of possible outcomes (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The price model uses price responses and response times to estimate many of the same cognitive parameters outlined in the choice model (α, k, b, and τ). However, instead of an upper and lower threshold corresponding to the two options, the price model features a quarter-circular threshold (θ price ) corresponding to the distribution of potential price responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>A diagram of how this model works is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. A decision-maker can make any response between the lower anchor (in this case, $0) and the upper anchor ($20). The high anchor is the value of the greatest payoff when it occurs immediately and with certainty ($20) while the low anchor is $0. Between these two values, the polar angle of a decisionmaker's state at any given time represents the currently favored price for the stimulus or prospect under consideration.</p><p>The decision-making process begins by anchoring on a start point. This start point is determined by the maximum payoff for a given prospect alongside the weight that this anchor carries in determining the final response. It is described by a location in two dimensions in polar coordinates, where the angle corresponds to the anchor and the radius corresponds to its strength. Formally, the radius of the start point (Equation 7), is represented as a proportion of the distance from the origin to the threshold (θ price ) that is drawn from U(0, ν), a uniform distribution between 0 and a decisionmaker's bias strength (ν). Thus the start point of the pricing process is given by equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r = U(0, ν) • θ price (7)</formula><p>In Cartesian (x,y) coordinates, this corresponds to the following start point in two-dimensional space:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">start = [(r • cos(u(x) • π/2), (r • sin(u(x) • π/2)]<label>(8)</label></formula><p>A value of ν = .5 would mean that the accumulation process begins at a random point between 0 and halfway to the threshold. On average, the accumulation process would begin one-fourth of the way to the threshold. Bias strength (ν) adds variability to the model and allows it to account for scale compatibility effects that may contribute to choiceprice preference reversals through anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Over time, a decision-maker adjusts their price response by accumulating evidence until reaching the threshold (θ price ) through mentally simulating the potential outcomes, like in the choice model. If the risky intertemporal prospect has a low probability and long delay, the accumulation process will more often step towards the low anchor because the decision maker frequently imagines waiting to receive the outcome or not receiving it at all. If the option has a high probability and short delay, the accumulation process will more often step towards the payoff because the decision maker frequently imagines receiving the outcome in the near future. For example, a risky, delayed outcome with a delay discounting factor of 0.5 ( 1 1+kt = 0.5 ) and a weighted probability of 0.4 (w(p) = e (−(− ln(p)) b ) = 0.4) would result in a 20% chance (0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2) of stepping toward the payoff and an 80% chance (1 − 0.2 = 0.8) of stepping toward $0.</p><p>Like in the choice model, price response times are determined by the number of steps necessary to reach the threshold and the amount of time between each step. However, unlike the choice model, where small drift rates near 0 meander to produce long response times and large drift rates race towards a threshold to produce short response times, price responses are always moving toward the threshold, resulting in a much more narrow distribution of predicted response times. To simulate precise price responses, we set the scale of the model to 0.03, meaning that it takes many small steps to reach the threshold. Precise simulation can result in an extremely narrow distribution of response times, particularly when start point anchoring is weak (e.g., an average response time of 6 seconds + non-decision time would be sampled from Γ(200, .03)). To account for the wider shape of empirical price response time distributions, we introduce a response time shaping parameter (ω) with a theoretical range from [0, ∞]. When generating a response time, the number of steps taken n is divided by (ω) and the time between steps t is multiplied by (ω), changing the shape but not the mean of the response time distribution and having no influence when ω = 1. Thus, price response times are given by the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Figure 3</formula><p>Price model diagram. The evidence accumulation process begins by anchoring on a start point determined by the angle of the payoff and bias strength (ν). Over time, evidence is accumulated by mental simulations of either receiving the payoff (moving towards the payoff) or not receiving/waiting for the payoff (moving towards the low anchor). Once accumulated evidence reaches the threshold (θ price ), a price response is made.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">RT = Γ(n/ω,t • ω) + τ<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Values of ω &gt; 1 flatten the distribution to indicate greater variability in the length of time to simulate an outcome from the prospect, while values of ω &lt; 1 sharpen the distribution to indicate fast mental simulation.</p><p>In pricing, a participant is not comparing the difference in utility of competing options -instead, utility is a property of the psychological representations of the distribution of payoffs. The psychological difference between $0 and $1 is greater than the difference between $10 and $11, meaning that the difference in angle (corresponding to the psychological difference between responses; Kvam, 2019) is greater for small values than for large values. This is shown in the middle of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. To account for the representation of subjective utility of the amount (α) of an outcome, pricing responses will be stretched or squeezed depending on their amount relative to the high anchor along the quarter-circular response continuum.</p><p>Together, the choice and price models can estimate how delay and risk influence subjective value measured in choice and pricing tasks. These models can predict choice-price preference reversals and generate parameter estimates for subjective utility, delay discounting, and probability weighting to compare representations of subjective value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asymptotic convergence</head><p>A key element of both the choice and pricing models developed here is that they subsume existing static models of choice and pricing. Specifically, the choice model we propose is a general case of hyperbolic discounting plus prospect theory -the model of risky intertemporal choice put forth by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Luckman et al., 2018)</ref> which is able to explain both risky choices and intertemporal choices. Specifically, if the random walk driven by the accumulation process takes only one step, the result will be a normally distributed preference state with mean proportional to u</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(x) • w(p) • v(t).</formula><p>Therefore, if the threshold is zero, the first step of the random walk will terminate the decision process. The result is a random utility model with a distribution given by Equation 6.</p><p>Of course, the model we present here goes beyond the static random utility models that have been used in the past. It adds to this model by accounting for response times as well, by adding the Wiener diffusion component to the prospect theory / hyperbolic discounting model. It therefore subsumes many existing models of preferential choice while adding a dynamic element. Comparison of dynamic and static models. On the left, observed choices are compared to predicted choices for the dynamic model and a static version of the model. Dynamic models with reduced noise are shown to converge with the static model. On the right, observed prices are compared to predicted prices for the dynamic and static price models. Increasing thresholds of the price model converge on the static model.</p><p>Likewise, the price accumulation model converges to prospect theory plus hyperbolic discounting under certain conditions. Unlike the choice model, however, the price model converges when the threshold is very large. This is necessary because the price accumulation model is driven by the anchoring process toward the beginning; a high threshold allows the impact of anchoring on the preference state to go to zero and for the mental simulation process to take over. Once the accumulation process dominates the anchoring component, the mean price assigned to a prospect also approaches u</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(x) • w(p) • v(t).</formula><p>In other words, the two models will make converging predictions to one another -and to prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting -when the price threshold is high.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, we illustrate how these special cases of the dynamic models reduce to the static models. For the choice model, decreasing both between-trial (v d ) and within-trial (v s ) noise results in the dynamic model asymptotically approaching a static concatenation of utility theory (Equation 1), hyperbolic discounting (Equation 2), and prospect theory (Equation 3) where the preferred option is always chosen. For the price model, increasing thresholds θ by a factor of x while holding the start point constant (i.e., ν is scaled by θ, while the accumulation process ends at θ • x) results in the dynamic model approaching the same static model described above applied to prices as thresholds approach infinity.</p><p>While not critical to understanding our results here, this asymptotic convergence is important theoretically in the sense that our models can accommodate any result that prospect theory, expected utility, or hyperbolic discounting can predict. It therefore provides a stronger connection to the economic decision-making literature, where these models feature heavily <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barberis, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dasgupta &amp; Maskin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hayden, 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling methods</head><p>To determine which cognitive mechanisms are most likely to account for differences between gains and losses in both the choice and pricing tasks and the buy/sell manipulations in the pricing task, we analyze these data through a switchboard analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Turner et al., 2018)</ref>. A switchboard analysis seeks to delineate between numerous mechanisms that compete to explain a phenomenon. Each competing mechanism (i.e., parameter) acts like a switch that can be turned on or off. If a parameter of interest accounts for an effect, models with that parameter varying between conditions are more likely to provide a better fit. Conversely, if a parameter of interest is not influenced by a manipulation, models where that parameter is fixed across conditions are likely to provide a better fit. By comparing model fits between a fully-variable model with the flexibility to explain differences between conditions through all mechanisms of interest to every possible configuration of the switchboard of parameters, we can identify the posterior probability that a mechanism varies between conditions.</p><p>Gains and losses have shown a variety of differences in the literature. In mixed gambles, where gains and losses are presented concurrently in a single choice, loss aversion is typically modeled by a multiplicative coefficient greater than 1 on the amount or utility of a loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. However, this loss aversion coefficient predicts no differences between choices for two gains or choices between equivalent losses, so we instead explore differences in utility between gains and losses. Additionally, it has been suggested that losses influence delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Frederick et al., 2002)</ref> and risk-seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. To test for any influence of gain/loss manipulations on value we estimated separate utility (α), delay discounting (k), and probability weighting (b) parameters for gains and losses in both the choice model and price model. We also test whether buy/sell manipulations reflect gain/loss manipulations by estimating the three valuation parameters independently for gains and losses crossed with buying and selling frames. In the price model, anchoring response processes offer a competing mechanism to account for gain/loss and buy/sell manipulations. We estimate four bias strength (ν) parameters to allow this response process to vary freely between the manipulations. Stronger start biases result in a greater relative influence from the amount of the prospect and a muted influence of delay and risk.</p></div>

The exact details of this approach are given in the supplementary materials, but here we provide a high-level intuition of how it works. First, a large volume of simulated data is generated, by drawing parameters of the model from a prior and simulating a data set for each combination of parameters. Next, the simulated data are summarized using a set of sufficient statistics -such as the RT and response quantiles for each condition -that serve as inputs to the neural network. Then, the neural network is trained on the relationship between observed data (RT / response quantiles) and the parameters that were used to generate them. This results in a neural network that "knows" the relationship between observed data and model parameters, allowing it to quickly and accurately map any set of real observed data onto best-fit model parameters. Uncertainty surrounding parameter estimates was obtained from the network by including a dropout layer with a 0.5 probability of randomly knocking out each node in that layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kvam et al., 2024)</ref>. This allowed the trained network to give different outputs for a given input, where each sample from the network represented a draw from an approximate Gaussian process, forming a joint posterior distribution over the parameter space <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gal &amp; Ghahramani, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>For model comparison, a similar approach was taken, except that the output of the neural network was which of a set of candidate models was used to generate the data. In the comparison approach, each one of a variety of models is used to generate simulated data -rather than a single model with many combinations of parameters, many models with many combinations of parameters are used to create synthetic data. Then, instead of training the neural network to estimate the parameters, it is instead trained to classify the data according to what model was used to generate it. In this way, a classification network is used to identify the most likely source or generative model for a given set of data. When applied to real data, it yields posterior probabilities for each model under consideration -and generally performs much better than other model comparison approaches like BIC, WAIC, or other likelihood-based comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kvam et al., 2024)</ref> Finally, based on the results of this classification process, we took the best-fitting models for each participant from the pricing and choice conditions and used them to fit a joint model of behavior across the entire experiment. This joint model was fit in the same way as the individual tasks, but the input to the network was behavior across all conditions and tasks that an individual completed. The outputs were the parameters for that participant, concatenated across all conditions and tasks. Because each participant was fit with a different model, this resulted in ten separate trained neural networks for joint model estimation. As before, the neural networks were trained based on simulated data. Finally, to determine how parameters were related across conditions for each person, we used a technique called dropout sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gal &amp; Ghahramani, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kvam et al., 2024)</ref> to obtain a joint posterior distribution across all parameters. Below, we report the covariances among these parameters as evidence for or against systematic parametric relationships between tasks and conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Analyses were conducted in MATLAB, R, and JASP. As described above, we trained deep neural networks to estimate model parameters from responses and response times through supervised learning on data simulated from the models, an approach which avoids the need for explicit likelihoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Radev et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cranmer et al., 2020)</ref>. To fit the models given the lack of analytic likelihoods, we used an amortized inference approach to parameter estimation by pre-training two simulation-inversion neural networks, one for the choice model and one for the price model. While this is a novel estimation approach for the choice model, such an approach has been used successfully on a similar price model for decisions under risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sokratous et al., 2023)</ref>. Network specifications and parameter recovery are detailed in the supplementary materials.</p><p>Note that the pricing model is generally easier to recover than the choice model -this follows naturally from the fact that pricing provides a precise, continuous scale variable while choice provides only a single bit of ordinal information about a person's preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sokratous et al., 2023)</ref>. As a result, pricing should ostensibly be a more efficient way to measure preferences -provided processes like anchoring are properly modeled. However, as we show below, it may be the case that pricing and choice tap into distinct psychoeconomic processes.</p><p>For the switchboard analysis, due to the lack of likelihoods for the pricing model, we also did not have access to traditional metrics of model fit like BIC or DIC to compare across models <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Turner et al., 2018)</ref>. Instead, the data and parameter estimates were fed into the classification network to determine the probability of each participant's data arising from each model in the switchboard (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Radev et al., 2021)</ref>. While in principle, every parameter could be allowed to vary across all conditions, we chose to restrict the switch-board to parameters of interest related to subjective value in choice and pricing and anchoring on the payoff in pricing. For the fully-variable choice model, we allowed utility, delay discounting, and probability weighting to vary between gain and loss conditions, while thresholds varied across the speedaccuracy manipulation for all models and all other parameters remained the same across conditions. Thus the choice switchboard consisted of 2 3 = 8 models. For the fully-varible price model, we allowed utility, delay discounting, and probability weighting parameters to vary between buying gains, selling gains, buying losses, and selling losses. We also allowed start bias strength to vary between pricing conditions, resulting in a price switchboard containing 2 4 = 16 models. We chose not to test gain/loss and buy/sell manipulations independently because that would result in a computationally infeasible 4 4 = 256 models. Therefore, the price switchboard aims to classify if any combination of gain/loss/buy/sell conditions differs between conditions for each parameter of interest -similar to an ANOVA testing for the presence or absence of differences as opposed to specific comparisons. We can then compare estimates between buying and selling gains or losses, similar to "post hoc" tests (although such a notion is not relevant to Bayesian posteriors, which typically need not be adjusted for multiple comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gelman et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Network specifications and classification confusion matrices, which provide an estimate of how well we expect the model comparison / switchboard networks to perform, are available in the supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral data</head><p>In aggregate, during the choice task, the option with the larger payoff was preferred 55.6% of the time when choosing between gains. When options had a chance to lose money, the option with the larger amount to be lost was selected only 39.3% of the time. When deciding between losses, people tend to choose the option that is less harmful, meaning that the option with the larger amount to be lost was judged to be more aversive 60.7% of the time. During the price task, the option with the larger payoff from the pairs of prospects presented during choice was priced as more valuable 66.5% of the time during gains and 70.4% of the time during losses (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for mean preference for all combinations of conditions). Preferences were largely stable under time pressure, with a general pattern emerging where preferences for the larger-payoff option were slightly greater for losses. This may reflect a general form of loss aversion where losses draw focus toward the primary attribute of the amount to be lost, making options with greater losses less favorable. Comparing elicitation procedures, we observe that pricing favored larger-payoff options and that this difference was more pronounced when participants were selling options.</p><p>Although the shift from preferring smaller (safer, sooner) Chance of assigning greater value to the larger-payoff. For choices between gains, the more appealing option is chosen, but for losses, the less aversive option is chosen. Preference during pricing was assessed by comparing the prices assigned to each option in isolation.</p><p>outcomes to larger (later, riskier) ones is apparent in the comparisons between choice and pricing conditions, these do not result in preference reversals as often as in other studies. When comparing preference for each prospect, we find choice-price preference reversals in four of the 22 option pairs in both gains and losses (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>), somewhat lower than the rates at which these reversals occur in risky-only or intertemporal-only domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kvam et al., 2021;</ref>. Still, all reversals followed a similar pattern such that on average the larger-payoff outcome is judged to be more valuable than the smaller-payoff outcome during price but the smaller-payoff outcome is judged to be more valuable than the larger-payoff outcome during choice. Interestingly, of the four reversals in both gains and losses, three featured a prospect that was larger, unlikely, and later and a prospect that was smaller, likely, and sooner. This may suggest that choice-price reversals are particularly common when the difference in payoff is large while probability and delay both favor the smallerpayoff option. This is consistent with the interpretation that in pricing the payoff is given more weight in pricing than in choice due to scale compatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tversky et al., 1990</ref>).</p><p>In addition to preferences inferred by relative prices, we compare average prices in each condition. We conducted a Bayesian ANOVA with the buy/sell, gain/loss, and speed/precision manipulations as fixed factors and participants as random factors. The response deadline had no influence on prices, with the best model having only gain/loss, buy/sell manipulations, and their two-way interaction as predictors (BF 10 = 364.26). Gains were assigned higher prices than losses (BF 10 &gt; 1000), and higher prices were assigned  Choice-price preference reversals. a) For gains, preference reversals are assessed by comparing the average proportion of larger-payoff &gt; smaller-payoff choices to the proportion of larger-payoff &gt; smaller-payoff prices for each pair of prospects presented in the choice task. b) For losses, the average proportion of smaller-magnitude-loss &gt; largermagnitude-loss choices is presented because participants chose the less aversive prospect.</p><p>in the selling relative to the buying condition (BF 10 &gt; 1000). The interaction reveals that the gain/loss manipulation was stronger in the selling than in the buying condition (BF 10 = 185.3).</p><p>The buying-gains condition resulted in the lowest prices (M = $5.34), followed by selling-gains (M = $6.13) and buying-losses (M = $6.29) which had a similar mean price, and finally selling-losses resulted in the highest prices (M = $8.04). Overall, prices suggest that the loss frame and the selling frame both increase the magnitude of the value of a prospect. This pattern is not easily explained only by ownership effects where buying gains and selling losses are framed as not owning the prospect, while selling-gains and buyinglosses are more easily construed as "owning" the prospect. We observe a close correspondence between the ownership frames (selling gains and buying losses) but not the nonownership frames (buying gains and selling losses), meaning that ownership or endowment is not a complete nor parsimonious account of why we observe differences among buying, selling, gains, and losses.</p><p>Reliability. To evaluate how stable these reversals and representations of value were, we computed test-retest reliability after approximately two weeks with Pearson correlations (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Performance in most pricing conditions was relatively reliable, falling mostly around the .8 to .9 testretest correlation coefficients with a few above and below, but choices were somewhat more unreliable. In the choice task, reliability was best for gains in the precision condition, followed by gains in the speed condition. Gains were more reliable than losses in both the precision condition and the speed condition. For the price task, all buying conditions had excellent reliability. Selling gains had similarly excellent reliability, with only selling losses having somewhat lower reliability. Test-retest reliability after two weeks. Pearson correlations were computed for each condition.</p><p>In addition to behavioral reliability, we assessed reliability in model parameter estimates. Choice model parameters had much better reliability across all parameters than behavioral responses (r = 0.95, 95% HDI = [0.92, 0.96]), while price model parameters had similar or higher reliability compared to behavioral reliability (r = 0.99, 95% HDI = [0.98, 0.99]). Overall, results suggest that pricing was more reliable than choice, and that elicitations in the domain of gains were more reliable than those using losses. Additionally, when choosing between gains, the precision condition was slightly more reliable than the speed condition, but reliability was largely unaffected by time pressure when choosing between losses and during all pricing conditions.</p><p>Reliability is critical to understand for two reasons. First, it allows us to evaluate what measurements can best characterize trait-like processes related to subjective value. From the perspective of our results, model parameters substantially exceed raw behavior in terms of reliability, mirroring previous results using hierarchical Bayesian analyses <ref type="bibr">(Haines et al., in press)</ref>. This suggests that the model parameters are indexing something more stable, and likely closer to the "true" generative process, than behavior. This stability may come from stochastic models accurately inferring that two slightly different patterns of behavior were generated by very similar parameters that are stable over time, allowing it to capture variability in behavior that would have been attributed to a lack of reliability in a more stable, reliable parameter.</p><p>Second, showing that model parameters are reliable is important to establishing the approach we take next, which is to model behavior from each participant across all of their sessions and create a joint model of their behavior across tasks. If model parameters differed substantially across testing sessions, we might rightfully be concerned that parameters changing across gains and losses is an artifact of these conditions varying across sessions. However, with the reliability of the model parameters well-vetted, we can more safely conclude that differences between conditions are due to the manipulation rather than the timing of the testing session.</p><p>In summary, the behavioral data suggests that participants in general assigned a higher subjective value to prospects with large payoffs, typically associated with lower probabilities and long delays. This was accentuated when outcomes were harmful losses in both choice and price tasks. When pricing, participants appeared to place relatively higher value on large-payoff prospects when prices were framed as selling compared to buying suggesting that buy/sell asymmetries do not only reflect valence (gain/loss) or ownership. We observed the typical choice-price preference reversal pattern, where pricing across all conditions resulted in an apparently greater preference for the large-payoff prospect. Lastly, time pressure had little influence on preference. We next turn towards model-based results to explain differences among conditions and tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling results</head><p>Before comparing model parameters between conditions, it is also important to check whether the models actually do a good job accounting for observed behavior. This is a critical step in testing the new models we developed above.</p><p>We therefore provide an overview of the model fits in terms of posterior predictions next, followed by a comparison of model parameters and switchboard analyses that characterize how (if) risk and time preferences change across manipulations, and then the individualized joint models accounting for each person's entire behavioral manifold.   Posterior predictive checks. To evaluate the performance of the models, we used the neural network's parameter estimates for each person at each point in time to generate posterior predictions for both choices and price responses. To obtain stable predictions for every trial of the study, we generated 100 simulated data sets from the best-fit parameters per real data set. This allowed us to minimize the variability in model predictions, and check closely how well the average predictions of the models (for a given set of parameters) corresponded to the data.</p><p>The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>. As shown in panel (a), the choice model provided an excellent fit to the data, though it very slightly overpredicted the proportion of largerpayoff choices for losses. Despite this small bias, even the lowest value of r = .93 for losses in the precision condition accounted for over 86% of the variance in the proportion of larger-payoff choices for each prospect. Likewise, the rightskewed response time distributions for choices in the precision and speed conditions, shown in panel (b), were almost perfectly mimicked by the choice model. Overall, the model provided an excellent fit to the choice and response-time data, suggesting that differences in its parameters across conditions were meaningful and contributed to an overall good fit to the data.  Next, we evaluated the model predictions of the price accumulation model. Posterior predictions for prices and their corresponding response times were simulated from the price model as described above for choice data, generating 100 simulated data points per real data point to minimize variability in model average predictions.</p><p>As with the choice model, the price model provided an excellent account of the data. Model posterior estimates for prices were accurate across the board, shown in panel (a), particularly for all buying conditions (left). The model seems to be very slightly underpredicting prices in the selling-losses condition, despite this the model's predictions largely retaining the true ordinal relationships between prospects.</p><p>The price model also appears to adequately predict price response times. The approximate shape of the distribution matches the observed distributions for both the speed and precision conditions in the buying and selling frames (i.e., distributions are right-skewed). However, the price model's predicted response time distribution is shifted to the left, meaning that, on average, the model is slightly underpredicting response times. This may suggest that the price model is systematically underpredicting either thresholds or nondecision time; increased non-decision time would right-shift the leading edge of the distribution while increasing thresholds would right-shift the entirety of the distribution.</p><p>Put together, both the choice and pricing models provided extremely good accounts of behavior across all conditions and manipulations in the experiment. They accounted for both responses and response times, indicating that they are not only describing the outcomes but the process of generating these responses as well. This allows us to meaningfully interpret their parameters and how they vary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative-wise vs. attribute-wise choice</head><p>While the alternative-wise choice model we have developed here provides a strong account of choice data, differences in preference between choice and pricing may arise from how options are compared. Though pricing an individual option requires computing the subjective value of that option overall, in a choice context, options may be compared by taking the difference of each attribute rather than the overall difference in subjective value of the two alternatives. To test this possibility, we simulated comparable data from an attribute-wise choice model, the direct difference model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dai &amp; Busemeyer, 2014)</ref>, and trained a neural network to classify whether data was simulated from the alternative-wise or attribute-wise model. While the direct difference model is one of many different attribute-wise choice models, it provides a suitable test-bed to delineate between attribute-wise and alternative-wise choices in this task.</p><p>The direct difference model compares attributes rather than alternatives, meaning that instead of computing the difference in utility between two alternatives (as in Equation 4), the drift rate is determined by differences in each attribute (amount, probability, and delay), where each attribute is given an attentional decision weight that sums to 1 across the three attributes. While originally developed for intertem-poral choice, the model has been extended to include probabilities. Like in the alternative-wise model, payoffs are raised to a power (Equation 1), and probabilities are transformed by a weighting function (Equation 3). However, delays are treated similarly to payoffs, by being raised to a power that tends to be less than 1.</p><p>To account for differences between gains and losses in the risky direct difference model, we simulated independent attentional decision weights for gains and losses. In the alternative-wise model, we simulated independent parameters that transform the value of each attribute (α, b, and k). In both models, time pressure was accounted for by simulating independent thresholds under speed or precision conditions. For each model, we simulated 100,000 datasets with thresholds tuned to produce similar mean response times. The direct difference model had strong parameter recovery, with a mean correlation between true and predicted parameters of r = .96 for the training, validation, and test sets. Additionally, the direct difference model reproduced the empirical data approximately as well as the alternative-wise model, with posterior predictions correlating with true choice proportions at r = 94 averaged across conditions.</p><p>After validating the direct difference model's recovery, we next trained a network to classify the model used to simulate a data set. The trained network then yields the posterior probability that a dataset was generated from each model. This classifier network achieved nearly perfect performance when classifying the simulated data, with a validation accuracy of 99.91%. When classifying the empirical data, all but two of the 20 datasets from the first and second assessments of 10 participants had a posterior probability of &gt; .999 in favor of the alternative-wise model. The second session of Participant 9 was assigned a .129 probability of arising from the direct difference model, still heavily favoring an alternativewise account. The only session where the direct difference model was assigned a higher probability was the second session of Participant 4, which had a .791 probability of arising from the direct difference model. Overall, we have strong evidence favoring an alternative-wise account of the present choice data. It may be that having participants complete a pricing task, where participants are required to compute the overall subjective value of a single alternative, promoted an alternative-wise strategy in the choice task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice estimates</head><p>Having established the efficacy of the model, we can now take a look at its parameters as well as how they differ across conditions. Mean estimates across all participants for the fully-saturated model are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>During the choice task, estimates of utility (α) were always less than 1, indicating typical decreasing or concave marginal utility. Estimates of log(k) also fall in the typical range; however during losses there was an estimate as high  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> Choice model parameter estimate descriptives as 0.87, indicating extremely steep delay discounting. Probability weighting (b) also tended to follow the commonly observed inverse-s shaped function given by b &lt; 1. On the high end, estimates of b slightly exceeded 1, indicating an approximately linear relationship between subjective probability and true probability.</p><p>On average, we see little to no evidence favoring differences between gains and losses for the slope of the utility α function (BF 10 = 0.35) or delay discounting log(k) rate (BF 10 = 0.53). Despite this, probability weighting b was slightly stronger for losses than gains (BF 10 = 3.35). This indicates that rare outcomes appear more likely when outcomes are harmful -which can contribute to apparent loss aversion. Together, these indicate that dealing with losses does not inherently change the perception of value regarding amounts and delays; rather, keeping outcomes homogenous (only-gains or only-losses) allows participants to leverage the same subjective value computations to construct their responses with only changes to how probabilities are subjectively weighted to avoid large, risky losses.</p><p>In addition to the parameters that are specifically relevant to subjective value, we also have several important dynamic processes in the choice model. For these dynamic process parameters, the precision/speed manipulation produced higher estimates of thresholds (θ) in the precision condition (BF 10 &gt; 1000), revealing a typical speed-accuracy trade-off. Non-decision time (τ) tended to be just over a second, with the fastest estimate being just over 550 milliseconds. Estimates also suggest a somewhat influential amount of between-trial variability (v d ), making choices on average move toward chance and accounting for slow choices that violate differences in subjective value. Given the relatively high thresholds we observe, estimates of within-trial noise (v s ) scaled to the diffusion rate of 0.03 rarely resulted in fast choices that violated the direction of the drift rate. Since v s had little impact on the choices that individuals made, we</p></div>

However, posterior predictive checks where v s was manually increased shifted choices towards chance but did not improve the correlation between observed and predicted choices, indicating that higher estimates of v s alone would not dramatically improve model fit.</p></div>

Next, we evaluated whether the subjective value parameters (α, k, and b) changed across conditions using the switchboard analysis described above. To analyze the results of the switchboard classification analysis, we took the eight different models and divided them into models where the parameter stayed the same across conditions and those where the parameter varied across conditions, computing the sum of model probabilities for all models in Matching matrix from the switchboard analysis for the choice model.

Looking at individual differences in <ref type="figure">Figures 9 and 10</ref>, we see a great deal of heterogeneity when it comes to conclusions about each par-ticipant's best-fitting model. An important note when comparing these two figures from the switchboard analysis is that the posterior probability of a parameter varying averaged across models <ref type="figure">(Figure 9</ref>) had much stronger recovery than each model individually, therefore we might see patterns in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> that reflect the best aggregate model without a clear winner in terms of individual models. Specifically, we find that 4 participants were best classified as showing differences in utility between gains and losses, though 2 were near chance. Likewise, 4 participants showed differences in delay discounting across conditions, and 7 showed differences in probability weighting across conditions, though most of these individuals were near chance.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> Price model parameter estimate descriptives</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Price estimates</head><p>The mean of the best-fit parameters for the pricing model are provided in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. As in the choice task, utility (α) tended to be less than 1, however, we observe estimates as high as 1.89 in some conditions like selling losses. This is somewhat unexpected, as this indicates a strongly convex utility function, where the subjective marginal utility of an outcome is increasing. In terms of our pricing model, this means that in some conditions some participants were more precise when assigning prices to large payoffs than to low payoffs. This could reflect greater attention to high payoffs, corresponding to a stronger focus on the pricing task when the stakes were higher.</p><p>Estimates of delay discounting (log(k)) also fell into the typical range. Some participants appeared to have extremely high rates of delay discounting given by estimates of log(k) &gt; 0. Most estimates of probability weighting (b) fell into the typical range below 1. However, in all pricing conditions, we observed at least some estimates greater than 1, suggesting that some participants display s-shaped probability weighting where low probabilities are underweighted and high probabilities are overweighted. This suggests that pricing may have an effect on probability weighting similar to that of decisions from experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hertwig et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wulff et al., 2018)</ref> -certainly this is worth exploring in future work.</p><p>For the dynamic process parameters of the pricing model, we observe moderate anchoring on the start point (ν). Across all pricing conditions, we see a large range for the strength of the anchor, with some participants only weakly anchoring on the payoff (ν &lt; 0.2), and others strongly anchoring on the payoff (ν &gt; 0.8). This bimodal group-level distribution is illustrated in the bottom right of <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, where we observe a split between individuals' pricing strategies. This may suggest that group-level preference reversals are driven by a subset of the group that anchor strongly on the payoff, as opposed to a homogeneous effect that occurs for every participant.</p><p>The speed-accuracy manipulation had typical effects in pricing. Like in the choice task, the response deadline in the speed condition produced much lower thresholds θ than in the precision condition. Non-decision time τ was somewhat longer than in the choice task, averaging just over two seconds. Finally, the response time shaping parameter ω was on average just under 60, suggesting that participants performed accumulation simulation steps approximately 60 times slower than the scale of the price model where each step takes 30 milliseconds. This suggests that the mental simulation process driving accumulation in the price model may be as slow as .55 Hz.</p><p>For the buying task, the gain/loss manipulation usually had no influence on utility α (BF 10 = 0.13), delay discounting log(k) (BF 10 = 0.13), or probability weighting b (BF 10 = 0.13). Differences arose when comparing gains and losses in the selling task, however, where utility (BF 10 = 2.29) was higher for losses than gains. This resulted in more precise prices for large losses, which may indicate more careful decisions when taking on liability. Unlike utility, there was no evidence of start bias strength ν varying between pricing conditions (BF 10 &lt; 0.14).</p><p>Averaged across all participants and both timepoints, we see evidence that the shape of the utility function (Mean = 0.71, Median = 0.82), probability weighting function (Mean = 0.56, Median = 0.54), and bias strength (Mean = 0.69, Median = 0.80) varied across buy/sell and gain/loss manipulations.

Averaged across all participants and both time points, we see some evidence of utility and bias strength varying across conditions in pricing, with the probability of varying across conditions being .71 for utility and .69 for start bias.

Looking at individual differences in <ref type="figure">Figures 11 and 12</ref>, we again see many heterogeneous profiles. Averaged across time 1 and time 2, we see a very high probability that pricing manipulations influenced utility for 7 participants. Delay discounting appeared to vary across conditions for 3 participants. There is a moderate probability that probability weighting varied for 6 participants, inconclusive results for 2 participants, and a low probability of varying for 2 participants. Finally, bias strength appears to vary for 6 participants, is inconclusive for 2, and appears to be fixed for 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice-Price comparison</head><p>Comparisons of parameter estimates between choice and price suggest that differences in utility (α) and anchoring on the start point (ν) during pricing best account for choice-price reversals. Of the parameters directly involved in determining the subjective value of an outcome (α, log(k), b), only α varied on average between the choice and pricing tasks. For gains, utility was lower during the choice task compared to buying (BF 10 = 49.3) or selling (BF 10 = 142.8). This relationship is maintained for losses, with choice utility being lower than buying (BF 10 &gt; 1000) or selling (BF 10 &gt; 1000).</p><p>A more complete analysis of the relationships between choice and pricing is provided in the supplementary materials. In short, parameter estimates tended to be correlated between conditions within a response format (choices or prices), but choice and price estimates were not correlated. Two exceptions were that probability weighting b was not correlated between gains and losses in the choice task but was strongly correlated between all pricing conditions and utility estimates in the price task were only significantly correlated between buying and selling losses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individualized Choice-Price Joint Models</head><p>While the comparison of parameter estimates across choice and price models tests group-level differences in choice and pricing behavior, it fails to address how related choice and pricing behaviors are at the individual level. To compare the two response modalities for each participant, we leveraged the results of the switchboard analyses to develop individualized joint models of choice and pricing behavior. This analysis aimed to model each participant as a wholeincorporating those mechanisms that best explained their behavior on either task, and evaluating their covariances across conditions.</p><p>To accomplish this, we trained a neural network to jointly estimate the parameters of the choice and price models from each individual's data on choices, prices, and their associated response times across all sessions. If the switchboard analysis suggested that a parameter varied across conditions for a participant, that parameter was allowed to vary across conditions in their individualized joint model by being drawn independently. This resulted in a total of nine distinct individualized choice-price joint models -two participants actually shared a common pair of models across choice and pricing.</p><p>Next, a neural network was trained to estimate the parameters for each joint model. Rather than data from a single task, the input to this network was all the data from the individual, and the output of the network was a set of parameters that described their behavior in its entirety across all conditions. This is a novel approach to joint modeling, where two models of behavioral tasks are jointly estimated by one neural network.</p><p>Critically, dropout layers allowed us to draw samples from the posterior distribution for all parameters of the model at once <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gal &amp; Ghahramani, 2016)</ref>. The ability to sample from each parameter's posterior with hidden dropout layers enables us to calculate the covariance in parameters across tasks by plotting samples from individual pairs of parameters. As a result, we approximate the full posterior rather than simply the marginal error of each parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sokratous et al., 2023)</ref>. Matching matrix from the switchboard analysis for the pricing model. Each row shows the posterior probability for each model in the switchboard analysis for a participant.</p><p>To compare choice and pricing at an individual level, we calculate the correlation between 1,000 samples from each parameter's posterior. Key comparisons of interest are utility (α), probability weighting (b), and delay discounting (k) across choice and price tasks. For most participants, their joint models suggest little-to-no relationship across the choice and price tasks for any of the parameters involved in subjective value, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>. However, participants 5, 6, and 10 all had substantial correlations between some parameters of interest.</p><p>Participant 5 had a correlation of r = .39 between the delay discounting parameter for gains in the choice task and for all conditions in the price task, but they had a correlation of only r = .15 for losses in the choice task compared to the price task. Participant 6 had moderate to strong correlations between choice and pricing for the delay discounting parameter. Specifically, delay discounting for the choice task correlated with delay discounting in all conditions of the price task (rs &gt; .6). In addition, there was a small correlation between probability weighting in the choice task and the price task when selling losses (r = .3). However, these results should be taken with a grain of salt -because delay discounting was also strongly correlated with between-trial (v d ; r = .83) and within-trial variability (v s ; r = .79), which may indicate that delay discounting was difficult to estimate for this partici-pant's data. Participant 10 once again shows evidence of only delay discounting being related across tasks, with a moderate correlation of r = .5 between choice gains and all conditions in the price task and a weak correlation of r = .43 between choice losses and the price task. Though, we again observe stronger correlations with choice variability parameters (rs &gt; .57).</p><p>The posterior distributions for the parameters allowed to vary in the switchboard analysis and posterior predictive checks from the joint models are provided on the Open Science Framework at osf.io/g2ua5. Overall, the individualized joint models support the conclusions drawn from group-level parameter comparisons at the individual level: there is little relationship between behavior in the choice and price tasks. The only parameter with some support for being related across tasks for three of the 10 participants was delay discounting. Even then, participants either had weak correlations between posterior samples or had numerous other strong correlations with theoretically unrelated parameters in the model, suggesting that the models might have struggled to accurately capture the influence of delay on subjective value for those participants.</p><p>Together, these results strengthen many of our previous inferences: 1) the gain/loss manipulation appeared to have little influence on average during the choice task, except for</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">, G k G b G b L 3 P -C ho ic e 3 S -C ho ic e = C ho ic e v s v d , B G k B G b B G</formula><p>3 P -P ric e 3 S -P ric e = P ric e ! 8 B G slightly closer to linear probability weighting for gains. It would not be appropriate to model all individuals as having the same values for α, log(k), and b. 2) During the pricing task, gain/loss/buy/sell manipulations most strongly influenced estimates of utility. In particular, the selling-loss condition yielded more linear utility. 3) On average, choiceprice reversals are driven by differences in utility and anchoring processes in pricing. However, this is not to say that choice and price elicitation procedures share a common value function. While choice and pricing elicitation procedures produced similar distributions of parameter estimates, an individual's latent representation of subjective value for an amount, delay, and probability in one elicitation procedure appeared to have little bearing on the subjective value that they assigned to the exact same amount, delay, and probability in another elicitation procedure. This holds true despite highly reliable behavior and parameter estimates within each elicitation procedure.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">, G k G b G b L 3 P-Choice 3 S-Choice = Choice v s v d ,<label>BG k</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The objective of this study was to develop a unified modeling framework to investigate how subjective value is computed across manipulations of choice, types of pricing, gains, losses, and time pressure. The fit of these models to the data showed that this framework provides extremely good predictions of choices, price judgments, and the response times associated with each type of response. Despite the close fits to data, however, the conclusions about subjective value are more mixed. If there is anything to conclude here, it is that there are substantial individual differences in the computation of subjective value and how this computation varies across experimental manipulations.</p><p>Despite this, there are a few take-aways from the behavioral and model-based results. First, we found consistently that pricing tends to favor larger payoffs compared to choice. Furthermore, when grappling with the prospect of losing money, larger payoffs were weighted more heavily compared to options with a chance to gain money. This was reflected in the more linear utility functions in the pricing task -resulting in stronger responses to high-payoff (low-probability) prospects.</p><p>Choice-price preference reversals occur frequently under conditions of risk or delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kvam et al., 2021;</ref>. These preference reversals are thought to be due to differences in attentional processes, where payoffs are given greater weight than either risk or delay during pricing compared to choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tversky et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alós-Ferrer &amp; Ritschel, 2022)</ref>. These dynamics are captured in the pricing model through modulating the bias strength parameter that determines the strength of initial anchoring on the payoff. In this study, preference reversals were less common, potentially due to dilution of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref> between all three properties of the prospect (amount, risk, and delay). This interpretation is supported by 3 out of 4 instances of preference reversals occurring when participants priced a larger, risky, later outcome as more valuable than a smaller, safe, sooner outcome, while choosing the opposite. In other words, preference reversals were frequent when the payoff was the only aspect favoring the larger outcome, suggesting that greater attention to the payoff in pricing drove preference reversals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A singular subjective value?</head><p>If choice-price reversals can be attributed entirely to anchoring resulting from attention or attribute compatibility, we might expect nearly identical parameter estimates in pricing and choice tasks. Anchoring on the payoff may reflect a scale compatibility effect, where attributes that are represented by units that are compatible with the response are given greater attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tversky et al., 1990</ref>). The pricing model includes the start-point bias, which does not exist in the choice task, which would allow it to explain preference reversals arising from anchoring. We did observe substantial anchoring in the pricing task for many participants, indicating that this is certainly contributing to reversals if not explaining them entirely.</p><p>Conversely, if the choice-price reversals are strictly due to differences in subjective value, then we would expect systematic differences in the parameters related to subjective value. Specifically, we would expect the utility parameter to be higher (α; less strong decreasing marginal utility), the probability weighting parameter to be lower (b; stronger risk-seeking), and/or the delay discounting parameter to be lower in pricing (log(k); increased self-control) compared to choice. Of these, we only observed differences in the utility function (α), where pricing corresponded to more linear relationship between payoff and subjective value. This may in part reflect greater attention to the payoff during pricing, lending support to the attentional account of preference reversals <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. Moreover, model parameter estimates also suggest that participants strongly anchored on the payoff during the pricing task. Together, these results suggest that preference reversals, where pricing favors larger payoffs, do not arise purely from differences in subjective value, but are jointly determined by anchoring and more linear utilities in the pricing condition.</p><p>While the behavioral data indicated a slightly higher proportion of choices where the larger outcomes was judged as having greater value when the outcomes were losses compared to gains, we see little evidence of any differences in representations of subjective value on average except for slightly stronger probability weighting for losses, reflecting greater risk-aversion -a finding that runs contrary to expectations of greater risk-seeking for losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. A lack of strong differences may simply reflect a lack of loss aversion for small payoffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Zeif &amp; Yechiam, 2022)</ref>. However, individual differences reveal a great deal of heterogeneity in response to gain/loss manipulations. While in the aggregate gains and losses appear to be treated about the same in the choice task, switchboard analyses of individuals reveal that many participants are likely to show differences in utility and probability weighting functions, with occasional differences in delay discounting.</p><p>The pricing task paints a similar picture, where on average there was no evidence of differences in subjective value or anchoring processes between gains and losses in the buying task, however, selling losses revealed flatter, more linear utility and probability weighting functions. Some have suggested that the endowment effect from buy/sell manipulations reflects ownership rather than loss aversion, where the payoff that is owned is assigned higher prices than the payoff that is not owned <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Morewedge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yechiam, 2019)</ref>. Selling losses is an interesting case because, from an ownership perspective, you are demanding payment to take on a loss you do not own. If ownership is the only explanation for the endowment effect, we would expect selling losses to mirror buying gains and selling gains to mirror buying losses. We do not observe this pattern, meaning that endowment is insufficient to explain the pattern of results present here.</p><p>A final key insight gained from the unified model framework in this paper is that, while choice and pricing tasks reveal similar degrees of decreasing marginal utility, delay discounting, and probability weighting on average, an individual's behavior in one task poorly predicts their behavior in another task. Utility did not correlate between the choice and pricing tasks, nor did delay discounting, nor probability weighting. While different elicitation procedures can be well-fit by the same descriptive models of subjective value, it appears that when we measure an individual's behavior in choice, we gain almost no information about their behavior in pricing. This challenges common notions of "impulsive" or "risk averse" individuals, where behavior in one procedure represents a general trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Strickland &amp; Johnson, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Frey et al., 2017)</ref>. Previous literature found strong correlations between two types of choice tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Wan et al., 2023)</ref>, but our results suggest that an individual's impulsivity might be specific to a particular response process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions</head><p>A clear limitation of the present work is the small sample size. We chose to extensively test 10 participants across various conditions to allow us to develop and test highfidelity theories of the dynamic processes underlying preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Smith &amp; Little, 2018)</ref>. All conditions were delivered twice with performance incentives to obtain a rich dataset for each participant. This allowed us to verify the test-retest reliability of our measures, models, and model-fitting methods. However, our small number of participants makes it difficult to connect model parameters between tasks or generalize specific insights into the mechanisms driving phenomena to a broader population. Such an endeavor would likely have to compromise on the number of trials and conditions to be tractable for a large number of participants.</p><p>Naturally, model misspecification is always a risk of making conclusions through the lens of a particular modeling approach. In "open-world" modeling, we cannot be sure that the true model is in the consideration set, meaning that even a switchboard analysis like the one we present here is unlikely to include the best model of behavior on the tasks. Idiosyncrasies in individual strategies, i.e. in the true model itself, undoubtedly affect the conclusions about which of our models fit best. However, by including more and more realistic cognitive mechanisms, we can start to divvy up systematic behavior and error into realistic explanations. And by drawing on both economic and cognitive modeling, we can at least discuss behavior on different tasks in terms of a language (risk-taking, delay discounting) that is common to both fields.</p><p>Future directions might also aim to test specific mechanisms rather than the broad set we entertain here, allowing for fewer conditions (or fewer trials) and a larger sample for each condition. Because of the individualized joint models, a larger number of participants makes the entire endeavor more complex, but it seems possible to automate certain parts of the switchboard analysis followed by a joint modeling procedure.</p><p>The addition of eye-tracking would additionally help incorporate a model of attention to test if anchoring is related to fixations on the payoff during pricing. Gaze could also be used to inform weighting coefficients for each component of Equation 4. Eye-tracking may also be an avenue to investigate the bimodal group-level distribution of anchoring strength (ν) in pricing. For instance, gaze may be different between individuals who anchor strongly on the payoff during pricing (initially fixate on the payoff) compared to those who anchor weakly (initially fixate on other attributes or a shorter initial fixation on the payoff). Likewise, joint modeling neural and behavioral measures might benefit from a parameter that influences the variance of response times, such as ω presented here, giving insight into the timescale of mental simulation in value-based decisions.</p><p>Another key direction to carry this work is to multioutcome and mixed gambles including both gains and losses in the same prospect. Although our tests of differences between gain and loss conditions here shed light onto what processes differ according to framing, a complete understanding of loss aversion requires presenting both losses and gains in the same choices or pricing judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Yechiam, 2019)</ref>. Indeed, pricing might be a clear way to determine if someone is loss aversion: assuming equal-probability and equalmagnitude gains and losses (e.g., 50% chance of +$20 and 50% chance of -$20), being willing to pay to avoid versus pay to play might be highly diagnostic of attitudes toward losses and gains. Of course, fully accounting for these kinds of pricing decisions requires understanding other processes like anchoring and probability weight -requiring a model like the one we developed here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This paper has developed a modeling framework that unites descriptive theory and dynamic cognitive models to characterize choice and prices under delay and risk. The goal of this undertaking was to identify if and how apparent subjective value changes as a function of the task and conditions a person completes. Our results support the idea that choiceprice preference reversals arise in part from greater attention to the payoff during pricing compared to choice, corresponding to an anchoring process that exists in pricing but not in choice. However, the shape of utility and probability weighting functions also appear to be affected by response type and condition manipulations, and individual-level parameters related to subjective value do not match across different tasks. We urge caution in comparing subjective value across different elicitation methods, and further work should evaluate the consistency of these valuation processes in methods like bidding, probability or delay equivalents, and various methods of eliciting indifference points. We hope that the models we developed here help understand how these many factors interact to produce the complex choice and pricing behavior people exhibit.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 4</figDesc></figure>
