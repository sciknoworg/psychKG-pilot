				<p>Rewards paid out for successful retrieval motivate the formation of long-term memory. However, it has been argued that the Motivated Learning Task does not measure reward effects on memory strength but decision-making during retrieval. We report three largescale online experiments in healthy participants (N = 200, N = 205, N = 187) that inform this debate. In experiment 1, we found that explicit stimulus-reward associations formed during encoding influence response strategies at retrieval. In experiment 2, reward affected memory strength and decision-making strategies. In experiment 3, reward affected decisionmaking strategies only. These data support a theoretical framework that assumes that promised rewards not only increase memory strength, but additionally lead to the formation of stimulus-reward associations that influence decisions at retrieval.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Rewards can enhance learning and memory (for a review, see <ref type="bibr">Miendlarzewska et al.</ref> (2016) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> ). This occurs when they are experienced as a consequence of an action (operant conditioning), but even the anticipation of a reward at retrieval is sufficient to motivate encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> . In this framework, items associated with higher rewards are retained better, usually assessed with a version of the "Motivated Learning Task" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref> . In this paradigm, participants learn stimuli cued with varying amounts of reward, which is paid out for later recognizing the studied stimuli (targets) among new ones (lures).</p><p>Dopamine plays a key role in prioritizing memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">10</ref> , presumably via enhanced encoding 11 and increased consolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6</ref> . It determines which information enters long-term memory via the hippocampal-VTA loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12</ref> . Presenting reinforcers during learning elicits a dopaminergic response <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> , which modulates neuroplasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14</ref> and thereby increases the memory strength of the studied items <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref> . Additionally, animal models suggest that dopamine tags memory traces for preferential reactivation during sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18</ref> .</p><p>In the Motivated Learning Task, researchers typically rely on the hit rate (number of recognized targets) to investigate the impact of reward on memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7</ref> . However, without correction for false alarms, (i.e., incorrectly identifying a lure as target), the hit rate cannot be used to disentangle memory strength (discriminability, the ability to discriminate between old and new stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19</ref> ) from decision-making strategies (response bias, the tendency to respond "old" during recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19</ref> ). Memory strength and decision-making strategies can be distinguished by considering the hit rate and the false alarm rate together (calculating discriminability ' and response bias ). However, in the standard implementation of the Motivated Learning Task lures are not assigned a reward, which makes it impossible to calculate those indices per reward level.</p><p>In three thoughtful experiments, Bowen et al. (2020) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref> delineated the influence of reward on memory strength and decision-making strategies. In their modified version of the Motivated Learning Task, rewards were associated with a category (indoor vs. outdoor scenes) rather than with individual stimuli, i.e., lures had an implied reward level. In experiment 1, Bowen et al. (2020) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref> found no effect of reward on memory strength, but participants were more inclined to respond "old" to high reward items. In experiment 2 and 3, the researchers eliminated the influence of reward on decision-making strategies by penalizing false alarms contingent on their reward category. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Marini et al. (2011)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">3</ref> presented reward information during study and test, and show that reward information can bias decisions during retrieval, although the study sample was small.</p><p>Although these studies suggest that the effects of reward on hit rate can be explained by a shift in decision strategies, they supplied the participants with perfect information about the reward contingencies at retrieval. To identify the crucial involvement of stimulusreward associations formed during learning for decision-making at retrieval and independent effects of rewards on memory strength, we conducted a series of three largescale online experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>Generally, across all three experiments, methods and materials were highly similar, and any deviations from the general methods between the three experiments are detailed in the relevant sections. Participants underwent an adapted version of the Motivated Learning Task (as e.g. reported in <ref type="bibr">Adcock et al., 2006 2</ref> ) described below (also see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">Figure 1</ref>). All tasks were programmed using JsPsych, a collection of JavaScript plugins for browser-based experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">21</ref> . This study's design and its analysis were preregistered on the OSF (Experiment 1, April 26, 2021, https://osf.io/ufwmv; Experiment 2, August 4, 2021, https://osf.io/fhzqs; Experiment 3, February 28, 2022, https://osf.io/nefud).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants across all three experiments were recruited via Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/), an online work-sourcing site. The number of participants and demographic information for each experiment are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 1</ref>. In order to be included in the experiment and/or data analysis, participants had to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 (see Supplementary Tables 3   -5</ref> for information about how many participants were excluded for which reasons).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory for Rewards Guides Retrieval</head><p>Participants who did not meet the exclusion criteria were re-sampled until the desired sample sizes were achieved. Oversampling was permitted to facilitate the data collection process. All participants provided informed consent prior to participation, and all experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the University Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg. For experiment 1 and experiment 2, participants received £6.50 for completing both parts of the study. At the end of the experiment, participants were ranked according to their score (gems won in the task) and received a bonus payment (rank 1-4: £25; 5-8: £20; 9-12: £15; 13-50: £7.50). In experiment 3, participants received £7.60 for completing both parts of the study. Additionally, they earned a bonus based on their performance on the task: They received the average reward they won across all trials of the test phase, multiplied by 2, i.e., participants could additionally win between £0 and £10.20.</p><p>[Insert <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 1</ref> about here.]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>All participants completed each experiment in a web browser using their computer or laptop. The first part of the study began with a set of demographic questions (age, gender, highest level of education, native language). They then completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22</ref> (SSS) and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">23</ref> (PVT). Afterwards, participants were provided with instructions for the Motivated Learning Task, which included a description of both the learning and the test phase, and the reward and punishment contingencies.</p><p>Participants practiced both the learning and test phase of the Motivated Learning task (3 targets, 3 lures), and then answered a set of questions to ensure they understood the reward and punishment contingencies of the task. The first part of the study ended with the learning phase of the Motivated Learning Task. Participants returned for the second part of the study approximately 22 -26 hours later. Due to a coding error, the retention interval varied slightly for some participants (for each experiment, 4.00 %, 2.94 %, 0.54 % of participants deviated by more than 60 minutes from the planned retention interval), but for each participant, the two sessions were separated by at least one night of sleep and the results were not affected by excluding these participants. When participants returned for the second session, they completed the SSS and the PVT again, and had the opportunity to read the instructions for the test phase of the Motivated Learning Task again. Once again, they had to pass the questions about the reward contingencies. Participants then completed the test phase of the Motivated Learning Task, and were debriefed afterwards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>For experiment 1 and 2, we collected landscape images from the Creative Commons online repository and assessed them in terms of aesthetics, composition, familiarity, memorability, and whether or not the participants knew the images in a pilot study. Participants recruited via Prolific (N = 152) provided ratings on these aspects (each participant rated 73 pictures out of a stimulus pool of 975 pictures, resulting in M = 11.38 ratings per picture) and</p><p>additionally completed a subsequent recognition memory test to collect a measure of memory accuracy for each picture. Based on the measures collected in the pilot study, we divided the images into small subsets (to achieve the required number of final stimuli, we removed the stimuli that received the highest "known" ratings) with properties that were as similar as possible using the R package anticlust <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">24</ref> . The sets were then balanced across task variables (reward level, exposure duration, image category (target/lure) and in experiment 2, experimental group). This way, each participant was presented with a unique stimulus set in the Motivated Learning Task, but variance in stimulus properties across sets was minimized. In experiment 3, we used the stimulus set previously used in Feld et al. (2014) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8</ref> and Alizadeh Asfestani et al. (2020) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25</ref> , consisting of indoor scenes, outdoor scenes and buildings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivated Learning Task</head><p>Because memory tasks with a lot of trials can be quite exhausting for participants, we wanted to increase motivation and reduce attrition rates using a gamified version of the Motivated Learning Task. We embedded the task in a cover story, where participants were recruited as crew members on a pirate ship. As part of their duties on the pirate ship, their goal was to scout for treasure at different locations (corresponding to the learning phase). The treasures were chests containing varying amounts of gems (i.e., different reward magnitudes).</p><p>Participants navigated between the locations via the Flankers Task, which was stylized as arrows on a treasure map. When participants returned the next day, they went out to Our cover story is highly similar to the interrogative cover story described by Sinclair et al. (2022) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">26</ref> , who found that participants who received interrogative instructions (as compared to imperative instructions) performed better in a recognition memory task, had better memory for rewards associated with the studied items, and demonstrated greater effects of memory-enhancing reward effects.</p><p>The Motivated Learning Task was split into two phases, the learning phase and the test phase. In the learning phase, participants were asked to memorize 128 landscape images for a later memory test. Four additional images at the beginning and at the end of the task, which did not appear in the later memory test, buffered primacy and recency effects. Each trial started with a fixation (a spyglass; 1500-2000 ms), followed by a reward (2000 ms).</p><p>There were different reward amounts (see description of each experiment for specific amounts) which corresponded to the amount participants could win if they correctly identified the subsequent image as old during the recognition test 24 h later. After a second fixation (1000-1500 ms), a landscape image was presented, for one of four possible exposure durations (see description of each experiment) to control for encoding strength effects unrelated to reward. This was done as a positive control of our paradigm as well as to prepare future studies that will intervene during the retention period, because exposure duration has previously been found to increase hit rate, without interacting with reward (Feld et al., 2014) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8</ref> . After each image, participants completed three trials of a flanker task,</p><p>where they were shown a series of arrows and had to press the arrow key that corresponded to the direction of the middle arrow highlighted in bold. Trials in this task were either congruent (e.g., &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;) or incongruent (e.g., &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;). Halfway through the learning phase, participants were offered a short break lasting a maximum of two minutes and a minimum of 30 seconds.</p><p>In the test phase, participants were shown the landscape images they had learned previously (i.e., targets; 128 images) and new images (i.e., lures; 128 images). In each trial, participants were shown a fixation (a shovel; 500-750 ms) followed by a "ready" button which participants clicked before seeing the image. This ensured that participants' mouses were in approximately the same position before seeing the image, to make reaction times comparable across trials. Whilst the image was shown participants had to decide whether the image was "old" (i.e., they did see the image during the learning phase) or "new" (i.e., they did not see the image during the learning phase). Identifying a target as old was a hit and participants won the reward associated with the image, and identifying a lure as new (correct rejection) was rewarded with the average of all possible rewards. Making a mistake (false alarm: identifying a new image as old; miss: identifying an old image as new) resulted in the loss of the average reward. Afterwards, participants were asked to rate their confidence in their old/new decision on a 3-point scale ("guess", "sure", "very sure"). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">Figure 1</ref> for a description of the task for all three experiments.</p><p>[Insert <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">Figure 1</ref> about here.]</p><p>In the first experiment ( = 200), we attempted to disentangle memory strength and decision-making strategies by adjusting the paradigm in such a way that the false alarm rate per reward level could be calculated without using categories or showing the reward during recognition testing. Participants learned several pictures associated with different amounts of points (gems), which were earned for correctly identifying the pictures in a recognition memory test 24 later. After identifying a picture as either old or new, we asked participants for their confidence in their decision ("guess", "sure", "very sure"). Previous studies using the Motivated Learning Task have found that high confidence responses are sensitive to reward, but found no evidence for (or against) a reward effect in low confidence items <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2</ref> . Whenever a participant identified an image as old during recognition, we asked them how many gems they expected to win for their answer -irrespective of whether the image was in fact a target or a lure (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">Figure 1</ref>). This gave us information about which reward participants expected to receive whenever they made a false alarm. Note that this experiment also had other preregistered goals, and the associated analyses can be found in Supplementary Note 4.</p><p>Disentangling memory strength and decision-making strategies was not an explicit goal of the preregistration for experiment 1, because we assumed our modification to the paradigm would enable us to calculate a false alarm rate per reward level based on our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25</ref> . This turned out to be wrong, which led to experiments 2 and 3. Descriptive performance measures for the different tasks and control tasks can be found in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 6</ref>. Reward levels were 50, 750, 1450 and 2150 gems, and exposure durations were 1500, 1833, 2167 and 2500 ms.</p><p>In experiment 2 ( = 205), we explicitly assigned a reward to lures by presenting the reward information not only during the learning phase, but also during the test phase (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">Figure 1</ref>). Participants were informed that the reward presented before each image during the learning and the test phase corresponds to the amount of reward that is paid out according to the same contingencies as in experiment 1. We did not mention whether the reward presented during the test phase matched the reward presented during the learning phase. However, reward congruency between learning phase and test phase was manipulated between two groups: In the congruent group ( = 103), the reward presented for targets during the test phase (shown reward) always corresponded to the reward presented during the learning phase (true reward). In the incongruent group ( = 102), the reward presented for targets was completely orthogonal to the true reward the picture was associated with during the learning phase (i.e., in 25% of target trials, true and shown reward matched). In both groups, lures were presented with a pseudo-random reward level (each reward level appeared equally often across all lures). As in experiment 1, we asked participants for their confidence in their old/new decision ("guess", "sure", "very sure"), but since rewards were presented during the test phase, we did not ask about their reward expectations. We expected reward to exert its influence on memory because it strengthens encoding during and consolidation after learning, not because it changes decision-making strategies during test. That is, in both the congruent and incongruent group, we preregistered to find an effect of true reward on hit rate. In the congruent group, we expected to find an effect of reward on memory strength ( '). In the incongruent group, we expected to find no effect of shown reward on memory strength, but hypothesized the shown reward to affect criterion. We also preregistered an effect of true reward on memory strength and possibly criterion in the incongruent group, but later realized that this part of the preregistered model could not be calculated as planned (for details, see Supplementary Note 5). We further predicted that the previously observed reward effect in the Motivated  <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25</ref> ). Furthermore, we used two instead of four exposure levels (1500 and 2000 ms),</p><p>and two instead of four reward levels (also more similar to previous research).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In three experiments, we investigated whether reward impacts memory strength at encoding or decision-making strategies at retrieval for reward-related long-term memory.</p><p>We replicated the well-documented finding that reward increases the hit rate. In our experiment 2, the influence of reward on false alarms differed between the congruent and incongruent group. In the congruent group, higher rewards increased the false alarm rate to a lesser degree than in the incongruent group -in fact, there was a decrease in false alarms between the third (1450 gems) and the fourth (2150 gems) reward level. Given that the reward-related increase in memory strength for the congruent group only emerged for the highest reward level, it is plausible that it is the reduction in false alarms for the highest reward level that is contributing to the effect.</p><p>That is, both the hit rate and the false alarm rate increase as a function of reward for lower reward levels, reflected in a more lenient decision criterion. However, the reduction in false alarms for the highest reward level results in an increased memory strength for the highest reward level. Since the reward for lures is only presented during the test phase, it</p><p>is not based on memory, however, the decrease in false alarms for the highest reward category might still be a result of memory processes. Participants in the congruent group could rely on their source memory especially for high reward targets. When encountering a new picture with a high reward, this might have resulted in a greater conflict with their source memory, which made them more careful. Participants in the incongruent group may have been surprised by the incongruence of their memory for stimulus-reward contingencies, and unable to use such strategies.</p><p>At first glance, it may be disappointing that hit rate reflects an influence of reward on decision-making strategies during retrieval rather than memory strength. However, for reward to influence decision-making processes in a memory test where no reward information is presented, participants need to remember which reward belongs to which picture, as was the case in our experiment 1. That is, participants must learn stimulusreward associations, which are then used to make a decision at test. Along this line, it was recently shown that even memory for unchosen rewards can bias decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">33</ref> . Thus, pure measures of memory strength (i.e., ') do not isolate the processes underlying the memory-related modulation of performance by reward in the Motivated Learning Task.</p><p>Instead, measures of the decision criterion and ideally, reward association memory, are preferred. However, modifying the Motivated Learning Task in such a way that these measures can be assessed is not trivial, and alternative versions of the task proposed so far all come with drawbacks. This is why we conclude that the standard version of the task, with the hit rate as outcome measure, might be a valid option in many scenarios. However, it</p><p>should not be interpreted as a measure of memory strength, but rather as a measure of a memory-based criterion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory for Rewards Guides Retrieval</head><p>Our third experiment with only two reward categories and perfect information about the rewards at recognition is most comparable to prior work that -as we did in experiment 3 -finds that reward does not influence memory strength, but only decision criterion. Two interpretations are possible: There might be an effect of reward on memory strength, but it could be so small that it cannot be detected reliably with even large sample sizes as in our study (around N = 100), let alone with "standard" sample sizes in the field (around N = 30).</p><p>This would make it very hard to assess these effects in more resource-heavy neuroscientific experiments. The alternative explanation is that effects of reward on memory strength only arise under very specific conditions. For example, the reward-based change in memory strength in our second experiment was largely driven by the highest reward level, while the lower reward levels did not differ in the effect on memory strength. It might be the case that effects of reward on memory strength only emerge when there are at least more than two reward levels, allowing participants to focus on the comparably few trials with a very high reward, as compared to half of the trials with a high reward in the case of two reward levels.</p><p>This potential moderator of reward context should be tested in future research.</p><p>Reward contingencies are a form of source memory (i.e., participants remember the reward associated with a stimulus). In support of this interpretation, we found participants to have more accurate reward expectations when their confidence was high. We did not ask for remember/know judgements, to not further burden our participants, and can thus not distinguish remember-based responses from familiarity-based responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">34</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref> , this means that participants had (or believed to have) perfect information about reward contingencies, so could base decision on cues presented during retrieval rather than memory for stimulus-reward associations. However, we directly manipulated the reward information presented to the participants, which was either accurate (congruent group) or not (incongruent group). The differences between the congruent and incongruent group provide empirical evidence that reward information presented during retrieval influences participants' behavior. Crucially, our set of studies demonstrates that the reward associations that bias decision making during retrieval are part of the construct that is of interest to researchers studying long-term memory for rewards rather than an unfortunate side effect of the measurement.</p><p>It is possible that providing participants with reward information during recognition changes the cognitive processes participants use to complete the task. I.e., when participants are not presented with any reward information during recognition (experiment 1), they might rely more strongly on (stimulus-reward) memory. When reward information is provided during recognition (experiments 2 and 3), participants might shift their criterion based on the presented reward, and disregard previously formed (stimulus-reward) memory. While we cannot rule out this explanation entirely, we argue against it: Overall memory performance is descriptively even better in experiments 2 and 3 than in experiment 1 (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 4</ref>), and better performance can only be achieved by improved discrimination between old and new pictures. Furthermore, reward information presented during recognition is not neutral, but seems to influence memory performance: For participants in the incongruent group, memory strength is worse when they are more strongly influenced by the shown reward. In line with this, response patterns in experiment 2 differ between the congruent and the incongruent group, especially for false alarms. This suggests that even when reward information is presented during recognition, knowledge about stimulus-reward associations is used to retrieve matching memory traces. If the Memory for Rewards Guides Retrieval reward information presented during recognition would override the participants' memory entirely, there would be no difference in performance between the congruent and incongruent group. We argue that rather than overriding existing memory traces, the reward information presented during recognition is used as a memory cue that guides retrieval. Lastly, it would be maladaptive if participants disregarded their memory of the pictures in favor of the reward information presented during recognition.</p><p>Generally, it makes sense that animals form stimulus-reward associations, rather than only relying on strengthening of the memory trace for the highly rewarded stimulus.</p><p>Remembering a stimulus strongly without information about its reward contingencies prevents the organism from adapting to changing reward contexts. For example, scrub jays memorize where they cached their highly preferred food, mealworms, but also remember the location of less preferred food, peanuts <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">35</ref> . Restricting access to the mealworms until they have gone bad, leads to the birds reliably retrieving less perishable peanuts. Likewise, participants in the Motivated Learning Task use stimulus-reward information encoded during learning or provided at retrieval testing to optimize decision-making during retrieval.</p><p>This interpretation aligns with findings that the effects of reward on decision-making are sensitive to modulations of punishments for incorrect decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref> , and that rewards influence retrieval strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">36</ref> . This account also connects the present research to research about model-based versus model-free learning in reinforcement learning tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">37</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref> . In addition, our large sample allows for a more precise and more robust estimate of effect sizes. We demonstrate that reward effects on memory can be categorized as small <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">43</ref> , which means that common sample sizes around 30 participants are not enough to detect them reliably and therefore the work by Bowen et al. (2020) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref> was likely not powerful enough to find subtle effects on sensitivity and thus their conclusions based on absence of evidence were premature.</p><p>While our conclusions are based on our preregistered mixed model analyses, it is helpful to look at the data from a different perspective. Our alternative analysis based on drift diffusion models, which take reaction times into account, generally confirms our findings that reward influences participants' performance at retrieval. In experiment 1, we found that reward expectations do not bias participants in the direction of a hit or false alarm (starting point). Note that the starting point cannot be interpreted as equivalent to a decision criterion in this model, because the outcome was "hit"/"false alarm", and not "old"/"new". That is, we cannot draw any conclusions about decision criteria with this model. The drift rate increased as reward expectations increased, which means evidence accumulation was faster and more accurate when participants expected a higher reward, potentially due to more noisy memory traces for low rewards. There was a trend towards Memory for Rewards Guides Retrieval a decreasing non-decision time as the reward increased; the non-decision time was higher for low rewards than for high rewards. That is, descriptively, participants needed more time for components that are not part of the decision process (e.g., early stimulus processing, preparing the motor response) when the reward was very low. Memory processes during early retrieval of stimuli might also contribute to the non-decision time.</p><p>According to the REM (retrieving effectively from memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">44</ref>  For both the congruent and incongruent group of experiment 2, we found that the higher the reward, the more participants were biased towards responding "old", which corresponds to the effect of reward on the decision criterion we found in the main analysis. We found a reduced drift rate as the reward increased (a trend for the congruent group; a significant effect for the incongruent group). This may seem at odds with the findings of experiment 1, where the drift rate increased for higher rewards. However -in contrast to experiment 1 -in experiment 2, the reward information was presented before the test stimulus was revealed. Participants might spend additional effort on stimuli labelled as high rewards, even if they do not recognize them. This might make the evidence accumulation for stimuli labelled as high rewards more noisy, resulting in an increased drift rate. In experiment 1, on the other hand, participants might quickly skip over stimuli that do not have a strong representation in memory. A similar explanation could apply to the non-decision time, which also increased as the reward increased:</p><p>Participants might spend more time on processing a stimulus following a high-reward cue during the test phase, or generating potentially matching vectors in memory. The findings of the drift diffusion models for experiment 3 follow a different pattern. There was no statistically significant association between reward and starting point, but the drift rate Memory for Rewards Guides Retrieval was significantly lower for the high reward level. It is intriguing that experiment 3 had a different pattern of results in both the main analysis and the exploratory alternative drift diffusion analysis. A speculative explanation could be that processing two reward levels is different from processing four reward levels. With two reward categories, there are more stimuli per category -potentially too many to prioritize the high rewards.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that participants spend more effort when a stimulus is announced as a high-reward item, regardless of whether its memory representation is strong. In contrast, decisions based on reward expectations require less effort, because resources are not "wasted" on stimuli that are only represented weakly in memory. Our results might further indicate that non-decision processes might be related to memory sensitivity. Lastly, it should be noted that because they also take reaction times into account, the parameters of drift diffusion models do not directly correspond to signal detection measures such as memory strength and decision bias. Thus, the drift diffusion models reported here provide complementary information to the analyses in the main manuscript, rather than challenging their interpretations.</p><p>In previous literature investigating the influence of reward on decisions and reaction times, the phenomenon of "magnitude sensitivity" has been described: "a choice between equal alternatives of high magnitude is made faster compared with a choice between equal alternatives of low magnitude", where "magnitude" means the summed value of the alternatives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">45</ref> In our experiments, we find the opposite pattern: Participants generally make slower decisions for stimuli preceded by a high reward. The most striking differences between our paradigm and those reported in the literature and magnitude sensitivity is that our participants a) do not choose between multiple alternatives presented on the screen and b) make their decision based on memory. To our knowledge, there are no studies investigating the classical magnitude sensitivity effect in memorybased paradigms. Even though our Motivated Learning Task differs in several aspects from typical magnitude sensitivity paradigms, our data might provide tentative evidence that reward magnitude affects memory-based decisions differently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>While experiment 1 enabled us to investigate participants' reward expectations and experiments 2 and 3 allowed us to calculate a reward-dependent false alarm rate, we were not able to create a paradigm that solved both problems at the same time. Future research would greatly benefit from tasks that do not need to provide their participants with perfect information about rewards, but still allow researchers to calculate a reward-dependent false alarm rate. A step in this direction might be an elegant two-step paradigm by Jang et al.</p><p>(2019) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">42</ref> , who associated reward probabilities with image categories, which changed over the course of the experiment. This provided them with a memory-based false alarm rate per reward probability. They found that reward prediction errors based on reward probability were associated with memory strength, but did unfortunately not report a measure of criterion.</p><p>Furthermore, in experiment 1, reward expectations were only available for "old" responses, which means that for correct rejections or misses, information about reward expectations is missing, limiting our analyses. We decided not to ask participants about the reward they expected to receive for their "new" decisions because that might have confused or frustrated participants. After all, when they identify a picture as new, they do not expect that the picture is associated with a reward.</p><p>In experiment 1 and 2, we used four different reward levels to investigate potential effects of reward in a more fine-grained manner, which might make our findings less comparable to previous literature, where it is common to use only two reward levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref>  Another limitation of our (and many previous) studies is the comparably small amount of money that participants could earn during the task. However, the striatal response to rewarding stimuli is not only modulated by absolute magnitude but also by relative magnitude of rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[48]</ref> . In addition, our use of gems as rewards instead of money may be criticized. However, in classical tasks such as the Monetary Incentive Delay task participants are able to transfer reinforcement properties to novel reward cues fast <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">49</ref> .</p><p>Additionally, we found no relative advantage of using monetary cues instead of gems in experiment 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, the highly robust effect of reward on hit rate reflects decision criteria at retrieval rather than changes in memory strength during encoding or consolidation. We propose that the decision criterion at recognition is based on memory for stimulus-reward associations learned during encoding and consolidated thereafter. However, it will be important to develop tasks that can reliably measure memory for stimulus-reward associations and reward effects on memory strength within one task in the future.         </p></div>

Example trials of the Motivated Learning Task for the learning and test phases of experiment 1, 2 and 3. During the learning phase, participants had to memorize 128 images. Each image was associated with a reward presented before the image (gems in a treasure chest in experiments 1 and 2, or cash (GBP), displayed as pictures of a bank note/coin in experiment 3). Trials of the Motivated Learning Task were separated by three trials of a flanker task to prevent rehearsal. During the test phase, participants had to determine whether the image they were presented with was "old" (i.e., shown during the learning phase) or "new" (i.e., not shown during the learning phase) and indicate their confidence in their choice on a 3-point likert scale (i.e., "guess", "sure", "very sure"). In experiment 1, if participants said that an image is "old" they were asked to indicate which reward they thought the image was associated with. In experiments 2 and 3, the reward was shown before the picture also in each trial of the test phase. In experiment 2, the reward was either congruent or incongruent to the reward shown to the participant during the study phase. In experiment 3, rewards shown during the test phase were always congruent to the reward shown during the study phase. In all experiments, participants who made a hit were rewarded the amount associated with the image. For a correct rejection, they received the mean value of all possible rewards and if they made an incorrect decision, they lost the mean value of all possible rewards.

In the congruent group of experiment 2, we found an effect of reward on memory strength, but in experiment 3, there was no statistically significant effect of reward on memory strength.Crucially, in experiment 1, we found that participants displayed explicit knowledge of reward contingencies, which was related to the effect of reward on hit rate.In experiment 1, we aimed to disentangle the contribution of memory strength versus decision-making strategies to this effect. For this, participants rated their expected reward in order to calculate a false reward rate per reward level. However, reward expectations were highly biased towards medium rewards for false alarms. This prevented us from calculating a meaningful d', because it is unclear what the appropriate denominator for the false alarm rate would be. There are two alternatives: One is to divide the number of false alarms per expected reward level by the number of total trials per expected reward level (per participant). This is technically not a false alarm rate, because it pits false alarms against hits. The false alarm rate is normally calculated as the number of false alarms divided by the number of all lure trials -but since correct rejections are not associated with a reward value, this does not work on a reward-level basis. The other issue with this method is that the information that each false alarm rate per expected reward level is based on a different number of trials is lost. This might mask criterion effects, e.g., when participants are less likely to identify a picture as old when their reward expectations are lower, leading to less trials for the lowest expected reward category. The other alternative would be to divide the false alarms per expected reward level by a constant (e.g., 128, the total number of target trials -dividing by 32 trials, the number of trials per expected reward if lures were evenly distributed across rewards, does not work, because some participants would end up with a false alarm rate &gt; 1). This way, a participant who, e.g., is heavily biased towards expecting medium reward levels will have a lower false alarm rate when expecting a high reward, which does not necessarily reflect higher accuracy or a more conservative response criterion. Lastly, when combining the hit rate and the false alarm rate into d', for both methods, the reward-dependent distribution of targets (uniform) and lures (more medium rewards) would differ, further complicating the interpretation of d'. These issues would be fixed if we had information about reward expectations for misses and especially correct rejections. However, we did not want to frustrate participants by asking them for their reward expectations when they just told us that they think a picture is new -and thus has no associated reward. Because of these issues, we concluded that the false alarm rate per expected reward level cannot be used to calculate a meaningful d'. Thus, we modified the paradigm again in experiment 2. For interested readers, we report d' analyses in the Supplementary Materials (both</figDesc><table><row><cell>based on a denominator per expected reward level, and a fixed denominator; see</cell></row><row><cell>Supplementary Note 6).</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Our observation that more accurate memory of stimulus-reward associations was correlated with a reward-related increase in hit rate provides further evidence that the effects of reward on hit rate rely on source memory.Bowen et al. (2020) 20 associated categories with different amounts of reward to give lures an objective value. Their approach provides perfect information of reward contingencies and removes the need to form stimulus-reward associations, sinceparticipants rely on perfectly learned category-reward associations.

We tried to design a paradigm without perfect reward information that would still yield a false alarm rate per reward level in experiment 1, but were not successful.

(2020)</ref> </figDesc><table><row><cell>. Similar to our</cell></row><row><cell>findings, Adcock et al. (2006) 2 report that -unlike for high-confidence responses -there was</cell></row><row><cell>no statistically significant effect of reward on low-confidence responses. Likewise,</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_11"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>. For modelbased behavior the participant can use information about expected stimulus-reward contingencies to adapt the criterion and maximize monetary gain. Flexible model-based representations enable participants to generalize knowledge about rewards to new stimuli across different contexts<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">38</ref> . This is in line with recent evidence that dopamine signals causal associations between cue and reward<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">39</ref> . Model-based explanations oppose accounts of more automatic influences of reward on memory, e.g., automatic dopaminergic processes during encoding strengthening the subsequently formed memory trace<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2</ref> . In tasks where participants have a good, explicit representation of the task structure (which we ensured with our validation questions about the reward contingencies), behavior is mainly modelbased 40,<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">41</ref> . In contrast, when learning is incidental, prediction errors based on reward probability influence (automatic) strengthening of the memory trace<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">42</ref> . Future research Memory for Rewards Guides Retrieval could relate inter-individual differences in reward-associated memory performance to model-based versus model-free decision-making tendencies.Our experiments reach similar conclusions as the experiments by Bowen et al. What makes our version of the task different is that we were able to manipulate the congruency of the reward information presented during the test phase. We believe that our results complement and go beyond the results of<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bowen et al. (2020)</ref> </figDesc><table><row><cell>(2020) 20 . However, our study goes beyond them since in contrast to their work, we are able</cell></row><row><cell>to examine the effect of associative reward memory and the item-specific effects of showing</cell></row><row><cell>rewards at retrieval, which the authors draw implicit conclusions about without directly</cell></row><row><cell>investigating them. Detailing on this, we test participants' source memory for the rewards in</cell></row><row><cell>experiment 1, which provided crucial insights into participants' reward expectations. Like</cell></row><row><cell>Bowen et al. (2020) 20 , our version of the task in experiments 2 and 3 provided participants</cell></row><row><cell>with perfect reward information, minimizing the need for source memory during</cell></row><row><cell>recognition.</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>. It is possible that rewards are processed differently when there are more reward levels. For example, since there are more images per reward level, participants might have less associative memories for each reward level. Less stimuli per reward level might allow them to prioritize the most salient information (i.e., the highest reward level). This would explain why results for experiment 3, where we used only two reward levels, differed from those for the congruent group of experiment 2, even though we cannot attribute the different results between the two experiments to the difference in reward levels with complete certainty.Future work should systematically investigate the influence of the number of reward levels on memory performance. However, another methodological limitation for paradigms that Memory for Rewards Guides Retrieval employ more reward levels is that less information (number of trials) per reward level is available, limiting statistical analyses.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
