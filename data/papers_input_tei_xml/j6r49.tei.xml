			<abstract>
				<p>Behavioral economists are increasingly making forays in decision-making modeling that takes in information from the external environment and the internal settings of agents, such as models of rational inattention. A key ingredient to these models is the cognitive effort of acquiring information. However, such costs are not generally well understood. One approach to solve this issue is measuring the running cost of cognitive tasks. Here we provide a model of rational inattention with running cost. We test the model on a double auction experiment. The results agree that a hyperbolic function of running cost can explain the deviation from the &quot;correct response&quot;. Furthermore, We find that the relation between performance and cognitive effort positive. But utility and cognitive effort have negative relation. Subjects try to increase performance by cognitive effort exertion when the expected utility was higher.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many observations in macroeconomics suggest that people's responses and adjustments to economic variable changes are sluggish. Keynesian articulate this phenomenon as "adjustment cost"</p><p>and "price stickiness": when the environment changes but individuals do not change their behavior accordingly, even when all necessary information is accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[Sims, 2010]</ref>. Previously, it was assumed that these sluggish behaviors were due to information lags. Not all people simultaneously have access to all the information all the time. However, even after providing enough information to the economic actors, this behavior persisted. This observation led to the invention of rational inattention models where the constraint was no longer seen as something in the environment but internal to the individuals. In rational inattention models extraction of information is assumed to be costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[Sims, 2003]</ref>. These models acknowledge that raw data can only be useful if one takes the effort and tries to make sense of them. The problem that arose next was that what should the cognitive effort of processing information be?</p><p>The dominant approach is to use Shannon's mutual information. However, recent works showed that it is not appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Krajbich and Dean, 2015]</ref>. In this article, after reviewing the literature on energy consumption of brain cell's (specifically neurons) information processing, we propose to use a method for computing cognitive effort called running cost instead of Shannon's mutual information.</p><p>It seems that the assumptions of rational inattention model is valid based on the cognitive neuroscience work. It has been shown that the engagement of cognitive control is indeed necessary for both For reducing entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Mushtaq et al., 2011]</ref> and updating action <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Levy and Wagner, 2011]</ref>.</p><p>And a major current hypothesis in the literature of cognitive effort, called cost control hypothesis claims that cognitive control registers as disutility in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Botvinick et al., 2009]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Energy consumption of neurons</head><p>Neurons display high energy consumption relative to other cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Ercsey-Ravasz et al., 2013]</ref>, with metabolic consumption of the brain representing 20 % of the whole-body oxygen uptake, even though the brain represents only 2 % of the body weight. Blood glucose during normal conditions is the primary source of energy for neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[Magistretti and Allaman, 2018]</ref>. Further- more, the brain must make sure to use this energy efficiently. Neuronal activity is known to evoke local increases in blood flow, glucose uptake, and oxygen consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[Sokoloff, 2008]</ref>.</p><p>It must be added that glucose uptake and glycolytic rate of astrocytes (another cell type of brain that provides neurons with energy through a mechanism known as "astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle" <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[Pellerin et al., 1998</ref>]) is increased in response to the activity of excitatory neurons, mostly as a consequence of the local rise of glutamate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[Magistretti and Allaman, 2018]</ref>. The activation of neurons is governed by pre-synaptic energy regulation. Most of energy budget is used during signaling, 75 % of the gray-matter and around 20 % of the total energy budget <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Attwell and Laughlin, 2001]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Harris et al., 2012]</ref>. Pre-synaptic neuron's ATP is mostly used to restore the sodium gradient due to action potential 22%, and sustain the resting potential, 20% of energy consumption. Neurons are famous for being highly sensitive to decreases in ATP sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Ames III, 2000]</ref>. These evidences led to the creation of the Energy Homeostasis Principle: neuronal energy regulation drives behavior. This principle suggests that on the molecular level of neurons' sudden drop of reserve energy after an action potential causes a higher energy input rate to match the consuming rate and restore energy levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[Vergara et al., 2019]</ref>.</p><p>Brain oxygen consumption is almost constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[Raichle and Gusnard, 2002]</ref> because even during resting state, much of brain energy is being consumed by a network called default mode network <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[Raichle et al., 2001]</ref>. Even when people are engaged in cognitively demanding tasks, energy consumption is steady <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[Sokoloff et al., 1955]</ref>. This observation has refuted theories of cognitive effort, which based their arguments on glucose consumption of the brain (for meta-analysis, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[Vadillo et al., 2016]</ref>). Growing evidence suggests that synaptic activities are tightly coupled with metabolic energy, and metabolic energy is governing neuronal activities <ref type="bibr">[Yuan et al., 2018]</ref> [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001]</ref> [Niven and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Laughlin, 2008]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Hasenstaub et al., 2010]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[Yu and Yu, 2017]</ref>.</p><p>Synaptic transmission and dendritic integration are two main metabolically expensive steps in neuronal information processing, and any changes in synaptic connections can result in fluctuations of their energy consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</ref>] <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Howarth et al., 2012]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[Yu and Yu, 2017]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, synaptic transmission may play very important roles in regulating collective neuronal activities, such as synchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Wang et al., 2011]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Guo et al., 2012]</ref> ,firing patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Guo et al., 2016]</ref> and resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[McDonnell and Abbott, 2009]</ref>.

Neural homeostasis keeps neurons in an optimal operating regime. Such a regime, on the one hand, is pulled by information processing requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Laughlin, 1981]</ref> and environmental necessities, and on the other hand is pulled by energy consumption constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Perrinet, 2010]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Running cost</head><p>It is evident that in brain the complete minimization of wiring would allow only local connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[Sik et al., 1995]</ref> and not long-distance connections, leading to delayed information transfer and metabolic energy depletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Allman, 1998]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Koch and Laurent, 1999]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[Sik et al., 1995]</ref>.</p><p>In other words, if the only force in the brain is the energy homeostasis principle, then it would not be a small-world network <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Bassett and Bullmore, 2006]</ref>.

However, due to short-term functional plasticity, different networks become active during different tasks on the time scale of a millisecond to seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Neher, 2007]</ref>. The wiring cost for running the active network during a functional task is called running cost, and it is equal to the sum of the length of axonal wires in a network.</p><p>But how is it possible that a quantity of distance can tell us anything about the amount of consumed energy? The answers lies in two facts; first, as mentioned before, most of the brain's energy is consumed within gap junctions, approximately 55 percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Harris et al., 2012]</ref>. And second, there is almost a fix relation between gap junction and the membrane that it occupies, On average 1 synapse per 1.6 µm 2 membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Meinertzhagen and Fröhlich, 1983]</ref>. Moreover, we know that each volume pixel (voxel) image of brain under fMRI machine contains roughly more than 3 * 10 10 synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Braitenberg and Schüz, 2013]</ref>. Hence, by observing how many voxel it was needed for connecting brain regions together we can have a estimate of how much energy it was needed to run that network of brain regions. Later we elaborate explicitly how these calculations can be done.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Subjects</head><p>Twenty-seven subjects (nine males, two left-handed, after discarding two of the initial 29 subjects due to excessive head motion) participated in the experiment. All subjects were queried to exclude histories of neurological pathologies. After a briefing, all subjects gave informed written consent and paid upon completion of the task. The protocol was performed under the Declaration of Helsinki with approval of the University Review Board of Higher School of Economics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Task</head><p>Subjects played the role of buyers in a double auction with first-price sealed bids and with opponents assigned by repeated random matching, in three different market types. The conditions differed in the number of sellers and buyers. In the seller competition market (SC), there were two sellers and one buyer (the subject); in the no competition market (NC), there were one seller and one buyer (the subject); and in the buyer competition market (BC), there were one seller and two buyers (one of them being the subject). In all market types, the outcome of the transaction was determined by pitting the highest buyer's bid against the lowest seller's ask price. If the former was strictly lower than the latter, then the transaction was not consummated, and the subject received the disagreement outcome: zero monetary units (MU). Otherwise, the subject received 10-b MU, where b is the bid of the subject.</p><p>Subjects were informed that they were participating in a game investigating decision-making.</p><p>The game paradigm required buyers to fix their bids in advance. Their task was to buy fish on a market using a 10-point Likert scale with increments of 0.1 MU. The initial position of the cursor on the Likert scale was randomized across trials. Collected fish led to a payoff: p = 10 − b, where b was the bid value in task MU, and 10 represented the maximum endowment the player could make use of in every transaction. Opponents were prerecorded human subjects replayed by a computer. In each trial, subjects played in one of the market types, which were looped throughout the experiment (24 blocks of 3 market types) in the order determined by a fixed sequence without repetition (of SC, NC and BC). One of the six possible sequences was pseudorandomly and independently assigned to each subject.</p><p>At the beginning of a trial, a MARKET stage (duration = 5s) informed subjects of the market type in the current trial. Next, a LOTTERY (duration = 2s) stage consisted of a lottery determining whether subjects would be allowed to enter the market or not. In one of every six trials, subjects were not allowed to enter the market and had to move to the next trial.</p><p>Otherwise, subjects entered the market and the CHOICE stage started. During the CHOICE stage (self-paced, but with a prompt to answer quicker after 15s), subjects had to purchase (by bidding) fish in a market using a 101-point slider scale. The feedback screen (OUTCOME, duration = 6s) displayed the outcome of the transaction and the profit earned. In BC trials, when the competitor outbid the subject, that bid was made visible to the subject. Sellers' ask prices were never disclosed. All inter-stimulus intervals were jittered between 5s and 7s following a uniform distribution of duration 2s. The LOTTERY stage was included to assess the subject's differential neural response to being rejected from each market type. However, we found no differences in this respect. Every subject played 24 trials of each market type (72 in total). The duration of each trial depended on the bid selection time and ranged from 21s to 61s, with an average of 39s. The total duration of the experiment was approximately 50 min.</p><p>The instructions explicitly informed subjects that they would play against prerecorded human players who had played the same game before against other human opponents. In each trial, the actions of the subjects' opponents were matched according to the trial order of each market type (repeated random matching). Once inside the scanner but before the scanning started, subjects were trained on 6-10 trials, encompassing all market types (at least two trials of each market type). The training phase ended after subjects successfully and consistently manipulated the button box by placing their intended bid and then reported understanding the task.</p><p>After scanning, subjects were rewarded according to the following reward scheme: a fixed compensation of 300 Russian rubles ( 5 USD) for participation, in addition to a bonus equal to <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Task design of one trial, each block consists of three trials. (a) Each trial consisted of four stages: market type announcement, lottery, bid selection and game outcome feedback. During the market announcement stage (MARKET), the subject was informed of the market type of the current trial. The next stage (LOTTERY) indicated whether the subject would go forth to the next stage or be redirected to the beginning of the next trial. In the former case, a Likert scale was displayed, and the subject had to choose her bid by sliding a vertical bar (CHOICE). Finally, the game outcome stage (OUTCOME) signalled whether the bid was accepted (ACCEPTED) or rejected (REJECTED). (b) Upper: behavioural learning dynamics of bids across all subjects. Lower: pairwise differences of bid sizes among market types. Box "hinges" represent first and third quartiles. (c) Bid adjustments were contingent on the previous trial's outcome of the same market type. the sum of the profit earned in three random trials multiplied by 15 MU ( 5-12 USD in total).</p><p>The visual stimuli were projected with an LCD projector onto a rear screen. This screen was reflected by a mirror attached to the MRI head coil, subtending approximately 20 degrees of visual angle. The task was programmed using Presentation software (version 18.0, Neurobehavioral Systems). Responses were collected through three response buttons: the right thumb shifted the cursor to the right, the right index shifted it to the left and the left thumb confirmed bid choices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">General Model</head><p>The standard rational inattention model comes in two kinds: constrained and unconstrained.</p><p>They are quite similar, but we will use the unconstrained version because it has been proven to be more accurate in experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Azrieli, 2021]</ref>. There is a finite set S of states with s ∈ S denoting a typical state. The prior belief of the participant about the environment (opponent's action) is µ ∈ △(S) where △(X) is the set of probability distributions over any finite set of X.</p><p>The finite set of available actions is A. For each pair (a, s) ∈ A × S, the utility of the participant when s/he chooses action a and the realized state is s is denoted <ref type="figure">by u(a, s)</ref>. A decision problem is described by the triplet <ref type="figure">(µ, A, u)</ref>.</p><p>The subject chooses two parameters; one is an information structure: a mapping from states to distributions over some set of signals (environment), and the second parameter is the action to play after exposition to each signal (what action to take based on the interpretation made from the environment). Thus, the choice variable is a mapping P : S → △(A), where P (a | s)</p><p>is the choice a probability conditional on state s. Also, P denotes the unconditional probability of actions, which is P (a) = s µ(s)P (a | s). Lastly, the cost of processing signals derived from fMRI data is denoted as c(P (a)).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">max P (a) s µ(s) a P (a | s)u(a, s) − λc(P (a))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The first term is the expected utility that the participants obtain by conditioning their choice on the observed signal, while the second term after λ is the cost of attendance or running cost.</p><p>For finding the P (a) that maximizes equation (1) we take first derivative from it with respect to P (a) of each a and equating it to zero. Then, by simplifying, we arrive at:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u(a, s) = λ * rc (2)</formula><p>where rc is running cost, rc = ∂c(P ) ∂P . From this solution it can only be concluded that there exist a relation between utility and running cost. Whether this relation is positive or negative it is up to experimental data at this point because c(P ) is not assumed to be monotone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Specific model for double auction experiment</head><p>Because of fMRI's low temporal resolution, we could not compute the running cost per trial, so instead, we computed the running cost per block. However, other parameters like bid (subject's action) profit (subject's utility) are defined per trial. Thus, we find it necessary to define an index of the subject's responses and utilities per block and not per trial.</p><p>The index a is defined simply as the mean of the scaled bid (∈ [0, 1]) in each block. For instance, if the subject bid 4, 5, 6 in a block then a equals 0.5. As for computer behavior (or the stimuli) s, we also used the same method for any other player with the highest bid (let me remind you that players changed in given markets, e.g., in seller competition market there are two sellers and in buyer competition one more buyer other than the subject. We chose the highest bid among them.)</p><p>Furthermore, now that stimuli, response and running costs are all defined per block, the Utility function is also necessary to be defined per block. The utility function in a double auction market works based on two main principles: The first object is to outbid other players, i.e., a − s be positive. Second, higher bids reward less than lower bids, i.e., 1/a. By putting these two principles together, we define utility function as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u(a, s) = max{ 1 a − s , 0}<label>(3)</label></formula><p>By plugging 3 into 2 and simplifying we reach the equation below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a = s + 1 λ * rc<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Equation (4) describes subject's response as a function of environment (outside factor) and brain activity (inside factor). We know that if subject bids are equal to the maximum bids of other players, the subject earns the maximum possible reward of each block. In other words, the "best bid" for each block is a = s. Thus, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>explains deviation of subject's bid at each block from the "best bid" is duo to running cost. As rc increases, a gets distance from s exponentially.</p></div>

Scanning protocol parameters were as follows: TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 80°; TR = 2280 m; slice thickness = 3 mm; no gap; slice matrix = 64 × 64; number of axial slices = 35; FoV = 192 mm; and voxel resolution = 3x3x3.7 mm.</p><p>High-resolution structural MRI data acquisition used a T 1 -weighted MP-RAGE sequence.</p><p>Parameters were as follows: TE = 2.47 ms; flip angle = 9°; TR = 1900 ms; slice thickness = 0.5 mm; slice matrix = 512 × 512 × 176; number of slices = 176; FoV = 256 mm; and voxel resolution = 0.508 × 0.508 × 1 mm. These data were used for anatomical localization. A corrective routine aimed at counteracting susceptibility angled through the slice plane (z-shimming) was performed by the scanner. The slice angle was tilted a negative 30°with respect to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure axis in the sagittal plane to reduce the unaccounted spatial components of the susceptibility gradients. The number of volumes acquired was on average 1,263, corresponding to a duration of approximately 48 min.</p></div>

Note that the threshold in this way varies between individuals. Lastly, we computed running costs by summing the euclidean distances between nodes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we showed how we could compute the cognitive effort of rational inattention models by adopting the running cost method from fMRI data. The contemporary approach for cognitive computing cost in the rational inattention model is a function of the amount of reduction in Shannon's entropy. However, as this method proved not so suitable, as an alternative we suggest running cost as a measure for cognitive effort, a function of approximated enlargement in axonal wiring distance between neurons. We provide the general, task-independent solution for this set of models 2 and task-dependent solution 4 specified for the case of double auction markets.</p><p>These solutions were able to stand the test of our empirical experiment.</p><p>The transition from task-independent to dependent is possible by defining utility function as agent and environment behavior. Thus, the subject's behavior would be predicted by external (environment) and internal (running cost) factors in any task-dependent. We test the model on double auction market experiments. We find that the relation between performance and cognitive effort positive and hyperbolic. But utility and cognitive effort have negative relation. This result means that subjects try to increase performance by cognitive effort exertion when the expected utility was higher. As an example imagine a case when they expected the highest other bidder is around 9, meaning the expected utility is 1, in this case subjects were not motivated enough to increase their accuracy and performance by increasing their cognitive effort. And reversely they exert more cognitive effort to be more accurate and perform better when they expect the other highest bidder is around 1, meaning the expected utility is 9.</p><p>For computing running cost we used the straight distance of the nodes in the network. Using anatomical data to use the true distance between the nodes will improve running cost approximation, leading to a better goodness of fit of our statistical model. Two key assumptions were made in our model that improving each one of them can be an interesting subject for future research. First one is that recent work cast doubt on this assumption of the cost control hypothesis, or the idea of considering cognitive effort as costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Bogdanov et al., 2022]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Inzlicht et al., 2018]</ref>. And second one is that in rational inattention models, the value of signal is assumed to be independent of the decision of the agent but in many cases it is not true. As an example, imagine traffic light, if the agent's prior belief is that people of the city follow traffic signals, then the value of the traffic signal is high but once he make a decision to follow them as well then the value of the traffic light increases. Reversely, imaging that he mistakenly belief that people do not follow the traffic signals and he decides not to coordinate his driving based on the traffic signals then his decision decreases the true value of the signal.</p><p>We believe that the rational inattention model is a compatible model with the cost control hypothesis or expected value of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[Shenhav et al., 2013]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Botvinick and Braver, 2015]</ref>. The main idea in both theories is that cognitive effort is perceived as disutility by the decision-maker, and he outweighs the disutility of cognitive effort versus expected value. Combining these two theories can be a powerful tool to study variety of phenomenons like biding behavior in our case.</p><p>Testing the model with more experiments in the future is encouraged for two reasons one, to test the predictability of the model and validity of running cost, and two, to investigate whether there exists a constant relation between utility and running cost.</p><p>[ <ref type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018] Yuan, Y., Huo, H., Zhao, P., Liu, J., Liu, J., Xing, F., and</ref><ref type="bibr">Fang, T.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Reviewer 1</head><p>In this paper, the authors conducted an auction experiment, and used brain imaging to measure the cognitive cost of information processing. They found a negative correlation between cognitive cost and utility received by subjects. Below are a few comments I hope they can address in a revision.</p><p>1. The authors rely on the rational inattention model to derive the theoretical relationship between utility and cognitive cost. I suggest the authors add a more detailed introduction of the theory, so as to make the modeling methods more accessible to their readers. 2. The authors introduce c(P(a)) in equation 1 but did not give the readers the form of its equation. Without that information, I cannot figure out how equation 2 was derived, which required taking the partial derivative of c(P(a)) with respect to P(a). I suggest the author clarify the functional form of c(P(a)), and explain how to derive equation 2 in more detail. 3. Regarding Equation 4, the authors state, "As rc increases, a gets distance from s exponentially." However equation 4 is a = s + 1/(lambda * rc). If rc increases, 1/(lambda * rc) decreases, and a should become more similar to s. Please correct this error. 4. The authors state in their abstract, "We find that the relation between performance and cognitive effort positive". I did not find this conclusion supported in their result section. Maybe the authors were referring to their model instead? I suggest the authors clarify how they achieved the conclusion and whether their empirical data supported this conclusion. 5. There are a few typos and grammar mistakes in the draft. For example: 5.1. page 2: It has been shown that the engagment of cognitive control is indeed necessary for both *For* reducing entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Mushtaq et al., 2011]</ref> and updating action <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Levy and Wagner, 2011]</ref>. Please delete "For". 5.2. Page 6: After a briefing, all subjects ** gave informed written consent and paid upon completion of the task. Please add "were".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Reviewer 2</head><p>The authors aim to test a model of rational inattention with running cost. To do so, they use economic choices and fMRI recordings. If I understood correctly, the authors start from the perspective that choices are limited by the use of available knowledge, then move to rational inattention theories (which to my knowledge explain why information that is not deemed relevant to one's current goals is often not perceived and/or remembered) and then move on to theories of effort costs as an explanation of that effect. They then talk about metabolic cost at the neuronal level and then jump to quantifications of that cost using fMRI. I will say I had a hard time following the logic here. They set up equations for how running cost -which here seems to relate to something like sum of network edges -should relate to utility. I have to admit I am entirely lost here. I also do not follow why they test hypotheses originating from research on cognitive control using economic decision tasks for which the quantification and nature of effort is complicated and still poorly understood (e.g. the amount of time spent deliberating, depth of deliberation, the precision of the underlying representations that are being compared...). To get some proxy for how (the demand for) effort even varies between the different tasks or with utility as the authors say, it would be necessary to show corresponding behavioral findings. At this point, the behavior is not reported at all. It would also be good to see some traditional task-based fMRI results. The figure captions are insufficient and inappropriate for a scientific publication. It is not clear to me what conclusion the authors draw from their results, and it is also difficult for me to discern what question they aimed to answer to begin with.</p><p>In its current form the manuscript does not meet the standards for publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Rational inattention model: Agents choose set of signals in the environment by comparing the expected reward that they provide and the expected cognitive effort of processing them.</figDesc></figure>
