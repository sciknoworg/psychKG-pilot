				<p>The past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum-like (QL) modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena, there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach. In this paper, we develop a QL representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on generalized probability theory (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework (see section 2.1 for comparison of classical, quantum, and generalized probability theories). Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect-observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments-a critical aspect of this model. Under the specific assumption regarding neuronal connectivity, the compound system S = (S 1 , S 2) of neuronal networks is represented using the tensor product. This S 1 ⊗ S 2 representation significantly enhances the computational power of S. The GPT-based approach successfully replicates key QL effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects-phenomena often as-Preprint submitted to Journal of Mathematical Physics sociated with decision interference. Additionally, this framework enables QL modeling in medical diagnostics for neurological conditions like depression and epilepsy. While the focus of this paper is primarily on cognition and neuronal networks, the proposed formalism and methodology can be directly applied to a broad range of biological and social networks. Furthermore, it supports the claims of superiority made by quantum-inspired computing and can serve as the foundation for developing QL-based AI systems, specifically utilizing the QL representation of oscillator networks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The quantum information revolution (commonly referred to as the second quantum revolution) has had a profound impact, not only technologicallyushering in advancements in quantum computing, cryptography, and simulation -but also in foundational understanding. One key revelation is that the methodology and formalism of quantum theory can be extended beyond physics to model phenomena in diverse fields, such as cognition, psychology, decision-making, biology (including genetics and epigenetics), evolutionary theory, economics, finance, social and political sciences, and game theory. This interdisciplinary area of research is broadly referred to as quantum-like (QL) modeling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[104]</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> It should be clearly distinguished from the use of genuine quantum physics in cognition, as explored by researchers such as Hameroff <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, Penrose <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[101]</ref>, and Vitiello <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[121]</ref>, as well as in biology, particularly in the framework of quantum biophysics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">109]</ref>. QL models, on the other hand, describe the behavior of macroscopic cognitive systems (e.g., human behavior), where the functioning of these systems can be modeled as information processing that adheres to the laws of quantum information theory and probability, deviating from classical laws.</p><p>In the past 10-15 years, QL studies have expanded into new domains of science, such as genetics and biological evolution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. As a result, the second quantum revolution has been complemented by the QL revolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[104]</ref>. A key challenge for the QL approach lies in the fact that the neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for generating macroscopic QL behavior remain unknown. The experimental statistical data collected in cognitive psychology exhibits phenomena like the order, conjunction and disjunction, response replicability effects, and contextuality. Such data can be successfully described using quantum formalism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> However, there is still no proper mathematical model that links the neurophysiological processes in the brain with a QL description. This issue was highlighted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Currently, this is not merely a theoretical concern. QL methodology has recently been applied in the medical diagnosis of neurological diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">113]</ref>, and the first "QL patent" has been granted <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[111]</ref>. While this method provides highly accurate predictions, the lack of a neurophysiological foundation hinders its widespread use in hospitals, as physicians require a neurophysiological justification for its application. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the coupling between the brain's neurophysiology and the QL framework. This model is based on the representation of brain neuronal network functioning within generalized probability theory (GPT) (also known as operational measurement/probability theory) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">95]</ref>; for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">103]</ref>. These neuronal networks are considered as systems under analysis. Information exchange between neurons in a network is mathematically described by a (generally directed) weighted graph G S , where the neurons are mapped to the vertices of G S . We acknowledge the challenges in experimentally realizing such mappings for the brain's neuronal networks (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[106]</ref>), and thus, our modeling remains far from experimental implementation. Each graph G S corresponds to the information state of the network, which is described by the weight matrix ω = (ω ij ). The elements of this <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> See, for example, the works cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> One might refer to quantum biophysics or to genuine quantum physical processing in the brain, such as in the microtubules <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">101]</ref>. And the QL approach does not contradict the quantum-brain hypothesis, despite the latter's numerous drawbacks, as pointed out by many critics, including Tegmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[117]</ref>. From our perspective, the main issue with the quantum-brain theory is that it does not consider neurons as the fundamental units of mental information processing. To identify such units, one would need to explore finer scales of space and time, possibly down to the Planck scale, as in Penrose's theory of consciousness and quantum gravity. However, we aim to focus on neuronal processing as the core basis for cognition and consciousness. matrix encode the strength of signals between communicating neurons, such as the frequencies used in the widely adopted frequency representation of the neural code <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> or correlations between neuronal activations. The dynamics of the weighted graph mathematically describes the evolution of the network's states. (Note that the dynamics are not studied in this paper.)</p><p>This is an opportune moment to highlight prior research on the neural network foundations of QL models. De Barros and Suppes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>) demonstrated that neural oscillators can generate interference patterns analogous to those observed in unitary evolution. Takahashi and Cheon <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[116]</ref> proposed a nonlinear neural network model that uses squared amplitudes to compute response probabilities within a quantum cognitive framework. Busemeyer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> explored how a neural-based system could perform the computations required for applying quantum probability to human behavior. More recently, QL modeling on treelike graphs has gained traction in medical research <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">113]</ref>, reflecting the hierarchical nature of information processing in the brain. Notably, one of the earliest works in QL modeling of cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref> focused on the quantum mechanics of treelike graphs, which are mathematically represented using p-adic numbers. This approach was later extended to QL modeling in studies of petroleum reservoirs <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[79]</ref>, where the treelike structure of capillary networks was analyzed. Additionally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref>, mental information was represented QL through the distribution of action potentials in neuron networks. The present work also draws inspiration from discussions with Gregory Scholes on QL states in neural networks represented by specialized classes of graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. However, our approach considers arbitrary graphs. Finally, we mention recent publications on neurally inspired QL models of arousal and the Yerkes-Dodson law based on neural activity in the locus coeruleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57]</ref>. This paper is intended for those interested in applying quantum methods to cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Researchers in these areas are generally unaware of GPT. Moreover, GPT is divided into several models that may appear to be different, but are mathematically equivalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref> (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">103]</ref>). In this paper, we employ a specific model based on ordered linear spaces, or more precisely, base norm spaces. To make the paper accessible to experts in mathematical psychology, we briefly introduce the basics of GPT within the ordered linear space formalism in section 5.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>Before formally introducing GPT, we begin by intuitively exploring and, we hope, clearly using the concepts of GPT. In section 4, we present a model that bridges QL cognition and the brain's networks of communicating neurons. We return to this model in section 7 to demonstrate the effects of order, interference (disjunction), and non-repeatability.</p><p>This paper is conceptual in nature, aiming to introduce the concept of coupling neuronal activity with the quantum cognition project through GPT. Further papers will delve deeper into the technical details. While this paper focuses on cognition and neuronal networks, the formalism and methodology presented here can be easily applied to a variety of biological and social networks, including QL modeling in genetics, medicine, and social science <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Moreover, the application of our bridging construction to networks of mechanical or digital oscillators supports the supremacy claims of quantum-inspired computing (QIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>. It can also serve as the foundation for the development of QL-based Artificial Intelligence (QLAI).</p><p>We draw attention to the connection with the paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, which reported the enhanced computational power of special oscillatory neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> emphasized the similarity between the functioning of these networks and QIC. In light of our work, this is not merely a similarity -these frameworks can be unified through our bridging construction. The key role here is played by the exploration of the tensor product QL representation for specially connected compound networks (see sections 8 and 9). Additionally, section 9.1 discusses the impact of electromagnetic fields, including the brain's basic rhythms, on establishing inter-network correlations, while section 9.2 explores the relationship between the QL representation of compound neuronal networks and QIC, as well as the enhanced computational power of certain oscillatory networks in the brain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminary foundational discussion</head><p>Our paper is linked to foundations of quantum theory, especially its probabilistic and measurement counterparts, and cognitive and neural sciences. Some of the foundational problems are of great complexity and it would be naive to expect their clarification here. Neverthelss, some preliminary discussion can be useful for understanding of our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Classical, quantum, and generalized probability theories</head><p>By the quantum probability theory (QPT) we understood the conventional quantum theory formulated by von Neumann <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[122]</ref> (and Lüders), but not non-commutative probability theory based on von Neumann algebras. The classical probability theory was formulated by Kolmogorov <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[76]</ref>.</p><p>Probability theory needs two kinds of rules:</p><p>• rules for probability distribution of observables,</p><p>• rules for state update.</p><p>In QPT, the state update rule follows the projective measurement postulate (Lüders' postulate), whereas in CPT, it follows Bayesian updating. These two rules allow us to compute joint probability distributions for arbitrary sequences of observables.</p><p>Regarding the question order effect (QOE) and the response replicability effect (RRE), sequential joint probability in CPT exhibits RRE but not QOE. Conversely, in QPT, sequential joint probability exhibits QOE if and only if it does not exhibit RRE <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">99]</ref>. Therefore, to reconcile QOE and RRE, a new theoretical framework beyond both CPT and QPT is required.</p><p>We have demonstrated that such a model exists within the framework of GPT or through QPT combined with instrument theory for state updates <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">99]</ref>. GPT provides a general structure for observables (encompassing both QPT and CPT) and describes state updates using the concept of instruments, as introduced by Davies and Lewis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[88]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[93]</ref>. Thus, GPT is not merely the union of QPT and CPT but extends beyond them.</p><p>The instrument theory in GPT (section 5.4) is emerged to fill those gaps in both probability theories QPT and CPT (see article <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> for detailed discussion). In fact, non-invasive measurements cannot be studied in QPT, and our Model 1 (section 3.2) cannot be described neither in QPT, nor in the standard CPT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cognition from the quantum-like representation of activity of neuronal</head><p>networks Our position that QL modeling of cognition strongly requires integration with the activity of networks of communicating neurons is not self-evident. One of the reviewers noted: "The authors raise the key issue of what kind of processing at the neuronal level is consistent with quantum-like cognitive models. In our field, in general, which has been a key challenge, that is, how to reconcile neuronal function with behavior ... most cognitive scientists/ neuroscientists might take the view that the neuronal explanatory level and the behavioral level are so detached that, essentially, they do not constrain each other. Explain why they think something quantum-like at the behavioral level makes it plausible why there should be some quantum-like at the neuronal level; this cannot be taken for granted. Note, a recent discussion of these issues is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref>. ... It would help a bit to explain what the overall assumption is: are we to assume that behavioral effects (such as whether we respond in a certain way to a question) can be directly mapped to processing of neuronal assemblies? "</p><p>In fact, we don't claim that "there should be some quantum-like at the neuronal level". Neuronal networks are purely classical random dynamical systems. QL representation is a metarepresentation of neuronal activity (cf. with a quantum-classical model of brain dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[109]</ref>). We emphasize that individual neuronal dynamics is present at the QL-level only indirectly -through the covariance matrix. The latter doesn't determine random dynamics in a neuronal network.</p><p>Our mathematical model supports the "QL-brain hypothesis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref> that the brain really can create such meta-representation and operate with QL states and observables, and that cognition is its facets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Graph representation of the networks of communicating neurons</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">From complexity of signaling in the brain to quantum-like representation</head><p>We start with recollection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> on the basics of brain's neuronal signaling:</p><p>"The human brain is made up of approximately 86 billion neurons that talk to each other using a combination of electrical and chemical (electrochemical) signals. The places where neurons connect and communicate with each other are called synapses. Each neuron has anywhere between a few to hundreds of thousands of synaptic connections, and these connections can be with itself, neighboring neurons, or neurons in other regions of the brain. A synapse is made up of a presynaptic and postsynaptic terminal. The presynaptic terminal is at the end of an axon and is the place where the electrical signal (the action potential) is converted into a chemical signal (neurotransmitter release). The postsynaptic terminal membrane is less than 50 nanometers away and contains specialized receptors.</p><p>The neurotransmitter rapidly (in microseconds) diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to specific receptors."</p><p>Voltage-dependent channels endow neurons with active signaling capabilities. Specifically, they enable neurons to generate nerve impulses, also known as action potentials. Despite variations in duration, amplitude, and shape, action potentials are typically treated as identical events. The duration of an action potential (approximately 1 ms) is often ignored, and an action potential sequence, or spike train, is represented as a series of all-or-none point events. It is important to note that each neuron, on average, has about 7,000 synaptic connections with other neurons. Axons vary in length; some are only a millimeter long, while those extending from the brain down the spinal cord can be over a meter in length. An axon has numerous side branches, known as axon collaterals, allowing one neuron to send information to several others. These collaterals, much like the roots of a tree, split into smaller extensions called terminal branches.</p><p>It is crucial to recognize that the integration of inputs in neurons is an intricate process, influenced by multiple factors at various scales. While the perspective summarized in the book of Kandel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref> provides a foundational understanding of synaptic integration, it does not fully capture the vast complexity of neuronal computation. Each neuronal output is not merely the result of synaptic summation at the dendritic level but is shaped by a vast array of biophysical, biochemical, and even systemic influences that interact dynamically. At the most immediate level, neuronal activity is driven by the integration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, primarily mediated by a multitude of ion channels/receptors. However, synapses themselves exhibit a high degree of complexity:</p><p>Nonlinear synaptic interactions: Dendrites do not simply sum inputs linearly. Instead, they exhibit nonlinear summation through mechanisms such as local dendritic spikes, NMDA receptor-mediated voltage dependence, and active back-propagation of action potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">114,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">78]</ref>.</p><p>Short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity: Synaptic strength is dynamically modified by mechanisms such as short-term facilitation/depression and long-term potentiation/depression (LTP/LTD), influenced by prior activity patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Neuromodulation of synapses: Neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine influence synaptic efficacy and dendritic excitability, regulating attention, learning, and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref> . Beyond classical synaptic integration, a variety of local and intracellular factors further shape neural output. we name a few below:</p><p>Ion channel diversity: Neurons express a diverse and changing (with functionality of the neuron based on various genetical modulations) range of voltage-gated and ligandgated ion channels, including potassium, calcium, and sodium channels, each contributing to intrinsic excitability and synaptic integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Intrinsic membrane properties: Neurons have unique electrical properties due to specific combinations of ion channels. These properties influence how inputs are transformed into outputs, leading to differences in firing patterns such as regular spiking, bursting, or adapting responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[82]</ref>.</p><p>Dendritic morphology: The physical structure of dendrites affects how signals propagate and interact. Thin dendrites can filter and attenuate signals, while dendritic spines can compartmentalize biochemical signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[114]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, Glial cells, once thought to serve only as support structures, are now rec-ognized as active participants in neural computation: Astrocytic regulation of synaptic function: Astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission by releasing gliotransmitters (e.g., glutamate, ATP) that can enhance or suppress neuronal firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Oligodendrocyte-mediated myelination: The myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes affects conduction velocity and synchrony of neural firing across distributed networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>.</p><p>Microglial immune responses: Microglia dynamically survey the neural environment and modulate synaptic pruning, plasticity, and inflammation, which in turn affect neuronal function <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[118]</ref> . Given the sheer complexity of neural influences, classical reductionist approaches may be insufficient to fully describe brain function. Instead, quantum-like formalism offers a promising alternative:</p><p>Handling infinitesimal influences: The sum of small influences (ǫ → 0) across different levels of neural organization is inherently embedded in the quantum state representation, reducing the need for explicit modeling at every level.</p><p>Holistic integration of influences: Quantum-like frameworks allow a unified view of neuronal interactions, where the state of the system represents the sum of all influences, and reductions can be made dynamically as needed.</p><p>Potential for new computational paradigms (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and section 9.2): If neural processing exhibits properties akin to quantum systems (e.g., superposition, entanglement-like correlations), new models may better capture the probabilistic nature of cognition and perception. As the integration of neural inputs is a profoundly complex process (which up until now could not be fully achieved by classical network dynamics formulation) influenced by multiple factors at different scales-from molecular and synaptic mechanisms to network-wide and systemic modulations. Traditional reductionist models struggle to encapsulate this complexity, particularly in the face of infinitesimal influences that accumulate to shape neuronal function. By adopting a quantum-like formalism, we may achieve a more holistic and adaptable framework for understanding neural computation, allowing us to isolate and examine specific influences while preserving their broader interactions.</p><p>In our model, we will create an abstract representation of interactions based on a synaptic connection between two neurons/system of neurons or even differently localized but connected brain tissues each with all its components, that encapsulates the multitude of minuscule influences shaping neural inputs, ranging from synaptic interactions and intrinsic neuronal properties to glial modulation and broader network dynamics. Rather than explicitly modeling each micro-level interaction from the outset, our approach will employ a simplified yet comprehensive framework that integrates these influences into a unified state. Crucially, unlike traditional models with fixed weights, our framework allows for a dynamic evolution of influence weights over time, analogous to quantum systems where states continuously evolve based on interactions and external conditions. This abstraction serves as a foundational model that can be systematically refined and decomposed into progressively more distinguishable components, enabling an adaptive level of complexity depending on the scale of analysis. By doing so, our framework not only preserves the holistic nature of neural computation but also provides a structured method-ology for isolating specific influences while maintaining their interconnected relationships within the system. Now, consider a network S in the brain consisting of N neurons, such as a network performing a specific brain function or even the entire network of neurons in the brain. Neuronal networks are the systems we model in our QL framework. Throughout the paper the symbol S denotes a neuronal network of communicating neurons.</p><p>In the graph representation of S, neurons are mapped to the vertices of the graph, and the connections between neurons are represented as the graph's edges. From an information-theoretic perspective, these edges need not correspond to physical connections, such as axons and synapses. For example, edges (connections) between pairs of neurons may be established based on correlations in their signaling.</p><p>We recall that if no two edges share the same pair of endpoints, the graph is said to have no multiple edges. Additionally, if no edge connects a vertex to itself (i.e., no edge has the same vertex as both endpoints), the graph has no loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[120]</ref>. A graph G S representing network S may contain multiple edges and loops.</p><p>A directed graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of directed edges, which are ordered pairs of vertices. A directed graph allows loops and permits two edges joining the same vertex but going in opposite directions. However, multiple edges going in the same direction between vertices are not allowed <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[120]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The primary model discussed in this article (Model 1, section 4) is based on directed neuronal graphs. The other two models are based on undirected graphs with loops, but without multiple edges.</p><p>Graphs describe the geometry of a network. But we model the "living community" of neurons communicating with each other. Therefore we consider the weighted graphs. If G S is the directed graph, then, for each pair of neurons n i and n j , the weights w ij and w ji are assigned for edges n i → n j and n j → n i . If G S is the undirected graph (without multiple edges), then the weight w ij = w ji is assigned to any edge (n i , n j ) = (n j , n i ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model 1: directed graph for neurons signaling</head><p>The weight w ij assigned to the graphs' directed edge n i → n j can be interpreted as the probability that during some interval of time ∆ (determining the scale of cognitive information processing in network S), neuron n i sends a signal to neuron n j . (This signal is of the electrochemical nature.) Denote this event O i→j . Thus, the neuronal network S is represented by the weighted directed graph, each two neurons are connected by two arrow-edges, n i → n j and n j → n i arrows (two neurons cycle), and each neuron n i is feedback coupled to itself by the loop edge n i → n i . No-signaling is encoded by the zero weight. So, we operate with a complete graph. This is convenient; we don't appeal to the "hardware" of the connections between the neurons in the network S. By eliminating the edges with w ij = 0 we would obtain more interesting graph geometry, but this is the topic of further studies.</p><p>Such neural activity can be represented in the framework of classical probability theory; for example, as follows. Let ξ ij denote the classical random variable</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ξ ij = 1, if O i→j holds, 0, otherwise.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Then we set w ij = E[ξ ij ] = P (ξ ij = 1).</p><p>Here 0 ≤ w ij ≤ 1.

The set Ω is convex, closed, and bounded in M (see Definition 1, section 5.2). Now we turn to the issue of pure states, the extreme points of the convex set Ω (section 5.2). The set of pure states coincides with the set of matrices (E ij ), where E ij is the matrix with elements e km;ij = δ(k − i)δ(m − j).

In fact, classical-quantum interplay is more complex and the crucial role is played not by state spaces, but by the calculus of measurement instruments (section 5.4). Let us briefly discuss the neural meaning of pure states in Model 1. In the matrix E i j only one element is non-zero. This means that only neurons n i and n j communicate and only in one direction: n i sends signals towards n j , but not vice verse. In particular, the pure state described by matrix E ii represent the situation such that ony neuron n i is active and it sends the feedback signals to itself. The two side communication of neurons n i and n j , i = j, is represented by the state (non-pure) described as matrix W = ω ij E ij + ω ji E ji , where the coefficients ω ij , ω ji encode the intensities of n i → n j and n j → n i signaling.</p><p>In GPT observables are defined as the collections of effects, positive linear functionals mapping state space into the segment [0, 1]. Any linear functional F = (F ij ) acts on a mixture (10) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">F |ω = ij F ij ω ij ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>so F is an effect (i.e., 0 ≤ F |ω ≤ 1 for all ω) if and only if 0 ≤ F ij ≤ 1 for all i, j, or equivalently F ≥ 0 and |F | ≤ 1. As in the quantum formalism, for any W ∈ M ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">F |W = Tr F † W,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where F † is the adjoint matrix of F . In GPT the important role is played by the unit effect u such that u|W = W for W ≥ 0; see (15) below). In the matrix model u = (u ij = 1). This is the analog of the trace functional in quantum theory. In general this is the basic scheme of GPT, states and effects. To proceed further, one should appeal to theory of measurement instruments. We want to do this properly and this needs more formal mathematical considerations that will be presented in the next section 5.</p></div>

Two neuronal networks, S 1 and S 2 , located in different regions of the brain, can contribute to the emergence of a cognitive phenomenon. The neurons in S 1 and S 2 do not necessarily need to be physically connected via axon-dendrite links. Instead, additional correlations between signals propagating within S 1 and S 2 must be considered. The interactions responsible for such correlations are of chemical or electromagnetic nature (see the Remark in this section and section 9). As a result, the from distributed neuronal networks. To tackle such problems, GPT should be applied to compound systems, which will be explored in sections 8 and 9, again in the context of Model 1.</p><p>compound network S = (S 1 , S 2 ) can generate states that cannot be produced by a network that is merely the set-theoretic union of the neurons (or neuronal circuits) in S 1 and S 2 and axon-dendrites connections between them.

Within this formalism, we can extend our analysis to Bell inequalities, which can be interpreted as measures of contextuality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.

In this article we proceed with this ideology which matches well with our neuronal model. We turn to the concrete representation of the weights w ij via averages of the classical random variables ξ ij , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Denote these variables for networks S 1 , S 2 as ξ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> ij , ξ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> ij .

Each W ∈ M , can be represented as the linear combination W = ijkm w ijkm E ijkm . The norm on M is defined as W = ijkm |w ijkm |. A matrix W is positive if all its elements are non-negative, i.e., the positive cone C + = {W : w ijkm ≥ 0}. So, matrices generated by the compound neuronal network via <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref> are positive. The state space of the compound system S = (S 1 , S 2 ) is defined as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, Ω = {ω : ω ≥ 0, ω = 1}. The matrix W S of the network S, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref>, is transformed to the corresponding state via normalization,</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">W S → ω = W S / W S .</formula><p>Thus, the description of the compound network via the covariance matrix, the S 1 ⊗ S 2 representation, differs from the description via the S 1 ⊕ S 2 representation. To imagine graphically the S 1 ⊕ S 2 representation, we need to establish all connections between the neurons n <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> i ∈ S 1 and n <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> j ∈ S 2 and assign to the corresponding directed edges the weights (see bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). The S 1 ⊗ S 2 representation doesn't contain these connections between neurons of S 1 and S 2 . Only the cross-correlations between signals inside these networks are taken into account. The S 1 ⊗ S 2 representation recounts correlations, or more specifically the concurrences, between signals within the network S 1 and the network S 2 (see top panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>The the S 1 ⊗ S 2 graph is constructed as follows. Denote the edges of the directed graphs G Sp , p = 1, 2, by the symbols e (p)</p><p>ij . These are the vertexes of the graph under construction that is symbolically denoted as G S 1 ⊗S 2 . This graph is undirected and weighted, and any vertex e <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> ij is connected with any vertex e <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> km by the edge e <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> ijkm with the weight w ijkm . For example, for N 1 = 2, N 2 = 3, the graph G S 1 ⊗S 2 has 32 (undirected) edges and the graph G S 1 ⊕S 2 has 25 (directed) edges. The graph G S 1 ⊗S 2 is not the standard tensor product G S 1 ⊗ G S 2 of the graphs G S 1 and G S 2 . The graph G S 1 ⊗S 2 can be called the edge tensor product of the directed graphs G S 1 and G S 1 . Since in such a graph the structure of the original neuronal graphs S 1 and S 2 would be shadowed, we illustrate the tensor product description of the compound system S = (S 1 , S 2 ) by the neuronal graphs for S 1 and S 2 and correlation coupling between them, so see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2 (top panel)</ref> for such visualizatio Remark. <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). The network S 1 ⊕ S 2 describes signaling between neuronal nodes of the networks S 1 and S 2 ; the matrix C consists of averages of inter-nodes signals; it evolves with time as C(t). This matrix (with normalization by norm) represents the QL state of S 1 ⊕ S 2 . The network S 1 ⊗ S 2 describes correlations between inter-nodes signals in the networks S 1 and S 2 . These correlations need not be based on the direct coupling between neurons in S 1 and S 2 ; the heptagon in the center of the upper figures symbolizes ephaptic coupling between S 1 and S 2 (section 9.1). The corresponding covariance matrix (with normalization by norm) represents the QL state of S 1 ⊗ S 2 . Its dynamics is given by a Schrödinger-like equation of GPT. Each of two networks S 1 and S 2 is characterized by internal signaling, described by the random signals ξ ij in S 1 and ξ ′ ij in S 2 . This is the direct signaling within the networks. Besides this direct signaling, there exist temporal concurrences between the signals in S 1 and S 2 (propagating along the edges in each of them). Mathematically they can be represented as correlations between the random signals ξ ij and ξ ′</p><p>ij , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref>. These correlations are basic for the QL representation via the tensor product.The crucial question is to understand how the compound network can explore the correlations between signals within them -even in the absence of physical connections, see section 9.1.</p><p>Suppose now that signals in S 1 and signals in S 2 are independent, i.e., the corresponding random variables are independent.

Electromagnetic fields as generators of inter-network correlations Consider two neuronal networks S 1 and S 2 such that the density of internetwork connections is very low comparing with the densities of connections between neurons in each of the networks.

They induce electromagnetic fields. The fields induced by signaling within S 1 and S 2 , n km can be generated by these fields. Next, we consider in more detail the possible processes that establish correlations between signaling in generally separated neuronal networks, S 1 and S 2 . Here we refer to ephaptic coupling between neuronal structures in the brain. This coupling leads to communication between neuronal networks that differs from direct communication systems based on the physical connections like electrical synapses and chemical synapses. By this mechanism signals in nerve fibers can be correlated as a result of local electric fields. Ephaptic coupling can generate the synchronization of action potential firing in neurons.</p><p>Recently this coupling was highlighted in article <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[102]</ref> in modeling of nonlocal representation of memories: "It is increasingly clear that memories are distributed across multiple brain areas. Such "engram complexes" are important features of memory formation and consolidation.

Our results ... provide evidence for in vivo ephaptic coupling in memory representations."</p><p>Our QL formalism describes such nonlocal correlations and, in particular, memories distributed across multiple brain areas. Such nonlocal memories are encoded in QL states. Here we again recall our basic conjecture that the brain explores the QL representation, i.e., it operates not with oscillations in neuronal networks but with the corresponding covariance matrices. 9.2. Enhancing computational power via exploring the tensor product representation In the situation under analysis, the rates of signaling within each of networks S 1 , S 2 are high, but the rate of the direct signaling between the neurons in S 1 and S 2 is relatively low. The utility of exploring the S 1 ⊕ S 2 representation is practically equal to the utility of separate exploring of S 1 and S 2 . On the other hand, the utility of exploring the S 1 ⊗ S 2 representation can be very high -in the case of strong inter-network correlations.</p><p>Where does the utility of the S 1 ⊗ S 2 representation come from? How can the brain explore the inter-network correlations?</p><p>To answer this question, we refer to the studies presented in article <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> that compares the information processing in the brain with quantum inspired computation (QIC) 8 Such QIC analog-devices and algorithms implemented on classical digital computers utilize harmonic oscillations for the classical realization of qubit information units <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>. In paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> it was pointed out that "biological neuronal networks, particularly those found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, also exhibit oscillatory dynamics." Such dynamics was studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and enhancing of computational performance, sometimes by orders of magnitude, relative to known recurrence neuronal networks, was reported. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> this enhancing was coupled to the QIC features of functioning of neuronal networks. However, QIC by itself can't explain the origin of its computational power. QIC articles refer to the outputs of computations for concrete optimization problems as confirming QIC's computational power. QIC can only refer to analogy with quantum computations.</p><p>Exploring the S 1 ⊗ S 2 representation for the functioning of neuronal networks can help explain the enhanced computational performance observed in neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Moreover, this approach provides a justification for the over-performance of quantum information processing (QIC) by highlighting the generality of the mathematical framework presented in this article.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Concluding remarks</head><p>As noted, QL modeling is actively developing as a phenomenological approach. However, it strongly requires integration with brain functioning, specifically with the activity of networks of communicating neurons. In this article, we established the basics of such integration within the GPT model, which represents networks using ordered weighted graphs. These graphs are described by weight matrices that quantify the intensities of signaling between neurons. The graph-matrix GPT model (Model 1) has a classical state space -a polygon -and its QL properties are generated by the calculus of measurement instruments.</p><p>We presented several QL effects -such as the order, interference (disjunction), and non-repeatability effects -within the graph-matrix GPT model. The discussion of compound systems and correlated neuronal networks was brief, and we plan to explore the QL properties related to the entanglement of neuronal network states in a future publication.</p><p>In our studies, GPT emerged as a framework for bridging classical information processing in neural networks with the QL representations used in decision-making and cognitive psychology. Initially, we turned to GPT not to uncover cognitive effects beyond those described by standard QPT (Quantum Probability Theory) in complex Hilbert space, but because certain GPT models align more naturally with the matrix representation of correlations in real-valued signals, particularly in the case of neurons' firing patterns as random variables. Specifically, these matrices contain elements that are real numbers.</p><p>A notable feature of the particular GPT model we examined in detail (Model 1) is that, from a probability theory perspective, it is classical, with a state space that forms a polygon. Thus, while developing the neural-QL bridge, we also demonstrated that all the cognitive effects previously modeled within the QPT framework can, in fact, be reproduced using classical state GPT models. This is an important foundational insight: the distinction between classicality and quantumness is not solely determined by the nature of the state space. Instead, the essence of quantumness lies in measurement theory and the calculus of instruments. Our work shows that by applying the calculus of instruments to a classical polygon-like state space, we can account for key non-classical cognitive effects -effects that were previously modeled in QPT using a quantum state space based on complex Hilbert space. From this perspective, cognition appears to be less quantum than previously assumed in QL modeling -yet it remains non-classical when viewed through the lens of measurement theory.</p><p>A reader can be curios about comparing GPT and QPT in terms of novel cognitive effects that GPT can describe but QPT (with complex Hilbert space) cannot is well-founded. However, at this stage, we have not identified such effects. We hope that our work will attract the attention of experts in cognitive psychology, decision-making, and neuroscience, paving the way for future discoveries of novel effects and open problems in this area.</p><p>Regarding the question order effect (QOE) and the response replicability effect (RRE), sequential joint probability in CPT exhibits RRE but not QOE. Conversely, in QPT, sequential joint probability exhibits QOE if and only if it does not exhibit RRE <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">99]</ref>. Therefore, to reconcile QOE and RRE, a new theoretical framework beyond both CPT and QPT is required.</p><p>We have demonstrated that such a model exists within the framework of GPT or through QPT combined with instrument theory for state updates <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">99]</ref>. GPT provides a general structure for observables (encompassing both QPT and CPT) and describes state updates using the concept of instruments, as introduced by Davies and Lewis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and developed by Ozawa <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[88]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[92]</ref>. Thus, GPT is not merely the union of QPT and CPT but extends beyond them.</p><p>The instrument theory in GPT is emerged to fill the above gaps in both probability theories, QPT and CPT. In fact, non-invasive measurements cannot be studied in QPT, and our Model 1 cannot be described neither in QPT, nor in the standard CPT.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A conceptual representation of the multi-level complexity of neuronal computation within a cortical area.

SinceP (A = α, B ∈ R ω) = P (A = α ω {B∈R} ) and P (A = α|B = β ω) = P (A = α ω {B=β} ), the classical Bayesian update is concurrent with the quantum Bayesian stateupdateω {B∈R} −→ ω {B=β} .Therefore, the quantum state update ω −→ ω {B=β} is explained as the composition of the non-selective quantum state changeω −→ ω {B∈R} = J B (R)ωcaused by the measuring interaction, described by the non-selective stateupdate map J B (R) of the instrument J B , and the quantum Bayesian stateupdate ω {B∈R} −→ ω {B=β} . This point has been fully discussed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref> based on the "quantum Bayes principle". By using conditional probability we define the sequential joint probability P BA (β, α ω) = P (B = β ω)P (A = α|B = β ω) = u|J A (α)J B (β)ω .<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> </figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">It seems that the GPT approach may be more appealing to psychologists than the standard formalism borrowed from quantum physics. GPT is "cleansed" of the quantum mysteries and prejudices, offering a more straightforward general mathematical framework that describes probabilities in all kinds of observations-whether physical, cognitive, social, or financial.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">So, we do not consider multigraphs. A multigraph can contain multiple edges going in the same direction between vertices. But any neuron has only one output -via axon. Multigraphs can be employed in more complex models of signaling in neural networks.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">In 2015, one of the co-authors (AKH) had extensive discussions in Vienna with Anton Zeilinger about possible applications of quantum theory to cognition. These discussions were prompted by Zeilinger's debates with the Dalai Lama on the relationship between spiritual and quantum mechanical phenomena. Zeilinger strongly advocated for generalized theories that are neither purely classical nor quantum. He also suggested that the ultimate QL theory of cognition might be so mathematically complex and exotic that the complex Hilbert formalism would no longer appear as advanced. However, this is not the case for the model proposed in this article, which is "less quantum" ("more classical") than traditional quantum mechanics.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">This is a good place to note that section 5 covers only the basic aspects of GPT, which are insufficient for describing other neuro-cognitive phenomena, such as contextuality . particularly "non-local contextuality." The latter arises</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8">What is QIC? See paper<ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref> on QIC: "The term "quantum-inspired" was introduced by Moore and Narayanan in the context of computing for the first time in 1995. The term was used to differentiate between two types of computational methods: "pure" quantum computation and quantum-inspired computation. The former is firmly rooted in quantum mechanical concepts, such as standing waves, interference, and coherence, and can only be executed on a quantum computer. On the other hand, "quantum-inspired" computing refers to practical methods that have been derived from these concepts. These methods do not require a quantum computer, but rather utilize classical computers or algorithms to simulate quantum effects and achieve computational advantages."</note>
