<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p>Noisy accumulation of evidence to a decision bound has proven to be an important and in uential concept within models of value-based and perceptual decisions in the social and biological sciences. This process is at the core of widely used sequential sampling models such as the drift di usion model (DDM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>), decision eld theory (MDFT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>), the leaky competing accumulators model (LCA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>), the association and accumulation model (AAM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>), the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>), and various others.</p><p>To date, most attempts to t this class of model to empirical data have assumed a constant evidence accumulation or drift rate throughout the choice process (e.g. the standard DDM or the LCA). The computational complexity and time required to t models that relax the assumption of a constant evidence accumulation rate have been key reasons for maintaining this assumption in most empirical applications. The rise in popularity of hierarchical Bayesian estimation methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> may have further dissuaded researchers from using time-varying drift rate models because Bayesian estimation using popular Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically requires an analytical solution for equations within the model in order to generate the posterior distribution within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>Bayesian data analytic methods have at least two bene ts for the decision sciences. First, Bayesian methods allow inference on the entire distribution of the parameters rather than just the most likely estimate as in methodologies based on maximum likelihood (MLE). These full distributions of parameters are useful because they provide a measure of the uncertainty in the parameters' values. This explicit uncertainty is useful in terms of both assessing the quality of model ts to data, and the interpretation of the parameters themselves. Second, hierarchical structures are e ciently embedded in the Bayesian framework in a readily interpreted manner. Standard modelling methodologies have to assume either complete independence in the data structure (i.e., as in single-subject MLE) or complete pooling (i.e., tting averaged data and implicitly assuming that all participants are identical) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. In contrast, hierarchical</p><p>Bayesian modelling implements a compromise between the two strategies allowing group and subject parameters to be estimated simultaneously at di erent hierarchical levels, thereby providing robust estimates of a model's free parameters without ignoring or over-weighting individual di erences. In other words, Bayesian models can allow for the more complete theoretical explanation of data from a single task, letting di erent people use di erent cognitive processes, or letting the same people use di erent processes at di erent times. However, as mentioned above, eciently generating the posterior distribution of the parameters with hierarchical Bayesian MCMC sampling methods is greatly facilitated when there is an analytical solution for equations within the model framework. Analytical solutions are not always possible to mathematically derive for models with time-varying evidence accumulation (i.e. drift) rates.</p><p>Although there are means of approximating the analytical solution for some types of time-varying drift rate DDMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, it is often theoretically and computationally challenging to estimate and implement such formulations.</p><p>Despite the added complexity of their estimation, time-varying drift rate models are important because there are many types of decision strategies and mechanisms that cannot be modeled with a xed drift rate. Examples of sequential sampling models in the existing literature that have a time-varying drift rate are, the attentional drift di usion model (aDDM), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, the dual-stage two-phase (DSTP) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the piecewise linear ballistic accumulator (pLBA), <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and the relative starting-time drift di usion model (stDDM), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. All of the models listed above share the fact that they do not have completely time-dependent drift rates in the sense of a linear or quadratic relation to time. Instead the drift rate in all of these models is time-constant in xed or alternating intervals, i.e. it is piecewise time-constant. Critically, if the intervals are known, then di usion models with piecewise time-constant drift rates (pcDDM) can be re-written as standard drift di usion models (DDM) for which the drift rate is constant in time using simple algebra. Here, we show how a simple, yet powerful, piecewise constant averaging method allows for the use of existing hierarchical Bayesian estimation tools that were developed for the standard DDM to t the time-varying drift rates of any DDM for which we can compute the average drift rate over an observable period of time. The advantage of using well-establish standard DDM methodologies can be found in the faster speed of estimation and in the simplicity of implementation when compared to other methods such as the martingales method <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or the probability density approximation (PDA) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we illustrate how to transform a pcDDM into a standard DDM with a fully time-constant drift rate.</p><p>We will show that a piecewise time-constant drift rate can be expressed as a constant drift that is a function of the rst passage time -i.e reaction time -and the times for each constant interval. We also walk through two concrete examples of how to apply this methodology. We derive the piecewise time-constant drift for the aDDM and for the stDDM, and implement these drifts in a hierarchical Bayesian DDM estimation framework implemented in R and JAGS.</p><p>We then show the recovery tting analysis of the two models to demonstrate that 1) we accurately recover the timevarying parameters through this reparameterization of the standard DDM, and 2) that the estimates of the other DDM parameters are not adversely a ected by the inclusion of these extra parameters for the drift rate. Lastly, we report the parameter estimates from two piecewise-constant drift di usion models and show goodness of t measures for the experimental reaction time and choice distributions from two experiments in humans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| RESULTS</head><p>We rst introduce the formulation of the standard drift di usion model (DDM) in its continuous version as an stochastic di erential equation (SDE) and a general piecewise time-constant drift di usion model (pcDDM) in a similar formulation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| General piecewise constant DDM (pcDDM)</head><p>As noted in the introduction section of the paper, some of the most prominent time-varying DDMs found in literature, e.g. the aDDM, do not have fully time-dependent drift rates, but rather have drift rates that are constant over discrete intervals. The continuous SDE of such a model (pcDDM) can be written as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dx (t ) = µ (t ) dt + dW (t ) x (0) = x 0 , µ (t ) = µ i , for t i  t &lt; t i +1 ⌧ = inf {t &gt; 0|x (t ) &lt; ( B, B) } (2)</formula><p>We can now see that the drift rate can be rewritten as follows when the intervals in which it is constant and the stopping time are explicitly speci ed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">µ (t ) = n 1 ' i =0 µ i ± [t i ,t i +1 ) (1) π ⌧ 0 µ (t )dt = π ⌧ 0 n 1 ' i =0 µ i ± [t i ,t i +1 ) (1)dt = n 1 ' i =0 π ⌧ 0 µ i ± [t i ,t i +1 ) (1)dt = n 1 ' i =0 π t i +1 t i µ i dt = ⌧ n 1 ' i =0 π t i +1 t i µ i dt ! 1 ⌧ = π ⌧ 0 d d⌧ " ⌧ n 1 ' i =0 π t i +1 t i µ i dt ! 1 ⌧ # dt = π ⌧ 0 1 ⌧ n 1 ' i =0 π t i +1 t i µ i dt ! dt (3)</formula><p>where n is the number of intervals, t 0 = 0 and t n = ⌧</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">µ (t ) = 1 ⌧ n 1 ' i =0 π t i +1 t i µ i dt = 1 ⌧ n 1 ' i =0 µ i (t i +1 t i )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Thus, if the rst passage time and the intervals are known, the time-continuous form of the pcDDM can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">dx (t ) =μ dt + dW (t ) x (0) = x 0 , µ = 1 ⌧ n 1 ' i =0 µ i (t i +1 t i ), ⌧ = inf {t &gt; 0|x (t ) &lt; ( B, B) }<label>(5)</label></formula><p>whereμ is a function of rst passage time ⌧, the number of intervals n and their duration t i +1 t i .</p><p>We, thus, demonstrated that the drift rate of a pcDDM when the intervals in which it is constant and the stopping time are explicitly known is equivalent to a constant drift rate that is the average in time of the original formulation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 1</ref> provides an illustration of two simulations of the aDDM, the model displayed by the black line has been simulated with the standard drift rate as in equation 6 and the red line shows a simulation of the aDDM with the average drift rate as derived above and in equation 7. Converting a piecewise-constant DDM into one with a constant slope allows us to derive the distribution of response times analytically rather than relying on numerical simulations, which in turn means that we can t Bayesian models using MCMC procedures in a reasonably small amount of time.</p><p>In the next section, we will show the drift rate formulaμ for two speci c example pcDDMs, the aDDM and the stDDM. F I G U R E 1 Evidence accumulation traces with time-varying drift rates versus a drift rate equal to the time-weighted average of the drift rates within each interval. The two plots show simulations of the attention drift di usion model (aDDM) with standard xation-location-dependent drift rate as in equation 6 (black line), and with a drift rate equal to the weighted average of the rates across all intervals as in equation 7 (red line). The blue vertical lines denote a change between intervals within which the evidence accumulation rate is constant. In the case of the aDDM, the end of an interval is marked by a change in xation from option B to the option A. a) In this example, both options receive the same amount of xation pattern. b) In this example, one option B is xated longer than the option A, resulting in a change in the outcome and the weighted average of the drift rate compared to a). The fact that we know 1) the time at which the evidence accumulation process reaches a threshold (i.e. the response time), and 2) the duration of each interval within which the drift rate is constant (i.e. xation locations and durations) for each trial means that one can compute the weighted average of the piecewise constant drift rates for each individual trial in a data set. Using these trial-speci c weighted averages, one can t a piecewise constant DDM as if it had entirely constant evidence accumulation using the closed form solution for constant drift rates instead of numerical simulation. Note that any parameter that in uences the piecewise constant drift rates will also in uence their weight average and thus parameters scaling the relative values of the two options or xation-dependent discounting can be optimized across trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">| aDDM</head><p>The aDDM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is an example of a modi ed version of a standard DDM for which the drift rate varies in time.</p><p>The basic idea of the model is that the drift rate changes every time the decision maker visually xates one option or another. The continuous aDDM formula is the following.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">dx (t ) = µ (t ) dt + dW (t ) x (0) = x 0 , µ (t ) = ( (V A ✓V B ) if option A is attended at time t (✓V A V B ) if option B is attended at time t ⌧ = inf {t &gt; 0|x (t ) &lt; ( B, B) }.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where ✓ is the discount factor that penalises the value of the unattended option, is the drift scaling parameter and V A and V B are the values of option A and B, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">| stDDM</head><p>The relative-starting-time DDM (stDDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is another example of a piecewise constant DDM for multi-attribute choices. This formulation of the DDM includes a relative-starting-time parameter that allows for one attribute to begin being considered before another. Other than that additional parameter, the model is a basic drift di usion model, in which the drift rate depends on the weighted value di erences of two attributes. This model can be used for di erent types of options that have two or more attributes, for example lotteries with money and probabilities or food items with healthiness and palatability attributes. The key idea of the model is that one of the two attributes might have some delay in entering the accumulation process relative to the other. For instance, a decision maker that has to choose between a salad and a chocolate cake might immediately think about the delicious taste of the cake compared to the salad, and only after half a second start to consider the fact that the chocolate cake would be a far less healthy option.</p><p>The continuous formulation of the stDDM can be written as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">dx (t ) =μ dt + dW (t ) x (0) = x 0 , µ (t ) = 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : w T VD T if s &gt; 0^0 &lt; t &lt; s w H VD H if s &lt; 0^0 &lt; t &lt; |s | w H VD H + w T VD T if t &gt; |s | ⌧ = inf {t &gt; 0|x (t ) &lt; ( B, B) }<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where w T is the weight given attribute T, w H the weight attribute H (T and H being any two attributes), VD T and VD H are the value di erences in attributes T and H respectively, s is time at which attribute H comes into the accumulation processs &gt; 0 means T-related evidence is accumulated from the beginning and evidence from attribute H comes into consideration at time s, while s &lt; 0 means that attribute H in uences the accumulation process from the beginning and evidence from attribute T starts to come in at time |s |.</p><p>Once again, knowing the stopping time ⌧ and explicitly specifying a relative starting time s, we can determine the average rate as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">dx (t ) =μ dt + dW (t ) µ = 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : s ⌧ w T VD T + ⌧ s ⌧ (w H VD H + w T VD T ) if s &gt; 0^s &lt; ⌧ |s | ⌧ w H VD H + ⌧ |s | ⌧ (w H VD H + w T VD T ) if s &lt; 0^|s | &lt; ⌧ w T VD T if s &gt; 0^s &gt; ⌧ w H VD H if s &lt; 0^|s | &gt; ⌧ ⌧ = inf {t &gt; 0|x (t ) &lt; ( B, B) }<label>(9)</label></formula><p>In summary, we have shown that both the aDDM and the stDDM can be written as a standard DDM for which the drift rate is a function of the reaction time and the duration of the constant intervals (i.e. relative xation time advantage or relative starting time advantage) in a given choice or trial. The advantage of this formulation is that we have an analytical solution for the pcDDMs that is identical to the analytical solution of the DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Thus, a hierarchical Bayesian approach can now be easily applied to this type of model. Here, we implement the piecewise constant averaging method described above within a hierarchical Bayesian estimation framework giving us the hierarchical Bayesian attention drift di usion model (HaDDM) and the hierarchical Bayesian relative-start-time DDM (HstDDM). We coded the HaDDM and the HstDDM in JAGS using equations 7 and 9 above, and performed recovery tting analysis in R (see the Methods section for details and https://github.com/galombardi/ for the full code). All the simulations were performed with the Euler method as standard practice in the eld.</p><p>Below, we report and discuss tests of the parameter recovery accuracy for both models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">| Recovery tting analysis</head><p>To further assess and demonstrate the validity of this method in practical terms, we performed a parameter recovery analysis for the HaDDM and the HstDDM. The aim of this recovery tting analysis was twofold. Firstly, it shows the ability of the method to recover di erent parameter combinations at the individual and the group level and, in particular, that the mean of the posterior distributions from the recovery of each parameter is informative of the real generating values. Secondly, it shows that this tting method is able to recover di erent parameters for di erent individuals from the same population. We performed parameter recovery with two types of participant samples, A)</p><p>samples of participants with homogeneous parameters (i.e. identical for all individuals) so that we could test several di erent known combinations of parameters at the group level, and B) a participant sample with a heterogeneous distribution of parameters across individuals so that we could determine recovery accuracy at the individual level.</p><p>In the homogeneous sample tests, for both the HaDDM and the HstDDM, the sets of parameters we tested varied around the best tting parameter estimates from past ts to empirical data sets. For the heterogeneous samples, each of the parameters were randomly drawn from Gaussian distributions with a xed mean and standard deviation.</p><p>All simulations for both pcDDMs were performed with the number of subjects, trials, and value di erences taken from existing empirical data sets (see Methods section for details). Note, that each subject for our simulations di ers from the others in value di erence trials and, concerning the aDDM, in xation patterns (i.e., xation duration and proportion). Although the piece-wise constant averaging method can be used to t time-varying DDMs to existing data, one cannot use it to simulate new data. This is because the method requires us to know the response times and constant interval durations. Therefore, both models were simulated with the Euler method approximation, also known as the discrete bounded accumulation series as follows. The series for the aDDM is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x t i = x t i 1 + µ t i (t i t i 1 ) + ✏ t i p (t i t i 1 ) µ t i = ( (V A ✓V B ) if option A is attended at time t i (✓V A V B ) if option B is attended at time t i ⌧ = t N = min t i , [i 2 OE| |x t i | &gt; B .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The stDDM discrete bounded accumulation series is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">x t i = x t i 1 + µ t i (t i t i 1 ) + ✏ t i p (t i t i 1 ) ⌧ = t N = min t i , [i 2 OE| |x t i | &gt; B µ t i = 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : w T VD T if s &gt; 0^0 &lt; i &lt; s w H VD H if s &lt; 0^0 &lt; i &lt; |s | w H VD H + w T VD T if i &gt; |s |<label>(11)</label></formula><p>For all samples and versions of the di usion model, we tted a hierarchical Bayesian version of the model. Hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedures estimate the posterior distributions of each parameter at the individual and group levels using a speci ed hierarchical relationship (i.e. assuming that individual parameters are somewhat similar and drawn from a common distribution). This approach is more data e cient than estimating each individual separately because it allows for data sharing across individuals. The degree of assumed similarity between individuals, and thus regularization of the individual parameters toward the group mean, is determined by the priors used for the group-level parameters. Such methods allow one to make inference about the population distributions of the parameters, while explicitly accounting for variability due to individual di erences.</p><p>The next sections show that the piecewise constant averaging method was able to accurately estimate the parameters for both the HaDDM and the HstDDM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1">| HaDDM</head><p>We rst tested parameter recovery accuracy for the HaDDM using a We then con rmed that varying the attention discount factor ✓ does not in uence the recovery accuracy of the other parameters. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figures S1 and S2</ref>, we show the ability of the model to recover the generating and parameters respectively, varying the other two parameters. The piecewise constant averaging method is able to accurately recover all the various parameters. The correlations and the MSE at the level of were corr( ,ˆ ) = 0.99, corr( ,ˆ ) = 0.96, MSE( ) = 0.067, and MSE( ) = 0.003, respectively.</p><p>However, it is worth noting that there is a systematic overestimation of the drift scaling parameter on average (see also the regression models at the individual level in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>). A plausible explanation for this overestimation is the fact that the discrete bounded accumulation series we used to simulate data is a numerical approximation of the continuous analytical solution of the model used to t the parameters in the HaDDM. In other words, the bias we observe in the estimation may not be due to the piecewise constant averaging method itself, but rather is the result of an approximation error between the discrete bounded accumulation series we used to simulate the data and the analytical solution of the DDM speci ed as a continuous stochastic di erential equation.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we ran parameter recovery tests for the standard DDM using simulated choices and response times generated by either the discrete bounded accumulation series or the analytical solution of the continuous stochastic di erential equation in 1. We then estimated the best-tting parameters for these simulated data sets using the same hierarchical Bayesian method that we used to t the standard DDM to the initial empirical data to obtain the generating parameters for our simulations. We use the standard DDM to test this hypothesis because the piecewise constant averaging method requires us to know the duration of each interval and response time, and thus it cannot be used to generate choice outcomes and response times for simulated agents.</p><p>As predicted, we nd that, when choices are simulated with the bounded accumulated series, the drift rate scaling parameter in a standard DDM has the same systematic overestimation that we see for the aDDM (and in the stDDM reported in the next section). Critically, when the choice response times are simulated with the continuous version of the DDM as the generating model, the bias is signi cantly reduced, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S3</ref> and <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>.</p><p>Thus, these results indicate that much of the small bias stems from simulating the di usion models with the bounded accumulation series, which is a numerical approximation of the continuous time model. This small bias remains largely unchanged even when the step size in the numerical approximation is reduced from 1 to 0.01 ms.</p><p>Importantly, if the evidence accumulation process in humans or other animals operates in continuous time, then it will not be a source of bias. In any case, this bias is not problematic because it is a small, constant overestimation of the drift scaling parameter. That being the case, it does not interfere with our ability to distinguish di erences between individuals or groups. Detecting such di erences is generally the goal when tting DDMs because the magnitudes of individual parameter estimates have little meaning on their own.

In particular, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9d</ref> shows that the simulated and the empirical reaction time distributions conditional to the choice are strikingly similar. Note that the simulations were performed using the mean of the posterior distribution for each individual for all tted parameters. This suggests that the estimated , ✓, and parameters are reasonably accurate.</p><p>We ran an additional parameter recovery test after tting the lottery task data set because the estimated values of certain parameters were outside the range we included in the a priori recovery tests above. Speci cally, the posterior distribution of the parameter at the group level was outside of the range of values we used in the parameter recovery analysis in the previous section. The reason for the lower value of in these data is straightforward. The response times (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9d</ref>) in this particular lottery task experiment are slower than those in the food choice data upon which we based the parameter ranges in the parameter recovery analysis. Thus, the drift scaling parameters are estimated to be lower in the lottery choices to account for these slower RTs. Therefore, to make sure that lower drift scaling parameters do not a ect the ability of the model to recover the discount factor parameter, ✓, we ran another recovery tting analysis with the parameter values for and that we obtained when tting the model to the empirical data. We generated simulated choice data with the ✓ parameter set to {0.2, 0.4, 0.8} in order to check whether the model was able to accurately recover the three values of ✓ when was 1.2.

Before performing the food-choice task, participants had to rate all the 180 food items in the choice set for healthiness and tastiness (see Method section for details). Once again, we performed a con rmatory parameter recovery analysis similar to the one described for the aDDM above to make sure the model was able to return the true generating parameters for these speci c data (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 10b)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 11d</ref>-g shows the correlation between the simulated and the tted parameters for this recovery analysis, further supporting the ability of the method to recover the parameters for this speci c range of parameters and subjective option values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 12</ref> shows the results of tting the HstDDM to this food-choice task data set for the drift-related parameters (s, w h , w t , and ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">| DISCUSSION</head><p>Here, we have presented the explicit derivation of a method to mathematically express a pcDDM as a standard DDM given the response time and the interval times in which the drift rate of the pcDDM is constant. We provided two practical examples of pcDDMs, the aDDM and the stDDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, and derived their mathematical formulations as standard DDMs. However, we note that this method is applicable to any time-varying drift rate for which one can compute the average drift rate over an observable period of time. Thus, this approach generalizes to a wide class of drift di usion models.</p><p>We used several distinct parameter tting and recovery analyses to show that this piecewise constant averaging method was able to accurately estimate the parameters of the aDDM and stDDMs. The rst recovery analysis demonstrated the method for both the aDDM and the stDDM in their hierarchical Bayesian formulations was able to accurately estimate the di erent magnitudes of parameters at the group and individual levels in simulated data sets.</p><p>The second recovery analysis showed that the method could accurately recover known heterogeneous individual-level parameters within the hierarchical Bayesian models. Finally, the last set of analyses showed the behavioral patterns in experimental data sets that we used as case studies could be accurately captured by the piecewise constant averaging method and that we could accurately recover the estimated empirical parameters.</p><p>Overall, all of the recovery tting parameter analyses proved to be successful for both the HaDDM and the HstDDM with a high degree of accuracy. Speci cally, we could apply this parameter estimation method to the two experimental data sets and show that the HaDDM and the HstDDM reproduced the choice and response time distributions well in both cases. Thus, the piecewise constant averaging method proved to be a simple, yet powerful, method that allows existing hierarchical Bayesian estimation tools developed for the standard DDM to also estimate the time-varying drift rate of pcDDMs. These ndings are consistent with those of Cavanagh and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, who tested di erent hypotheses about how visual xations in uence the DDM drift rate using a form of piecewise constant averaging in combination with a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. We also showed how fast the model can be t to experimental data of typical size. We believe this method will allow researchers not familiar with computational modelling to accurately t typical experimental data sets. Nevertheless, we argue that any model tting procedure applied to new data sets, even when methods or models have been tested to be robust and consistent in the eld, should be used with caution, and few quality assurance steps should be followed rigorously before making any inference on the tted parameters.</p><p>Running parameter recovery tests for the values estimated from a given empirical data set is good practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. It is especially important when dealing with data from novel experimental paradigms. It is often mathematically and computationally challenging to determine a priori all the potential combinations of parameter's values for which the model (or the tting method) is not able to properly t the data or return the true generating parameters. For instance, a low signal to noise ratio certainly a ects the ability to accurately recover parameters, but what is "low" exactly?</p><p>Further, a narrow range of value di erences between choice options could a ect the ability of a di usion model to t the data and derive the generating parameters, but what is a "good" or a "bad" range? Answering these questions with satisfactory precision is not trivial, and therefore, running a posteriori parameter recovery checks is best practice.</p><p>The rst step in such a recovery test is to check the ability of the model and tting procedure to recover relevant known generating parameters. This can be done by simulating the data with the parameters obtained when originally tting the empirical data, and then re-tting the model to the simulated choice and response times. However, it is also possible that the recovery tting fails by always returning the same parameters independently of the generating values. Therefore, success in this rst step does not ensure you against this aw in the model or tting procedures.</p><p>Thus, a necessary second step is to make sure that the model and tting procedures are able to accurately distinguish between di erent generating parameter values. Speci cally, for the second recovery testing step, all the simulating parameters but one are taken from the tting of the empirical data as in the rst step. The one remaining parameter is then varied across a range of plausible values that you want to test. This procedure ensures that the model can recover di erent magnitudes of that speci c parameter of interest under the real data conditions, i.e. all the other parameters equal to the originally estimated values. Ideally, this second testing step would be run for each parameter in the model. At minimum, it should be run for all parameters of interest in a given study.</p><p>To conclude, we have shown that the piecewise constant averaging method is a simple, fast, general, and robust way to t time-varying drift di usion models within existing hierarchical Bayesian estimation frameworks. There has been a substantial increase in the postulation and application of time-varying sequential sampling models in recent years. Their ability to incorporate and quantify the e ects of visual attention and other cognitive processes on decision outcomes makes them a useful advance over models that assume a constant rate of evidence accumulation. We hope that this tutorial on tting such models in a simple, fast, and robust fashion will facilitate further application and re nement of time-varying DDMs in the decision sciences. di erent probabilities were used in the study, such that the probability of winning in a given trial was either 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90%. The expected outcomes, i.e. expected value (EV), of sure and gamble options were always equivalent in each trial. However, the EV varied across trials from 3 to 90 CHF (approximately 3 -90 USD).</p><p>The sure and the gamble options on the screen were represented through partially or completely lled rectangles and pie-charts. The proportion of the rectangles lled with color indicated the amount of money that the subject could keep from the starting amount, while the proportion of the pie charts lled with color represented probabilities (e.g. the sure option always had a pie-chart completely lled with a color). Before performing the choice task, subjects went through a training task to learn the meaning of rectangles and pie-charts.</p><p>In the second phase of the experiment, the participants performed a certainty equivalence (CE) elicitation task in which they were shown all the 70 gambles that they encountered during the choice task. In each trial, for a total of 70 trials, a gamble and a list of sure amounts of money was shown to the participant. The subject had to make 10 decisions in each trial between the gamble displayed on the left hand-side of the screen and 10 sure amounts of money. The sure amounts of money were displayed in decreasing order from a maximum value smaller but close to the amount of money that they could win if they choose the gamble, to a minimum value close to zero. For instance, a gamble can be described as follows. You rst receive an endowment of 100 CHF and you have a probability of 70% of keeping all the 100 CHF (30% of receiving nothing). In the rst line, the participant had to decide between the gamble and a sure amount of 95 CHF. In the second line, she had to decide between the gamble and a sure amount of 85 CHF, and so on until the last line in which she had to choose between the gamble and a sure amount of money of 5 CHF.</p><p>The CE was calculated as the mean between the two amounts of money where the subject switches from choosing the sure amount to choosing the gamble. Thus, in the example above, if a participant chooses the sure amounts of money for every decision lines until 55 CHF, and she chooses the gamble from 45 CHF on, the CE for this gamble is 50 CHF. Participants were only allowed to switch from choosing the sure amount to choosing the gamble a maximum of once per trial -including the possibility of never switching, i.e. always choosing the gamble or always choosing the sure amount.</p><p>All tasks were programmed in Matlab 2015b (Matworks), using the Psychophysics Toolbox extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Task. The experimental design was divided into two parts: a rating phase and a decision phase. During the rating phase participants rated 180 food items for healthiness and tastiness on a continuous scale with the anchors -5 (bad)</p><p>to 5 (good). The food items were shown to the subjects as images on the computer screen with a rating bar below one at the time. After the ratings, subjects performed a binary food-choice task consisting of 60 trials in which two food items were presented on the computer screen and they had to choose the food that they would like to receive at the end of the experiment. Before starting the food-choice task, participants read through a health agreement form in which the bene ts of eating healthy were explained and in which subjects were asked to try to make healthy choices during the following food-choice task. After reading the form, subjects had to express their willingness to try to eat, i.e. choose, healthier foods by check-marking the yes or no option on the health agreement form. Participation in the study and receipt of the monetary and food compensation were not conditional on agreeing to try and make healthy choices. However, subjects who were not willing to try to eat healthy were subsequently excluded from the data analysis.</p></div>

The drift di usion model (DDM) and other types of sequential sampling models have proven to be useful ways of quantifying and characterizing individual di erences and the e ects of experimental manipulations on various types of behavior in humans and other animals. To date, partially for the sake of simplicity, most modeling studies have assumed a constant rate of evidence accumulation when tting the data and testing theoretical predictions. Nevertheless, there are a growing number of theories and empirical data that suggest that evidence accumulation rates may vary within the time course of a decision because of changes in attention, arousal, goals, or other factors. Fitting a DDM with a time-varying evidence accumulation rate can be much more computationally demanding and time consuming than tting the standard DDM if there is no analytical solution for the timevarying DDM. Here, we demonstrate how to mathemati-cally reformulate an in uential subset of time-varying DDMs into standard DDMs with constant drift rates. This simple yet powerful reformulation allows time-varying DDMs with piecewise-constant drift rates to be easily and rapidly estimated within existing hierarchical Bayesian frameworks.</figDesc></figure>

For each subject in the simulated groups, we randomly drew the parameters from gaussian distributions around a speci c mean. The means and distributions of the generating parameters are shown in gure S5b.

We ran 30 subjects with 70 trials each as a time baseline and measured the time increase when doubling number of trials, number of subjects or both. To estimate group-level and individual parameters in a data set of 30 subjects with 70 trials each, took 4522 seconds -about 75 minutes. When increasing the number of trials to 140 the time did not double, but only increased to 4789 seconds -about 80 minutes. When increasing the number of subjects to 60 -with 70 trials each -the time increased to 6472 seconds -about 108 minutes.

Six of them were excluded from the experiment because they failed to understand the choice task based on a priori performance criteria for the comprehension questions. Subjects received monetary compensation for their participation, were informed about all aspects of the experiment and gave written informed consent. The experiments conformed to the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Human Subjects Committee of the University of Zürich approved the experimental protocol. Task. The experimental design was divided into two main parts: a decision phase and an elicitation phase. During this decision phase, participants completed 70 trials in which they made lottery decisions between a sure option and a gamble. At the beginning of each trial the participant was presented with a monetary endowment (e.g. 'You receive 50 CHF'). Ten di erent starting amounts were used in the experiment (from 10 CHF to 100 CHF with an increment of 10 CHF). To move on to the decision screen, the participants had to xate for 2 seconds on the received monetary amount, which appeared in the centre of the screen after the choice was indicated. After the outcome xation period was completed, a new trial began with a sure option and a gamble appearing on the screen. The sure option was presented as an amount of money retained from the starting amount (e.g. keep 20 CHF out of a total of 50 CHF). The gamble option always o ered the chance to keep all of the starting amount of money with some probability. Seven</figDesc></figure>

Choice trials with no gaze time on any option attribute were excluded from the analysis (17 trials, 0.004% of the pooled data from the 30 subjects).| Food-choice taskSubjects. Ninety-seven healthy subjects participated in this experiment. Eleven of them were excluded from the experiment because they either failed the questionnaire about the choice task -i.e. understanding the task, or because they did not comply with the health agreement (described below).

For each parameter combination in the aDDM, we simulated 30 agents that each faced 70 trials of unique subjective values and xation patterns.
