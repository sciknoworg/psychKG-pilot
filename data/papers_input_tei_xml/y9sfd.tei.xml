<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>findings on the use of holistic and mechanical combination <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Ryan &amp; Sackett, 1987</ref>). Yet, professionals nowadays seem to increasingly interact with algorithmic solutions, both in everyday life and in high-stakes decision making about individuals. For example, algorithms may score game-based assessments and asynchronous interviews, scrape social media profiles, and give hiring recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gonzalez et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Landers &amp; Behrend, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Landers &amp; Sanchez, 2022)</ref>. Therefore, it is also possible that the use of algorithms to make selection decisions has increased over time, which warrants an updated investigation of how selection decisions are made in practice.</p><p>Another aim was to identify factors that could promote algorithm use, assuming that algorithm use today is not optimal yet. To achieve these aims, we surveyed decision makers involved in personnel selection (reported below in Study 1 and 2, respectively) and organized two focus groups with I-O, educational, and clinical psychologists (Study 3). We invited decision makers with different backgrounds since the superiority of mechanical over holistic methods and algorithm aversion has been observed in virtually all social science fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grove et al., 2000)</ref>. Our goal with these studies was to identify existing phenomena about how practitioners combine information <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eronen &amp; Bringmann, 2021</ref>) based on current attitudes and practical problems identified by practitioners regarding algorithm use, which is an essential, but often overlooked first step to theory development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berkman &amp; Wilson, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ployhart &amp; Bartunek, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Holistic and Mechanical Prediction</head><p>When the aim of combining information is prediction -as it is in selection -, holistic and mechanical combination is also referred to as holistic and mechanical prediction. In holistic prediction, information is combined in the decision-maker's mind. In mechanical prediction, the same information is combined through an algorithm in the same way for all cases. While mechanical prediction is fully consistent and reproducible, holistic prediction is not; decision makers do not consistently use the same weights across applicants <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grove et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kuncel et al., 2013)</ref>. Algorithms can vary from very simple additive formulas with only a few variables to more complex machine learning approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fokkema et al., 2015)</ref>. An example of a simple algorithm is to assign equal weights (i.e., unit weights, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bobko et al., 2007)</ref> to, for example, a test score and an interview rating, to add up the resulting scores, and to hire the highest scoring candidate(s). Yet, weights can also differ and can also be based on, for example, regression analyses, meta-analytic estimates, or even expert judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kuncel, 2018)</ref>. Alternatively, weights may be obtained by regressing decision-makers' holistic predictions on the predictors, which is also called "model of man" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goldberg, 1970)</ref> or judgmental bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Armstrong, 2001)</ref>. So, algorithms neither have to be complex 'black boxes' nor be directly derived from data analysis. They can be simple, transparent, and designed by practitioners based on their knowledge. Such practitioner-designed algorithms can still outperform holistic prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Yu &amp; Kuncel, 2020)</ref>, as do simple algorithms with unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Sackett et al., 2017)</ref> or even random weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dawes, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Yu &amp; Kuncel, 2020)</ref>, given that predictors do not differ substantially in validity.</p><p>Although often argued by practitioners, holistic and mechanical prediction cannot be used simultaneously, as one cannot both hire and reject the same candidate when the two methods disagree (for an example, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grove &amp; Meehl, 1996)</ref>. However, they can be used sequentially for the same prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sawyer, 1966)</ref>. In clinical synthesis, the decision maker makes a holistic prediction based on the collected information and an algorithm's prediction.</p><p>In mechanical synthesis, the decision maker considers the collected information and makes a holistic prediction. This holistic prediction is subsequently multiplied by a fixed weight and algorithmically combined with all other information. Clinical synthesis classifies as holistic prediction since the final prediction is made holistically. Correspondingly, mechanical synthesis classifies as mechanical prediction, since the final prediction is derived algorithmically and hence consistently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Prevalence of Holistic and Mechanical Prediction in Practice</head><p>Publications that reported anecdotal experiences suggest that holistic combination is predominantly used in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arkes, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grove &amp; Meehl, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Highhouse, 2008</ref>). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, only a few surveys exist on the use of holistic and mechanical methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Ryan and Sackett (1987)</ref> surveyed 163 members of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology and found that only a small minority (2.5%) used mechanical prediction in individual assessments. Other respondents reported combining information purely holistically (55.7%) or using clinical synthesis (41.8%). More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ryan et al. (2015)</ref> surveyed 1197 human resource (HR) professionals from several countries on their test use and found that 43% indicated combining test scores and interview ratings in a standardized manner, although it is unclear how 'standardized' was defined or interpreted.</p><p>So, despite the robust research findings on evidence-based selection and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kuncel et al., 2013)</ref>, our knowledge on how information is combined in practice is scarce and outdated or primarily anecdotal <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Grove &amp; Meehl, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Ryan &amp; Sackett, 1987)</ref>. This is surprising, given that surveys on what assessment instruments are used to collect information are abundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Furnham, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jackson et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">König et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mann &amp; Chowhan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Piotrowski &amp; Armstrong, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Risavy et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Zibarras &amp; Woods, 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research question 1: How do decision makers combine information in practice?</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors Related to Algorithm Aversion</head><p>Various factors related to algorithm aversion in human performance prediction have been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Neumann et al., 2021)</ref>. Studies based on self-determination theory generally showed that algorithm use is higher when decision makers retain autonomy in mechanical combination, either by self-designing the algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Nolan &amp; Highhouse, 2014)</ref> or by being able to holistically adjust predictions from a prescribed algorithm (clinical synthesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dietvorst et al., 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, mechanical methods in which decision makers retain autonomy can result in more valid performance predictions than pure holistic combination <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dietvorst et al., 2018;</ref>.</p><p>In line with attribution theory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Nolan et al. (2016)</ref> found that decision makers were less likely to use an algorithm as a result of concerns about negative perceptions of stakeholders (e.g., colleagues or management) and the fear of losing professional status.</p><p>Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Diab et al. (2011)</ref> showed that laypeople considered algorithms to be less useful and more unprofessional, impersonal, and insufficient, compared to holistic prediction. Yet, another study showed that watching a short educational video on holistic and mechanical prediction increased algorithm use and hence prediction accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Neumann, Hengeveld, et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>In a sample of HR professionals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lodato et al. (2011)</ref> found that an experiential decision-making style (i.e., a preference for making general judgments based on feelings) correlated positively and strongly with a preference for holistic prediction in selection procedures. In contrast, experience in HR management (in years), the possession of a certification as a senior HR professional and organization size were negatively and weakly correlated with a preference for holistic prediction. Furthermore, the frequency of reading work-related academic journals had a negligible but negative relationship with a preference for holistic prediction, although this small effect may have resulted from not defining the term "academic journals" in the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lodato et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, various factors that may be related to algorithm aversion were sometimes derived from theory and mostly tested in experimental study designs. Yet, the perspective of practitioners on algorithm aversion has rarely been entertained in earlier studies, although this is also important for identifying factors related to algorithm aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ployhart &amp; Bartunek, 2019</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm Appreciation</head><p>Compared to algorithm aversion, we know little about when and why decision makers appreciate algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Logg et al., 2019)</ref>. Research on assessment instrument choices showed that validity/effectiveness, efficiency, fairness, and face validity were the most important factors why organizations employ tests in selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ryan et al., 2015)</ref>. We expected that these factors also relate to (not) using algorithms. Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lodato et al. (2011)</ref> found that experience, reading the academic literature, and possessing a certification were negatively yet weakly related to holistic prediction, we also aimed to investigate if these characteristics relate to algorithm use. We expected that obtaining a license and reading up on the superiority of algorithms in the academic literature should increase knowledge and hence algorithm use <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Neumann, Hengeveld, et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, we also explored the relation between experience and algorithm use since some evidence suggests that it is negatively related to algorithm use and prediction accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arkes et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Logg et al., 2019)</ref>, likely due to overconfidence of experienced decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arkes et al., 1986)</ref>. So, given that practitioner-insights regarding algorithm aversion and appreciation are largely lacking, compared to insights from top-down research based on theory and experimental designs, we had the following research question:</p><p>Research question 2: Why do decision makers (not) use algorithms in practice? 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Encouraging Algorithm Use in Practice</head><p>2 Compared to the pre-registration, we rephrased the research question to cover algorithm appreciation.</p><p>Based on existing surveys, we expected that algorithms are underutilized. Therefore, we conducted focus groups to (1) explore reasons for algorithm aversion in more depth than is possible with surveys and (2) explore what decision makers need to apply algorithms in practice more often.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research question 3:</head><p>What do decision makers need to apply algorithms more often?</p><p>For the two standardized surveys and the focus group study reported below, the preregistrations, raw data, codebooks, R scripts, and study materials are available on https://osf.io/v3thf/?view_only=db9ed843dc3b43e6877c37341204dbb5</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We obtained a convenience sample via LinkedIn. This platform is typically used for survey research among practitioners involved in selection decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jackson et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ryan et al., 2015)</ref>. The first author distributed the online questionnaire in a German organization's private LinkedIn group whose mission is to bridge the science-practice gap, and whose members are interested in evidence-based assessment in personnel selection.</p><p>Members of the private LinkedIn group are either members of the "recruiting rebels" organization who have paid an annual membership fee of 49€ or are potentially interested in becoming a member. Furthermore, we asked LinkedIn group members to share the survey link with other eligible decision makers who were not part of the LinkedIn group.</p><p>We only included participants who reported that they were involved in at least five hiring decisions in the last two years, through making (part of) the hiring decision or providing consultation to others who made the decision. One participant who indicated to be younger than 18 was excluded. In total, we obtained usable data from N = 93 3 participants (54% female) who ranged in age from 25 to 60 (M = 38.2, SD = 9.4). The sample was primarily German (95%) and 54% of the participants were part of the organization's private LinkedIn group. The other participants had other European nationalities. Most participants held a Bachelor's or Master's degree (88%), mostly in psychology, HR management, or business (69%). Furthermore, participants' mean organizational tenure was 6.5 (SD = 7.9) and role tenure was 4.1 (SD = 5.1). The mean number of years participants were involved in making hiring decisions was 9.8 (SD = 7.6). Additional demographic information can be found in Supplement S1, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>. The median survey completion time was 13 minutes. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> depicts the survey flow. Participants reported their experience and indicated whether they use more than one source (i.e., assessment instrument) to obtain information about applicants. Those who indicated using only one source (n = 1) were asked why, and what source they use. Participants who indicated using multiple sources (n = 92) reported how frequently (1 = never, 5 = always) they use several methods to combine information, and which method they use most often (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>; results from Study 1 and Study 2 are also included in this Table, but are further discussed in the results sections below). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We had pre-registered to collect data from minimally N = 171 participants who report not always using mechanical prediction, to achieve a desired margin of error for observed proportions. Furthermore, the results from an a priori power analysis showed that, for a regression model given five predictors, α = .05, 1-β = .80, and R 2 = .09, N = 136 participants would be needed. We reposted the survey link several times and explicitly asked key organizational members to share the link with their network. After a prolonged time of no additional survey completions, we had to stop the data collection, which lasted from April to October 2021.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>The Survey Flow in Study 1  Participants who reported that they do not always use an algorithm (decision strategy 4</p><p>in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, n = 86) selected pre-listed reasons why they do not always use an algorithm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). This list was derived from theories that have been tested in the context of algorithm aversion in selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Neumann et al., 2021)</ref>, reasons that have been mentioned in position papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arkes, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grove &amp; Meehl, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Highhouse, 2008)</ref>, and other reasons that we encountered during earlier conversations with decision makers. Participants could also report additional, other reasons via a text field. Participants who reported always using algorithms (decision strategy 4, 6, or 8 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, n = 6) were asked to select pre-listed reasons why they do so. This list was based on factors that explain the use of different data collection methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(König et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ryan et al., 2015)</ref>. However, the relationship between these factors and data combination methods has not been studied before. Those who indicated using a decision strategy that in some form includes an algorithm (decision strategy 4, 6, or 8 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, n = 50) to some extent (i.e., more often than "never") selected pre-listed approaches of how they construct their algorithm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). This list was composed of approaches to mechanical data combination as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kuncel's (2018)</ref> taxonomy. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kuncel (2018)</ref> distinguished between unit weights, criterion-derived weights (weights based on empirical results from regression analyses, previous meta-analyses, or zero-order correlations), and bootstrapped weights. We did not include a combination method based on bootstrapped weights because we have never observed this combination method in practice and because we expected that participants would not understand this answer option without adding an extensive explanation that would have substantially lengthened the survey. Although not explicitly included in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kuncel's (2018)</ref> taxonomy, weights can also be directly chosen by decision makers. This choice can be based on gut feeling or knowledge of the scientific literature. We call this approach 'judgmental weighting'.</p><p>Furthermore, participants who indicated using multiple sources reported whether they quantify information obtained from each source, because mechanical prediction requires quantified information. Moreover, all participants indicated how frequently they consult several sources (e.g., other professionals, academic or professional literature) to obtain information about how to best make hiring decisions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>), and whether they possess an assessment license (German DIN 33430).</p><p>Lastly, after reading an explanation on the distinction between holistic and mechanical prediction, participants indicated for each of three fictitious hiring scenarios whether information was combined holistically, mechanically, or whether they could not tell without further information. These "knowledge check" items were administered to investigate whether participants understood the distinction between holistic and mechanical prediction. The items were administered at the end of the survey to avoid potentially socially desirable answers on questions regarding how decision makers typically combine information.  Note. 1 = never or rarely, 2 = a few times per year, 3 = about once a month, 4 = several times per month, 5 = almost daily. We gave slightly different examples of the professional HR literature and the popular magazines than presented in this Table in Study 1, given that our sample in Study 1 was primarily German. The exact examples can be found in the study materials on OSF, https://osf.io/v3thf/?view_only=db9ed843dc3b43e6877c37341204dbb5</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>All but one participant reported using multiple sources to obtain information about applicants. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the mean frequency ratings and the number of participants who indicated using a given method most often, for each combination method. We collapsed these methods into the two holistic and mechanical meta-categories by averaging participants' frequency responses to combination method 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and 4, 6, and 8, respectively (see the participants who reported using some form of holistic prediction most often (n = 80), 55%</p><p>reported making predictions in a team discussion, while 31% reported making holistic predictions individually. Moreover, 14% reported using clinical synthesis (combination method 5 and 7), mostly in the form of multi-stage selection. That is, first selecting applicants who pass pre-determined cutoffs and then selecting among the final candidates based on one's own judgment. Among participants who used some form of mechanical prediction most often (n = 12), 75% reported that they first select applicants who pass pre-determined cutoffs and then use a pre-determined algorithm to make final hiring decisions.</p><p>Furthermore, most participants indicated that they do not quantify all obtained information (70%). We also asked participants who reported not always using some form of mechanical prediction (n = 86) why (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). The most common reason was that participants cannot or do not want to quantify all information (35%). Other frequently reported reasons were that algorithms are unavailable (30%) and not accepted by stakeholders (e.g., supervisors and colleagues, 24%). Furthermore, participants believed that using an algorithm together with one's own judgment would result in the most valid decisions (21%).</p><p>Moreover, 14% indicated not knowing that mechanical prediction is more valid than holistic prediction. Less frequently mentioned reasons were that using algorithms would reduce one's perceived competence (5%) and professional status (3%). Moreover, no participant was concerned that using an algorithm would be against the law. Mentioned reasons not pre-listed in the survey were that other decision makers can veto decisions in a group discussion (n = 4), and that algorithms, or selection in general, would be unnecessary due to a lack of applicants (n = 5). To investigate when decision makers appreciate algorithms, we asked those who always use an algorithm why. Yet, only six participants reported always using an algorithm.</p><p>Therefore, no specific results on that subsample are reported.</p><p>Participants who indicated using some form of mechanical prediction at all (n = 50)</p><p>were also asked how they construct their algorithm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). The most common way was by means of discussion with experts/professionals (42%). Other common strategies were to design an algorithm based on scientific research (meta-analyses or primary scientific studies, 34%) or based on one's own knowledge and expertise, without consulting the scientific literature or others (32%). Some participants also indicated that they use an algorithm as prescribed by others (e.g., by their organization or professional standards, 28%) or that they base their algorithm on statistical analyses of data from their organization, or other relevant data (24%). Unit weighting was the least common way (10%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information Sources</head><p>Participants reported that they most frequently obtain information on how to best make selection decisions by consulting other HR professionals (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>). Similarly, blogs, videos, websites, and popular magazines such as Harvard Business Review were frequently consulted. Compared to these sources, participants consulted the academic literature (e.g.,</p><p>Journal of Applied Psychology) less frequently. Moreover, scientists and external consultants were rarely consulted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge Check</head><p>After reading the explanation of holistic and mechanical prediction, 32% out of all participants who obtained a college degree (n = 87) indicated that holistic and mechanical prediction was discussed in their studies. Afterwards, participants indicated for three fictitious hiring scenarios whether the information was combined holistically, mechanically, or whether they cannot tell without further information. Out of all participants, 43% answered all three "knowledge check" items correctly, while 77% answered at least two items correctly. At least one item was answered correctly by 95% of all participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Characteristics</head><p>Means, standard deviations, and Spearman's rank correlations among study variables are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>. We computed Spearman's rank correlations instead of Pearson's correlation coefficient because the variables "mechanical prediction" and "experience (in years)" were positively skewed. As expected based on Lodato's et al. <ref type="formula">2011</ref>results, we also found that reading the academic literature and possessing an assessment license were significantly positively yet weakly to moderately related to using mechanical prediction methods (r = .26 and .25, respectively). In contrast, experience in making hiring decisions (measured in years and the amount of decisions made) and organization size showed negligible relationships with using mechanical methods. We also fitted a regression model with mechanical prediction as the dependent variable and academic literature, assessment license, organization size, experience (in years), and experience (amount) as independent variables (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>). Together, the predictors explained 15% of the variance in the use of mechanical prediction methods (F(5, 86) = 3.05, p = .014, R 2 adj. = .10). To assess variable importance, we also computed relative importance weights using the relaimpo R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grömping, 2006)</ref>. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows, reading the academic literature and possessing an assessment license were the most important predictors. Based on the suggestion of an anonymous reviewer, we also fitted the same regression model with holistic prediction as the dependent variable (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>). Together, the predictors explained 15% of the variance in the use of mechanical prediction methods (F(5, 86) = 2.71, p = .026, R 2 adj. = .09). In line with expectations, reading the academic literature was negatively related to the use of holistic methods. All other predictors were not statistically significant. Organization size was measured on a five-point scale (1 = less than 100, 2 = 100 -499, 3 = 500 -1999, 4 = 2000 -4999, 5 = more than 5000).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>The aim of the second study was to replicate the results from Study 1 using a larger sample that was collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We displayed the different combination methods in random order, to prevent order effects. Furthermore, in Study 1, only six participants reported always using algorithms and hence selected reasons why. This subsample was too small for meaningful interpretation. Therefore, in Study 2, all participants who indicated using algorithms at all (i.e., more than "never") selected reasons why. Since we expected participants to be mostly U.S. citizens, we slightly revised the sources that participants may consult to obtain information about how to best make hiring decisions.</p><p>Furthermore, we asked participants if they possess a SHRM license instead of the German DIN 33430 license. Except for these changes and additional exclusion criteria presented below, the survey was the same as in Study 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The study was introduced as a general study on decision making, to avoid that participants guessed the exclusion criteria. Participants indicated up to three (from a list of twelve, presented in random order) work activities that they most frequently engage in at work (see Supplement S2). Only participants who selected "staffing organizational units", "making decisions and solving problems", or "judging the qualities of things, services, and people" were included. As in Study 1, we excluded participants who reported that they were involved in less than five hiring decisions in the last two years, meaning making (part of) the hiring decision or providing consultation to others who made the decision. Furthermore, participants who failed at least one of two attention checks (see Supplement S3) were excluded. Although not pre-registered, we also excluded participants who were younger than 18, or who gave impossible responses to some questions (e.g., a higher organizational role tenure than organizational tenure), which indicated that they may not have completed the study seriously. We retained usable data from N = 230 participants (55% male) who ranged in age from 21 to 67 (M = 36.4, SD = 10.3). The sample consisted primarily of U.S. citizens (89%). Other participants had other non-European (10%) or European nationalities (&lt; 0.01%).</p><p>As in Study 1, the majority of participants held a Bachelor's or Master's degree (93%), mostly in psychology, HR management, or business. Participants' mean organizational tenure was 6.9 years (SD = 4.3) and role tenure was 4.5 (SD = 2.8). The mean number of years participants were involved in making hiring decisions was 5.6 (SD = 4.7). Additional demographic information is displayed in Supplement S4 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">, Table S1</ref>. The median survey completion time was 12 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Most of the results found in Study 1 were similar in Study 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Similarities</head><p>All but two participants reported using multiple sources to obtain information about applicants. Also, holistic methods were used most often (82%, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Furthermore, the results from participants who reported using some form of holistic prediction most often (n = 188) showed that making holistic team predictions was prevalent (41%), although almost as prevalent as individual holistic predictions (39%). Moreover, 20% reported using clinical synthesis.</p><p>Although the reasons for not using algorithms were also similar (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>), relatively more participants indicated that they feel their status (23%), autonomy (23%), and personal contact with other decision makers (21%) is reduced when using an algorithm.</p><p>Relatively less participants than in Study 1 indicated that they do not use algorithms because algorithms are unavailable (16%) or because they cannot or do not want to quantify information (18%).</p><p>Participants indicated that they frequently consult blogs, videos, websites, other (HR) professionals, and the professional (HR) literature to obtain information on how to best make selection decisions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>). They consulted the academic literature somewhat less frequently and rarely consulted scientists or external consultants. Furthermore, we found similar relations between individual characteristics and the use of mechanical methods as in Study 1 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>). In line with expectations, reading the academic literature and possessing an assessment license were positively and moderately correlated with the use of mechanical prediction methods (r = .45 and .32, respectively). Yet, in contrast to Study 1, we found a strong positive correlation between using holistic and mechanical methods.</p><p>Unexpectedly, reading the academic literature and possessing an assessment license were also positively and moderately correlated with the use of holistic prediction methods (r = .31 and .22, respectively). As in Study 1, we fitted two regression models with holistic and mechanical prediction as the dependent variables, and academic literature, assessment license, organization size, experience (in years), and experience (amount) as independent variables (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>). Together, the predictors explained 30 % of the variance in mechanical prediction (F(5, 222) = 18.58, p &lt; .001, R 2 adj. = .28), and reading the academic literature and possessing an assessment license were the most important predictors (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the predictors explained 14% of the variance in holistic prediction (F(5, 222) = 7.07, p &lt; .001, R 2 adj. = .12). Unexpectedly, reading the academic literature was positively related to the use of holistic methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differences</head><p>In contrast to Study 1, only a small minority indicated that they do not quantify all information (11% versus 70% in Study 1). Furthermore, the mean frequency rating for holistic methods (M = 3.43, SD = 0.59) was similar to the mean frequency rating for mechanical methods (M = 3.37, SD = 0.83, d = 0.09, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.20]), whereas in Study 1 the mean frequency for holistic methods was much higher than for mechanical methods. Moreover, in</p><p>Study 2, many more participants who obtained a college degree (n = 216) indicated that holistic and mechanical prediction was discussed in their studies (90% versus 32 % in Study 1). Yet, only 7% (versus 43% in Study 1) out of all participants answered all three "knowledge check" items correctly, while 42% (versus 77%) answered at least two items correctly. Out of all participants, 70% (versus 95%) answered at least one item correctly 4 .</p><p>Participants who indicated that they at least rarely use some form of mechanical prediction (n = 221) were also asked how they construct their algorithm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). In contrast to Study 1, algorithms were most often based on statistical analyses of data from one's organization, or other relevant data (54%). Furthermore, unit weighting was common (44%), and relatively more common than in Study 1. Other ways of determining algorithms were similarly often reported as in Study 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm Appreciation</head><p>We also asked participants who indicated using algorithms at least to some extent (n = 219) why (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>). Commonly reported reasons were that algorithms are more valid (45%), easier to use (37%), yield more valuable information (34%), and are fairer (32%) than holistic prediction. Relatively uncommon reasons were that algorithms are legally safer (22%) and reinforce the employer brand more effectively (18%) than holistic prediction. Only four participants thought algorithms would be cheaper than holistic prediction (2%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Study 1 and Study 2</head><p>The results from Study 1 and 2 showed that most selection decisions are made holistically and usually in teams. Frequently mentioned reasons why algorithms are not (always) used were that stakeholders do not accept the use of algorithms and that decision makers believe a combination of holistic and mechanical prediction results in the best decisions. Other reasons in Study 1 were that decision makers cannot or do not want to quantify information, and that algorithms are unavailable. Other reasons in Study 2 were that decision makers considered it their professional duty to use holistic prediction and felt a loss of autonomy and status when they would use algorithms. Decision makers who use some form of mechanical prediction mainly do so because of its validity advantages over holistic prediction, and they often base their algorithms on scientific research findings, a discussion with experts (Study 1), and unit weights (Study 2). Despite presenting participants with an elaborate explanation on holistic and mechanical prediction, only a (small) minority answered all knowledge items correctly, suggesting that many misunderstandings regarding evidencebased decision making still exist. Lastly, we found consistent evidence that reading the academic literature and possessing an assessment license were positively related to the use of mechanical methods. Yet, unexpectedly, we also found that these factors correlated positively with the use of holistic methods in Study 2. This finding is not in line with the results from Study 1, where the use of holistic methods correlated negatively with reading the academic literature and possessing an assessment license, as one would expect. We do not have a plausible explanation for this latter, inconsistent finding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>The aim of Study 3 was to supplement the quantitative surveys with qualitative data from focus groups and to investigate what is needed to increase algorithm use in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>Participants were members of the Dutch Association of Psychology (Dutch:</p><p>Nederlands Instituut voor Psychologen, NIP) who indicated their willingness to participate in future research on test use and decision making in an earlier survey on psychological testing, conducted in collaboration with the European Federation of Psychologists' Associations. We invited these members via email to take part in one of three online focus group sessions on decision making in practice. Due to a technical error, the third focus group session was not recorded. Therefore, we only report the results of the first two sessions. Decision makers (mostly psychologists) with backgrounds in I-O, clinical, developmental, forensic, and educational psychology participated in the focus groups. There were nine and 12 participants in focus group 1 and 2, respectively. Participants read an elaborate explanation on the distinction between holistic and mechanical prediction before signing up for a focus group session. They received a presentation on the distinction again at the beginning of the session and consequently responded to two questions: (1) "What is the reason you think decision makers do not (or seldom) apply mechanical methods in decision making?" and (2) "What is needed to apply mechanical methods more often?"</p><p>We applied thematic analysis to analyze our data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006)</ref>. The third author transcribed the audio material of the two focus group sessions. Then, the authors worked in two pairs. Each pair read the text from both focus groups and classified the text into units. Differences in unit classification were resolved by discussion among the authors.</p><p>Seven themes were suggested based on inspection of the different units (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>). Second, two newly formed author pairs assigned the units to the themes. Each pair coded one focus group. The pairs could choose a second theme when in doubt which theme to choose. Across focus groups, there was moderate agreement between the two raters (κ = .53). Differences in assigned units were resolved by discussion within author pairs. Eventually, each pair received all codes and independently wrote a results section. The first author integrated the results sections as presented in the paper. Per theme, we present exemplary quotes in Supplement S6, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>. Note. Choice 1 = raters' first choice. Choice 2 = raters' second choice. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref> shows that most units were assigned to primary theme 6 (questions about how to use mechanical methods), 2 (disadvantages of mechanical methods), 7 (reasons why decision makers do not use mechanical methods), and 5.1 (what is needed to increase the use of mechanical methods: information and guidelines). When also considering secondary themes, most units were assigned to theme 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A summary of our research findings per theme can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 9</ref>. Within themes, we reported participants' remarks based on how frequently they were mentioned, in descending order. Many participants mentioned that transparency would be a great advantage of mechanical methods. Yet, they also mentioned that the use of algorithms could be inefficient because the criteria of interest may change, specific positions may require specific algorithms, and literature searches to determine predictor weights may be time-consuming.</p><p>Interestingly, although our participants reported that they usually apply holistic methods, almost no participant mentioned advantages of the holistic method. One participant said that you could also make holistic predictions fully transparent by exactly describing what you do.</p><p>Some participants were aware of the evidence that mechanical methods are more valid than holistic methods. To increase the use of mechanical methods, participants desired a discussion of this topic in test guidelines, and they suggested that more education is needed.</p><p>Furthermore, they mentioned that training on how to apply algorithms would be valuable, as well as a database that contains evidence-based algorithms. Lastly, comparing holistic and mechanical prediction within companies would help to recognize differences in predictive validity. In general, participants mentioned that they would like test commissions and universities to spend more attention to this topic.</p><p>Our focus groups revealed that many questions and misunderstandings regarding mechanical methods existed, which partly explained why they are seldom used. Participants thought mechanical prediction would only be possible with well-measured variables and evidence-based weights. Furthermore, they considered many decisions too complex to use an algorithm for, and they highlighted the importance of considering the context. Some also thought that it would be a psychologist's job to use holistic methods, while others considered psychologists as "stubborn". Lastly, participants mentioned that other stakeholders in the field would not accept the use of mechanical methods. Advantages of mechanical methods (theme 1) -Using an explicit algorithm would make decisions transparent and would provide insight into how decisions are made (i.e., how information is weighted).</p><p>-Mechanical prediction would elicit critical thinking and "creates awareness".</p><p>-Algorithms would serve as an "anchor", heuristic, or decision aid. Decision makers could learn from it, but also adjust it to their needs, given a justification.</p><p>Disadvantages of mechanical methods (theme 2) -The criterion of interest would constantly change.</p><p>-It would be inefficient to design an algorithm for a specific function in an organization because such a selection takes place only one or two times a year, maybe even less often.</p><p>-It would be difficult and time-consuming to choose predictor weights, and decision makers would not have the time and motivation to consult the literature for predictor validities and weights.</p><p>-Mechanical methods would disregard uncertainty around point estimates. -Training in applying algorithms would be needed.</p><p>-Obtaining more information from test commissions on test reliability and validity would make the choice of predictor weights easier.</p><p>-Access to information on algorithms would need to be improved.</p><p>-Ideally, a database with possible algorithms per sub-discipline would be available.</p><p>-Evaluating the validity of algorithms and comparing it to current holistic predictions would stimulate its use in practice.</p><p>Where should information about mechanical methods be exchanged? (theme 5.2)</p><p>-More attention to algorithm use in the regular professional training and education (e.g., in the bachelor, master, and post-master in psychology) would be needed.</p><p>-Specific courses devoted to mechanical prediction should be created.</p><p>-Decision makers within or across companies or institutes could discusses how they decide in particular cases and based on this information suggest specific algorithms.</p><p>-Communities could report which specific algorithms work in their case, and upload those to a system so that others could use them as well.</p><p>Who should be responsible for encouraging the use of mechanical methods? <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(theme 5.3)</ref> -Universities should be in charge to accommodate decision making more in their curriculum.</p><p>-Testing commissions and other diagnostics institutes were expected to cover decision making in more detail.</p><p>-In the field of personnel selection, consulting firms should collaborate with scientists and collect data on applicants and later performance that may be used to design algorithms.</p><p>Questions about how to use mechanical methods <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(theme 6)</ref> -For many participants it was unclear what exactly an algorithm was and how to use it, although we had asked participants to read our explanation of holistic and mechanical methods before the session.</p><p>-It was unclear whether algorithms would have to be communicated to everyone involved in the decision-making process, or whether you could also construct individual algorithms. A -It was also unclear that one could choose predictor weights oneself, and that this does not necessarily have to be evidence-based.</p><p>-It was asked whether the data combination method would still matter if valid, evidence-based predictors are used.</p><p>-Participants were confused that the scoring of a test could also be distinguished with regard to the holistic and mechanical method.</p><p>-Participants asked what to discuss in group discussions when one wants to implement the mechanical method.</p><p>Reasons why decision makers do not use mechanical methods <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(theme 7)</ref> -Holistic and mechanical prediction would not be sufficiently taught at the university.</p><p>-The distinction between holistic and mechanical prediction was unclear, and there were many misunderstandings.</p><p>-Participants thought mechanical prediction would be only possible when solely wellmeasured variables are available.</p><p>-Participants also thought the situations in which they have to make decisions are too complex to apply algorithms.</p><p>-It was mentioned that algorithms would ignore the individual, and that information should be differently weighted in different situations.</p><p>-It would be the role of the psychologist to identify situations in which information should be weighted differently.</p><p>-Psychologists could be "stubborn" and (think) they have a lot of knowledge and can predict events better than an algorithm by using their gut feeling.</p><p>-Algorithms are rarely used because they would not be accepted in the field.</p><p>-Organizational cultures could foster or impede algorithm use. Organizations with a stronger focus on quantitative than on qualitative information would appreciate algorithms more.</p><p>-Information on how to construct algorithms is not easily available.</p><p>-It would be too time-consuming to find and read the literature on how to construct algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>In line with earlier research <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Ryan &amp; Sackett, 1987)</ref>, we consistently found that most decisions are made holistically in practice, usually in teams. Across three studies, conducted in different settings and countries, we found that decision makers rarely use algorithms because they lack knowledge and fear negative evaluations from stakeholders when using algorithms. Moreover, participants in Study 1 indicated that they cannot or do not want to quantify information. Also, participants mentioned that algorithms (Study 1) and information to construct them (Study 3) are often unavailable. Participants in Study 2 also reported that their autonomy and status is reduced when using algorithms, and that they consider it their duty to use holistic prediction (also mentioned in Study 3). Furthermore, Study 1 and 2</p><p>showed that reading the academic literature and being licensed were positively related to algorithm use. Yet, unexpectedly, we also found that these variables were positively related to the use of holistic methods in Study 2. Decision makers who use algorithms do so mainly because of its validity advantages over holistic prediction, and they often construct algorithms based on research findings (e.g., meta-analyses) and expert discussions (Study 1), or organizational data or unit weights (Study 2). Lastly, our results from Study 3 suggest that more training and support in using algorithms is needed to increase its use in practice.</p><p>Although we supplemented two quantitative surveys with qualitative research to achieve methodological triangulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959)</ref>, our studies have several limitations. We used a small convenience sample in Study 1. Therefore, the results may not generalize to other decision makers involved in selection decisions. Despite a larger and more diverse sample in Study 2, concerns exist regarding the quality of the data, as less participants answered all knowledge check items correctly compared to Study 1. It could be that participants in Study 1 were more intrinsically motivated to learn about evidence-based decision making and hence read the explanation on mechanical and holistic methods more</p><p>carefully. Yet, in Study 2, the results from a subsample of participants who answered at least two knowledge check items correctly were very similar to the results from the full sample, and most results were in line with the results found in the other studies. Still, given the concerns regarding data quality in Study 2, we primarily interpreted the results from Study 1 and 3. Moreover, we cannot rule out that some participants mistakenly reported using mechanical prediction, given the many misunderstandings we observed. We found similar results regarding algorithm use when making hiring decisions in three Western countries. We have no reason to assume that our results would not generalize to other countries in the Western world, given our robust findings and similar findings in other contexts than personnel selection, such as in clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Vrieze &amp; Grove, 2009)</ref>. However, investigating algorithm use in selection decisions in other countries would be valuable. Lastly, due to our cross-sectional, correlational designs, we cannot infer causality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications and Future Directions</head><p>The field of assessment and selection has experienced an increase in automated and algorithmic solutions, mainly in terms of how and what applicant information is collected <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gonzalez et al., 2019)</ref>. However, our results suggest that algorithms are still rarely used to make selection decisions. We do not expect that complete reliance on mechanical methods to make selection decisions will drastically increase soon, partly because the most commonly mentioned reasons why algorithms are underutilized were diverse, including a lack of training, but also socio-psychological factors such as restricted autonomy and negative stakeholder perceptions when using algorithms. Therefore, it seems promising to investigate when decision makers are most likely to at least take algorithmic advice into account, as this should also increase judgment consistency and hence predictive validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Yu &amp; Kuncel, 2020</ref>).</p><p>Our results have several implications for advancing research on algorithm aversion and improving decision making in practice. First, we found that decisions are often made holistically in teams. Yet, existing research on algorithm aversion has mostly focused on individual decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Neumann et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, research on the role of mechanical methods in team decision making would be very valuable. We suggest that researchers adopt the lens model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brunswik, 1955)</ref>, which is a useful framework to study both individual and team selection decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kuncel, 2018)</ref>. This model allows researchers to compare how predictors are related to a criterion (e.g., job performance), and to a decisionmaker's or a team's holistic predictions. Predictors can include applicant information such as test scores and interview ratings, but also predictions of an algorithm or holistic predictions from others, in case of hierarchical groups where one member is responsible for the final selection decision and receives advice from others <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hollenbeck et al., 1995)</ref>. In many selection procedures, a line manager makes the final hiring decision based on the available information and expert advice. An interesting question to be studied in the future is, for example, whether line managers weight expert advice more strongly when the expert has completed a training on evidence-based decision making.</p><p>Procedural aspects could also affect algorithm use (for a review of procedural aspects that affect team effectiveness, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mathieu et al., 2019)</ref>. Do teams who receive advice from a self-designed algorithm make more accurate predictions than teams who make pure holistic predictions? Do teams make more valid predictions when their discussion is moderated by an assessment expert? Lastly, decision makers may be more likely to use algorithmic advice when the algorithm 'explains itself' by providing a story, as humans also typically explain and justify their holistic decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bolander &amp; Sandberg, 2013)</ref>. Adding such narrative elements may improve both individual and team decision making.</p><p>Second, given that knowledge on evidence-based decision making seems to increase algorithm use and predictive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Neumann, Hengeveld, et al., 2022)</ref>, decision making should receive much more attention in licenses and the education of practitioners, for example, in on-going organizational trainings. Also, textbooks on psychological and educational testing and test guidelines such as those of the APA/NCME and of the ITC currently do not discuss the benefits of mechanical methods . In our opinion, this should change. However, this may not be enough. In line with the broader literature on the science-practice gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rynes et al., 2002)</ref>, our results showed that decision makers rather consult the professional than the academic literature to obtain information on how to best make hiring decisions. Yet, the professional literature contains much misinformation, and evidence-based decision making is hardly discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Neumann et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, information on evidence-based decision making should be disseminated in other outlets next to academic journals, such as trade books, professional journals, social media platforms (e.g., LinkedIn), and popular podcasts. Furthermore, organizations like SIOP and EAWOP could assist in information campaigns to reduce misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lewandowsky et al., 2012)</ref>. Additionally, a (virtual) drop-in center may be established where practitioners can ask experts questions regarding the implementation of algorithms. The resulting input from practitioners may also meaningfully inform theory development on algorithm aversion.</p><p>Third, many participants noticed that algorithms are unavailable, which suggests that they think algorithms have to be complex, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grove and Meehl (1996)</ref> already noted. Yet, as we discussed, even simple algorithms often outperform holistic prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Sackett et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Yu &amp; Kuncel, 2020)</ref>. To increase the availability of algorithms and relevant information, testing commissions and consultancies may create decision aids that document evidence-based algorithms for different predictor sets, or support decision makers in developing their own algorithms, such as the ShinyApps by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Failenschmid et al. (2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Song et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, and in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Nolan et al. (2016)</ref>, we consistently found that decision makers fear negative evaluations from stakeholders when using algorithms. Therefore, research on improving (decision-makers' concerns about) stakeholders' perceptions seems valuable. Furthermore, our results showed that many participants believed a combination of holistic and mechanical methods to result in the best decisions. We found that decision makers mostly combined these two methods in the form of clinical rather than mechanical</p><p>synthesis. Yet, it remains unknown how clinical and mechanical synthesis compare in terms of usage and predictive validity. Therefore, future research may compare these two methods.</p><p>Fifth, our results suggest that decision makers may be more likely to use simple algorithms due to increased transparency and potentially higher fairness (perceptions), rather than due to higher predictive validity. We speculate that people intuitively devise a narrative that "a fair treatment requires equal weights (across applicants)". So, it may be easier for people to see the need for judgment consistency when fairness rather than predictive validity is emphasized. In sum, emphasizing other valuable outcomes such as fairness may help in encouraging (simple) algorithm use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Although mechanical methods are superior to holistic methods, they are still rarely used, suggesting that there is much room for improving decision making in practice. Many reasons for this underutilization relate to a lack of knowledge of evidence-based decision making.

Disadvantages of holistic methods (theme 4) -Decision makers (including psychologists) would be bad at combining information holistically, as research has shown. They would also put the most weight on things they had seen themselves, and they would think that instruments like cognitive ability tests were less important. What is needed to increase the use of mechanical methods?

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">As a robustness check, we inspected the results when only considering participants who answered at least two items correctly (see Supplement S5). The results were closely in line with the results of the full sample.</note>
