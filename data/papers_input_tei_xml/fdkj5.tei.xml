				<p>Rankings are ubiquitous, also within higher education settings. Guides are produced and they contain rankings for each subject provider. University rankings influence student choice of where to study. Moreover, league table rankings may be used by institutions to inform policy. As such, it is important to ensure these rankings are reliable. In this research, we applied a novel robust ranking algorithmic (RRA) method, commonly used in biosciences, to determine university rankings and compared this against the rankings from well-used university league tables (Guardian / Complete university guide). Although there was some correspondence between the RRA method rankings and the university league tables, there were also inconsistencies. Indeed, the median rank shift was 18 ranks for the Guardian University Guide and 11 ranks for the Complete University Guide. These findings were similar regardless of whether the focus was all institutions or those in the Russell Group. Additionally, there was little correspondence in ranking changes across years between the RRA and either well-used league table. Based on this, we argue that it is important to consider the reliability of university league tables when they are used in decision making, either by students or university staff.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Going to university is a major life transition. As such, it is important to make the right decision about where to study and what course to undertake. However, within most countries there is likely to be a variety of possible institutions where a student could study. Moreover, within each institution there will be numerous courses that can be taken. This mass of choice can make deciding where to study and what to study difficult for students. Therefore, it is important to have metrics that are available to help students make this important decision.</p><p>Within different countries, there are league tables that are produced which rank the universities overall, as well as at the subject level (e.g., top university for chemistry, veterinary science, psychology). For example, in the US students can consult the US News League <ref type="table">Table.</ref> In the Netherlands, there is the 'Keuzegids'. Similarly, in the UK there are a variety of league tables, such as the Guardian University Guide, Complete University Guide and the Times League <ref type="table">Table.</ref> Universities market themselves based on these rankings. As such, it is unsurprising that rankings influence a prospective student's choice of university <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gibbons, Neumayer, &amp; Perkins, 2015)</ref>. Given this, it is important to ensure that university rankings in league tables are reliable. In this paper, we first outline the issues with using rankings from university league tables. Moreover, we apply a novel Robust Ranking Aggregation Algorithmic (RRA) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kolde, Laur, Adler, &amp; Vilo, 2012)</ref>, which is predominantly used in genomics, to test the reliability of university rankings for two well-used league tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Issues with University League Tables</head><p>There is substantial variation in the data used to create the league tables. For example, the US News rankings combine data from 17 different factors to create its ranking of UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 4 institutions in the US (https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-usnews-calculated-the-rankings). This includes data on graduation rates, faculty salaries, peer assessment and student-staff ratio. In contrast, in the UK the Complete University Guide ranks universities using data on entry standards (i.e., average grades needed to study at the university), student satisfaction, research quality and graduate prospects (https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/sector/insights/university-and-subjectleague-tables-methodology). Even within countries, there is variation in the data used to construct league tables. The Complete University Guide and the Guardian University Guide are both UK-based university ranking systems, but the data used in the Guardian guide is substantially different to the Complete University Guide (https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/sep/07/methodology-behind-the-2025-guardian-university-guide). The Guardian rankings are based on entry tariff, satisfaction with teaching (from National Student Survey), satisfaction with feedback (from National Student Survey), student-staff ratio, money spent on each student, added value (i.e., how their degree result relates to their entry qualifications), the number of graduates who have a graduate-level job within 15 months and continuation (i.e., percentage of first year students who continue to second year). Overall league tables combine both objective data (e.g., student-staff ratio, grades needed to enter the course) and subjective data (e.g., student satisfaction, peer-review of the institution) to rank the institutions within a country.</p><p>As such, despite there being some similarities, league tables rely on different data both within and between countries.</p><p>The use of different data across league tables creates a problem with this ranking system. Indeed, a university's ranking is likely to vary depending on which league table is consulted <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bowden, 2000)</ref>. Aforementioned, institutions often use university rankings in their marketing materials. The incorporation of these inconsistent rankings into such marketing materials is likely to cause further confusion. For example, universities may cherry pick the ranking system that makes them look best, resulting in two universities both UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 5 marketing themselves as the top course in their region for a specific course <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Wakeford, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, these inconsistencies are likely to create problems for prospective students, as they may be unsure as to which guide to trust.</p><p>Problems with the underlying data may also be problematic for university rankings. As mentioned above, in the UK both the Complete University Guide and the Guardian University Guide rankings are partly based on data from the NSS. This is an annual survey completed by students in their final year who are studying at UK institutions. The Complete University Guide uses the satisfaction with the quality of teaching students received in its league table. In contrast, the Guardian uses the satisfaction with the quality of teaching alongside the satisfaction with feedback subscales from the NSS in its league tables. However, numerous researchers have highlighted problems with NSS data. Indeed, NSS scores vary based on factors beyond the quality of the course, including the region in the UK where the university is based, the subject that is studied (i.e., media studies versus clinical dentistry) and whether the course is being studied full-time or part-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bell &amp; Brooks, 2018)</ref>. As a result, it is difficult to use NSS data to rank the quality of different institutions and courses.</p><p>Students from different universities may also rate the same item using different criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bennett &amp; Kane, 2014)</ref>. Moreover, researchers have questioned the data sorting processes applied to NSS data <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pollet, Bilalić, &amp; Shepherd, 2024)</ref>. Additionally, the structure of the NSS subscales has been questioned <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pollet &amp; Shepherd, 2022)</ref>, with the researchers suggesting that there may be fewer subscales than suggested by the NSS. This is particularly problematic for the Guardian League Table which used different NSS subscales. Therefore, the use of this subjective data in university rankings may be problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Marginson, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Although the NSS is specific to the UK, there are other subjective ranking metrics that have received criticism. One such metric is the use of peer review. This involves experts judging the academic quality of different universities. Researchers have argued that such ratings are instable and may reflect methodological issues (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bookstein, Seidler, Fieder, &amp; UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 6 Winckler, 2010)</ref>. Although peer-review is weighted heavily on some league tables, some experts have questioned the validity of this task and chosen to boycott this <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Enserink, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Related to this, not all metrics contribute equally to the university rankings. Instead, some metrics are weighted more heavily than others. For example, in the Complete University Guide student satisfaction is weighted more heavily than entry requirements. In contrast, in the US news rankings there is variability between the different rankings, with peer assessment being highly weighted and retention rates and student-staff ratio receiving much lower weights. Researchers have argued that the arbitrary assignment of weights to the different metrics is problematic for such ranking league tables <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Marginson, 2014)</ref>. Indeed, weighing metrics in university league tables based on less arbitrary values is likely to produce very different results <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Turner, 2005)</ref>. Additionally the metrics in university league tables are unlikely to form a single construct, leading to questions about the use of weightings to create single scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Johnes, 2018)</ref>. As such, although the weights are applied consistently for each university, numerous issues have been identified with this approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability of University Rankings</head><p>The issues above have been well-discussed in previous research [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Enserink, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Marginson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wakeford, 2015)</ref>. However, there are other issues that need to be considered with regards to a university's overall ranking. Indeed, students are taught at the subject-level rather than the university level. As such, it is important for overall assessments of universities to be based on subject-level performance. This is problematic as the subjects taught at different universities vary. Given that NSS ratings vary based on the subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bell &amp; Brooks, 2018)</ref>, simply combining overall scores across the university, without taking the subjects taught at an institution into account may be problematic. Instead, it is important to base the judgements on how well each institution performs in the subjects that are taught. However, this poses the additional challenge that not all subject ranking lists will be of even length. For example, a guide might rank 100 institutions for accounting degrees, but only 30 UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 7 for Aeronautical and Aerospace engineering. This makes it hard to compare if certain institutions are consistently ranked top across lists. Being top ranked when there are only 30 courses ranked should be interpreted with caution compared to when 100 courses are ranked.</p><p>Therefore, a robust method needs to be applied if we want to compare universities across courses.</p><p>Here, we apply a robust ranking method from genomics which allows for aggregation across lists of ranks. In the domain of genomics, different studies will produce lists of candidate genes associated with a trait -but the length of these lists might vary. For example, Study X might have examined the top 10, Study Y the top 30 and Study Z the top 50, et cetera. A challenge is to synthesise across these lists varying in length to determine if there are candidate genes consistently present across all lists. A similar issue applies with university courses. Indeed, each institution may teach a subset of subjects. These then need to be combined to create the overall evaluation of the institution. Despite the parallels between the issues in genomic research, where researchers want to synthesise across lists, and the university league table issue, to our knowledge this approach has not been used to synthesise subject rankings across UK universities.</p><p>This project is largely descriptive and we are interested in how a robust ranking method compares to the institutional rankings produced by well-used university guides. In our analyses, we first analyse all institutions and then focus on The Russell group. They are 24 universities who identify as world-class research intensive universities. However, a 2023 article in the Guardian, made the case that some of these universities might be leading but others are not. This was supported by data from the Guardian University Guide 2024. Part of the evidence cited was that the leading institution was a non-RG member (University of St. Andrews). Therefore, based on the above rationale, we address the following research questions:</p><p>1. Are universities similarly ranked by their respective guide (institutional ranking) and UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 8 the robust ranking method we used? 2. Across courses are there universities that are consistently ranked highest? We expect that these will be predominantly Russell Group universities.</p><p>3. Are there universities that are consistently improving based on the robust ranking method? We use a small window (year to year, rank difference in 2024-2023) and a larger window (rank difference 2024-2019). We calculate rank differences for all courses that we are able to match, as groupings might have changed. This is then compared against the well-used university guides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data sources</head><p>We selected two popular guides based on public data availability. For both sources, the structure of the metric and methodology of the rankings are broadly constant since their inception. However, it should be noted that (substantial) revisions do happen. That being said, the guides themselves routinely offer year-to-year comparison. For our analysis, we do not combine the two guides or directly compare them as they vary not only too widely in their methodology, but they also vary in how they group subjects, the number of subjects and the number of institutions they include. This hampers any comparison across guides.</p><p>The guides themselves provide detailed information on how their metrics are calculated at both the institutional level and subject level. These typically involve measures derived from the National Student Satisfaction survey, Staff Student Ratio, and we refer the reader to the respective guides. For our purpose, the details on how these metrics are constructed does not matter gravely, rather we are interested how a robust ranking would match up to one produced by a provider of league tables. Studies has the most institutions ranked (n = 121). The smallest list was for Celtic studies where only five institutions were ranked. The Complete University Guide institution list allows for ties in rankings (for 2024: 14 ties; none in top 60). However, in their subject ranking list, only one subject showed ties (Drama, Dance, and Cinematics), and this was limited to one tie only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics and data availability</head><p>The project was approved by the local ethics committee at the institution of the corresponding author. As described above, the data are publicly available from the Guardian website and the complete university guide website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 10</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical strategy</head><p>Our analyses were conducted in R 4.4.2 (R Development Core <ref type="bibr">Team, 2008)</ref>. For research question 1, we apply the Robust Ranking Aggregation algorithmic (RRA) method developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kolde et al. (2012)</ref>, widely used in bioinformatics (over 1,000 citations in Scholar Google). Very simply put, in this algorithmic approach a null model is generated with random ranking. No ties are allowed. This is a list with random shuffles of all items on the list, and it is thus non-informative. Next, we can evaluate the probability of being ranked at a certain position compared to the reference distribution with all these non-informative lists. A p value can thus be derived for each item, and an aggregated list can be generated via ordering these p values. The full details for the method are described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kolde et al. (2012)</ref>. As algorithmic approaches take a random starting point, we ran the analyses in duplicate with a different random seed -in all cases we obtained the same results with a different starting seed. There was perfect correspondence in rankings (Spearman ρ = 1), so we only report the first analysis. We refer to the ranking produced as the 'RRA ranking', and we generate this for all institutions in the included subject lists as well as restricted to just the institutions on the institutions list but when it comes to comparing institutional rankings based on guides and our method, we only rely on the latter. In our analyses, all the subjects are weighed equally but due to list length, larger subject rankings will inherently carry more weight, i.e. being ranked 1st when 80 universities are ranked is more informative compared to when just five institutions are ranked. In this way, the analyses thus account for the relative popularity of varying subjects.</p><p>Our results are mostly descriptive statistics, ordinal correlations (Spearman ρ, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Siegel &amp; Castellan, 1988)</ref> and the p values associated with the ranking. We apply an error correction to account for multiple testing as every item gets ranked <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli, 2001</ref>). This method is conservative, as compared to other methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>It makes no assumptions regarding the dependency of p values. An alternative is the UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 11 Bonferroni method, however, there are suggestions that this method is overly restrictive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moran, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Nakagawa, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Perneger, 1998)</ref>. A significance level of 5% is used throughout, though we will also report p &lt; .1. For judging the correspondence or stability between rankings, based on ordinal correlations, we interpret thresholds of .667 as acceptable and .8 as good (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Krippendorff, 2004</ref>, pp. 239-ff for similar guidelines). Though the RRA method does not allow for ties in its ranking, note that Spearman ρ does allow for ties when calculating correspondence. For examining whether there is significant change in the ranks between 2023 and 2024 within institution lists we use a one sample rank test we use a one sample Wilcoxon signed rank test against a median of 0. Our analysis plan and full analysis document is available at https://osf.io/ubnwy/. This document also contains some further analyses and full tables not reported here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guardian data</head><p>2024. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the rankings for all those universities ranked by the RRA method, as well as their Guardian 2024 institution ranking. The top 13 institutions are ranked significantly better than chance (p = .05), regardless of whether the <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001)</ref> or Bonferroni method is used to adjust for multiple testing. Approximately half of the Russell Group universities were not included in the list and the list also included some non-Russell Group members (e.g., St Andrews, Swansea).</p><p>The correspondence between the two ranking lists was acceptable, both when including any institution ranked in the subject list (Spearman ρ = .667) and when restricting to universities which are listed in the GUG institution list (Spearman ρ = .673). The absolute median rank shift between the two methods is 18 ranks (n = 122 institutions ranked, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure   1A</ref>). Some institutions did not move (min = 0), but at its extreme they can move with over 100 ranks (max = 103). Thus, even though there is acceptable correspondence, some institutions can exhibit very large shifts up or down the list. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2 shows the institutions   UNIVERSITY RANKINGS   12</ref> with the largest absolute shifts in ranks. Most notably the largest shifts are for some specialist providers: the University of the Arts London (RRA rank = 118, GUG = 15) and SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, RRA rank = 118, GUG 2024 = 15). These are two specialist providers, not offering all subjects. Excluding these two specialist providers improves the correspondence somewhat but not greatly so (Spearman ρ = .712). That being said other universities with broader curricula also showed a large discrepancy. For example, both Chichester and Aberystwyth shift 69 places downwards on the RRA rankings. It also is not a given that specialist providers inherently will have poor rankings. For example, some specialist providers, e.g., the London School of Economics (RRA Rank = 17), still float toward the top, albeit in a less pronounced way than under the Guardian Institution rankings (GUG 2024 = 4).   We can use the Russell Group Universities to illustrate some shift in rankings. <ref type="figure">Figure   X</ref> shows the largest changes in ranking between the two methods.  We examined whether there were institutions that dropped or climbed rankings more so than expected under chance with the RRA method. Just three universities out of 121 ranked in total, i.e. Leeds, Birmingham, Hull, experienced a significant drop based on the RRA method. The conclusion is the same regardless of the choice for the <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(p Benjamini&amp;Yekutieli &lt; .00001, p Benjamini&amp;Yekutieli = .0030, p Benjamini&amp;Yekutieli = .0146) or Bonferroni adjustment (p Bonferroni &lt; .00001, p Bonferroni = .0011, p Bonferroni = .0081).</formula><p>There were no significant climbers based on the RRA method when applying an adjustment based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001)</ref>  There was little correspondence between the ranking for ranks dropped between 2023</p><p>and 2024 based on the Guardian Institution list and the RRA method (Spearman ρ = .187).</p><p>Similarly there was hardly any correspondence between the ranks gained between 2023 and 2024 based on the Guardian Institution list and the RRA method (Spearman ρ = .259). We examined whether there were institutions that dropped or climbed rankings more so than expected under chance with the RRA method. Seven universities out of 118 ranked in total experienced a significant drop based on the RRA method <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref> and p Bonferroni = .097).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2019</head><p>There was little correspondence between the ranking for ranks dropped between 2019</p><p>and 2024 based on the Guardian Institution list and the RRA method (Spearman ρ = .284).</p><p>Similarly there was hardly any correspondence between the ranks gained between 2019 and 2024 based on the Guardian Institution list and the RRA method (Spearman ρ = .248).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 3</head><p>The providers with the largest drops in rank between 2019 and 2024 vs. p Bonferroni = 1) and Queen Mary University London (QMUL, both methods: p = 1).</p><p>The absolute median rank shift between the two methods is 11 ranks (n = 130 institutions ranked). Some institutions did not move (min = 0), but at its extreme they can move with over 80 ranks (max = 87; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1B</ref>). Thus, even though there is acceptable correspondence, some institutions can exhibit very large shifts up or down the list. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> shows the ten institutions with the largest absolute shifts in ranks. These tend to be specialist providers but also some non-specialists (e.g., University of Buckingham).  We can again use the Russell Group Universities to illustrate some shift in rankings.   The vast majority of subject rankings were stable (Spearman ρ ≥ .667, for 68 out of 74 subjects), with most showing strong stability (Spearman ρ ≥ .8, for 54 out of 74 subjects).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 20</head><p>Three universities out of 129 ranked in total, i.e. Coventry, Central Lancashire, University of Manchester, experienced a significant drop based on the RRA method.

Ulster University also experienced a drop, but not significantly so at p = .05 (p Benjamini&amp;Yekutieli = .087 and p Bonferroni = .064). There were three universities, experienced a significant climb based on the RRA method.</p><p>There was hardly any correspondence between the ranking for ranks dropped between 2023 and 2024 based on the CUG Institution list and the RRA method (Spearman ρ = .054).</p></div>

There were also some extreme cases with large shifts in rank (i.e., 103 for the Guardian University Guide and 87 ranks for the Complete University Guide). This discrepancy between the RRA method and the university guides was also found when focusing specifically on Russell Group universities. Therefore, we argue that the way in which university ranking data is calculated has implications for a university's position in league tables.</p><p>For the university guides, there was strong correspondence between the 2023-2024 rank data. For the Complete University Guide, there was also strong correspondence between the 2019-2024 rank data. However, for the Guardian League <ref type="table">Table the correspondence between</ref> the 2019-2024 rank data was only moderate. Interestingly, there was hardly any alignment between movement at subject level via our method and institutional rank changes as captured by the university guides. This was regardless of whether the comparison was made between 2023-2024 or 2019-2024. As such, this questions whether changes in ranks are meaningful or whether they are dependent on the methodology used to rank the universities.</p><p>A university's rank within a league table has important implications. For example, students may use these to choose which university to attend <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gibbons et al., 2015)</ref>. This has important consequences for both the student and the higher education institution, who often use these in their marketing materials (for example, University of Bath, University of Bolton, City University London, Loughborough University, University of Portsmouth). Therefore, UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 27 these ranks need to be reliable. In this research, we demonstrate that there is variation between each university guide's ranking and the ranking determined by our RRA method. This is not the first study to show variations in university rankings based on different analytical methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Turner, 2005)</ref>. However, in contrast to this previous research, our analysis was based on the original ranking data from the original university guides -we did not adjust the weighting of the different metrics. Given this, greater correspondence between ranks could be expected. As such, the discrepancies between the RRA method and the university guides is problematic. As a result, we argue that it is important to keep this reliability in mind when making decisions based on league table rankings.</p><p>This issue is especially difficult given the lack of correspondence in increases and deceases in ranks between the RRA method and the university guides. Universities aim to improve their ranks in league tables and undertake different strategies to achieve this. Any changes in ranks from one year to the next may be attributed by university staff to strategies that have been put in place to improve the university. However, if the implementation of such strategies has been effective, we would expect to see similar changes in the rankings based on the RRA method and the university guides. The lack of correspondence suggests changes may be more likely to be driven by random fluctuations. By focusing specifically on the university guides, institutions may misattribute changes to these strategies rather than random fluctuation. As such, resources may be allocated to ineffective strategies for improving the institution (e.g., https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2021/03/22/the-absurdity-of-universityrankings/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations</head><p>There are numerous strengths of this research. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the RRA method commonly used in genomics has been applied to institution ranking league tables. The ability of this algorithm to aggregate data across lists of different lengths UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 28 makes this well suited to being applied to university league table data. Moreover, we contrasted this RRA method with two separate well-used university ranking league tables and at different points in time. The fact that the findings were fairly consistent throughout the years demonstrates their robustness.</p><p>Despite this, it is important to discuss the limitations of this research. We focussed on one particular method for generating ranks. However, there are other algorithmic approaches one could take (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Feng, Deng, Wang, Song, &amp; Liang, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li, Wang, &amp; Xiao, 2019)</ref>. Some researchers have suggested that rather than comparing universities as a whole, it may be more effective to use data envelopment analysis to categorise similar universities into groups based on their objectives as this would account for the diverse nature of higher education <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Johnes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Turner, 2005)</ref>. We are not claiming the method we used is the fastest or best performing for this problem. In fact, depending on the analytical problem, there might be others. As such, more work is needed on optimal rank aggregation. Instead, we used this research to highlight that discrepancies may occur depending on how institutions are ranked.</p><p>The ranking method likely puts specialist universities at a disadvantage. Indeed, we found a large shift in ranks, in both the Guardian and Complete University Guide, for specialist providers (e.g., University of Arts London, Norwich University of the Arts). There were some non-specialist providers with large shifts as well (e.g., Buckingham, Chichester, Aberystwyth). It is difficult to circumvent this issue as it would be rather difficult to say which institutions are specialist providers or where to draw the line. For example, an institution may not offer Medicine, but may offer Nursing, which a Russell Group university might not offer. Alternatively, the analysis could focus specifically on the Russell Group.</p><p>However, there are still some specialist institutions there (e.g., London School of Economics).</p><p>It could also be argued that specialist institutions are not an issue when they can boost their rankings in larger subjects.</p><p>It is also worth noting that both university ranking guides were from within the UK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 29</head><p>The aim of this research was to illustrate the implementation of the RRA method for university ranking data. Although both guides were from the UK, there is no reason why this approach could not be applied in a similar manner to other university ranking data. Our data analysis code is freely available to others, enabling them to apply this RRA method to other university ranking data. In this research, we have demonstrated the application of this approach. We would strongly encourage others to extend this research by applying this approach to other university ranking data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further directions</head><p>We focused on rankings specifically but more broadly, we believe there is future work to be done to more closely investigate so-called pooling fallacies (also known under various guises, such as Simpson's paradox <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kievit, Frankenhuis, Waldorp, &amp; Borsboom, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Simpson, 1951;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wagner, 1982)</ref> or the ecological fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Piantadosi, Byar, &amp; Green, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Robinson, 1950)</ref>, review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tu, Gunnell, and Gilthorpe (2008)</ref>). As an example, institution A could outperform institution B in an overall institution list but when looking at the subject list institution B outperforms A on a majority of subjects -this can occur even after weighing for subject size or number of subjects compared. These phenomena have been well-documented in other disciplines (e.g., Anthropology: <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pollet, Tybur, Frankenhuis, &amp; Rickard, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Biology: Allison, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Scheiner et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Criminology: Demers &amp; Rossmo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Epidemiology: Persoskie &amp; Leyva, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reintjes, de Boer, van Pelt, &amp; Mintjes-de Groot, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Psychology: Hintzman, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kievit et al., 2013</ref>) but we do not believe these are fully considered when it comes to institutional metrics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Soh (2012)</ref> examined this form of paradox for QS rankings when it comes to lower level indicators versus overall ranking, but to our knowledge, in the context of ranking subjects. We would welcome more work examining these reversal paradoxes.</p><p>Another further direction is to synthesise global university rankings (e.g., QS, Times</p><p>Higher Education, US news global rankings), though a challenge is that each ranking UNIVERSITY RANKINGS 30 approach has its own methodology and therefore possibly cannot be compared. This is known as an issue of measurement equivalency (review in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jilke, Meuleman, &amp; Van de Walle, 2015</ref>). Then again, a similar approach is used in political science, where across multiple polls results are aggregated even if they vary considerably in design <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blumenthal, 2014)</ref>. A useful next step would be to synthesise global rankings and evaluate if similar institutions float to the top.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, this research demonstrated the application of a RRA method from genomics to university league table rankings. We found that the RRA methods corresponded with rankings from two well-used league tables, but that it was more closely aligned to the Complete university Guide than the Guardian University Guide. However, we did find some discrepancies between the ranks our RRA method and the rankings in both university guides.</p><p>These discrepancies may lead to questions about the reliability of rankings from these well-used league tables. This is further collaborated by the lack of correspondence between the increases and decreases in the university rankings from the well-used league tables and that of the RRA method. Given the importance of university rankings on student decisions regarding where to study, as well as university policy, it is important to identify robust ranking methods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Guardian</head><label></label><figDesc>University Guide data (2019, 2023, 2024).
