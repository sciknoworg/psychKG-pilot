<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Identifying high-performing individuals and collectives is a key challenge in a wide range of high-stakes contexts, from medical and psychological diagnostics and lie detection to economic and political forecasting, environmental risk analyses, and investment decisions (1-9). Telling them apart is relatively straightforward when accurate records of past performance exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10)</ref>. In many real-world contexts, however, such records do not exist or are inaccessible due to ethical or legal constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>. The most common approach, then, is to identify high performers based on proxies that are thought to correlate with decision accuracy, such as experience or reputation, or self-identified or peer-assessed expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>.</p><p>The purported correlations between accuracy and such proxies, however, are often poorly understood, complex, and context-dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>. Focusing on the class of binary decision problems, we here use a combined theoretical and empirical approach to develop and test a novel method for selecting highperforming individuals and groupscrucially, this method relies solely on inputs that are readily observable and does not require information about past decision accuracy of individuals.</p><p>We proceed as follows. First, we use a general mathematical argument to show thatin any binary decision task in which individuals are on average more often correct than notthe similarity of an individual's decision to others (i.e., the average percentage agreement with others) is tightly correlated with that individual's decision accuracy. Second, using numerical simulations, we show that this correlation between decision similarity and accuracy is observed even when one relaxes the two simplifying assumptions underlying our analytical result (i.e., when decisions of different individuals are correlated and/or when decision similarity is calculated from small samples)as long as the average accuracy of decision makers exceeds 0.5. Third, using several large data sets from three different domainsmedical diagnostics, geopolitical forecasting, and general knowledgewe show that (i) in each of these domains, as predicted, the decision similarity of an individual is tightly correlated with that individual's decision accuracy and (ii) this association can be exploited to reliably detect both high-performing individuals and groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical result: decision similarity correlates with decision accuracy</head><p>Consider a pool of N decision makers facing a binary decision problem (e.g., dermatologists classifying a skin lesion as benign or malignant; forecasters predicting whether a regime will still be in power one year from now), individuals differ in their average accuracy i p , 1...</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>iN </head><p>. Suppose we confront each individual with the same set of cases (e.g., skin lesions; forecasts) and let us compare the decisions of each individual to the decisions of a "benchmark individual" judging the same cases. More specifically, for each individual i, we define the decision similarity i S as the fraction of cases for which this individual makes the same decision as the benchmark individual. The expected value of this decision similarity is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) (1 ) (1 ) , i i i E S p p p p       (1)</formula><p>where p is the probability that the benchmark individual is correct in any particular case. To see how our similarity measure depends on individual accuracy levels, we compare the expected decision similarity (to the benchmark individual) for two individuals j and i, which is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) ( ) ( ) (2 1) . j i j i E S E S p p p      <label>(2)</label></formula><p>Crucially, as can be seen from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, whenever the benchmark individual is more often correct than incorrect (i.e.,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>0.5) p </head><p>, individuals with a higher accuracy will be characterized by a higher expected decision similarity, that is ( ) ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">j i j i p p E S E S   </formula><p>. In other words, the higher an individual's decision similarity, the more accurate this individual's decisions are, provided the benchmark individual performs above chance level. In order to illustrate the mechanism underlying the similarity-accuracy relationship as clear as possible we have, up to now, considered the case where we compare the decisions of individuals to a single benchmark individual. In practice, however, one may not know whether a particular decision maker performs above chance level. This problem can be solved by comparing the decisions of individuals to several other individuals. To see this, let us define the average decision similarity i S of individual i as the average percentage agreement of this individual with all other N-1 individuals, that is, for individual i we calculate the percentage agreement with every other individual j (j ≠ i) and take the average of these N-1 percentages:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">      1... ,</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numerical simulations: Small samples and correlated decisions</head><p>The above result suggests that the similarity of an individual's decisions to otherswhich can be readily observed when confronting individuals with a series of decision problemsis a powerful proxy for an individual's decision accuracy, provided the average accuracy of individuals exceeds 0.5. However, our analysis above is based on two simplifying assumptions. First, it is based on the expected value of decision similarity, that is, situations where for each individual a very large number of decisions are available for calculating that individual's decision similarity. Second, we assumed that decisions of different individuals are statistically independent from each other, that is, for any particular case, the accuracy i p of individual i is independent of any other individual j ≠ i being correct or incorrect. To investigate the robustness of the similarity-accuracy relationship, we performed numerical simulations across a broad range of statistical environments relaxing these assumptions. We focused on different populations of decision makers (i.e., populations differing in their accuracy distribution) using the beta distribution, systematically varying the alpha and beta shape parameters between 1 and 10 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Fig. 2A</ref>). Importantly, these populations differ in their average accuracy, variance, and skewness, encompassing a wide variety of accuracy distributions. For each of these populations, we repeatedly and randomly sampled groups of 10 decision makers (i.e., individuals characterized by a given accuracy level) and confronted these individuals with a number of decision cases.</p><p>We then investigated the strength and direction of the correlation between the observed decision similarity and decision accuracy, while varying (i) the number of observations used to calculate decision similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">25</ref>, and 100), and (ii) the degree to which the decisions of different individuals are correlated with each other (0, 0.5, and 1.0; see Materials and Methods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2B</head><p>shows the results of this analysis. Within each subpanel, the different tiles correspond to the different populations (i.e., accuracy distributions) of the associated tiles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Fig. 2A</ref>. While tiles below the diagonal (i.e., alpha &gt; beta) correspond to populations with an average individual accuracy above 0.5, tiles above the diagonal (i.e., alpha &lt; beta) correspond to populations with an average individual accuracy below 0.5. Importantly, as can be seen from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Fig. 2B</ref>, independent of the specific accuracy distribution, whenever the average individual accuracy in the population exceeds 0.5 (tiles below the diagonal), we find a positive correlation between decision similarity and accuracy. As expected, the strength of this correlation increases as (i) more observations are available to calculate decision similarity (moving from the left to the right panels) and (ii) decisions of individuals are less correlated with each other (moving from the bottom to the top panels). Importantly, the correlation between decision similarity and accuracy can be observed in almost all scenarios (with the exception of the most extreme scenario of few samples and maximally correlated decisions). Our analysis thus strongly suggests that the similarity-accuracy relationship is robust.</p><p>Despite having considered a broad range of conditions in our numerical simulations, these simulations do not cover all conceivable scenarios. For simplicity, we have assumed that correlations do not differ systematically between subgroups of individuals and/or cases. In the presence of such systematic differences, scenarios are conceivable where the positive correlation between decision similarity and accuracy will not be observed, even when the average accuracy of individuals exceeds 0.5 (see Supplementary Materials for an example).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical analysis: Identifying high-performing individual decision makers</head><p>Our analysis above suggests that selecting decision makers based on their decisions' similarity to others should be a powerful and broadly applicable approach to identifying high performers. To test this prediction in real-world contexts, we analyzed data from several published data sets from three domains: medical diagnostics, geopolitical forecasting, and general knowledge. showing thatin line with our results above, Eq. (4)high similarity is associated with high accuracy for cases in which the majority of the population is correct (a.k.a. "kind" cases), but not for cases in which the minority of the population is correct (a.k.a. "wicked" cases). <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref> shows that the positive relationship between similarity and accuracy is also observed when using the continuous probability scale in the forecasting data set (rather than the binary yes/no scale).</p><p>To test whether the correlation between decision similarity and accuracy can be exploited to predict which individuals are high performers, we completed cross-validation procedures using training and test sets. In the training set, we calculated the similarity measure as above and selected individuals on that basis.</p><p>We then looked at the performance of the selected individuals in the test set. To investigate how the number of decisions used to calculate decision similarity and the selection criterion (i.e., threshold of decision similarity) affected the selected individuals' performance, we repeated this analysis for training sets ranging from 0 to 60 cases in size and using selection criteria ranging from including individuals whose decision similarity was among the top 50%, top 25%, or top 5% in the training set (see Materials and Methods). <ref type="figure">Fig.   4</ref> shows the results of this analysis: In each of the three domains (medical diagnostics, geopolitical forecasting, and general knowledge), selecting individuals based on decision similarity is indeed a powerful way to select high performers. Even when evaluating only a small number of cases in the training set and using a lenient selection criterion (e.g., top 50%), our approach succeeds in selecting individuals who perform substantially above average in the test set. Moreover, as we increase the size of the training set and/or apply a stricter selection criterion, the average accuracy of the selected individuals increases. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> focuses on selecting a subset of high performers from a relatively large pool of individuals (101 for breast cancer, 40 for skin cancer, 90 for geopolitical events, and 99 for city demographics). The same approach can be used to identify (relatively) low performers ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. S5</ref>) and to select high and low performers from pools as small as three individuals <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">(Fig. S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wisdom of crowds: Identifying high-performing groups</head><p>The similarity-accuracy relationship also has important implications for harnessing the "wisdom of crowds" when pooling multiple decision makers' independent decisions pertaining to the same case <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(23)</ref>. One of the most commonly used aggregation rules is the majority rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">25)</ref>, which is known to outperform individual decision making in a variety of contexts, including medical diagnostics and forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(30)</ref>. All other things being equal, the performance of the majority rule will increase with the average accuracy of the decision makers in that groupprovided individuals are, on average, more often correct than not <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">31)</ref>. Consequently, our analysis above suggests that under a majority rule, groups consisting of individuals with relatively high decision similarity should outperform groups with relatively low similarity because the individuals' decision similarity is positively correlated to their accuracy. To test this prediction pertaining to groups empirically, within each data set, we randomly sampled groups of three individuals and combined their decisions using the majority rule (i.e., we selected, for each case, the decision that received either two or three votes). We then investigated how the average decision similarity among group members affected their collective accuracy. Consistent with our prediction, we find a positive relationship between decision similarity and collective accuracy (filled dots To test whether this relationship can be exploited to identify high-performing groups of individuals from a larger pool of groups, we again ran cross-validation procedures using training and test sets (see Materials and Methods). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">Fig. 6</ref> shows the results: In each of the three domains, selecting groups of individuals with a high average decision similarity is indeed a powerful method of identifying highperforming groups. Mirroring our results above, as we increase the size of the training set and/or apply a stricter selection criterion, the accuracy of the groups increases. While <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">Fig. 6</ref> focuses on identifying highperforming groups, the same approach can be employed to identify low-performing groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">(Fig. S8</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Similarity to the majority</head><p>While our analyses above are based on the average decision similarity of individuals to others, a closely related approach is based on the similarity of individuals to the majority decision (i.e., the frequency of cases for which an individual makes the same decision as the majority). In the Supplementary Materials we show that both approaches give rise to qualitatively the same analytical predictions, implying that qualitatively the same empirical results are to be expected when selecting individuals based on their similarity to the majority decision. In line with this, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">Fig. S9</ref> shows that, in each of the four data sets, there is indeed a tight positive correlation between an individual's average decision similarity to others and that individual's similarity to the majority decision. Thusas in the case of average decision similarity to others -there is a positive correlation between an individual's similarity to the majority decision and that individual's accuracy ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. S10</ref>) and this relationship also permits the identification of high-performing individuals and groups.</p><p>Note that selecting individuals with the highest similarity valuesbe it the average decision similarity to others or the similarity to the majoritydoes not imply that these approaches aim to approximate the performance of the majority rule. To see this, note that both similarity measures tightly correlate with decision accuracy. Selecting the most similar individuals thus aims at selecting the most accurate individuals whichdependent on the distribution of accuracies and the group sizemay perform systematically better or worse than the majority rule (see Supplementary Materials for examples).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>To summarize, based on a general mathematical argument and numerical simulations, we predicted that in binary decision problems in which individuals are on average more often correct than not (i) an individual's decision similarity to others is tightly correlated with that individual's decision accuracy and (ii) this correlation can be used to identify high-performing individuals and groups of decision makers. Our analyses of four large data sets from three domains (medical diagnostics, geopolitical forecasting, and general knowledge) confirm these predictions. Based on these findings, we propose a widely applicable and robust method of identifying high-performing individuals and groups for binary decision problems. This method is captured by a simple and easily applicable heuristic: Faced with the task of identifying high performers from a pool of candidate decision makers (whose decision accuracy is unknown), observe a series of decisions of individuals and select those individuals (or groups) who make decisions that are most similar to others.</p><p>The practical utility of our approach resides in the fact that our method relies solely on input that is readily observable and does not require any knowledge about individuals' past performance. However, it does require that the average individual accuracy in the pool of candidate decision makers exceeds 50%</p><p>[see Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref> The positive relationship between similarity to others and accuracy can break down when correlations differ systematically between different subgroups of individuals and/or cases (see Supplementary Materials for an example). The data sets we investigated, however, did not provide any evidence for this. Also, in our data sets, the tight positive relationship between decision similarity to others and accuracy is only observed for cases in which the majority is correct <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">(Fig. S3</ref>). For such "kind" cases, individuals making the correct decision also had higher decision similarity. However, for "wicked" cases, we did not observe this relationship, showing thatwhile our approach does select high-performing individualsit does not succeed in selecting individuals that solve these more difficult cases. Interestingly, Prelec et al. showed that identifying answers that are more popular than people predict can help solving such wicked cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(32)</ref>.</p><p>In our mathematical and numerical analyses we have assumed that each individual decision maker is characterized by a single number corresponding to the probability to be correct in any particular case.</p><p>Although this is a common assumption made for analytical tractability, in many binary decision and categorization problems, the world is in one of two (or more) states (33, 34) (e.g., cancer present vs. cancer absent) and the accuracy of an individual may differ between these states (e.g., sensitivity versus specificity of a decision maker). A more general framework would thus characterize each individual by multiple accuracies corresponding to the accuracies in each of these states. It will be interesting to investigate the consequences of such a more general conceptualization for the here developed ideas.</p><p>It is widely held that groups must harbor high diversity to maximize collective performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">36)</ref>. When selecting members of decision-making groups, it is worth remembering that diversity is multidimensional and complex, encompassing individual differences on dimensions ranging from gender, ethnicity, age, and educational background to cognitive diversity and the correlation of errors among decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">38)</ref>. Although some dimensions of diversity are known to boost collective accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">36)</ref>, other dimensions can have negative consequences for collective performance, as illustrated here.</p><p>Counterintuitively, selecting individuals who make similar decisions collectively outperforms selecting individuals whose decisions are dissimilar. Bahrami and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">40)</ref> recently showed that two heads collectively outperform the ability of any single pair member whenever the pair members are of similar visual sensitivity (see also 7). Whether (and when) decision similarity reflects similarity in visual sensitivity or, perhaps, can complement it, is an interesting avenue for future research.</p><p>A related question is what underlies the observed differences in agreement level between decision makers. Einhorn (41) distinguishes between agreement "in fact" and agreement "in principle", the former referring to agreement of actual decisions, whereas the latter has to do with agreement about information and how it should be weighted in formulating a decision. Since we only have evaluated agreement "in fact", we cannot evaluate the extent to which the decision makers would agree in principle and it will be interesting to investigate this issue in future research. Future work could also focus on the question to what extent the differences in agreement are the direct result of differences in individual accuracies (the approach we have followed here, but see Supplementary Materials), or whether there are additional sources of covariation. For example, by using the kappa statistic (instead of percentage agreement), which is a measure of interrater agreement that quantifies the agreement beyond that already expected by chance.</p><p>Our approach shares similarities to cognitive models based on cultural consensus theory (CCT) that use the agreement among individuals in answering a common set of questions to simultaneously estimate individuals' competences, response tendencies, and the "culturally correct" answers to the questions--by up-weighting the opinions of individuals with higher estimated competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(45)</ref>. While a CCT approach is based on cognitive models aimed at describing the cognitive process involved in answering questions by estimating latent variables, our approach is substantially simpler: Instead of making assumptions about the cognitive process underlying decisions, it simply focuses on identifying individuals or groups with high future performance. Notwithstanding those differences, both approaches illustrate how agreement among people can be used to improve decision-making systems.</p><p>The finding that decision similarity can be harnessed to predict the future performance of individuals and groups is both powerful and intriguingly simple. While we tested this prediction in medical diagnostics, geopolitical forecasting, and a general knowledge task, we expect similar results in other binary decision problems. Further developing and testing our approach in non-binary decision making contexts will be an important next step (see also <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>). We believe that the decision similarity-accuracy relationship offers a powerful new avenue to improving real-world systems of individual and collective decision-making.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numerical simulations</head><p>From each of the different populations of decision makers ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Fig. 2A</ref>), we repeatedly sampled sets of 10 decision makers. Each of these 10 decision makers was characterized by a single value i p indicating its average individual accuracy. Next, given this average accuracy, each of these decision makers evaluated M cases (10, 25, or 100). To illustrate, a decision maker with i p = 0.7 evaluating 100 cases would be characterized by a vector of 100 values where each value is either a 0 (incorrect decision) or 1 (correct decision), drawn from a Bernouilli distribution with probability 0.7 for a correct decision.</p><p>To study the effect of correlations between the decisions of different decision makers, we used an "opinion leader" approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(25)</ref>. One of the 10 individuals was randomly assigned as the "opinion leader"</p><p>and we fixed the sequence of its decisions (i.e., the sequence of 0s and 1s). Then, for all remaining individuals, the sequence of their decisions was paired to the opinion leader's sequence, depending on a correlation parameter p ( 01 c p  ). In particular, starting at case i=1, for each case, with probability (1 -p ) we randomly selected a decision from the set of remaining cases from that individual (i.e., decisions from cases j that have not yet been selected, ji  ), and with probability p we took the same decision as the decision of the opinion leader from this set. If the same decision was not present in the set of remaining decisions of that individual, we randomly selected a decision from this set. We then moved on to the next case i+1. This procedure thus introduces different levels of correlation between decision makers, ranging from 0 (maximum amount of independence) to 1 (maximum amount of dependence) while not changing the frequency of 0s and 1s for each decision maker. Note that even if p = 1, there can still be disagreement between a pair of raters, namely when the number of 0s and 1s in their respective vectors are not equal. population accuracy distribution ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Fig. 2A</ref>), we repeated this procedure 2,500 times, and we show values averaged across all repetitions (color codes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Fig. 2B</ref>).</p></div>

All participating dermatologists had at least five years of experience in dermoscopy practice, teaching, and research. They first underwent a training procedure in which they familiarized themselves with the study's definitions and procedures in web-based tutorials with 20 sample skin lesions. They subsequently evaluated skin lesions in a two-step online procedure. First, they used an algorithm to differentiate melanocytic from nonmelanocytic lesions.</p><p>Whenever a lesion was evaluated as melanocytic, dermatologists were asked to classify it as either melanoma or a benign melanocytic lesion, using four different algorithms. Here, we focus on the diagnostic algorithm with the highest diagnostic accuracy, which is also the one most widely used for melanoma detection: pattern analysis. It uses a set of global (textured patterns covering most of the lesion) and local features (representing characteristics that appear in part of the lesion) to differentiate between melanomas and benign melanocytic lesions. We treated the decision to classify a lesion as melanoma as a positive test result.</p><p>The review board of the Second University of Naples waived approval because the study did not affect routine procedures.

This is a large-scale forecasting project, running over several years and using a wide variety of participants and settings (e.g., training schedules, team competitions). We used data from the first year of the forecasting project (47). In this year, 102 questions, such as "Will Serbia be officially granted EU candidacy by 31 December 2011?" and "Will the Nikkei 225 index finish trading at or above 9,500 on 30 September 2011?" had to be forecasted. Participants were asked to estimate the probability of the future event. We excluded questions with more than two possible answers and questions for which the correct answer could not be irrefutably determined (n = 8).</p><p>We excluded forecasters who did not complete all remaining 94 questions, resulting in 90 forecasters. The total data set we used thus contained 8,460 forecasts by 90 forecasters on 94 geopolitical events. Sometimes, forecasters updated their forecasts over time, thereby giving multiple responses. In such cases, we used their first forecast only. To investigate the case of binary decision making, we converted the probability scores into 0 (probabilities &lt; 0.5) and 1 (probabilities &gt; 0.5). 0.5 scores were randomly converted to either 0 or 1. In <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>, we investigate a scenario when using the probability scores directly without any conversion. Participants were free to enter the forecasting competition, and the subject pool consisted of a mix of laypeople and geopolitical experts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical analysis: Individual decision makers, cross validation</head><p>To study the relationship between individuals' decision similarity and decision accuracy, we calculated, within each data set, each individual's accuracy. For the forecasting and the general knowledge data set, we used proportion correct. For the medical data sets, we used balanced accuracy, defined as (Sensitivity + Specificity)/2. This implies weighting the misclassification errors of positive and negative cases inversely proportional to their prevalence; in case of a 50% prevalence, balanced accuracy reduces to proportion correct. Using balanced accuracy circumvents the problem that proportion correct faces, namely that when the prevalence becomes highly asymmetric, one can always perform well by always predicting the more frequent outcomes (e.g., if the prevalence of cancer is 10%, always predicting no cancer gives a proportion correct of 90%, but a balanced accuracy of 50%). Next, we calculated each individual's average decision similarity. For this we used the percentage agreement, which ranges from 0 (never made the same decision for a case) to 1 (always made the same decision for all cases). To quantify the relationship between average decision similarity and individual accuracy <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>, we used Spearman's rank correlations (cor.test) in R (version 3.4.4).</p><p>To test whether decision similarity can be used to predict high-performing individuals, we performed a cross-validation procedure using a training and test set procedure. Within each data set, we randomly drew m cases to create a training set (varying m from 0 to 60 in steps of 5). Part of the remaining cases were used for forming a test set. As size of the test set, we used the total number of cases in a data set minus the maximum size of the training set (i.e., 60). This assured that, within each data set, the test set size was the same across all number of training images, making the results comparable across training set sizes.</p><p>In the training set, we calculated each individual's average decision similarity with all others (i.e., percentage agreement). We then ranked all individuals based on their decision similarity in the training set and tested their performance in the test set using different similarity thresholds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Fig. 4, Fig. S5</ref>). For example, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> the top 25% corresponds to individuals with the 25% highest decision similarity values in the training set. Similarly, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. S5</ref>, the bottom 25% corresponds to individuals with the 25% lowest decision similarity values in the training set. We repeated each number of training images 1,000 times in each data set, and report averaged values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical analysis: Groups of decision makers, cross validation</head><p>To study the relationship between decision similarity of group members and collective accuracy, we randomly sampled, from each data set, 100 unique groups of n individuals (n = 3 and 9). For each group, we calculated the (i) average individual decision similarity (i.e., the average percentage agreement of all possible pairwise combinations of group members), (ii) average individual accuracy of the group members, and (iii) accuracy of the majority rule ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Fig. 5B-E, Fig. S7</ref>).</p><p>To test whether decision similarity can be used to predict high-performing groups, we performed a cross-validation procedure using a training and test set procedure. Within each data set, we randomly drew m cases to create a training set (varying m from 0 to 60 in steps of 5) and used part of the remaining cases to form a test set, using the procedure described above. Within a training set, we calculated the average decision similarity of each rater and ranked individuals according to their decision similarity. We then created groups of three raters, calculated their average decision similarity, and tested the performance of these groups in the test set using different similarity thresholds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">(Fig. 6, Fig. S8</ref>). For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">Fig. 6</ref> the top 25% corresponds to groups with the 25% highest decision similarity values in the training set. We repeated each number of training images 1,000 times in each data set and report averaged values.   . Decision similarity performs well for cases in which the majority decided correctly, but breaks down for cases in which the minority decided correctly. <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>. The similarity-accuracy relationship is also present when using the continuous probability forecasts.    . In each of the four data sets, the average decision similarity to others tightly correlates with the decision similarity to the majority judgment. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. S10</ref>.

In the presence of such systematic differences, scenarios are conceivable where the positive correlation between decision similarity and accuracy is not observed even when the average accuracy of decision makers exceeds 0.5. To illustrate, consider the scenario where one individual always makes the correct decision, and all others perform imperfect, but above chance with accuracy p , 0.5 1.0 p  . Assume next that, for any given case, all imperfect individuals always make the same decision.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Similarity to majority</head><p>As in the main text, we consider a pool of N decision makers. For each individual i,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1... iN </head><p>, we define the decision similarity to the majority m i S as the frequency of cases for which individual i makes the same decision as the majority of the N decision makers. The expected value of this similarity to the majority is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">( ) (1 ) (1 ), m i i i i i E S p M C p M W       (S1)</formula><p>where i MC and i MW correspond to the probabilities with which the majority of the N decision makers is correct, conditional on individual i being correct or wrong, respectively.

To see this, note that similarity correlates with decision accuracy. Selecting the most similar individual thus aims at selecting the most accurate individuals from a pool of candidate decision makers.</p><p>The most accurate individuals, in turn, often achieve a higher accuracy than the majority rule in relatively small groups with relatively large differences in accuracy (Example 1), while the majority rule often outperforms the most accurate individuals in small groups with small differences in accuracies (Example 2) and in large groups.    accuracy (i.e., the fraction of the population answering a particular case correct) and average decision similarity for individuals who were correct (green dots) and who were incorrect (red dots) on that particular case. Each case is thus represented by two dots, one for individuals being correct, and one for individuals being incorrect on that case. For cases in which the majority was correct (case accuracy &gt; 0.5), the individuals being correct had higher similarity values than the individuals being incorrect; for cases in which the minority was correct (case accuracy &lt; 0.5), this pattern either disappeared (A-C), or even reversed (D). <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>. The similarity-accuracy relationship is also present when using the continuous probability forecasts. To investigate the relationship between similarity and individual accuracy of continuous probabilistic forecasts (rather than binary yes/no forecasts), for each individual, we calculated its mean absolute distance between its own probabilistic forecasts and that of all others. Next, we calculated the average accuracy of each individual using the Brier score, where lower values indicate higher accuracy. As can be seen, analogous to our results for binary forecasts <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3C, main text)</ref>, the closer an individual's forecasts were to other forecasts, the higher its accuracy (i.e., the lower its Brier scores).  To test whether decision similarity can be used to identify high-(and low-) performers in small groups, we performed cross-validation procedures using small groups of different sizes. Within each data set, we randomly sampled n individuals <ref type="bibr">(3, 5, 7, and 9)</ref>. We then randomly sampled m cases to create a training set (varying m from 0 to 60 in 5-step increments), and used part of the remaining cases to form a test set (see Materials and Methods for details). In the training set, we calculated, for each individual, its average decision similarity. We then selected the individual with the highest and the one with the lowest decision similarity and tested the performance of both in the test set. We replicated each combination of group size and number of training images 1,000 times in each data set. The green line ("Average") refers to the average performance of all individuals in the test set.   how an individual's decision similarity to others relates to that individual's decision similarity to the majority, we calculated, within each data set, for each individual, its decision similarity to the majority rule (i.e., the percentage agreement with the majority outcome). Values of 0.5 and 0.7, for example, imply that the individual makes the same decision as the majority in 50% and 70% of the cases, respectively. As can be seen, individuals with a high average decision similarity to others also have a high decision similarity to the majority judgment. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 1A illustrates this tight relationship between decision similarity and accuracy when comparing a focal individual to different benchmark individuals.</figDesc></figure>

Arguably, it is a reasonable expectation that in many, if not most, binary decision problems, this condition is fulfilled. Moreover, while information on individuals' relative performance can be noisy, difficult, and costly to obtainor unavailableour approach requires only population-level information about whether or not individuals in the pool of candidate decision makers are on average more often correct than not. For practical implementation, we have two concrete recommendations. First, since our method aims at distinguishing between high-and low-performing individuals and groups, the utility of our approach increases the larger the expected performance differences between individuals in a domain are. Second, in all four data sets, we found that observing around 20-30 decisions was enough to reliably identify high-performing individuals(Fig. 4)and groups (Fig. 6), as well as low-performing individuals and groups (Fig. S5 and Fig. S8, respectively).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_17"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Analytical predictions: Decision similarity is tightly associated with decision accuracy in binary decision problems. (A) When compared to a benchmark individual with 0.5 p  , the expected decision similarity () i ES of an individual i increases with its accuracy level i p ; the different lines correspond to benchmark individuals with different levels of accuracy. (B) When comparing the decisions of individuals to all other individuals in a pool of candidate decision makers, the expected average decision similarity of individuals is tightly correlated with individual accuracy, as long as the average accuracy of individuals in the pool is above 0.5 (more precisely: as long as the average accuracy of individuals remains above 0.5 after excluding every possible pair of individuals, see main text). The panel illustrates this for a pool of 10 decision makers with decision accuracies of 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, … 1.0, respectively. The expected decision similarity is calculated using Eq. (3) in the main text.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_18"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Numerical simulations: The similarity-accuracy relationship is observed when similarity is calculated from few samples and the decisions of different individuals are correlated with each other. (A) For the numerical simulations, we sampled decision makers from a wide range of populations of decision makers differing in their performance distribution (x-axis: individual accuracy; y-axis: probability density). We created those by systematically varying the two shape parameters alpha (values on top) and beta (values on the right) of the beta distribution. Dashed vertical lines indicate chance level of raters (i.e. accuracy of 0.5). (B) The average correlation coefficient between decision similarity and accuracy for 10 raters making 10, 25, and 100 decisions (subpanel columns) and for different degrees of correlations (0, 0.5, and 1; subpanel rows) between the decisions of different individuals (see Materials and Methods).</figDesc></figure>

(A) Illustrative example of the relationship between the expected average decision similarity, the average individual accuracy of group members (open dots), and the expected performance of the majority rule (filled dots), for eight groups of three identical decision makers with accuracies of 0.60, 0.65, … 0.95, respectively. Decision similarity is calculated using Eq. (3), and the expected accuracy of the majority rule is calculated using the binomial distribution given by  . (B-E) As predicted, in all data sets, we find a strong positive correlation between the average decision similarity among group members and their collective performance under the majority rule (filled dots and solid robust regression lines). This pattern is driven by a strong positive relationship between the average decision similarity among group members and the average individual performance of group members (open dots, dashed robust regression lines).

As can be seen, in all data sets, selecting groups of individuals based on decision similarity substantially increases the average collective performance. As predicted, the performance of the selected groups of individuals in the test set increases with the number of training images as well as with a stricter threshold value. The purple line ("Average") refers to the average majority-rule performance of all groups in the test set.

Here, the majority rule achieves an accuracy of 0.75 and the expected average decision similarities of the three decision makers to others are 0.52, 0.52 and 0.54, respectively (expected decision similarity to the majority: 0.75, 0.75 and 0.79, respectively). Thus, in this scenario, the individual with the highest similarity (i.e., the most accurate decision maker) outperforms the majority rule. Consider three decision makers with accuracies 0.7, 0.75 and 0.8. Here, the majority rule achieves an accuracy of 0.85 and the expected average decision similarities of the three decision makers to others are 0.61, 0.63 and 0.64, respectively (expected decision similarity to the majority: 0.79, 0.82 and 0.84, respectively). Thus, in this scenario, the individual with the highest similarity (i.e., the most accurate decision maker) performs worse than the majority rule.</figDesc></figure>

(A-D) To further study the relationship between individuals' accuracy levels and decision similarity with others on a population level, we created, for each data set, a network in which nodes represent individuals (nodes are colored according to individual accuracy: dark/light shades = 50% most/least accurate individuals) and edges represent above median decision similarity between raters.That is, lines connect raters that have a relatively high level of agreement in their decisions. We used the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, which minimizes the distance between pairs of individuals with high decision similarity. Decision similarity between individuals was thus the sole basis for creating the network. As can be seen, in all data sets, high-performing individuals cluster in the center of the network, whereas lowperforming individuals are scattered at the network periphery. Low performers thus not only made dissimilar decisions to high performers but also to other low performers; that is, while high performance unfolds in a similar way, poor performance unfolds in different ways. (C, D) Several nodes are isolated from all other nodes, implying that the pairwise similarity values of these individuals with any other individual in the population are below the median.</figDesc></figure>

Similarly, for the forecasting data set, the correctness of the forecasts was determined from follow-up research.Fig. S1shows that in each of the data sets (i) decision makers differ substantially in their individual performance, (ii) average individual accuracy is substantially above chance level, and (iii) decisions of different individuals are moderately correlated.</figDesc><table><row><cell>In particular, we investigated (i) a breast cancer data set, comprising 15,655 diagnoses by 101 radiologists based on 155 mammograms (17); (ii) a skin cancer data set, comprising 4,320 diagnoses by 40 dermatologists based on 108 dermoscopic images of skin lesions (18); (iii) a geopolitical forecasting data set from the Good Judgment Project, containing 8,460 forecasts by 90 forecasters of 94 geopolitical events (19); and (iv) a data set on general knowledge questions (here: which of two cities is larger), containing 99,000 decisions by 99 individuals on 1,000 questions (20). For the medical data sets, the patient's actual health state (i.e., cancer present vs. absent) decision accuracy, we created, within each data set, all possible pairs of decision makers and calculated, for each pair, their percentage agreement. As in our analysis above, each individual's average decision similarity was defined as its average percentage agreement with all other individuals. As predicted, we found a strong positive correlation in all four data sets between an individual's average decision similarity and accuracy (Fig. 3; Spearman's rank correlations: breast cancer: rs = 0.56, P &lt; 0.001; skin cancer: rs = 0.83, P &lt; 0.001; geopolitical events: rs = 0.84, P &lt; 0.001; city demographics: rs = 0.84, P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the network graphs in Fig. S2 illustrate that while high performers are similar to other high performers, low performers are not similar to other low performers. That is, high performers perform well was known from follow-up research (see To test our basic prediction that individuals' decision similarity is positively correlated with their in the same way, whereas low performance is poor in myriad ways.

To avoid having the same radiologist evaluate a case twice, we excluded all cases from stage that had already been viewed by that radiologist in stage 1. Moreover, we only included cases present in all four test sets in order to ensure that each radiologist evaluated the same set of cases, resulting in 155 unique cases. Between the two stages, radiologists were randomly assigned to one of three intervention treatments. Because there were no strong treatment differences (46), we pooled the data from stages 1 and 2. In our analysis, we treated the recommendation that a woman should be recalled for further examination as a positive test result.</figDesc><table /><note>). Radiologists evaluated the cases in two stages. In stage 1, four test sets were created, each containing 109 cases. Radiologists were randomly assigned to one of the four test sets. In stage 2, one test set containing 110 cases was created and presented to all radiologists. Some of the cases used in stage 2The breast cancer data were assembled at the BCSC Statistical Coordinating Center (SCC) in Seattle and analyzed at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany. Each registry received institutional review board approval for active and passive consent processes or was granted a waiver of consent to enroll participants, pool data, and perform statistical analysis. All procedures were in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. All data were anonymized to protect the identities of women, radiologists, and facilities.</note></figure>
