			<abstract>
				<p>A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards-considered as expectations about the future availability of events-decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>"It is loss which teaches us about the worth of things." -Arthur Schopenhauer In psychology and neuroeconomics, it is well documented that the impending loss of an opportunity or resource often enhances its desirability, as individuals become more attuned to its potential unavailability <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ariely, 2008)</ref>. This effect is widely exploited in marketing strategies, such as limited-time offers, which capitalize on the increased perceived value of a product when availability is restricted <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cialdini, 2001)</ref>. Similarly, in behavioral economics, the prospect of losing access to a resource can trigger heightened urgency and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Frederick et al., 2002)</ref>. More anecdotally, a common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. A classic example in marketing is when people are willing to pay more for a fly when only few tickets remain available. Understanding the mechanisms behind these changes in subjective value is crucial for developing a comprehensive framework of human valuation and motivation. However, a fundamental question remains: why do we tend to assign more value to something that we are about to lose?</p><p>Classical accounts of this phenomenon are based on well-established psychological principles, including loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979)</ref>, the fear of missing out (FOMO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref>, the endowment effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Thaler, 1980)</ref>, and the scarcity principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cialdini, 2001)</ref>. Loss aversion suggests that people weigh potential losses more heavily than equivalent gains, leading to stronger motivation to retain what they already possess. The endowment effect further reinforces this by indicating that people tend to overvalue items they own simply because they own them. Meanwhile, the scarcity principle states that items become more attractive as they become less available, an idea extensively used in marketing and decision-making studies. However, while these explanations capture behavioral tendencies, they remain largely descriptive rather than mechanistic. Concepts like FOMO and scarcity appeal to observed effects but do not explain why people exhibit these behaviors at a fundamental cognitive or computational level.</p><p>That is, they identify what happens but do not specify the underlying processes that generate these changes in subjective value. A complete account requires a formalized, predictive model that explains how and why subjective value increases when opportunities become scarce.</p><p>In this study, we approach the problem from the perspective of a reference-based theory of subjective value, where valuation depends on dynamically shifting reference points or standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rigoli and Pezzulo, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kopp and O'Doherty, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">KÅ‘szegi and Rabin, 2006)</ref>. According to reference-based theories, an event's perceived value can increase as external or internal standards decline. Crucially, we assume that the standard reflects an expectation of the number of valuable events that will occur in the future, such as how often one expects to see a friend or find a good job from now on. Based on this principle, we suggest that a meeting with a friend seems more valuable when the friend is about to leave, and a job offer appears more attractive when market conditions deteriorate-both due to a lowered reference point, meaning that the expectation of these future opportunities has diminished. Likewise, a reduced reference point increases the motivation to exert effort to attain a valued event, such as spending extra time with a friend or intensifying job applications. This paper quantitatively models this effect and examines how subjective value and effort allocation evolve in response to shifting expectations. Instead of focusing solely on ownership or scarcity, our model considers how expectations about an event's future availability shape its subjective value. By doing so, we offer a more computationally precise account of why perceived value changes over time.</p><p>In the remainder of this article, we formally introduce our reference-based theory of how subjective value changes as a deadline approaches (e.g., when a friend is about to leave). We then present a series of simulations that manipulate uncertainty about reference standards to examine their effects on the subjective value of events (e.g., meeting the friend). Finally, we explore how shifting subjective values influence effortbased decisions (e.g., whether to invest effort in meeting the friend). We demonstrate that, as the deadline nears, the perceived value of an event increases, leading to greater motivation and effort to secure it. This novel framework provides a mechanistic explanation for why people tend to value things more when they are about to lose them, with implications for psychology, neuroeconomics, and marketing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>In this section, we introduce the two fundamental equations that form the basis of our simulations, one for subjective value and one for effort-based decisions.</p><p>The subjective value function used in this study assumes that the perceived value of an event depends on a reference standard and on the uncertainty associated with that standard, in a nonlinear way. As explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rigoli and Pezzulo, 2022)</ref>, the rationale is that subjective value is not determined in isolation, but, rather, in relation to expectations shaped by past experiences and contextual factors. When the reference standard shifts-such as when a deadline approaches-the perceived value of the same event or outcome can change dynamically.</p><p>The subjective value function is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V (E) = 1 1 + e âˆ’ Eâˆ’Âµ Ïƒ<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where E represents the event or outcome to be evaluated (e.g., meeting a person), Âµ is the reference standard (e.g., how many times one expects to meet the person in the future), and Ïƒ represents uncertainty about the standard. This formulation ensures that as the standard Âµ declines over time-such as when opportunities become scarcer-the subjective value of events E increases accordingly. Specifically, as Âµ declines, the term E âˆ’ Âµ becomes larger, shifting the function toward a higher subjective value. This illustrates how, as opportunities become scarcer, their perceived importance increases, even if their objective value remains unchanged. Additionally, the function exhibits nonlinearities due to the sigmoidal shape of the exponential term and includes the uncertainty parameter Ïƒ, which modulates the rate at which subjective value increases as standards decline.</p><p>In addition to modeling subjective value, we capture how declining standards influence the willingness to exert effort to realize a valuable event. For this, we use two alternative ways to model effort-based decisions.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein-FlÃ¼gge et al. (2016)</ref>, the first model computes the probability of choosing to exert effort based on the difference between the subjective value of an event requiring effort, V (E L ), and the subjective value of a missed event after not investing effort, V (E S ). For example, if the even regards meeting a friend who is about to leave the country, V (E L ) represents the subjective value of having a long meeting with the friend, which requires effort (e.g., freeing time), while V (E S ) represents the subjective value of having a short meeting with the friend, which does not require effort. The decision probability is derived from a logistic function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (Effort) = 1 1 + e âˆ’Î²(V (E L )âˆ’V (E S ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P (Effort) represents the probability of making an effort-based decision, Î² is an inverse temperature parameter that controls the sensitivity to value differences, V (E L ) is the subjective value of the event requiring effort, and V (E S ) is the subjective value of the event not requiring effort. This formulation ensures that as the perceived benefit of exerting effort increases relative to the alternative, the probability of choosing effort also increases. In this model, we do not explicitly include an effort cost (e.g., the cost of freeing time to ensure a longer visit to the friend) since it would merely act as a constant, not altering the form of the function.</p><p>The second model computes the probability of choosing to exert effort based on the difference between the subjective value of an event requiring effort, V (E L ) and a fixed effort cost.</p><p>This decision probability is derived from a logistic function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (EffortFixedCost) = 1 1 + e âˆ’Î²(V (E L )âˆ’cost)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Where cost is the fixed effort cost.</p><p>Below, we illustrate simulations using the equations of subjective value and effort-based decisions to simulate the effects of an approaching deadline. These simulations demonstrate how the interplay between subjective value and effort-based decision-making evolves as the deadline draws nearer, showcasing the dynamic nature of decision-making under time constraints.</p><p>3 Results</p><p>Here, we simulate how declining standards affect the subjective value of events and the willingness to exert effort to realize more valuable ones. For illustrative purposes, we consider two events: having a longer (E L ) or shorter (E S ) meeting with a friend who is about to leave. The former is more appealing but requires effort, whereas the latter is less appealing but requires no effort.</p><p>We examine how the subjective values of these two events, calculated using Equation 1, evolve as a function of declining standards Âµ over time, where standards are interpreted as "the expected number of future meetings with the friend," as well as the uncertainty Ïƒ associated with these standards. Finally, we simulate how declining standards influence the probability of engaging effort to realize the more valuable event (the long meeting, E L ). We consider both a situation in which the decision is made by comparing the subjective values of the long and the short meetings (P (Effort), i.e., Equation 2) and a situation in which the decision is made by comparing the subjective value of the long meeting with a fixed effort cost, set to 0.4 (P (EffortFixedCost) i.e., Equation 3). In the simulation, we set the objective values of the long (E L ) and the short (E S ) meetings to 1 and 0.1, respectively, and the effort cost to 0.4. Furthermore, we let the standard decrease from 10 to 0 across 10 time steps -capturing the idea that 10 meetings withe the friend are initially expected, decreasing to zero with time. We consider the case of three different levels of uncertainty about the standard (Ïƒ = 2, 5, 10). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the results of the simulation. This simulation illustrates that as the number of times one expects to meet the friend decreases ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A)</ref>, the subjective value of having long or short meetings with the friend increase ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. This happens because the logistic function is sensitive to changes in the denominator. When Âµ decreases, the denominator of the function shrinks, leading to an overall increase in subjective value of events. However, the subjective value of the long meeting increases faster than the subjective value of the short meeting. Consequently, the probability of engaging effort to ensure a longer meeting also increases. This result holds both when effort-based decisions depend on the difference between the subjective values of the long versus the short meetings ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>) and when they depend on a comparison with a fixed effort cost ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1D</ref>) -but the numerical results are different in the two cases. Finally, and importantly, the increases in subjective value and probability of engaging effort are more prominent when the uncertainty about the standard is lower. These results highlight the role of the standard and uncertainty in shaping the perceived value of events and the willingness to engage effort to realize them. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Simulation results. The plots show how the subjective value of events and the probability to invest effort to realize them change, as the standard decreases over time. (A) The standard (e.g., how many times one expects to meet a friend in the future) decreases from 10 to 0. (B) The subjective value of an event requiring effort E L (e.g, having a long meeting with the friend) and of an event not requiring effort E S (e.g., having a short meeting with the friend). The initial values of E L and E S are set to 1 and 0.1, respectively. The simulation considers three levels of Ïƒ: 2, 5 and 10. (C) Probability to engage effort to realize an event requiring effort E L (e.g, having a long meeting with the friend) when compared against an event not requiring effort E S (e.g., having a short meeting with the friend).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>It is often noted that we only appreciate things when we are about to lose them. Various studies show that the impending loss of an opportunity or resource-such as the chance to meet a friend who is about to leave or the opportunity to buy an item with a limited-time offer-often increases its desirability, as individuals become more attuned to its potential unavailability <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ariely, 2008)</ref>. However, mechanistic explanations for this phenomenon are lacking. In this study, we present a model that integrates reference-based subjective value and effort-based decision-making. It captures how individuals assess the value of events relative to a reference standard-representing an expectation about the future availability of events-and the uncertainty surrounding this standard, as well as how they choose to exert effort based on this evaluation.</p><p>A crucial innovation in our model is the conceptualization of the standard as an expectation of the number of valuable events that will occur in the future. This sets apart our proposal from previous reference-based theories, in which the reference is established based upon the history of previous events, not the expectation of future events <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rigoli and Pezzulo, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kopp and O'Doherty, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">KÅ‘szegi and Rabin, 2006)</ref>. This expectation necessarily decreases as a deadline approaches, such as when a valuable person is about to leave or when there is a limited-time offer to purchase a valuable object. Under this framework, when an item is readily available, the reference point remains high and thus the item's subjective value is relatively low.</p><p>However, as the item becomes less availability, the reference point decreases thereby boosting the item's subjective value. This explains why the same event or item can suddenly appear more desirable when it is about to become unavailable, even in the absence of any intrinsic change in its utility.</p><p>Through simulations, we demonstrate that our reference-based model captures the increase in subjective value as the reference standard decreases, along with nonlinearities in the process. Specifically, we observe a disproportionate increase in subjective value when events significantly exceed the reference standard. This aligns with real-world decision-making patterns, where opportunities increase in perceived value as deadlines approach, due to the heightened awareness of their potential unavailability <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cialdini, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Our model also incorporates the probability of exerting effort as a function of the subjective value of two events: one more appealing but requiring effort, and the other less appealing but not requiring effort. We found that the likelihood of choosing to exert effort increases as the deadline approaches, reflecting the faster increase in subjective value of the more appealing event. This outcome highlights how deadlines influence the salience of opportunities and the trade-offs between effort and reward, a pattern commonly observed in real-world decision-making scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariely and Loewenstein, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buehler et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gneezy and Potters, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979)</ref>. A similar pattern emerges when the more appealing event is evaluated against a fixed effort cost (rather than another less appealing event), though in this case, the increase in subjective value is steeper.</p><p>Another key aspect of our model is the inclusion of uncertainty, represented by the parameter Ïƒ. The simulations show that different levels of uncertainty in evaluating events lead to varying sensitivities to changes in the reference standard. Specifically, higher uncertainty results in a flatter subjective value function, making individuals less responsive to changes in outcomes compared to situations with lower uncertainty. This underscores the importance of incorporating uncertainty into decision-making models, as it affects not only the perceived value of outcomes but also the likelihood of engaging in effortful actions.</p><p>The reference-based model we propose expands on the notion of loss aversion as advanced by prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979)</ref>. Based on the principle that losses loom larger than gains, loss aversion implies that people are willing to put more effort to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain of equal amount. In prospect theory, whether an outcome is treated as loss or gain depends on the status quo, that is, on the endowment one currently possesses. By contrast, our reference-dependent model asserts that, rather than being evaluated against the status quo, outcomes are evaluated vis-Ã -vis a reference point reflecting the reward expected in the future; see also <ref type="bibr">Rabin, 2006, 2007)</ref>. In this way, our model explains why the same outcome is treated as less valuable when, for example, because of an approaching deadline, the future reward is expected to be smaller. This phenomenon is harder to explain with the concept of status quo, since this concept refers to the current endowment, and not to the expected future reward.</p><p>Our model offers a formalization of the concept of FOMO. Coined in the marketing literature, this concept refers to a feeling of apprehension triggered by the prospect of missing some important opportunity available <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hodkinson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Milyavskaya et al., 2018)</ref>. Our proposal suggests that, at least in some circumstances, FOMO can be conceptualised as arising from the prospect of a diminished future reward, captured by a lower reference point. Indeed, when one believes that opportunities (e.g., meeting a friend) are plenty in the future (an aspect our model formalises in terms of a large reference point), FOMO does not arise, and people are not willing to put much effort to secure the opportunities available now. By contrast, predicting that opportunities will become scarce in the future (as a small reference point prescribes) will elicit FOMO, reflected in the willingness to exert greater effort to secure the opportunities available at present. Additionally, our model builds upon the research on effort discounting, which posits that individuals often undervalue outcomes that require substantial effort, particularly when uncertainty is involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ariely, 2008)</ref>. By incorporating uncertainty directly into the decision-making process, our model offers a more comprehensive view of how people evaluate trade-offs between effort and reward, moving beyond simple assumptions of linear relationships. This addition enhances the model's ability to capture the complexities of human decision-making, particularly in scenarios where both effort and uncertainty play pivotal roles.</p><p>Similarly, our model relates to theories of procrastination, which suggest that people delay the initiation of a task because they initially undervalue its outcome (due to temporal discounting) or do not perceive it as urgent-until the deadline approaches, prompting a re-evaluation of the task's outcome or an increase in urgency <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akerlof (1991)</ref>; O'Donoghue and Rabin (1999); Durakiewicz (2016); <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Konig and Kleinmann (2005)</ref>.</p><p>Our proposal highlights that the reason the subjective value of events or their urgency increases as deadlines approach is that the standard, which reflects the expectation of future opportunities, declines.</p><p>Finally, our proposal is potentially relevant for the study of psychopathology. Recent work has employed reference-dependent models to explain various forms of mental illness including depression, anorexia, apathy, and addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Rigoli, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rigoli and</ref><ref type="bibr">Martinelli, 2021, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rigoli and Pezzulo, 2023;</ref>.</p><p>Some of these conditions, namely, depression, anorexia, and addiction, have been interpreted as stemming from an exaggerated reference point . For instance, as also classical set-point models suggest <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed and Koob, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Keramati et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Koob and Le Moal, 2001)</ref>, addiction is proposed to arise when repeated drug consumption magnifies the reference point, in turn producing tolerance and withdrawal symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rigoli and Pezzulo, 2023)</ref>. As the example of addiction illustrates, the idea is that some forms of mental illness emerge because past experience has altered the reference point in a dysfunctional</p><p>way. Yet, the present paper suggests that an abnormal reference might not only be caused by past experience, but also by unrealistic expectations about availability of reward in the future. Some types of apathy, for instance, might stem from an inflated expectation about average future reward. In turn, this might lead to discounting the opportunities currently available, and to an unwillingness to exert effort to seize those opportunities-being unwillingness to put effort a cardinal symptom of apathy. A promising research avenue is to examine implications for psychopathology of an inflated reference point due to unrealistic expectations of future rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Parr et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Maisto et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pezzulo et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tschantz et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pezzulo, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barrett et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Seth and Friston, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Paulus et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Van den Bergh et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>While the model presented here offers a self-sufficient explanation for why we appreciate things or people more when we are about to lose them, it could be extended in several directions. One possible extension involves additional factors that contribute to increased valuation as deadlines approach. For example, a limited-time offer might seem more valuable not only because of its scarcity but also due to the anticipated cost of searching for future offers or the potential regret of missing it. Furthermore, future developments could refine the model by incorporating asymmetries in how individuals evaluate gains versus losses, as documented in decision-making research <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979)</ref>. These asymmetries are well-established in the literature and could enhance our understanding of the factors shaping effort-based choices. By extending our model to account for these additional influences, we could more accurately capture the complexities of human decision-making, particularly in contexts where both effort and reward are at stake.</p><p>In conclusion, our model offers a comprehensive framework for understanding subjective value and effortbased decision-making under approaching deadlines, highlighting how these processes are influenced by contextual factors such as expectations and uncertainty. It serves as a useful tool for analyzing the dynamics of subjective value and effort-based decision-making and provides a starting point for empirical data analysis.</p><p>The model can be fitted to human data on subjective value assessment and effort-based decision-making in the presence of a deadline, allowing for the quantitative validation of model predictions and the inference of specific participant parameters (e.g., the initial values they assign to events, their uncertainty, and whether they consider the subjective value of alternative events and/or fixed costs in effort-based decisions).</p></div>
