<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Information about other people is vital for understanding the world, social relationships, and providing help. With so much information available, we must constantly choose whether to seek or avoid it. These choices depend on our preferences for particular information and shape the boundaries of our social knowledge. In two experiments, we examined how people decide between seeking or avoiding information about outcomes affecting others and whether these choices show a preference for good news, shown previously for information about oneself. Participants decided whether to reveal financial outcomes, a potential gain or potential loss each with a known probability (10% to 90%), for themselves or another person. Participants in Experiment 1 (n=205) could 'opt-in' to reveal the outcome or do nothing to avoid knowing it. In Experiment 2 (n=56), an action was required for either option, making seeking and avoiding information equally active. Both experiments demonstrated a clear preference to seek positive over negative information about others. This preference increased with the likelihood of the outcome and crucially, was the same as the preference for good news about outcomes affecting oneself. Individual differences revealed a general tendency to seek or avoid information across domains, but social information-seeking also linked to empathic concern and charitable giving. Together, these findings show the information we seek about others depends on whether it is expected to be positive or negative as well as individual factors. Advancing our understanding of such preferences has vital implications for research across the social sciences, as well as applied importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance statement</head><p>In the age of information, we must constantly choose which information to seek and which to avoid. Other people shape our lives and are a major source of information, but how do we decide whether to find out what is happening to them? Here we show people have the same preference for good news compared to bad news about others as they do for information about themselves. More empathic individuals were more interested in others overall and people who donated more to charity showed increased interest about others relative to themselves. Our results reveal that people filter social information depending on whether it is positive or negative, with implications for how we understand the world and interact with others.</p><p>Our understanding of the world is shaped by the information we receive and information about the experiences of other people are a major source of information. That knowledge is essential for our relationships with others, social decision-making, and being able to help effectively. Yet, with so much information about the lives of others available, we are forced to filter knowledge through choices to seek or avoid information. Therefore, our preferences to seek certain types of social information will influence what we know and what we will forgo by ignorance.</p><p>There are several possible reasons to seek information <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. People can be driven by the instrumental utility of information: how useful it is to reach a goal that requires particular knowledge. People also consider how information will make them feel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. As a result, people seek self-relevant information more often when it is likely to be positive and less often when it is expected to be negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. This effect becomes more pronounced as the probability of positive or negative outcomes increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Our knowledge is therefore shaped by our expectations about the valence -positive or negative -of the information. If this preference also occurs for information about outcomes for other people, it suggests we also anticipate how this social information will make us feel, and this influences choices to seek or avoid it. If information about negative outcomes for others is avoided, we bias our understanding and are more likely to miss the information required to help those who need it most.</p><p>Like self-relevant information, information about others can serve instrumental goals, including learning from others (7), positive social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, and helping others <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. However, whether we decide to seek or avoid information about others based on how it will make us feel is unclear. This can be tested by removing the possibility of acting on information or changing the outcome, therefore removing instrumental utility. Evidence that positive information about outcomes affecting others has intrinsic value comes from research on vicarious reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref> and learning when our actions affect other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. In contrast, people may also avoid information about others to circumvent the emotional, cognitive, physiological, or monetary costs associated with knowing it <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. In the context of belief updating, participants were biased to integrate positive information about the likelihood of events happening to another person (for example a traumatic event is less likely than expected) more readily than negative information (the event is more likely than expected). This optimism bias was also observed for beliefs about the likelihood of events affecting the participant. Strength of the optimism bias for others was enhanced by increasing concern for the person, making them identifiable and likable, suggesting a role for empathic concern in the biasing effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Biased belief updating is relevant when we receive information, but it is unknown how people decide whether to seek information about others in the first place.</p><p>Here, we assessed whether choices to seek or avoid information about what happens to other people depends on the expected positive or negative valence of that information. We also tested if such an effect would vary with the probability of that positive or negative valence, as found for information about the self <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. With no ability to change outcomes for oneself or others, valence-dependent information-seeking would suggest good news about other people has intrinsic value. If preferences are similar between information about oneself and other people, this could be due to an individual's general information-seeking tendencies, which apply across social and non-social contexts, or rely on partially separable processes. We tested these possibilities by examining individual differences in information-seeking across conditions and how social information-seeking linked to concern for others and altruistic behaviour. Empathic concern is an emotional response of compassion and concern caused by the awareness that a person is suffering, though it may reflect a general emotional response to social connection and experiences of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Empathic concern could influence information-seeking through increased interest about other people generally, or the prospect of concern-driven distress. These two potential influences resulted in two distinct hypotheses: that empathic concern would be associated with a general increase in social information-seeking, or alternatively that it would be differentially related to seeking negative compared to positive information about others. Since altruistic behaviour requires a cost for oneself to benefit to others, we also hypothesised that interest in information about others, relative to interest in oneself, would link to generosity in the form of a charitable donation.</p><p>On each trial of the experiments, participants chose between seeking or avoiding information about financial outcomes, over which they had no control <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1a</ref>). These outcomes differed in valence (positive: possibility of winning money or negative: possibility of losing money) and the probability of the outcome. The probability of each win or loss varied between 10% and 90%, in increments of 10%. If the outcome did not occur, there was no change to payments from that trial. On half the trials, the recipient of the outcome was the participant (self) and on the other half outcomes affected another person (other), an anonymous stranger described as in need of money. If participants chose to find out, they were informed whether the payment for themselves or the other person increased or decreased, according to the valence condition, or did not change. If they did not want to find out, they received no information about the outcome of that trial. Choices to find out or not did not impact the payments or the time it took to complete the study. Information was always given if it was requested and never given if it was not requested.</p><p>Participants completed one of two experiments which differed in the type of choice required in the task and therefore whether avoiding information was passive or active. For the opt-in version in Experiment 1 (n=205), participants pressed a key to find out the outcome or did not respond if they did not want to know, meaning information avoidance was passive. This design is relevant to many real-world examples of seeking social information that require an opt-in choice and action to obtain information, for example contacting a friend about the outcome of their job application. However, other situations mean seeking and avoiding information about others require similar actions, for example choosing to watch the news or a fictional program on television. Experiment 2 used a forced-choice version of the task (n=56) that reflected these latter situations, requiring participants to press one key to find out or another to not find out. As well as providing the opportunity to compare determinants of opt-in and forced-choice information-seeking, a version with equally active seeking and avoidance ensures that any valence-dependent effects were not due to an association of valence and motor response. This is important as opt-in choices could be biased by associations between positive information with action or approach and negative information with inaction or avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. For all participants, we also measured empathic concern through the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) (19) subscale and average charitable giving across seven incentivised donation decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We modelled the binary choice to seek or avoid information with generalised linear mixedeffects models (GLMM). The maximal models included fixed and correlated random effects of valence (positive vs. negative), probability (10%-90%), and recipient (self vs. other), with all interactions, as well as trial number and a random participant-level intercept. We reduced these models to find the best converging model for each experiment separately (see Methods), always keeping the participant-level random effect corresponding to each within-subject fixed effect (see Tables S1-S3 for final models). All results replicated between the two experiments unless otherwise specified and statistics are provided in the format: opt-in | forced-choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seeking information about other people shows the same preferences as seeking information about oneself</head><p>Across recipients, participants were more likely to find out information about potential wins (mean opt-in=60.95% | forced-choice=66.93%), compared to potential losses (55.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref>, Tables S1 &amp; S2). This demonstrates that information-seeking is valence-dependent, with a preference for information that could be positive, compared to information that could be negative. Crucially, this preference for good news was the same for self and other. Post-hoc contrasts compared information-seeking about potential wins with potential losses with for each recipient separately (see Methods &amp; <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). These showed a significant preference for positive information for both self <ref type="bibr">(</ref> Next, we examined whether the effect of valence differed depending on the outcome probability, and whether this difference occurred for both self and other. As predicted, information-seeking increased as positive outcomes became more likely but decreased with probability for negative outcomes (GLMM valence*probability interaction OR=0.51 [0.36, 0.72] | 0.15 [0.07, 0.34], z=-3.77 | -4.55, p&lt;0.001 | &lt;0.001). Strikingly, this was the case for outcomes affecting both self and other. Information-seeking increased as positive outcomes became more likely for both outcomes affecting oneself and another person. In contrast participants were less likely to seek information with increasing likelihood of negative outcomes affecting both recipients ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1c</ref> &amp; <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). As with the preference for positive information, post-hoc contrasts showed this diverging effect of probability between the positive and negative conditions was significant in both recipient conditions (negative vs. positive difference for self z=-3.77 | -4.69, p&lt;0.001 | &lt;0.001; other z=-3.17 | -4.15, p=0.002 | &lt;0.001). A Bayesian comparison between self and other of how probability effects differed for positive vs. negative outcomes also found evidence of no difference between recipients (BF10=0.20 | 0.25). In summary, participants' preference for seeking positive information about others was the same as their preference for good news about outcomes affecting themselves. On each trial, participants decided if they wanted to find out or not whether they had won money (positive condition) or lost money (negative condition) for either themselves (self condition, "for yourself") or another person (other condition; "for Player 3"). Each outcome occurred with a set probability of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90% as shown by a pie chart. Bonus money "for yourself" and "for Player 3" was simply a result of the participant completing the study, they could not control the outcomes in any way. In the opt-in version of the task (Experiment 1, n=205; top), participants pressed the space bar within a three-second window to find out the outcome or did not respond if they did not want to know. In the forced-choice version of the task (Experiment 2, n=56; bottom), participants responded with one key to reveal the outcome and another key to avoid the information. Two keyboard keys were linked with the right or left placement of the two eye symbols with the side of the open eye for seeking information and the closed eye for avoiding. The symbols switched sides on each block (36 trials, 4 blocks). (b) Participants found out significantly more often when information could be positive than when it could be negative, and this preference was the same for outcomes affecting self and other in both the opt-in and forcedchoice experiments. Additionally, in the opt-in version, information-seeking was higher for self than other, but this difference was not significant in the forced-choice version. (c) Preferences for positive over negative information are strongest when the positive or negative outcome is most likely. The direction of probability effects in each condition shows increasing information-seeking as positive outcomes become more likely (orange &amp; yellow lines) but decreasing informationseeking as negative outcomes become more likely (blue &amp; green lines; <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). Note: * p&lt;0.05; n.s. not significant.</p><note type="other">53%</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information-seeking preferences are accentuated when both seeking and avoiding information require an active response</head><p>Separate models of information-seeking in the opt-in and forced-choice experiments above demonstrated all key findings replicated between the two samples. This similarity between the two experiments with different choice types shows information-seeking for both self and other depends on valence and probability, regardless of whether information avoidance was passive or required the same effort as seeking information. Next, we tested whether any predictors of information-seeking differed in strength between the two choice types (opt-in or forced-choice) in an additional GLMM including all participants <ref type="table">(Table S3)</ref>. Results showed that the valencedependent effect of probability was even stronger in the forced-choice, compared to the optin experiment (GLMM probability*valence*choice type interaction OR=1.78 [1.20, 2.63], z=2.88, p=0.004; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1c</ref>). That the difference between seeking positive and negative information was largest when both seeking and avoiding required a key press or 'approach' provides strong evidence that valence-dependent information-seeking cannot be explained by existing pairings of positive outcomes with approach and negative outcomes with avoidance. The effect of trial number also depended on choice type, with a larger decrease in interest over time in the opt-in context, compared to forced choices (GLMM trial*choice type interaction OR=0.56 [0.43, 0.74], z=-4.05, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Although preferences for good news were similar for information about self and other, participants generally sought more information about themselves when avoidance of information was passive (opt-in mean for self=60.23%, other=56.25%; GLMM recipient OR=0.83 [0.74, 0.93], z=-3.23, p=0.001). However, when avoidance also required an action, there was no significant bias for information about oneself (forced-choice mean for self=63.47%, other=61.32%; OR=0.94 [0.76, 1.17], z=-0.53, p=0.60). While this could suggest the bias toward self-related information varies between the choice types, the inclusion of a formal interaction between recipient and choice type did not significantly improve the fit of the overall model (p&gt;0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consistency of preferences for information within individuals</head><p>So far, we have shown similarities in how valence and probability affect seeking information about outcomes affecting oneself and someone else across participants. Next, we used an individual differences approach to examine whether participants had similar informationseeking patterns for self and other and between positive and negative contexts. Correlations between the frequency of finding out for all pairs of recipient and valence conditions were significant and strongly positive in both experiments (Rs=0.68-0.76 | 0.39-0.85, ps&lt;0.001 | ps&lt;0.004; <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>), suggesting individuals have a general tendency to seek or avoid information. Participants who found out more about self-relevant outcomes also found out more about outcomes affecting the other person in both valence conditions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2a</ref> &amp; <ref type="table">Table  S5</ref>). Similarly, participants who found out more about positive outcomes also found out more about negative outcomes for both recipients <ref type="table">(Table S5</ref>). There was also a significant positive correlation between self and other in individuals' preference for positive information for the opt-in experiment (R=0.17, p=0.01; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref> &amp; <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>). These findings show that the tendencies to seek information is consistent between outcomes affecting oneself and others within individuals. were also correlated between self and other in the opt-in experiment. (c) Significant positive correlations were also found between self and other in the slope of the probability effect. This was calculated as the regression coefficient for probability predicting choices, calculated for each participant in each valence and recipient condition. A positive slope means information-seeking increased at higher probabilities whereas a negative slope shows decreased information-seeking as probability increased. (d) Differences between the slope of probability in the positive and negative conditions (slope when positiveslope when negative) quantify the increase in valence-dependent information-seeking at higher probabilities. These differences were positively correlated between self and other.</p><p>We next tested the consistency of probability effects between self and other. Probability effects were quantified as the standardised regression coefficient of the slope increasing probabilities (10-90%) for each participant in each recipient-valence condition. A positive slope represents increasing information-seeking as the probability increases (as found for positive outcomes). A negative slope represents less information-seeking at higher probabilities (as seen for negative outcomes). Significant and large positive correlations between the effects of probability (slopes) were present between self and other in each valence condition (Rs=0.  <ref type="table">Table  S5</ref>). These results provide further evidence of similarities in information preferences for outcomes affecting oneself and someone else.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empathic concern and charitable giving are linked to seeking information about others</head><p>While our individual difference results suggest general information-seeking tendencies affect interest in outcomes affecting others, previous evidence also suggests processing outcomes for other people is affected by individual variability in empathy. It is also crucial to understand how interest in outcomes affecting others relates to willingness to help. We therefore examined whether information-seeking about other people relates to individual differences in empathic concern (Interpersonal Reactivity Index subscale) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and prosocial behaviour (how willing people were to donate some earnings they had accumulated in the task to charity; see Methods). Levels of empathic concern and generosity on the charitable giving measure were only moderately correlated with each other (R=0.19 | 0.18, p=0.008 | p=0.23).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empathic concern:</head><p>We tested two hypotheses on the association between information-seeking and empathic concern. First, if empathic concern heightens the prospect of negative feelings from learning bad news but positive feelings from good news, higher empathic concern would be differentially linked to seeking positive and negative information about others. We did not find evidence for this as there was no significant difference in the correlation between seeking positive social other information and seeking negative social other information in either experiment (p=0. <ref type="bibr">40 | p=0.27)</ref>. Second, if empathic concern generally increases interest in outcomes affecting others, those with higher empathic concern would seek more information about others overall, regardless of valence. In support of this second hypothesis, individuals higher in empathic concern generally chose to find out information about outcomes for others in the forced-choice experiment (R=0.31, p=0.028; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3a</ref>; note opt-in experiment R=0.04, p=0.60). The correlation between empathic concern and seeking information about outcomes affecting oneself was not significant (R=-0.01 | 0.15, p=0.89 | p=0.30). Charitable giving: Donating to charity can be motivated by both preventing negative and generating positive outcomes for others. We therefore tested whether willingness to donate to charity was associated with other-regarding preferences (other-self) in information-seeking, across both positive and negative information conditions. Information-seeking for others relative to information-seeking for the self was correlated with charitable giving, such that more generous participants showed greater relative interest in outcomes for other people (R=0.21, p=0.003; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3b</ref>; note forced-choice R=0. <ref type="bibr">10, p=0.49)</ref>. In summary, we show that seeking information about outcomes affecting other people is linked to individual variability in empathic concern and charitable giving.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Information about other people's experiences is vital for understanding our world and connecting with others. However, we cannot know everything and our knowledge is shaped by choices to seek or avoid information, based on our preferences. Here we reveal strong evidence of a preference for good news about outcomes affecting others: people seek positive information more than negative information. Strikingly, this preference was the same as for positive information about themselves and increased with the likelihood of the positive or negative valence. All main results replicated across two experiments. Individual difference results suggest the influence of a general tendency to seek or avoid information that applied across social and non-social contexts. However, it was the difference between informationseeking for self and other that was linked to charitable giving. Empathic concern related to an overall interest in outcomes for others, rather than amplifying the preference for good news.</p><p>Our finding that people seek positive over negative information about outcomes that affect themselves and others extends a growing body of evidence that the expected valence of information influences whether people want to know <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. This has been interpreted as a hedonic utility or value of information in and of itself, due to the role of positive information in maintaining positive beliefs (1). Previous work on seeking self-relevant information has also highlighted the important consequences of this established preference for positive over negative information <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Such valence-dependent patterns in how people seek information and integrate it into their existing beliefs have been linked to positive mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. Avoiding self-relevant information to prevent a detrimental impact on choices or actions can also be beneficial through maintaining commitment toward goals. For example, a healthconscious individual avoids information about unhealthy food options (3). However, ongoing uncertainty about negative information can result in unrealistic optimism and negatively affect choices across diverse domains from health to economics (1).</p><p>Crucially, whether we seek or avoid information about other people also has influential consequences but research on information-seeking in the social domain is limited. One line of work has identified a tendency to avoid information and therefore maintain uncertainty about the possible outcomes of one's moral decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Such "moral wiggle room" can be used, particularly by more selfish individuals, to maintain their self-image despite achieving their goal of acting selfishly <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Evidence that consumers do not request information about the ethical attributes of products such as child labour practices, partially due to anger, also suggests a role of anticipated emotions in seeking or avoiding moral information <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. However, as product information was also relevant for decisions in that task, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that other motivations were driving avoidance. Here, we establish a preference for positive over negative information about others, even when there is nothing participants could do to change the outcome and information was irrelevant to future choices.</p><p>In addition to similarities in information-seeking between outcomes affecting self and other at the group and individual levels, interest in another person was also linked to empathic concern and charitable giving. Specifically, we found that more generous participants were more interested in information about outcomes affecting others relative to themselves and participants higher in trait empathic concern showed greater interest in information about others overall. There was no evidence that empathic concern differentially related to seeking positive compared to negative social information. The similarities and differences between recipient conditions raise exciting questions about how we calculate the value of information about others and whether this depends on (partially) separate algorithms (for example comparing costs and benefits) or implementation (brain areas, circuits, or cells) to information about oneself <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Self-relevant information-seeking and valence effects have been linked to a network of prefrontal and mesolimbic regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> that overlap with regions processing primary rewards, financial gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> and prosocial decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Dopamine signalling is thought to play a role in seeking non-instrumental information <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, and enhancing dopamine function reduced the bias toward seeking positive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Studies using computational modelling also reveal the algorithms for valuing information <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. With our results, these findings provide a framework for future research on social information-seeking.</p><p>Our finding that people have the same preferences in information-seeking for themselves and an anonymous stranger also offers novel insights for theories in social cognition and has important implications for research in this area. Whether or not people value outcomes affecting others, independent of their role in causing them through prosocial actions, is the key distinction between "pure" and "warm-glow" altruism (40) also labelled action and outcomeoriented altruism <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. Previous work on separating these motivations has relied on studies and paradigms which lack statistical power and are very far removed from donation scenarios outside the lab, or inferred motivations from neural activity while participants view outcomes. By measuring information-seeking, rather than just altruism directly, our novel paradigm supports the idea that people value information about positive outcomes affecting others that they had no role in causing and by proxy the outcomes themselves. This provides a novel approach in this research area. Positive links between seeking social information and both individuals' levels of empathic concern and charitable giving further reinforce the relevance of this approach to social motivations and behaviours that affect others. Evidence of valencedependent information-seeking about other people also raises questions about the divergence between experimental measures of social cognition or decision-making and the processes they are trying to capture. Most research on empathy, rewards for others, and prosocial behaviour uses tasks in which participants are not given an option to avoid information about others. In contrast, people usually have opportunities outside of experimental settings to avoid news about others. Combined with evidence that empathy and compassion are often avoided as they require cognitive effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>, our results highlight this issue and the need for experimental tasks that more closely capture how people engage with information in their daily lives.</p><p>The key result of preferences for good news that were the same between self and other and increased with probability was replicated across two experiments that differed in whether decisions were opt-in or forced-choice. For the opt-in task, seeking information was active, requiring a button press, whereas avoiding information was passive. If the participant didn't respond, the default option was to not receive the information. For the forced-choice version, participants pressed one key to seek information or another to avoid information, so the two options were equally active. The stronger preference for positive information in the forcedchoice version demonstrated that pairings between action/approach with positive stimuli and inaction/avoidance with negative stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> do not explain valence-dependent informationseeking. While the two versions showed consistency in the main findings, the individual difference results were not the same across experiments. While this could be interpreted as a lack of replication, differences in how empathic concern and charitable giving related to information-seeking could also be due to the differences between opt-in and forced-choice processes. Opt-in information-seeking is particularly relevant for charitable giving, where learning about potential beneficiaries usually requires actively seeking information that wouldn't be received otherwise. Any future research using the information-seeking task could select a version based on these differences and whether the information-seeking behaviour being studied is usually opt-in or forced choice. It is noteworthy that valence-dependent information-seeking was shown despite minimal outcomes and the other person being an anonymous stranger. This context is particularly relevant for charitable and policy-related decisions. Furthermore, seeking or avoiding information were both free in our paradigm. Future research could qualify the strength of desire for knowledge against varying levels of effort or payment to receive it <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>.</p><p>How people choose to seek or avoid information about others has important implications for understanding and enhancing social interactions and behaviours. We show that choices to find out about outcomes affecting another person depend on whether information is expected to be positive or negative, with a strong preference for good news. This preference for good news was the same for information about outcomes affecting oneself. Seeking information about others was associated with both the tendency to seek self-relevant information but also individual differences in empathic concern and charitable giving. Together, these findings suggest people anticipate how information about others that they cannot act on might affect them and seek positive information accordingly. While this supports the idea that people care what happens to others, it could also result in a biased understanding of the world and missed opportunities to help those that need it. However, individuals more willing to help and show concern are relatively more likely to find out about other people and therefore gain information that could ultimately enable them to connect, cooperate and help.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Experiment 1 includes data from 205 participants (157F, 40M, 1 other gender, 7 unknown; age 18-46, mean 22.6). In total, 226 participants started this experiment but 21 did not complete the information-seeking task or data were lost due to technical issues during testing. An independent sample of 56 participants completed Experiment 2 (43F, 10M; age 17-30, mean 21.1). There was no significant difference in age (Wilcoxon two-sided signed rank test p=0.12) or in the proportion of males and females (χ 2 (1)=0.00, p=0.97) between the two experiments. Participants were recruited on campus or through social networks. Some took part for course credit, and all participants were reimbursed for their time, with the amount depending on the outcomes of the information-seeking task and others not reported here. All experiments were approved by the Sussex University Sciences &amp; Technology Cross-Schools Research Ethics Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information-seeking task</head><p>We adapted a task used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Charpentier et al. (2018)</ref>, which only concerned outcomes for the participant. In the current version, outcomes affected either the participant's payment (self) or the payment of another person (other). This person was described as in need of money, but the participant did not meet them. Trials were either in a positive (win money or no change to payments) or negative (no change to payments or lose money) condition. Each trial presented a probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr">60,</ref><ref type="bibr">70,</ref><ref type="bibr">80</ref> or 90%) of how likely a change in payment (win or loss) was. Participants were informed that winning or losing bonus money (paid at the end of the study) "for yourself" and "for Player 3" was simply a result of their participation and wins or losses were determined by the computer meaning they could not control the outcomes in any way. Probability (10%-90%), valence (positive or negative) and recipient (self or other) conditions were fully crossed. There was one block for each of the four recipient-valence combinations, with each probability presented four times. This resulted in 36 trials per block and 144 trials in total. Of those trials, it was only on every other trial (72 trials) that the participant could find out whether the outcome occurred, and so whether the payment had changed (increased or decreased, depending on the valence). We included trials on which participants could not find out to prevent them tracking the wins and losses for themselves and the other person, as this risked introducing a competitive approach. Trials were quasirandomised so each recipient-valence-probability condition occurred twice on trials where the outcome could be found out and twice when it could not be.</p><p>Participants completed one of two versions of the task, which differed only in how the choice to find out or not was made. Experiment 1 used an opt-in version, so participants had to press the space bar to find out whether the win or loss occurred. If they did not press within three seconds, they did not find out. A countdown of "3, 2, 1" was displayed on the screen during this time. This opt-in choice meant seeking information was active, whereas avoiding information was passive. In Experiment 2 we used a forced-choice version. Participants had to press a key whether they wanted to find out the outcome or not -one key to seek information or a different one to avoid it. This meant that the same level of action was required for either option. In the opt-in version, trials with no opportunity to find out took 2s and trials with an opportunity to find out took 6s, giving an average trial length of 4s plus a 1s fixation between each trial. In the forced-choice version, trials with no opportunity to find out still took 2s but the length of trials with an opportunity to find out depended on the response time. It was explicitly explained to participants that whether they found out about the outcomes or not did not affect the payments or how quickly they finished the experiment. Instructions also made it clear that participants could not influence the outcome in any way. Unlike the task used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Charpentier et al. (2018)</ref>, information was always provided if requested and never provided if not requested (opt-in version) or avoided (forced-choice version). There were therefore no cues proceeding ignorance or knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual difference measures</head><p>Empathic concern: Participants completed the 28-item version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. For analysis, we used scores on the empathic concern subscale (7 items) to test whether differences in interest between conditions were linked to other-focused emotions.</p><p>Charitable giving: After the information-seeking task, participants indicated the percentage of their winnings they wanted to donate to charity. A percentage was given for each of seven charities, with one decision chosen at random and implemented. Participants were told all charities save lives by stopping preventable diseases and no organisations were named. Slightly different information about the charity and a different letter (Charity A, B etc) was given to differentiate the seven decisions, but here we analyse mean donations from the seven items. At the time of making these decisions, participants did not know exactly how much they had won but were told to think of it as £2.50 on average and that it could be up to £5. This was to ensure that the amount they had actually won did not affect donation decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study consisted of two parts: an online questionnaire (20 minutes) completed before an in-person session (40 minutes). Participants completed the online questionnaire, which included the IRI, through Qualtrics Online Survey Software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Participants completed two tasks during the in-person part seated alone in an experimental cubicle, with the information-seeking task reported here always second. Verbal instructions were provided for both tasks at the start then on-screen instructions immediately preceded each task. The charitable giving questions were completed last. The task and charitable giving questions were presented using MATLAB (2017b, Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) using Psychophysics Toolbox extensions version 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>To test the role of valence, probability, and recipient in choices to seek or avoid information, we used generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) with lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> in R (47) with RStudio <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. A binomial distribution was used to model the binary outcome of whether participants found out or not on each trial. Continuous variables were mean centred before analysis. Analysis started with the maximal model which had fixed and correlated random effects of valence (positive vs. negative), probability (10%-90%), and the recipient (self vs. other), with all interactions, as well as trial number and a random participant-level intercept. We reduced from the maximal model using the buildmer package <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> to identify the best converging model using backwards elimination for each experiment separately. Models were fitted by maximum likelihood estimation and compared using likelihood ratio tests. Separate comparisons for each experiment meant the best model could differ. Fixed terms in the best models are shown in <ref type="table">Tables S1 and S2 for each experiment and Table S3</ref> for comparing between experiments. All models contained random effects, correlated with the random intercept, corresponding to each within-subject fixed effect (all variables except choice type (opt-in vs. forced-choice) when comparing between the two experiments). We converted fixed-effect parameters to odds ratios and calculated their confidence intervals as well as Z and p values with the model_parameters function from the parameter package <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. Post-hoc contrasts to interpret interactions in the GLMMs <ref type="table">(Table S4)</ref> were calculated using emmeans (estimated likelihood of finding out) and emtrends (probability trend) functions from the emmeans package <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>. Standardised effect sizes (r) to quantify the preference for positive over negative information for self and other were generated using Wilcoxon paired samples tests (wilcox_effsize function) with the rstatix package <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. For data visualisation and average interest in each condition, we calculated the proportion of times participants found out in each condition and took the mean and within-subject standard error of this measure.</p><p>For the individual-level analysis, we used Pearson's correlations to examine similarities or differences in participants' information-seeking preferences between conditions and how information-seeking related to charitable giving and empathic concern. First, we quantified information-seeking for each participant as the proportion of times they found out in each recipient-valence condition. Second, we calculated a probability slope to quantify the effect of probability in each recipient-valence condition as a standardised regression coefficient. We then ran correlations for the proportions and the slopes between self and other for each valence condition and between positive and negative outcomes for each recipient. To assess similarities in individuals' preference for positive information between the self and other conditions, we also subtracted the proportion of times participants found out in the negative condition from the proportion of times they found out in the positive condition to generate a single variable. The same was done for probability slopes. For correlation with charitable giving, we additionally calculated interest in information about others relative to oneself with the difference between the proportion found out for other subtract self across valence conditions. We additionally used Bayesian analysis to quantify the evidence for no differences between self and other in the preference for positive information and differing effects of probability (slope when positive -slope when negative). Paired Bayesian t tests in JASP <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref> provided Bayes factors (BF10) which correspond to how many times more likely the data are under the alternative hypothesis than the null hypothesis of no difference. A BF10&lt;1/3) is often considered substantial evidence in favour of the null hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Preferences for positive compared to negative information about both oneself and another person, particularly when the outcome is highly likely.
