			<abstract>
				<p>People often prioritize their own interests, but also like to see themselves as moral. How do individuals resolve this tension? One way to both pursue personal gain and preserve a moral self-image is to misremember the extent of one&apos;s selfishness. Here, we test this possibility. Across five experiments (N=3190), we find that people tend to recall being more generous in the past than they actually were, even when they are incentivized to recall their decisions accurately. Crucially, this motivated misremembering effect occurs chiefly for individuals whose choices violate their own fairness standards, irrespective of how high or low those standards are. Moreover, this effect disappears under conditions where people no longer perceive themselves as responsible for their fairness violations. Together, these findings suggest that when people&apos;s actions fall short of their personal standards, they may misremember the extent of their selfishness, thereby potentially warding off threats to their moral self-image.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans tend to see themselves as fair and honest <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , and often behave accordingly. Yet some are tempted to stray from such ideals when they can get away with it <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> . This suggests that, at least in some cases, people prioritize appearing moral to themselves and others over truly aligning their actions with moral principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . This seems to be an effective strategy as well. Maintaining a positive moral self-image not only bolsters psychological well-being and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> , but also yields downstream social benefits. Individuals who appear committed to moral rules are viewed as more attractive social partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> -and one dependable strategy for convincing others of one's morality is to first convince oneself of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</p><p>How can people preserve their moral self-image while simultaneously behaving selfishly? Social scientists have often credited our ability to engage in motivated reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> -that is, we form self-serving beliefs and attitudes to justify immoral acts to ourselves before or after the events unfold <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . This feat is accomplished in a number of ways. For one, people tend to strike a justifiable balance between self-interest and their moral values-for instance, lying just enough to profit financially, but not so much as to harm their moral self-image <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . In addition, people psychologically distance themselves from their unethical actions-attributing past misdeeds to situational pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , or having been a "different person" at the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . Moreover, people exploit uncertaintybehaving more selfishly when the consequences for others are ambiguous <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , making selfserving mistakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , and avoiding information about how their actions may have harmed others <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . A common thread in each of these self-serving strategies is that they operate over abstract beliefs and attitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 4</head><p>Another possibility that has received less attention is that our desire to believe we are moral may distort memories of our concrete experiences. When people's actions fall short of their personal standards, they might misremember having acted in line with those standards. Misremembering past immoral behavior as moral would pre-empt the need to rationalize one's actions, as actions that fall short of one's personal standards would instead be revised in memory. This possibility coheres with evidence that people are able to "suppress" awareness of unwanted memories at both encoding and retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . It is also consistent with recent evidence that memories for dishonest behavior (e.g., cheating) are less subjectively vivid than memories of honest actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , and that memories are less accurate when recounting relevant moral rules after cheating <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , relevant story details after hypothetical acts of cheating ( 25 , but see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> ), and selfish relative to altruistic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . However, it remains an open question whether people who violate their own moral standards actually misremember their behavior in a self-serving direction. Importantly, impaired vividness or accuracy (e.g., fuzzy recollection of the moment you tipped a barista yesterday) does not necessarily imply memory distortion (e.g., misremembering tipping the barista more than you actually did), and vice-versa <ref type="bibr">18,30,31 .</ref> This leaves open the question of whether memory distortion may serve as another mechanism through which individuals can act selfishly and ultimately still feel moral.</p><p>When behaving unfairly (e.g., giving a stingy tip), people may misremember behaving more fairly than they actually were, thus preserving the view that they treat others equitably.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 5</head><p>Here, we test this possibility by leveraging experiments in which motivated reasoning should have a minimal influence-recalling a recently performed action for which one's standard of fairness is explicitly declared. If one engages in motivated reasoning before or after engaging in unethical behavior, there should be no reason to misremember a justified action. If people instead tend to engage in motivated misremembering, such biases should be evident at recall.</p><p>Another key focus of this work concerns whether misremembering is in fact motivated. A rich, long-standing debate in social psychology concerns whether selfserving biases require motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . For instance, many seemingly 'motivated' social comparative biases (e.g., above-average effects) can arise from rational inference processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . Although the moral domain is one where motivated effects are wellsupported <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , it is nonetheless crucial to rule out the possibility that rational inference processes may produce misremembering that only seems morally motivated. For instance, since people tend to be fair across many social situations, it is reasonable for them to infer they behaved fairly in the past. Thus, if memory for recent behavior is weak or incomplete, people may tend to rely on knowledge of what they normally do to inform recall.</p><p>We predicted that motivated misremembering would be specific to fairness "violators", as we posited that this process serves chiefly to reduce discomfort when an individual's actions threaten their moral self-image <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . By focusing on personal standards of fairness in four of our experiments, we accounted for an important feature of social decision-making: even when people's overt behavior appears self-serving, people may not subjectively perceive their behavior as selfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . Crucially, here, we measured MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 6 each individual's subjective threshold for what counts as a fair (versus selfish) choice, and examined how this subjective threshold shapes motivated misremembering of past social choices.</p><p>In line with the predictions above, across two lab experiments (Experiments 1 and 2) and three online experiments (Experiments 3, 4a, and 4b), we find evidence that selfish decisions are more generous in hindsight. After deciding how to split money with anonymous partners, people tend to recall being more generous in the past than they actually were. Crucially, this misremembering effect occurs chiefly among people who initially give less than what they personally believe is fair (Experiments 2, 3, 4a, and 4b).</p><p>Moreover, this effect disappears under conditions where fairness violations no longer pose a self-threat (Experiment 4b)-supporting the view that this misremembering effect is motivated. Together, these findings suggest that when people perceive their own actions as selfish, they are motivated to misremember having acted more equitably, thereby preserving their moral self-image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Misremembering stingy behavior</head><p>In all experiments, participants made a series of five decisions, in which they chose how to allocate money between themselves and a unique anonymous partner.</p><p>Later, in a surprise memory test, we asked participants to report how much they remembered giving on average across their five decisions, and financially incentivized them to be accurate. In Experiment 1, we predicted that participants would misremember being more generous than they actually were, and that this effect would be driven by MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 7 relatively stingy participants (since generous participants should have no reason to misremember their generosity). To test this hypothesis, we examined the direction of participants' memory errors (i.e., discrepancies between recalled generosity and actual generosity). If our hypothesis is correct, then memory errors should tend to be selfserving: that is, recalled generosity should on average be greater than actual generosity.</p><p>Across all five experiments, memory errors were non-normally distributed (W=.53-78, p&lt;.001; Shapiro-Wilk test), thus we report non-parametric statistics for all key comparisons. All reported p-values are two-tailed.</p><p>In line with our predictions, in Experiment 1, we found that participants overall showed a systematic bias towards self-serving memory errors, such that recalled generosity was significantly greater than actual generosity (V=1345.5, p=.021, d=.23, Cliff's Œ¥=.14; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; means and standard deviations are reported in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Since we predicted that misremembering would occur chiefly among more stingy participants, we performed a median split based on participants' average level of generosity across their five decisions, dividing them into a behaviorally stingy group (N=53) and a behaviorally generous group (N=56). As predicted, more stingy participants showed a bias towards self-serving memory errors, such that they remembered giving significantly more than they actually did (V=335.5, p=.003, d=.34, Œ¥=.23; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1a</ref>), whereas more generous participants showed no such difference (V=353, p=.54, d=.13, Œ¥=.05; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). However, stingy participants and generous participants did not significantly differ in the extent of their self-serving memory errors (W=1292.5, p=. <ref type="bibr">23, d=.19, Œ¥=.13</ref>; Mann-Whitney U test).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(A)</head><p>In Experiment 1, relatively stingy-behaving participants recalled being more generous than they actually were, but not generous-behaving participants. (B) In Experiment 2, we show that specifically individuals who violated their own personal standard of fairness (violators) recall being more generous than they actually were, but not those upholding their own fairness standard (upholders). In Experiment 3 (C) and Experiment 4a (D), we replicate the finding that violators, but not upholders, recall being more generous than they truly were. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Misremembering depends on violating personal standards</head><p>Experiment 1 showed that more stingy individuals recall being more generous than they truly were, while more generous individuals recall their choices accurately.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> . Indeed, feelings of responsibility for an action serve as a bridge between the action and one's self-concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . As such, only if people feel MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 14 personally responsible for their fairness violation should they experience a moral selfthreat, and become motivated to reduce it via misremembering.</p><p>Second, motivated misremembering should be largely choice-independent. That is, it should be independent of any peculiarities of the choices that violators and upholders tend to make. Indeed, one possible alternative explanation for our findings is that there is something about the pattern of violators' choices that makes their choices more prone to being misremembered-for instance, that the amount they gave across their choices varied more. Thus, it is important to rule out the possibility that the sets of choices made by violators are just inherently more prone to being misremembered than the sets of choices made by upholders.</p><p>In a final pair of experiments (Experiments 4a and 4b), we examined these two hypotheses to directly test the motivated nature of misremembering. In Experiment 4a, an initial wave of participants (free-choice deciders) freely decided how to split money with anonymous partners, and later recalled their choices (as in prior experiments). Next, in Experiment 4b, a second wave of participants (forced-choice deciders) were each yoked to a randomly selected free-choice decider from Experiment 4a, and were forced to make (and later recall) the exact same set of transfer choices as their yoked free-choice decider (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a</ref>). Crucially, in Experiment 4b, forced-choice deciders (as well as the recipients of their transfers) were instructed that the decider had no responsibility for their transfer choices-thereby removing any incentive to misremember their choices.</p><p>Moreover, we confirmed that feelings of personal responsibility were lower among forced-choice (versus free-choice) deciders (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2b</ref> and 2c for distributions of reported personal responsibility). We made the following key predictions. Based on the motive-dependence hypothesis, we predicted that those who freely violated their own standards would make self-serving memory errors, whereas those who were forced to violate their own standards and perceived no personal responsibility for their actions would show no such bias toward self-serving memory errors.</p><p>Similarly, based on the choice-independence hypothesis, we predicted that while violators in the free-choice condition would make self-serving memory errors, their yoked counterparts in the forced-choice condition, who had to recall exactly the same choices, would not make such errors. Since Experiment 4a was structured the same as Experiments 2 and 3, we first conducted all key tests that were reported in Experiments 2 and 3. We replicated all of the key results reported above (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Results)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Misremembering is motive-dependent</head><p>To evaluate the efficacy of our manipulation, we first assessed how responsible We predicted that while those who freely violated their own standards would make self-serving memory errors, those who were forced to violate their standards (and consequently perceived no personal responsibility for their actions) should show no such bias toward self-serving memory errors.</p><p>Consistent with our prior experiments, in Experiment 4a, free-choice participants showed a systematic bias towards self-serving memory errors (V=29581, p&lt;.001, d=.18, Œ¥=.08; Wilcoxon ranked-sum test). Violators (N=231) recalled being more generous than they actually were (V=8609.5, p&lt;.001, d=.40, Œ¥=.26; Wilcoxon ranked-sum test; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.   1d</ref>), but upholders (N=478) showed no such bias (V=6102.5, p=.92, d=.02, Œ¥=-.01;</p><p>Wilcoxon ranked-sum test). Furthermore, violators showed a greater bias toward selfserving memory errors than upholders (W=42117, p&lt;.001, d=. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Thus, while our forced-choice manipulation eliminated the main effect of misremembering, there remained a significant, albeit diminished, misremembering effect for forced-choice violators. One possibility is that, despite our instructions that sought to minimize feelings of responsibility in the forced-choice experiment, some forced-choice violators may have still felt some degree of personal responsibility, and thus were motivated to misremember. This prediction follows from work showing that while following orders or instructions can reduce feelings of responsibility, it does not eliminate them entirely (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> ). Supporting our prediction, around 30% of forcedchoice participants reported feeling some degree of responsibility for their choices.</p><p>Crucially, the motive dependence hypothesis predicts that the forced-choice manipulation should eliminate motivated misremembering only in those violators who viewed themselves as not personally responsible for their actions, whereas forced-choice violators who viewed themselves as personally responsible should remain motivated to make self-serving memory errors. To test this possibility, we independently assessed the memories of those who reported being "not at all responsible" for their actions (i.e., 1 out of 7 on our personal responsibility measure; N=408), and those who self-reported some degree of personal responsibility for their actions (i.e., greater than 1 out of 7 on our personal responsibility measure; M=4.87, SD=1.84; N=171).</p><p>Consistent with the motive-dependence hypothesis, forced-choice deciders who nonetheless perceived themselves as responsible for their actions showed a significant bias toward self-serving memory errors (V=3206. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Wilcoxon ranked-sum test; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3b</ref>), whereas upholders (N=92) showed no such bias (V=372, p=.066, d=.08, Œ¥=-.13; Wilcoxon ranked-sum test). We also found that violators showed a greater bias toward self-serving memory errors than upholders (W=2010, p&lt;.001, d=.61, Œ¥=.45; Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, forced-choice participants who reported feeling no responsibility for their actions showed no bias toward self-serving memory errors (V=4802.5, p=. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Misremembering is choice-independent</head><p>We also predicted that while those who freely violate their own standards should tend to make self-serving memory errors, those forced to make the same choices would  In contrast, yoked forced-choice deciders-who were forced to make, and then remember, the exact same choice sets as free-choice deciders-showed no significant bias toward self-serving memory errors (V=16087.5, p=. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In The Descent of Man, Darwin wrote "A moral being is one who is capable of reflecting on his past actions and their motives-of approving of some and disapproving of others" <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> . Here we offer one account of how people may fall short of Darwin's moral criterion. Across five experiments, we found that people tend to recall being more generous than they actually were. This occurred even when participants could receive a monetary bonus that directly scaled with their memory accuracy. Crucially, this effect was driven by a subset of individuals whose generosity fell short of what they personally believed was fair, independent of their absolute level of giving. Such individuals not only showed more self-serving memory errors, but were also less confident in their memories compared to individuals who upheld their personal fairness standards. Further analyses revealed that this phenomenon is in fact motivated, as opposed to arising from rational inference processes. Specifically, misremembering only occurred when violating fairness standards posed a self-threat-i.e., when people perceived themselves as personally responsible for their actions. Together, our findings highlight the importance of assessing selfishness as it is perceived by social decision-makers-that is, relative to their own, subjective moral beliefs. More crucially, these findings contribute to a growing literature on the motivated nature of memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> by supporting the idea that people can misremember not just rules, or hypothetical situations, but also concrete actions.</p><p>Specifically, these findings suggest that those who violate (as opposed to uphold) their personal standards misremember the extent of their selfishness. Moreover, they highlight the key motivational role of perceived responsibility for norm violationsconsistent with classic accounts from social psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> , and recent evidence from MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 23 experimental economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . However, since we focused specifically on those who reported no responsibility, it is also conceivable that other factors might have differed between the participants who felt responsible and those who did not.</p><p>We interpret these results as evidence of motivated memory distortion, however an alternative account would hold that these individuals were aware of their true level of generosity at recall, yet were willing to pay a cost to claim having been more generous.</p><p>While this account is not inconsistent with prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , it should be less likely in a context which is anonymous, involves no future interaction with any partners, and requires memories to be verified by an experimenter <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> . Accordingly, we found little to no effect of trait social desirability on peoples' reported memories. Together, these points suggest that people were actually misremembering their choices, rather than consciously lying about them.</p><p>A related literature suggests that memory is enhanced for emotional events <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> and violating fairness standards may immediately induce negative emotions such as guilt <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . From this literature, one would expect fairness violations to be more memorable than morally-consistent choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . This may be especially true of extreme moral transgressions (e.g., physical harm), which may remain memorable to transgressors long after they occurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> , or when one's moral transgression was witnessed by others-which could elicit social emotions such as shame or embarrassment <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> . Such contexts may indeed elicit a different self-serving strategy. If one's moral conduct were witnessed by, or directly comparable to, the conduct of one's peers, individuals might instead distort their moral view of others (e.g., viewing peers as being less moral than they truly are <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</p><p>Below we propose three possibilities, however it is important to note that it is plausible that numerous memory mechanisms could contribute to misremembering in our experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</p><p>One possibility is that selfish individuals misremember their choices via mechanisms that unfold at encoding. Memory encoding is chiefly determined by attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> , which in turn is guided by our goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> . Upon first becoming aware of the intention to make a selfish choice, individuals may attend less to episodic details, and strategically downregulate the depth of processing of such episodes via inhibitory control processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .

Importantly, we controlled for four other predictors of memory in each model: choice speed (the average time participants took to make their choices), choice variance (the standard deviation of their choices), non-giving (whether or not they ever gave a positive amount across their choices), and numeracy (their performance on a numeracy task between making and recalling their choices).

However, if misremembering is in fact motivated, we would only expect misremembering to occur among violators, whereas exceeders should tend to recall their choices accurately. To test these possibilities, across Experiments 2 and 3, we examined memory errors in exceeders (Nexp.2=69; Nexp.3=207; see Supplementary Table 2)-a group that showed a similar degree of norm deviation and choice variance as violators (see Supplementary Results). In support of our hypothesis that misremembering is motivated, we found no evidence of misremembering towards the norm in exceeders (Vexp.2= 587.5, p=.48, d &lt;.001, Œ¥ = -0.04; Vexp.3=1704.5, p=.99, d=.04, Œ¥=.01; Wilcoxon signed-rank tests), and violators misremembered to a significantly greater degree than exceeders (Wexp.2= 1537, p&lt;.001, d=.57, Œ¥=.35; Wexp.3=12767.5, p=.015, d=.31, Œ¥=.14; Mann-Whitney U tests). Nevertheless, even if exceeders show no bias on average, a rational inference account would still find partial support if exceeders were more likely to make errors in the direction of their norm (i.e., norm-directed memory errors) than in the opposite direction. To address this question, we compared the frequency of errors made in each MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 13 direction by exceeders and violators.CI[.40, .62])). These results are inconsistent with a rational inference account, but consistent with a motivated account of misremembering. Motive-dependence and choice-independence The findings of Experiments 2 and 3 cohere with the possibility that the memory bias we observe is a motivated phenomenon. However, they only demonstrate this phenomenon indirectly. A motivated account of misremembering would receive compelling evidence over a rational inference account with direct evidence for two key conditions. First, motivated misremembering should be motive-dependent. That is, misremembering should occur only when people have a motive to misremember, and should cease to occur if motives to misremember are removed. In particular, a rich, long standing literature on motivated cognition suggests that when people no longer view themselves as personally responsible for a dissonance-inducing action, they no longer experience dissonance motivation</note></figure>

As such, we anticipated that the intensity of negative emotion experienced by agents would not be strong enough to elicit preferential encoding of their own actions-a prediction supported by the presence of self-serving memory errors across our three experiments. Ultimately, uncovering how memory for selfishness shifts as a function of (i) the degree of harm caused by the choice and (ii) the presence of others remain exciting and important directions for future work to explore.</figDesc><table><row><cell>If we accept the possibility that people can misremember their misdeeds, what</cell></row><row><cell>cognitive and neural mechanisms might facilitate this effect?

Engaging in this form of motivated control over MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 25 memory-suppression-induced forgetting-has been shown to not only prevent the suppressed memory from entering conscious awareness, but also reduce its accessibility during subsequent retrieval attempts<ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> . Such findings suggest that even if selfish and fair choices are stored with equal fidelity, selfish choices may nonetheless become less accessible over time, leading one to preferentially recall choices that better align with one's moral self-view. This raises at least one key direction for future work: since misremembering was more likely to occur when people varied in their choices, it could be strategic to vary the specific amount one gives each time to facilitate motivated misremembering.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

Half of participants indicated their fairness standards before learning they were assigned the role of Participant 1, and the other half indicated their fairness standard after learning their role. The timing of the fairness standards question had no influence on the MOTIVATED MISREMEMBERING 28 results, and thus we collapsed across these conditions in all analyses for Experiment 2 (see Supplementary Results for more details).In both experiments, participants were ultimately assigned to the role of dictator average, they transferred to the recipient. Participants were asked to record their response on a provided answer sheet. To motivate participants to recall their choices accurately, they were informed that they would receive an additional CHF 5 if their response was within 10% of their actual average transfer. This setup ensured that participants had no incentive to consciously lie. At the recall phase, participants knew that there would be no future interactions with any partners. They also knew that their reported memories were accessible by the research team-who also had access to the participants true choices in order to determine their accuracy bonus. Such knowledge is known to reduce lying<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> . . 28 participants were excluded for failing at least one of our comprehension checks. Moreover, 5 participants were excluded for reporting suspicion about key aspects of the task. Finally, 11 participants were excluded for being extreme outliers (i.e., &gt; 4 standard deviations from the mean) in the size of their memory errors. This left a total sample of Unlike the prior experiments, participants were not informed of the size of this bonus until after the experiment. In addition, all participants in this experiment made fairness judgements without prior knowledge of whether they would be assigned as Participant 1 (the decider) or Participant 2 (the receiver).
