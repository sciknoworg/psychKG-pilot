			<abstract>
				<p>Judgments surrounding resource acquisition and valuation are ubiquitous in daily life. How do humans decide what something is worth to themselves or someone else? One important cue to value is that of resource quantity. As described by economists, the principle of diminishing marginal utility (DMU) holds that as resource abundance increases, the value placed on each unit decreases; likewise, when resources become more scarce, the value placed on each unit rises. While prior research suggests that adults make judgments that align with this concept, it is unclear whether children do so. In Study 1 (n = 104), children (ages 5 through 8) were presented with scenarios involving losses or gains to others&apos; resources and predicted the actions and emotions of the individuals involved. Participants made decisions that aligned with DMU, e.g., expecting individuals with fewer resources to expend more effort for an additional resource than individuals with greater resources. In Study 2 (n = 104), children were capable of abandoning a quantity-based approach to resource valuation when it was appropriate to do so, showing the capacity to incorporate information about preferences when inferring others&apos; resource valuations. Our results indicate the early emergence of an intuitive economic theory that aligns with an important economic principle. Long before formal learning on this topic, children integrate quantity and preference information to sensibly predict others&apos; resource valuations, with implications for economic decision-making, social preferences, and judgments of partner quality across the lifespan.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Introduction</head><p>Imagine sitting in your office on a rainy afternoon. You open your email to a message offering leftover cookies in a building across campus. Despite the distance and rain, you choose to make the trip; cookies are your favorite snack, and you have yet to eat any cookies today. You grab a cookie and feel much happier after having eaten it. Now imagine that you receive a similar email on another rainy afternoon, but on this day, you already ate two cookies with your lunch.</p><p>You might decide that additional cookies are not worth the trip; you stay in your office instead.</p><p>The examples above, showing divergent reactions to the prospect of one additional cookie based on one's prior consumption of cookies, are illustrations of diminishing marginal utility.</p><p>Diminishing (or declining) marginal utility, a law from the field of economics, holds that the value, or utility, of additional resource units declines as one acquires more units of that resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rachlin, 1992</ref>). In the second example, one's expected utility from a single cookie is reduced by virtue of having recently eaten cookies. While particularly true of consumable items, this principle extends to other kinds of resources, including money <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Greene &amp; Baron, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Henrich et al., 2005)</ref>, leisure time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Diener, Ng, &amp; Tov, 2008)</ref>, and durable goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Greene &amp; Baron, 2001)</ref>. For instance, one might greatly enjoy two hours of baking cookies but derive minimal pleasure from two more hours, and one would pay more for one's first cookie baking sheet than one's third.</p><p>An intuitive sense of diminishing marginal utility helps us make decisions to maximize our utility and efficiency, such as choosing to buy more of things we have less of over things we have more of or more carefully conserving resources that are scarce over those that are abundant. It also guides our social judgments and moral evaluations, such as judging a schoolteacher's $5000 charitable donation as more generous than a billionaire's $5000 donation. Although the amount given is identical, $5000 impacts the teacher's wealth to a greater extent than the billionaire's wealth and is therefore viewed more favorably.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Diminishing Marginal Utility in Adults</head><p>Utility theory has a long intellectual history that dates from Aristotle, Bernoulli, and Smith <ref type="bibr">(Kauder,1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mishra, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pine et al., 2009)</ref> through classic and contemporary research in psychology and economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</ref>; Jara-Ettinger, Gweon, Schulz, &amp; Tenenbaum, 2016). Diminishing marginal utility has been called "the fundamental economic law," because it underlies other theories of consumer demand and exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rachlin, 1992)</ref>. It helps explain why trade can benefit both parties involved in an exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rachlin, 1992)</ref>; for instance, one person's excess of bread can be swapped for another person's excess of cheese, allowing both individuals to make a sandwich (see <ref type="bibr">Echelbarger, Good, &amp; Shaw, 2020, and Johnson, Zhang, &amp;</ref> Keil., 2022, on trade).</p><p>College-educated adults make hypothetical judgments in line with diminishing marginal utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Diener et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Greene &amp; Baron, 2001</ref>). For instance, participants in a thought experiment choose to allocate their leisure time across several different activities rather than allocating all of their leisure time to their most preferred activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Diener et al., 2008)</ref>. The finding that college-educated adults' decisions accord with diminishing marginal utility may seem unsurprising given that this concept is taught in social science classes. However, academic knowledge of diminishing marginal utility does not seem responsible for this effect. Diminishing marginal utility has distinct neural correlates elicited in real decision-making contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Pine et al., 2009)</ref>, and is seen in the choices and evaluations of adults who participate outside university subject pools <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kushlev, Heintzelman, Oishi, &amp; Diener, 2018)</ref>, including those with weaker quantitative skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Schley &amp; Peters, 2014)</ref>. Indeed, we propose that an intuitive sense of diminishing marginal utility is not a product of formal learning or extensive experience. Rather, we predict that an intuitive sense for this concept is operative by middle childhood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Diminishing Marginal Utility Antecedents in Development</head><p>The capacity to consider costs, benefits, value, and utility seems like a necessary precondition for reasoning in line with diminishing marginal utility, which rests on the foundation of these concepts. Recent evidence suggests that sensitivity to such concepts emerges early in development, as revealed by infants' expectations of others' behavior as well as their own behavior. By the age of 10 months, infants expect individuals to more strongly value objects that require greater effort to reach relative to objects requiring less effort, thus indicating their consideration of benefits and costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Liu, Ullman, Tenenbaum, &amp; Spelke, 2017)</ref>. Infants also assess costs when choosing whether to help others, resulting in a propensity to perform lower-cost actions. By the age of 18 months, infants are more likely to fetch an object for an experimenter who requests a light block than an experimenter who requests a heavier block <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sommerville et al., 2018)</ref>, reflecting a differential assessment of the costs required for each action.</p><p>Towards the end of early childhood, children show explicit recognition that costs and benefits influence others' choices, in line with the theory that humans view others as "utility maximizers" even early in development (Jara-Ettinger, Gweon, Schulz, &amp; Tenenbaum, 2016).</p><p>Children between the ages of 4 and 6 believe that individuals who highly value a goal are likelier to perform costlier actions to achieve it than individuals for whom the goal is less meaningful (Jara-Ettinger, Gweon, Tenenbaum, &amp; Schulz, 2015; Aboody, Zhou, &amp; Jara-Ettinger, 2021).</p><p>Additionally, children in this age range consider costs when evaluating others' actions and judge individuals who expend great effort to achieve prosocial goals as especially nice (Jara-Ettinger, Kim, Muentener, &amp; Schulz, 2014).</p><p>Sensitivity to costs, benefits, and value is also evident in children's own decisions by the ages of 5 and 6. Children in this age range are willing to tolerate the cost of waiting for longer periods of time in order to acquire greater rewards and understand tradeoffs between costs and benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Liu, Gonzalez, &amp; Warneken, 2019)</ref>. When choosing what to teach others, children select information that yields the highest benefits for the learners while minimizing the learners' costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bridgers, Jara-Ettinger, &amp; Gweon, 2020)</ref>. In situations of conflict between the interests of oneself and others, children in this age range often act in ways that maximize their own value. For instance, they are less likely to share higher-value than lower-value resources with others (Blake &amp; Rand, 2010; Sheskin, Nadal, Croom, Mayer, Nissel, &amp; Bloom, 2016). Children also consider the costs required to obtain resources when determining their subjective value, sharing fewer resources when considerable effort was needed to obtain them than when minimal effort was required <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Benozio &amp; Diesendruck, 2015</ref>; but see Sehl, Friedman, &amp; Denison, 2021, on the special case of sunk costs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Evidence for and Against Diminishing Marginal Utility in Childhood</head><p>Despite the fact that key concepts underlying an intuitive sense of diminishing marginal are in place by the early school years, there is little direct evidence regarding the concept itself. Do children understand that the value one places on a single resource unit is influenced by how many additional units one possesses? If true, this would indicate that a guiding principle for adults' decisions in diverse domains is already accessible to children. This has the potential to shape children's choices about how they acquire, conserve, and share resources, spend their time, and evaluate others' decisions. The limited prior research pertaining to diminishing marginal utility in childhood provides reasons to support as well as challenge the notion that children have access to this concept.</p><p>Indirect evidence for such understanding comes from the finding that children expect others to prefer variety over homogeneity in resources and also show such a preference themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ahl &amp; Dunham, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Echelbarger &amp; Gelman, 2017)</ref>. Variety preferences could be motivated by a sense that resources can become less valuable as they accumulate, which aligns with diminishing marginal utility.  found that 4-to 8-year-olds predicted that children with greater toys of the same kind would be likelier to give one toy to another child than children with fewer toys. Such a pattern could emerge through an understanding that the costs of sharing one resource are lower for individuals with more (thus resulting in more sharing), consistent with diminishing marginal utility. The clearest evidence for children's understanding of this concept comes from their own words. In the above study, participants were asked to explain the reasons for their predictions. Some participants produced explanations consistent with this concept; 13% referenced excess or need as factors motivating the choice to share or not, and several of these participants mentioned that changes to resources are less impactful to people with more than people with less. This indicates that some children's reasoning matches the tenets of diminishing marginal utility.</p><p>Most of the results mentioned previously, however, could emerge even if children do not have an intuitive sense of diminishing marginal utility. Variety-based preferences can arise through the understanding that diverse resources can be useful under different circumstances and do not require the belief that value declines as quantity increases. Predictions that individuals with more are likelier to share could emerge through a general attraction towards larger arrays of objects or the individuals who possess them. While children's ability to produce explanations consistent with diminishing marginal utility is compelling, few children produced such explanations. The low prevalence of such explanations may underestimate the actual rates of this kind of thinking or accurately reflect its rarity in young children. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Current Study</head><p>In our pre-registered Study 1, we examine whether children's predictions of others' behaviors and emotions align with diminishing marginal utility. We present participants with information about individuals who undergo prospective or actual changes to their resources and then ask them to predict the individuals' responses. Rather than asking participants to reassess the same individual's resource valuations after changes to their resource quantities, we ask them to compare two individuals who have equally strong preferences for a given resource type but differ in how many resources they possess (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Greene &amp; Baron, 2001</ref>, for comparisons of utility across different individuals). We reasoned that this approach allows for a simple, age-appropriate narrative while eliminating the need to pose questions about the same person across multiple time points, thus minimizing task demands.</p><p>A robust sense of diminishing marginal utility should support judgments in diverse situations. Thus, to provide a strong test of whether children hold such an intuitive theory, participants make two distinct kinds of predictions in our study. Specifically, participants make predictions of effortful actions and predictions of emotions, with two different scenarios of each kind, yielding a total of four scenarios. We chose to query predictions of actions and emotions to infer value, rather than directly querying value in monetary terms (c.f. <ref type="bibr">Gelman</ref>  As our pre-registration states, we hypothesized that children would make predictions consistent with diminishing marginal utility. We set our age range of 5-to 8-year-olds because children by this age demonstrate fundamentals of diminishing marginal utility understanding, as discussed previously, but to our knowledge the concept itself has not been shown in children of any age.</p><p>In our pre-registered Study 2, we modify our task by changing the characters' resource preferences, such that the individual with fewer resources likes the resource type less than the individual with greater resources. Since the individual with fewer resources would derive less utility from a single resource unit in this situation relative to the situations described in Study 1, we predicted lower scores in Study 2. In other words, we anticipated that children would rationally incorporate information about individuals' preferences into their predictions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Participants</head><p>Our total sample of 104 participants included a younger age group of 52 five-and 6-yearolds (41.1% girls; Mage = 72.69 months, SD = 7.00, range = 59 -83) and an older age group of 52 seven-and 8-year-olds (51.8% girls; M = 96.67, SD = 7.02, range = 85 -110). An additional 6 participants were excluded due to experimenter error (n = 3), parentally-disclosed developmental disability (n = 1), watching a previous session (n = 1), or falling outside our age range (n = 1 Informed consent from participants' parents was obtained before testing began, as was assent from the participants themselves. Our research was conducted with the approval of our university's Institutional Research Board and accords with international standards for ethical research. We recruited and tested participants in children's museums (n = 59), parks (n = 4), our lab (n = 21), and a private school (n = 20) in the Greater Boston area. We expected our research sites to yield demographically similar participants; moreover, we believed our predictions would hold for boys and girls from diverse populations. However, to ensure that age group and scenario type were not confounded with site or participant gender, we used a pseudo-randomized procedure that took location, age, and gender into account when determining which scenarios each participant would receive. This procedure achieved a good balance of age, gender, and testing location for each scenario, as reported in Supplement 1.</p><p>The parents of 56 participants completed a demographic survey. (The remainder of parents either declined this survey or were not asked due to site restrictions or time limitations.) This subset of parents reported their participating children's race and ethnicity; 71.4% were White, 7.1% were Black, 8.9% were Asian, and 12.5% were of more than one race. Overall, these parents were highly educated (92.9% held a bachelor's degree or higher) and affluent (the median family income bracket chosen was $175,000 -200,000, based on the 48 parents who responded). We caution that the potential for reporting bias (e.g., perhaps wealthier families were likelier to report their income)</p><p>complicates inferences about the demographics of the entire sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Materials, Procedure, and Design</head><p>The study was administered using a magnetic whiteboard. Images of key features in the scenarios' narratives, such as the children and resources, were placed on magnetic strips and moved throughout the study to serve as visual aids and answer choices for the participants.</p><p>Photographs of toys were collected from internet searches. Arrays of two and five toys were created from these photographs, with each toy per array having a unique color. Photographs of children's faces were chosen from the CAFE set (LoBue &amp; Thrasher, 2015; LoBue, 2014). The faces that were paired together were of the same gender and race, within 7 months apart in chronological age, and similar in overall appearance based on our subjective impressions. Race varied between pairs, to increase the odds that our racially diverse sample would see children like</p><p>themselves during the study. The use of counterbalancing ensured that whether two or five toys appeared on the left or right (and was discussed first or second) and whether a given face appeared on the left or right was similarly likely across trials. A full list of images for each scenario is included in Supplement 2 and the randomization procedure is explained in Supplement 3.</p><p>Participants saw children that matched their own gender.</p><p>Four different scenarios were used. Each scenario conveyed a situation in which two children highly valued a certain type of resource, started with different amounts of that resource, and then faced single-unit gains or losses. One child always started with two resources and the other started with five resources. The resources were described as each child's "absolute favorite" toys. They had different amounts "because of how many the store had when their parents bought them their birthday presents." This reason is unrelated to children's preferences or overall wealth, factors which could influence participants' inferences about the children's behavior <ref type="bibr">(</ref> After this introductory section, each scenario had a unique script. Events differed across scenarios. In the Recover scenario, for instance, the script described each child as having brought their toys (e.g., fidget spinners) to a playground one day. When they arrived back at their homes, each child discovered that they lost one toy at the playground, such that the child with five spinners now had four, and the child with two spinners now had one. Each child had wanted to go swimming in the park pool, but since the pool was closing soon, they had to choose between going swimming or returning to the playground to look for their lost spinner. Participants were told, "One kid will walk back to the playground to look for [the] lost toy instead of swimming, and one kid will go swimming instead of looking for [the] lost toy," and asked to indicate who would perform which action. Participants answered via moving magnets, pointing, or verbal responses.</p><p>Our key question was whether participants would view changes to resources as more impactful to the child with fewer resources than the child with greater resources. In the two "emotion" scenarios, impact was operationalized in terms of emotional intensity. Participants guessed which child would be happier for gaining one toy (Happy scenario) or sadder for losing one toy (Sad scenario). In the two "action" scenarios, impact was operationalized in terms of willingness to perform effortful actions. Participants guessed which child would exert effort to recover a lost toy (Recover scenario) or obtain an additional toy (Gain scenario) instead of doing an enjoyable activity. For each kind of prediction, such responses would suggest that the child with fewer resources values each resource unit more highly, in line with diminishing marginal utility (DMU). For each trial, participants received a score of 1 for choosing the DMU-consistent answer and a 0 for making the opposite choice. DMU-consistent responses were ones in which the child with fewer toys was identified as happier for gaining one toy, sadder for losing one toy, or exerting more effort to recover or gain one toy. Each script is included in Supplement 4.</p><p>Participants saw one block of three trials for each scenario. Each trial was conducted with new face pairs and toys. After the final trial of the first block, participants were asked to explain their choice on the most recent trial. This prompt allowed for the coding of children's explanations</p><p>and provided insight into their reasoning; the coding procedure will be discussed below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Data Checking</head><p>Participants' predictions for which child performed the focal actions were live coded by the testers. Video recordings were available for most of the sessions (86.5%) and coded by research assistants who were blind to the testers' coding. The testers and video coder agreed on 98.3% of trials. Discrepancies were adjudicated by rewatching the videos and consulting data sheets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Explanation Coding Procedure</head><p>Of the 104 participants, codable explanations for participants' decisions were available for 103 participants for block 1 and 104 participants for block 2. When available, explanations were transcribed from video recordings (n = 90) and audio recordings (n = 7) by a research assistant.</p><p>For the 7 participants for whom recordings were unavailable, live transcription notes from the tester were used instead. (The missing block 1 explanation was not successfully transcribed live and was inaudible to the video coder.) A thematic coding system was devised to examine participants' explanations in both Study 1 and Study 2. First, a randomly-generated set of explanations (10 each from Study 1 and Study 2) was designated to train the second coder and generate feedback on the coding system. These explanations were collaboratively coded. Next, the first coder used the revised coding system (Supplement 6) to independently code all remaining explanations. A randomly-generated set of 40 participants' block 1 and block 2 explanations (38.5%) was independently double-coded by the second coder, who was blind to the prior coding. A percentage of agreement score was calculated by dividing the number of codes for which the coders agreed by the total number of codes used, which meant that disagreements about both the number and kind of codes used would count against the agreement score. We chose this method because most of the coding categories were not mutually exclusive; thus, multiple codes could be used for a single explanation, preventing kappa scores from being calculated. The agreement scores indicated strong inter-rater reliability (89% agreement, with agreement on 105 out of 118 codes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5.">Analysis</head><p>For one-sample t-tests, each trial was scored as a 1 (for DMU-consistent responses) or 0, and total scores for each scenario could range from 0 to 3. These scores were then converted into "percentage of DMU-consistent responses" scores by dividing the total scores by 3, resulting in scores ranging from 0 to 1. Analyses compared participants' scores to the chance score of .50. For generalized linear mixed models, the variable was binary, with a "1" given for DMU-consistent responses. The generalized linear mixed models were conducted with R statistical software (version 4.1.1, R Core Team, 2021) using lme4 (Bates et al., 2015). For the "intercept only" models, participant ID was entered as a random effect (intercepts), and 95% confidence intervals were bootstrapped (N = 1000 simulations). For the models including predictors, block order and participant gender were entered as covariates and participant ID as a random effect (intercepts) to control for repeated measures. Plots with binomial confidence intervals were produced in R using ggplot2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Wickham, 2016)</ref> and the method of Agresti &amp; Coull (1998).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Results</head><p>We analyzed our data to address two main questions. First, and most centrally, we tested if, as we predicted in the preregistration, children were significantly more likely to answer in ways consistent with diminishing marginal utility than chance would predict.  Our research design was not created to compare differences across scenarios. However, based on piloting, we predicted that young children would score lower on the Happy scenario in particular, but scores for other scenarios would be similar for both age groups. To compare the effects of age group and scenario on children's scores and their interaction (with emphasis on the latter in accordance with our pre-registration) we created a generalized linear mixed model, as described in the Analysis section and shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1 (see page 28</ref>). The main predictors were scenario (Gain, set as the baseline; Happy; Recover; Sad), age group (Younger, set as the baseline;</p><p>Older), and their interaction. In the first step, we compared this full model to a null model consisting only of our covariates and random effects term using a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT).</p><p>The full model provided a superior fit to the data (LRT, 2 7 = 55.96, p &lt; .001).</p><p>We examined the significance of our predictors of interest by removing them from our full model using the 'drop1' command and testing whether their inclusion improved model fit. This comparison revealed that the interaction of scenario and age group (LRT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref>  .08], OR = 3.10), indicating different performance for these scenarios relative to Gain. For older children, all confidence intervals overlapped with 0, indicating similar performance across scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Explanations</head><p>Our primary goal in exploring children's verbal explanations was to determine whether participants who chose the child with fewer toys as performing the focal action (e.g., exerting effort to recover one additional unit; N = 80), versus the child with more toys (N = 23), referenced different concepts in their explanations. Thus, the rates at which each code was used were compared for these groups of participants, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. For our main analyses, we combined all first-block explanations together 2 , in the interest of maximizing statistical power and because we had no specific age-or scenario-specific predictions (with the exception of the Happy scenario, which is discussed in the third footnote). This meant that the data consisted of a single explanation for each child, although multiple codes were sometimes used for a single explanation.</p><p>Aside from a No answer code used when participants declined to respond (N =5), five categories were used to code participants' explanations. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the percentage of participants for which each code had been used, separated by which child the participants had chosen, for Block 1, Study 1. For instance, Quantity was coded for 91.3% of participants who chose the child with less. Because most coding categories were not mutually exclusive, the total percentage across codes exceeds 100%. ** indicates p &lt; .01; *** indicates p &lt; .001.</p><p>Change was used when participants implicitly or explicitly mentioned changes to a child's resources, indicating awareness of the scripts' emphasis on the event of resource change, which is a key element of the narrative (e.g., "because he had two and now he only has one"). Participants who chose the child with fewer toys mentioned Change at significantly higher rates than participants who chose the child with greater toys, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> (1, N = 103) = 6.73, p = .009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> .

We predicted that children who chose the individual with fewer toys would be likelier to mention changes to the characters' resources than children who chose the individual with greater toys. The results were not significant but trended in the predicted direction (one-sided Fisher's exact test, p = .18); 50% of participants who chose the child with less as happier mentioned Change, compared to 25% of participants who chose the child with more . Recall that these analyses were based on only the 26 participants who received the Happy scenario first.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Discussion</head><p>In the "action" scenarios, children predicted that individuals with fewer resources would incur greater costs to obtain one resource unit than individuals with greater resources. In the "emotion" scenarios, children generally predicted that changes to resources would result in greater emotional changes for individuals with fewer resources than individuals with greater resources.</p><p>(The one exception to this pattern was for younger children in the Happy scenario; we will return to this issue shortly.) The most conservative interpretation of these results is that children understand that individuals' resource quantities influence their actions and emotions. Our preferred interpretation is a richer one: Children view individuals' resources quantities as affecting their resource valuations in ways that align with diminishing marginal utility. They expect that individuals with low quantities but high preferences for a resource category will greatly value each resource unit, which in turn cause changes to their resource levels to be especially impactful.</p><p>Our study was not designed to detect differences in alignment with diminishing marginal utility between different situations (e.g., are situations involving losses likelier to evoke this concept than situations involving gains?) but rather general patterns that we believed would be common in diverse contexts. However, we did predict, and find, a unique pattern for one age group and scenario combination: younger children in the Happy scenario. This was the only group in which participants did not significantly favor the child with fewer toys as performing the focal actions. The Happy scenario also showed scenario and age effects; younger children performed differently from the Gain scenario and differently from older children. The Recover scenario also showed scenario-and age-based differences, but unlike Happy, both age groups still chose the child with less at above-chance rates. (Happy and Recover were always paired together, but note that block order was included as a covariate in our models.)</p><p>The unusual performance of the Happy scenario for the younger age group has many potential causes. Our favored account is not that children's performance reflects genuine conceptual differences in their predictions for positive emotions relative to other kinds of predictions but that some children had difficulty parsing the script and recalling the question posed to them. In the Happy scenario, participants heard that two individuals, one with two favorite toys and one with five, each won an additional favorite toy. Participants then indicated who felt "super happy … happier than before" because he got one more, and who felt "sort of happy ... sort of happier than before" because he got one more. Participants may have neglected the script's descriptions of emotional change due to the gain of one toy and instead answered a simpler question, "who was super happy?" The individual with more toys would have been an appealing choice if the question had pertained to overall emotional state. It may be especially difficult for young children to inhibit a default belief that individuals with greater toys are happier. We note a similar belief, that individuals with fewer toys are sadder, would align with the predictions of diminishing marginal utility and make the Sad scenario easier. Our overall results for the emotion scenarios, however, cannot be explained by a simple "quantity is associated with emotions"</p><p>heuristic. Recall that younger children in the Happy block were at-chance, not significantly below it, and both age groups' scores were near ceiling-level for the other scenarios.</p><p>Children's explanations for their choices were consistent with diminishing marginal utility.</p><p>The most commonly-used categories (Quantity, Change, and Surplus/Deficit) convey themes one would use when explaining diminishing marginal utility itself. Namely, children mentioned numbers and quantifiers, changes to the individuals' resources, and whether the individuals' resource levels were high or low relative to their needs. The coding category that most directly relates to diminishing marginal utility, Surplus/Deficit, was nonetheless used infrequently, by approximately one fifth of participants. We suspect that more participants would have referenced this concept had they produced longer explanations or been asked to elaborate upon their responses; many answers were just a few words long.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge the limitations of interpreting the frequencies with which coding categories were mentioned as indications of proto-diminishing marginal utility concepts in children. The coding categories relate to events described in the scenarios, which were designed </p></div>

However, instead of cookies, the snack is pretzels. You have not eaten any pretzels today, and you are neutral about pretzels, neither liking nor disliking them. Consider whether you would be more likely to leave your office for pretzels or for cookies, a favorite snack which you already had consumed with your lunch. The answer is less straightforward than the situation described previously; your desire for cookies would be reduced by your prior consumption of cookies but may still outweigh your desire for your first serving of a less-preferred snack. This example illustrates how preferences can serve as cues to resource valuations as well as the aforementioned cue of resource quantity.</p><p>Thus, in Study 2, we pit information about preferences against information about quantity.</p><p>Our only change to the script is modifying the preference level of the individual with fewer resources. Instead of liking the resource as strongly as the individual with greater resources, the individual with fewer resources thinks the resource type is "just okay." We predicted that children It is also possible that children will be resistant to viewing individuals with greater resources as sadder than individuals with fewer resources; if true, we would also not expect Study 2 to differ from Study 1 in the Sad scenario. Finally, if the prevalence of certain themes (e.g., quantity) in children's Study 1 explanations reflected superficial features of the scripts rather than diminishing marginal utility-like concepts, we would expect to see such themes mentioned at similar rates in Study 2. If children make different predictions and produce different explanations in Study 2, then these alternative explanations for Study 1's results become less likely.</p></div>

Our secondary question was whether scores differed less for younger children in the Happy scenario across the two studies than for other scenario and age combinations; such an effect, if present, would be manifest as a significant three-way interaction between study number, scenario type, and age group. Thus, we created a generalized linear mixed model, as described in the Analysis section, with the dependent variable of DMU-consistent responses. The main predictors were study number (Study 1, set as baseline; Study 2), scenario type, age group, and their interaction. In the first step,</p><p>we compared this full model to a null model consisting only of our covariates and random effects term.

However, because the Study 2 scores were lower than anticipated, we conducted additional exploratory analyses to determine if this was the case. Onesample t tests for each age group and scenario compared participants' scores to the mean score of 0.50. For younger children, all four scenarios produced below-chance scores (p = .03 for Sad; all other ps &lt; .001; ds ranged from .46 to 2.0).

For instance, the supposition that younger children will invariably view individuals with greater toys as happier and fewer toys as sadder is untenable in light of Study 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">General Discussion</head><p>Our main purpose was to determine whether children expect resource quantity to affect resource valuation, in line with diminishing marginal utility, in a variety of contexts. Certain situations may elicit this concept more strongly than others. However, we did not design our study to discern such situational differences, nor individual differences in sensitivity to this concept. An exploration of such topics would benefit from using continuous scales rather than the binary choices participants made in the current studies, which we deemed ideal for an initial exploration of this topic. In terms of individual differences, one factor of particular interest is wealth and socioeconomic status. Recent work has shown that children's economic backgrounds influence their evaluations of resource distributions (Peretz-Lange, Harvey, &amp; Blake, 2022); might this factor also influence diminishing marginal utility sensitivity? Unfortunately, because our sample was skewed towards children of wealthy backgrounds, it was ill-suited to address this research question. While children's wealth may influence this concept, and children from higher-wealth backgrounds are clearly sensitive to it, it is unclear whether children from lower-wealth families would be less or more sensitive compared to higher-wealth children. Perhaps more frequent experiences with resource scarcity would make children even more aware of how lacking resources influences one's valuations.</p><p>We believe our study is the first to show that children have an intuitive economic theory that aligns with the formal economic theory of diminishing marginal utility. Even children understand that resource quantities influence resource valuations, in ways that cause scarcer resource to be valued more highly. They also understand that strong preferences can override this general rule, causing greatly enjoyed resources to be valued highly even when abundant. An intuitive sense of diminishing marginal utility apparently does not require formal or protracted learning. It can be added to a growing list of economic concepts which children appear to understand, such as trade <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Echelbarger et al., 2020)</ref> and supply and demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Huh &amp; Friedman, 2019</ref>; but see Smith-Flores, Applin, Blake, &amp; Kibbe, 2021). In some cases, folk economic theories conflict with formal economic principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boyer &amp; Petersen, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Johnson et al., 2022)</ref>, but with diminishing marginal utility, they are aligned. Diminishing marginal utility appears to be readily accessible for children but may still be influenced by contextual and priming cues that increase its salience; this is a topic for future research.</p><p>Where does a sense of diminishing marginal utility come from? It could be intuited through direct experiences with having different amounts of valued resources and noticing one's own reactions to changes in those resources, e.g., being less upset when one misplaces a single sticker sheet out of many sheets, and more upset when one misplaces a unique toy. It may be implicitly communicated through adults' testimony, such as exhortations to take special care of things one has less of. Diminishing marginal utility also parallels psychophysics concepts, which can be seen in the behavior of people who are unaware of the concepts themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson &amp; Busemeyer, 2010</ref>): the Weber-Fechner law notes that changes in stimulus perception are proportional to the starting level of the stimulus (e.g., a one-unit difference in weight may be detectable if the initial weight is low but undetectable if the initial weight is high). Regardless of origins, a sense of diminishing marginal utility can inform how people will value, handle, and share their own resources and make social judgments about the costs and benefits of others' actions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1996)</ref> and who is a likely to be a valuable resource-sharing partner (see Gurven, Allen-Arave, Hill, &amp; Hurtado, 2000; Ready, 2018). It may lead to greater expectations that those with more will share, but also harsher judgments when such sharing is denied. Thus, it is an important component of the conceptual toolkit humans use when navigating the social world.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>One reason to question children's capacity to reason in line with diminishing marginal utility comes from children's neglect of information about proportional generosity when making social evaluations. Adults prefer and positively evaluate people who share a greater proportion of their resources over those who share more in absolute terms but less proportionally (Hackel, Mende-Siedlecki, &amp; Amodio, 2020; Raihani &amp; Barclay, 2016; Hurst, Shaw, Chernyak, &amp; Levine, 2020), such as deeming someone who gives 2 of their 4 resources as nicer than someone who gives 3 of their 9 resources. A sense of diminishing marginal utility can contribute to positive evaluations of proportionally generous sharers. For instance, diminishing marginal utility holds that each resource unit is particularly valuable for individuals with less, thus making sharing costlier and more generous for those with less. In contrast to adults, children between the ages of 4 and 7 do not typically favor those who give more proportionally but less absolutely (Chernyak, Turnbull, Gordon, Harris, &amp; Cordes, 2020; Hurst et al., 2020; McCrink, Bloom, &amp; Santos, 2010), except in special cases of collaboration (Ng, Heyman, &amp; Barner, 2011). Quantitative reasoning limitations certainly contribute to young children's difficulties (Chernyak et al., 2020; Hurst et al., 2020), but interventions designed to address such limitations, while successful at improving children's performance, do not boost children's preferences for proportionally generous givers to abovechance levels. Some researchers have speculated that conceptual difficulties are responsible, including the possibility "that children, unlike adults, do not weight the value of resources relative to their availability" (Ng e al., 2011). Since viewing resource quantity as an indication of value is a key feature of diminishing marginal utility, this interpretation runs counter to our proposal that children intuitively understand this concept. The existing literature thus provides reasons to bolster as well as doubt our central proposal, raising the need to directly test this possibility.</figDesc></figure>

Additionally, children by the age of 5 understand how emotions follow from events (Ahl &amp; Dunham, 2020; Doan, Friedman, &amp; Denison, 2019; Stein &amp; Levine, 1989) and view physical effort as an indication of cost (Aboody et al., 2021; Liu &amp; Spelke, 2017; Sehl et al., 2021).</figDesc></figure>

The Happy scenario, however, produced a chance-level score, t(25) = .80, p = .43, d = .16. Children's DMU-consistent responses are shown in Figure 1. As a complement to our t tests, we also ran separate generalized linear mixed models for each age group and scenario. These intercept-only models revealed that, for younger children in the Happy block, the confidence interval for the intercept overlapped with 0 (β = -0.50, 95% CI [-1.97, 0.62], OR = 1.65), as shown in Supplement 7.

The Quantity category in particular encompasses concepts (those of numbers and quantifiers) that are rather common in children's speech in general, perhaps particularly in situations involving resource differences amongst individuals<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chernyak, 2020)</ref>. However, the rates at which children mentioned the categories in question varied depending on which individual they chose as performing the focal actions, even though exposure to the scenarios via experimenter-delivered scripts was identical for all participants. When explaining why individuals with fewer resources would perform the focal actions, they were likelier to mention the individuals' resource quantities, changes to their resources, and whether one individual's resource level was excessive or insufficient, demonstrating awareness of how resource levels influence actions. The differences in children's explanations based on their behavioral predictions suggest that a common cause, such as a diminishing marginal utility-like concept, may have been responsible for both their choices and their explanations. A stronger test for our suppositions will be provided in Study 2, for which the scripts are virtually identical to those of Study 1 except for a change that makes the scenarios less likely to evoke diminishing marginal utility. If children's explanations are responses to the broader concepts of the scenarios, rather than superficial features of the scripts, we should expect to see different patterns of explanation results in Study 2.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>would be significantly less likely to choose the child with fewer resources as performing the focal action than in Study 1. In other words, some children would deviate from quantity-based predictions when given an alternative (and appropriate) basis for their decisions. Our prediction was based on children's abilities to infer actions from preferences, and vice-versa(Fawcett &amp; Markson, 2010; Hu, Lucas, Griffiths, &amp; Xu, 2015; Kushnir, Xu, &amp; Wellman, 2010; Pesowski, Denison, &amp; Friedman, 2016), and expectations that people will value things they like (Jara-Ettinger, Gweon, Tenenbaum, &amp; Schulz, 2015). We did not predict a complete reversal of results (i.e., significantly favoring the child with greater resources as performing the focal action) because the modified scenarios could still support a diminishing marginal utility-like interpretation. It is unclear exactly how much to weigh the lower quantity of one individual's resources (motivating the prediction that the individual with less will perform the focal action) against the stronger preference of the other individual (motivating the opposite prediction). The main goal of Study 2 was to determine whether children can use a prediction strategy based on preferences rather than quantities. However, the results of Study 2 also can support, or rule out, deflationary accounts for children's Study 1 performance. We focus on three alternatives here. Given children's dislike of inequality between individuals (McAuliffe, Blake, Steinbeis, &amp; Warneken, 2017), participants in Study 1 may have predicted that the individuals with fewer resources would obtain the extra resource out of a desire to see the inequality between the individuals get reduced. If true, we would not expect to see a different pattern of results in Study 2 than in Study 1 for the action scenarios, as the numerical quantities are identical in both studies.</figDesc></figure>

Participants in Study 2 were significantly less likely to choose the individual with fewer toys as performing the focal action than participants in Study 1. Thus, children readily incorporated information about the individuals' preferences when making their predictions; recall that, in Study 2, only the child with greater toys "loved" the toy category. Taken together, these data indicate children's receptiveness to multiple kinds of information when estimating others' resource valuations. A diminishing marginal utilitylike pattern predominated in Study 1, but when this concept's conditions were undermined in Study 2 due to differences in the individuals' preferences, this pattern was less likely. Thus, a quantitybased approach to resource valuation is applied selectively rather than blindly.The preferences-based shift seen in children's predictions was also reflected in children's explanations. In Study 2, children's explanations emphasized the individuals' preferences, in contrast to their emphasis on quantity in Study 1. Both studies' scripts were similar; they mentioned the individuals' resource quantities and their degree of liking for the resources. The change in children's explanations across studies suggests that the proto-diminishing marginal utility themes mentioned in Study 1 were not an automatic consequence of the scripts' semantic content (e.g., a script that mentions quantities will inevitably result in most children discussing quantities in their explanations) but were due instead to the scripts' concepts. While participants rarely chose the child with less in Study 2, those who did so often offered similar explanations for their choices as participants in Study 1. For instead, one child in Study 2 explained, "this kid still has four playdohs but if [the other kid] lost one she wouldn't have any." A diminishing marginal utility-like interpretation of Study 2 was still compatible with the script but it was generally overtaken by the competing information about preferences.</figDesc></figure>

Performance on both questions was strong (ranging from 77% to 98% correct; most responses that were not "correct" came from participants who declined to answer or gave vague responses), indicating that most participants retained these details. Please see Supplement 5 for more information. After the first block concluded, participants were offered a brief break (either coloring or reading a Where's Waldo book for a few minutes, as chosen by the participant) to reduce boredom. Next, participants saw one additional block of three trials for a new scenario, which included the explanation prompt and comprehension questions. For the sake of having children hear a mix of positive and negative</figDesc><table /><note>events, the script pairings were as follows: Gain &amp; Sad, Sad &amp; Gain, Happy &amp; Recover, and Recover &amp; Happy.</note></figure>

A visual inspection of the data, displayed in Figure 1, suggested that, relative to older children, younger children's responses varied more depending on scenario, most notably scoring lower in the Happy and Recover Block than the other blocks. Because of the significant interaction, separate models were run for each scenario, with age group as the main predictor. Age group was not a significant predictor of DMU-consistent responses within the Gain and Sad scenarios (all confidence intervals overlapped with 0) but was a significant predictor within the Happy (β = 3.39, CI [1.38, 10.9], OR = 29.70, p &lt; .001) and Recover scenarios (β = 1.47, CI [0.48, 2.91], OR = 4.34). Additionally, separate models were created for each age group, with scenario as the main predictor. For younger children, confidence intervals did not overlap with 0 for Happy (β = -2.79, CI [-4.45, -1.77], OR = 16.20) and Recover (β = -1.13, CI [-2.55, -</note></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">This prediction was based on our belief that some children may fail to focus on the script's reminder to consider the emotional change as a result of gaining one toy and instead reason about whether a child with fewer or greater toys was happier in general; children who interpreted the script in this way would likely predict that the child with more toys would be happier.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">We included children's first-block explanations since they were the purest responses, by virtue of being generated in response to the first query for explanations. However, results for the second-block explanations were qualitatively similar to first-block explanations; they are displayed in Supplements 8, 9, and 12.</note>
