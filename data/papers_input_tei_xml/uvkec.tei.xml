			<abstract>
				<p>This research explores anthropomorphism and gender presentation as prospective determinants of trust in household service robots with respect to care of objects (e.g., clothing, valuables), information (e.g., online passwords, credit card numbers), and living agents (e.g., pets, children). In Experiments 1 and 2, we compared trust in a humanoid robot presenting as male, female, or gender-neutral, finding no effects of gender presentation on any trust outcome. In Experiment 3, a fourth condition depicting a physically nonhumanoid robot was added. Relative to the humanoid conditions, participants reported less willingness to trust the nonhumanoid robot to care for their objects, personal information, or vulnerable agents; the reduced trust in care for objects or information was mediated by appraisals of the nonhumanoid as less intelligent and less likable, whereas the reduced trust in care of agents was mediated by appraisals of the nonhumanoid as less likable and less alive. In a parallel pattern, across all studies, participants&apos; appraisals of robots as intelligent tracked trust in them to take care of objects or information (but not agents), whereas appraisals of robots as likable and alive tracked trust in care of agents. The results are discussed as they inform past work examining effects of gender presentation and anthropomorphism on perceptions of, and trust in, robots.</p>

One critical design consideration for the successful deployment of service robots is the extent to which humans will trust them to perform tasks which entail risk of harm to valuables or living agents should errors be made. An extensive human factors literature has identified anthropomorphic design as an important determinant of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen &amp; Barnes, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Hoff &amp; Bashir, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chiou &amp; Lee, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deng, Mutlu &amp; Mataric, 2019)</ref>, which may be defined as the attitude that an agent will help one to achieve objectives under circumstances characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lee &amp; See, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Anthropomorphic cues suggestive of interpersonal engagement, such as emotional expressiveness, eye gaze, and vocal variability, have been found to increase trust in social robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mutlu, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">DeGraaf &amp; Allouch, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kuhnert, Ragni &amp; Lindner, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ruhland et al., 2015)</ref>. Indeed, robots exhibiting social cues such as gestures or facial expressions have been appraised as comparably trustworthy to human interaction partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DeSteno, Breazeal, Frank, Pizarro, Baumann, Dickens &amp; Lee, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Gender constructs are a fundamental aspect of anthropomorphism. Concepts of femininity and masculinity are traditional social constructs associated with binary understandings of biological sex which remain culturally pervasive despite being scientifically oversimplified <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(DuBois &amp; Shattuck-Heidorn, 2021)</ref>. Gender constructs organize social relationships-in varying ways and to varying degrees-across human societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lew-Levy, Lavi, Reckin, Cristóbal-Azkarate, &amp; Ellis-Davies, 2018)</ref>. Natural selection likely favored the evolution of psychological mechanisms that categorize individuals by sex in order to facilitate inferences about highly fitness-relevant social considerations such compatibility for mating and parenting, in addition to inferences about individuals' likely aptitude and tendencies to engage in activities that may be gendered to a relevant extent in the society in which a human develops (e.g., potential cultural constructs linking gender roles with foraging, fighting, or leadership). Indeed, experiments in cognitive psychology reveal a robust, automatic categorization of individuals according to gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pietraszewski, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 2014)</ref>. Accordingly, to the extent that they evoke human gender constructs, artificial agent designs incorporating gendered presentation may influence trust with regard to socially gendered task domains (e.g., the association between childcare roles and femininity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bernotat, Eyssel, &amp; Sachse, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tay, Jung &amp; Park, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, Eysell &amp; Hegel, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kuchenbrandt et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Reich-Stiebert &amp; Eyssel, 2017)</ref>. Here, we examine gender presentation, as well as overall physical anthropomorphism, as prospective determinants of trust in robots with respect to care of household objects (e.g., clothing, valuables), living agents (e.g., pets, children), and information (e.g., online passwords, credit card numbers).</p><p>Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has obtained mixed results with regard to effects of gender presentation on trust. In a field study at a science museum, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Siegel, Breazeal, and Norton (2009)</ref> assigned a humanoid robot either a masculine or feminine voice, finding that men rated the female-presenting robot as more credible and trustworthy than the male-presenting robot, whereas the reverse pattern obtained (to a weaker degree) in women, who rated the malepresenting robot as slightly more credible and trustworthy than the female-presenting robot. In a later study, this time manipulating gender according to the voice and name assigned to the robot <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alexander et al., 2014)</ref>, participants once again exhibited preferences for the robot of opposite apparent gender to their own. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr">Ghazali and colleagues (2018)</ref> found that participants experienced more negative thoughts and feelings when interacting with a robot portraying the opposite gender to themselves during a game task in which the robot attempted to influence their decisions using forceful language, with no effects of participant gender or the robot's gender presentation on trust. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Rogers, Bryant and Howard (2020)</ref> found that attributions of gender to a humanoid robot did not significantly impact assessments of the robot's competency to perform various service tasks, although this study's experimental manipulation of gender may have been weak given that participants in a substantial number of cases reported perceiving the robot as corresponding to a gender identity other than the condition to which they had been assigned. Finally, a recent meta-analysis examining effects of robot gender presentation on HRI in studies published between 2005 and 2021 found no reliable impact on assessments of robots' competence, likability, or acceptability <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Perugia &amp; Lisy, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The mixed effects of gender presentation on trust in robots may reflect the social contexts and/or focal tasks under which trust is gauged, such that relationships between gender and trust are more evident in task domains characterized by salient gender stereotypes. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eyssel and Hegel (2012)</ref> found that participants judged a female-presenting robot to be more well-suited to perform stereotypically feminine tasks (e.g., childcare, household maintenance), whereas a male-presenting robot was judged more well-suited to perform stereotypically masculine tasks (e.g., repairing equipment). In a complementary finding, <ref type="bibr">Carpenter and colleagues (2009)</ref> found that participants preferred a female-presenting, highly anthropomorphic humanoid (e.g., equipped with human facial features, skin and hair) to perform tasks such as cleaning or washing dishes inside their homes relative to a non-gendered, less anthropomorphic humanoid (e.g., covered in metal, lacking humanlike facial features). Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tay, Jung, and Park (2014)</ref> similarly observed that gender presentation (manipulated via synthetic voice and gendered names: "John" versus "Joan") led participants in a laboratory study to accept a masculine-seeming robot over a feminine-seeming robot to perform household security tasks, (e.g., monitoring for intruders), but to accept a feminine-seeming robot to perform healthcare tasks. In another study supporting a link between gender presentation and trust to perform gender-aligned tasks, a robot assigned a feminine body shape (i.e., based on waist-to-hip ratio and shoulder width) was preferred for stereotypically female tasks over a robot with a typically male body shape, although the two robots were perceived as equally suitable to perform stereotypically male tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bernotat, Eyssel &amp; Sachse, 2021)</ref>. A recent meta-analysis likewise found that manipulations of robot gender-presentation are most successful at eliciting stereotypical biases in perceptions of their suitability to perform gendered tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Perugia &amp; Lisy, 2023)</ref>. In summary, a body of findings indicates that trust in robots may be moderated by whether gender stereotypes associated with particular tasks align or diverge from the gender with which the robot presents.</p><p>Against the above pattern of findings, however, a study examining effects of the genderpronouns assigned a small humanoid robot (NAO; Gelin, 2017) on its perceived suitability for stereotypically gendered tasks (e.g., housework, physical labor) revealed no effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rea, Wang, &amp; Young, 2015)</ref>, although these null results may be explained by the weakness of the manipulation, as the robot was neither made to appear or sound gendered, and as a miniature robot would presumably be ill-suited to the gendered tasks that were used. A study which utilized stronger methods, manipulating gender in terms of the name and voice of a larger humanoid presumably more capable of performing physical work (Pepper; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pandey &amp; Gelin, 2018)</ref>, similarly observed no effects of gender-presentation on appraisals of trustworthiness or competency to perform gendered tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bryant, Borenstein, &amp; Howard, 2020)</ref>. These null results render the empirical picture, with regard to both effects of gender-presentation and interactions between robot gender and confidence in robots' ability to perform stereotypically gendered tasks, as mixed at best. Some null results may owe to the relatively anemic manipulations of gender used in prior work (e.g., subtle shifts in pronouns or names without distinctly gendered visual designs), as well as reliance on robots that realistically could not perform key service tasks (e.g., due to their small size or limitations in their physical affordances), such as the NAO, Furhat, or Robovie <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Perugia &amp; Lisy, 2023)</ref>. We therefore conducted three pre-registered experiments with an adult-sized humanoid robot programmed with clearly gendered faces and voices in order to provide a stronger test of the extent to which manipulations of gender presentation influence trust across distinct task domains varying in gender-associations (e.g., stereotypically feminine tasks such as childcare versus less gendered tasks such as managing vital personal information). In Experiments 1 and 2, we compared trust in a humanoid robot configured to present with a masculine face and voice, a feminine face and voice, or as a gender-neutral persona with no facial features and a synthetic-sounding voice. Accordingly, the latter condition constituted both a non-gendered and a less anthropomorphic presentation of the humanoid robot. In Experiment 3, we added a nonhumanoid robot condition to provide a clearer contrast in physical anthropomorphism. Taken together, these three studies test both the potential impact of gender presentation and of degree of physical anthropomorphism on trust.</p><p>In each study, we also measured the extent to which participants appraised the robot as intelligent and as likable, because trustworthiness has been conceptualized as rooted in corresponding perceptions of ability (i.e., task-competence presumably related to intelligence) and benevolence (i.e., desire to help presumably related affiliative likability) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mayer, Davis &amp; Schoorman, 1995)</ref>. We therefore expected ratings of robot trustworthiness to correspond with appraisals of both intelligence and likability. Some prior research also suggests that, in line with human gender stereotypes, robots designed to present as masculine are appraised as relatively high in ability whereas robots presenting as feminine are appraised as relatively high in benevolence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eyssel &amp; Hegel, 2012)</ref>, although other investigators have failed to observe these contrasts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bryant, Borenstein, &amp; Howard, 2020)</ref>; we sought to retest these claims here, using a robot platform capable of presenting unambiguously gendered, adult-sized humanoids.</p><p>For exploratory reasons, because the agents in question in this context of trust assessment are artificial, we also assessed appraisals of the robots as alive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictions and Exploratory tests</head><p>The design allowed us to test a number of potential effects of gender presentation and anthropomorphism:</p><p>1.

All studies were approved by the University of California, Merced, Institutional Review Board, informed consent was obtained prior to participation, and all methods were in accord with relevant guidelines and regulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>We targeted a sample size of 500, recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (500 + completed assignments, 99% approval, located in the USA) in exchange for U.S. $0.65 in the Fall of 2020. Data were prescreened for providing complete responses, answering a 'catch question,' watching the entire robot video (based on a page timer) and technical problems with video streaming reported by participants. The final sample consisted of 474 participants (47.9% female, Mage = 39.82 years, SD = 13.09).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>In a between-subjects design, a humanoid robot was presented with either a male face, voice and name (the Masculine condition, N = 158), a female face, voice and name (the Feminine condition, N = 163), or as faceless, nameless and using an artificial-sounding voice (the Less Anthropomorphic condition N = 153; see <ref type="bibr">Figure 1,</ref><ref type="bibr">top)</ref>. The humanoid was equipped with an actuated torso, legs, arms, hands and fingers (RoboThespian; Engineered Arts, n.d.a), and a head unit capable of rich variation in facial characteristics and expressiveness using a rearprojected face (Socibot; Engineered Arts, n.d.b). The robot introduced itself in a 35s video as a "household robot" which could be integrated into participants' homes "to perform a wide variety of tasks, including cleaning, cooking, home security and babysitting". The video was edited to resemble a promotional film, and included both facial closeups and shots highlighting its humanoid body shape and movement capacities (e.g., gesture). The Masculine robot identified itself as "Graham", the Feminine robot identified itself as "Rachel" (corresponding to the names assigned their synthesized voices; Acapela <ref type="bibr">Group, n.d.)</ref> , and the Less Anthropomorphic robot did not identify itself by name.</p><p>After watching the video, participants were asked to report their degree of willingness to trust the robot to perform five household tasks involving objects (i.e., cleaning, doing laundry, watering plants, cooking, handling valuables; composited as a measure of Trust in Care of Objects, α = .87) or to provide care to five different types of living agents (i.e., pets, elderly people, teenagers, young children, infants; composited as a measure of Trust in Care of Agents, α = .90). (A redundant measure probing trust to physically carry objects / agents was also included, see Supplementary Material for details.)</p><p>Participants were also asked to rate their appraisals of the robot's likability ("The robot seems friendly", "I like this robot"; r = .71), intelligence ("The robot seems intelligent", "The robot seems responsible"; r = .74) and aliveness ("The robot seems conscious", "The robot seems alive"; r = .83). The trust and appraisal items (randomized) were presented in separate blocks (randomized). All of the above ratings were produced using the same 7-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Somewhat disagree, 4 = Neither agree nor disagree, 5 <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Top: Humanoid "household" robots (RoboThespian with Socibot head unit), presenting with either a masculine face, name and voice (top left), a feminine face, name and voice (top middle), or faceless, nameless and equipped with a gender-neutral synthetic-sounding voice (top right). Bottom left: The humanoid robots (masculine persona shown here) were depicted producing humanlike gestures, facial expressions and postural shifts. Bottom right: Nonhumanoid "household" robot added as a fourth condition for Experiment 3, and depicted producing non-anthropomorphic movements of its base, appendages and grippers (modified Turtlebot). Due to the dark background, the hands and grippers depicted in still images are difficult to see, but were clearly visible in the videos (see Supplementary Material for links.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Preliminary analyses revealed no significant effects of participant gender, nor interactions between participant gender and robot condition, on any of the trust or appraisal outcomes. Accordingly, participant gender was not included in subsequent analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Null Effects of Robot Condition on Trust in Care of Objects or Agents</head><p>Against Predictions 1 and 2a, we observed no main effects of robot condition, ps .379 -.751, nor did post hoc contrasts reveal any significant differences between robot conditions, ps .187 -.799, on either Trust in Care of Objects or Trust in Care of Agents. Instead, on average, participants evinced a moderate degree of willingness to trust any of the three humanoid robots to care for valuable objects (see <ref type="bibr">Figure 2)</ref>, and a relatively low degree of willingness to trust any of the three humanoid robots to care for vulnerable agents (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Null Effects of Robot Condition on Appraisals of Likability, Intelligence, or Aliveness</head><p>We observed a significant main effect of the robot manipulation on appraisals of Aliveness, F(2, 471) = 4.54, p = .011, ηp 2 = .02, and simple comparisons revealed that the Masculine robot was appraised to be more Alive than the Less Anthropomorphic robot, p = .003, 95% CI [.21, 1.00]. Against Prediction 2b, analyses of variance revealed no other significant effects of robot condition on appraisals of Likability, Intelligence, or Aliveness, ps .115-.852.</p><p>Instead, on average, participants appraised the three humanoid robots as comparably high in all three dimensions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for descriptives).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asymmetric Associations between Appraisal Dimensions and Trust Categories</head><p>Pearson's correlations revealed that the three trust and the three appraisal dimensions were all moderately positively associated rs .47 -.64, ps &lt; .001. We next conducted a series of simultaneous linear regressions including covarying appraisals of Likability, Intelligence, and of Agents in the model, p = .218.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Against predictions, we observed no effects of either the manipulation of gender presentation, or relative anthropomorphism, on either trust outcome. Similarly, we found no effects of condition on appraisals of Likability or Intelligence, although there was a modest significant contrast between the perceived Aliveness of the Masculine robot relative to the Less Anthropomorphic robot. Consistent with predictions, we found that appraisals of Likability and Intelligence, as well as Aliveness, were positively correlated with Trust in Care of both Objects and Agents. Strikingly, regression analyses revealed that trust in robots to care for Objects was positively associated with appraisals of their Intelligence (but not Likability or Aliveness), whereas trust in robots to care for vulnerable Agents was positively associated with appraisals of robot Likability and Aliveness (but not Intelligence). This pattern is consistent with claims that social robots activate intuitive social schemas, here, for example, linking perceived affiliative likability with traits associated with rendering care to living creatures and people, such as interpersonal warmth and compassion. In prior research, likability has similarly been shown to track trust in robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ghazali et al., 2018)</ref>. But from an objective standpoint, likability and seeming aliveness appear mostly irrelevant to considerations of whether a machine can provide adequate care to pets, children, or the elderly. Notwithstanding the value of such appealing characteristics to enhancing the experiences of those being cared for (e.g., they may find affable robot caregivers more appealing), arguably the most critical capacity that should be desired in a caregiver is the capacity to respond intelligently and responsibly to circumstances. Yet here we observed that appraisals of Intelligencewhich, notably, was measured using the term "responsible" as well as "intelligent"did not drive trust in robots to care for agents, but instead predicted trust in the care of objects.</p><p>We next sought to replicate and to extend these findings in two ways. First, given the unexpected absence of effects of the gender and anthropomorphism manipulation, we added a measure of the robot's nurturing qualities, as gender stereotypes broadly associate femininity with nurturance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ellemers, 2018)</ref>. In this way, Experiment 2 provides a stronger test of whether the gendered presentation of the humanoid robot can cause participants to attribute gendered human social qualities to the robot (i.e., less nurturing qualities appraised in the Masculine condition than in the Feminine condition). Second, we added a domain of trust which would be unconfounded by differences in physical task demands, as, in addition to differing in what or whom is cared for, Trust in Care of Objects versus Agents may be imagined as requiring differing physical capacities. We therefore asked participants to assess the trustworthiness of the robot to care for their sensitive personal information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>We again targeted a sample size of 500, recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (500 + completed assignments, 99% approval, located in the USA) in exchange for U.S. $0.65 in the winter of 2020. Data were prescreened as in Experiment 1. The final sample consisted of 481 participants (58.8% female, Mage = 39.39 years, SD = 12.06).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The between-subjects design mirrored Experiment 1 (Masculine condition, N = 165;</p><p>Feminine condition, N = 159; Less Anthropomorphic condition N = 157), with participants once again rating their degree of willingness to trust the robot to Trust in Care of Objects (α = .89), or Trust in Care of Agents (α = .92). In addition, participants were asked to report their willingness to Trust in Care of Information (i.e., bank account information, credit and debit card numbers, online passwords, social security numbers, healthcare-related information, passport and/or driver's license information, α = .97). As in Experiment 1, participants were also again asked to rate their appraisals of the robot's Likability (r = .69), Intelligence (r = .68) and Aliveness (r = .74). In addition, we solicited participants' appraisals of the robot's Nurturant qualities (i.e., "The robot seems nurturing", "The robot seems warm", r = .77; see Supplementary Material for additional exploratory measures of assertiveness). The trust and appraisal items <ref type="bibr">(randomized)</ref> were again presented in separate blocks (randomized), and rated using the same 7-point Likert scale as previously.

Similarly, against expectations, we found no effects of condition on appraisals of Likability, Intelligence, Aliveness, or Nurturance, the latter of which we had anticipated to be influenced by our manipulation of the robot's gender presentation. Consistent with predictions, and as in Experiment 1, we observed patterns of asymmetric association between appraisal dimensions and trust domains. As in the prior study, regression analyses revealed that trust in robots to care for vulnerable Agents was positively associated with appraisals of their Likability and Aliveness (but not Intelligence). Somewhat replicating the prior pattern, trust in robots to care for Objects was positively associated with appraisals of their Intelligence (but not Aliveness), although in Experiment 2 Likability was also associated albeit to a lesser degree than Intelligence. In a similar pattern, appraisals of the robot as Intelligent and as Likable (but not as alive) equivalently predicted respect to Trust in the Care of Information. In sum, Experiment 2 provided additional support for the hypothesis that trust across contexts is sensitive to thematically associated social qualities evoked by robots, such that perceptions of an agent as benevolently friendly and alive engender greater willingness to trust them to care for vulnerable agents than do perceptions of competent intelligence, which are more associated with willingness to care for physical objects or sensitive personal data.</p><p>In addition to testing prior claims regarding robot gender presentation, Experiments 1 and 2 were also intended to test potential related effects of anthropomorphism. However, these studies were limited insofar as we did not manipulate anthropomorphism in an unambiguous manner, but rather with the faceless humanoid in the Less Anthropomorphic condition.</p><p>Therefore, in Experiment 3 we added a nonhumanoid robot condition.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Across three experiments, we explored potential effects of both feminine versus masculine gender presentation and relative anthropomorphism on trust in household service robots. We manipulated anthropomorphism by presenting, in contrast to the gendered humanoids, a faceless humanoid robot with a synthetic-sounding, non-gendered voice in the first two experiments, as well as with an additional nonhumanoid robot using the same syntheticsounding voice in Experiment 3. Broadly consonant with prior work linking anthropomorphism to trust, we observed significantly less trust in the nonhumanoid relative to any of the three humanoids. However, against prior literature reporting effects of gender presentation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eyssel &amp; Hegel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bernotat, Eyssel &amp; Sachse, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Perugia &amp; Lisy, 2023)</ref>, we found no consistent patterns of difference between the masculine and feminine humanoids with regard to trust or appraisal outcomes, regardless of face-valid thematic links between the trust domains or appraisal dimensions and human gender stereotypes (e.g., linking femininity with trust in care of vulnerable agents or appraisals of nurturance). Similarly contradicting prior reports (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Siegel, Breazeal &amp; Norton, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alexander et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bernotat, Eyssel &amp; Sachse, 2021)</ref>, we observed no effects of participant gender, nor interactions between participant gender and gendered robot condition, on either trust in the gendered humanoids or appraisals of their likability or intelligence. On the one hand, the present null effects of both participant gender and robot gender presentation call prior reports into question as either limited in their generalizability or flukes.</p><p>On the other hand, our reliance on online viewing of robots via video rather than in person or in direct interaction raises the plausible possibility that some of the non-replicated prior observations were contingent on physical presence, interaction, or both (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Siegel, Breazeal &amp; Norton, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tay, Jung &amp; Park, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Reich-Stiebert &amp; Eyssel, 2017)</ref>. In addition, to our knowledge, no prior studies examining effects of gender presentation have utilized humanoid robots equipped with highly human faces, raising the possibility that effects of gender presentation of the sort reported in prior literature can be obscured when robots are relatively high in anthropomorphism.</p><p>Although we did not observe interactions between participant gender and the gender with which the humanoids presented, we did observe a main effect of participant gender applicable across robot conditions. In Experiment 3, we found that women, relative to men, evinced less trust in household robots to care for vulnerable agents. However, although this result accords with both folk intuitions and prior literature attributing greater concern for the welfare of children to women (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kroska, 2003)</ref>, the temptation to draw such conclusions should be tempered given that no effect of gender on trust in care of agents was obtained in either Experiments 1 or 2, nor did other prior researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ghazali et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bryant et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rea et al., 2015)</ref> find effects of gender on trust in gendered robots. Similarly, the effects of gender on appraisals of robot intelligence and seeming aliveness obtained in Experiment 3 should be treated with skepticism given that they were neither anticipated on theoretical grounds nor observed in the two prior studies.</p><p>As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 2-4</ref> show, we obtained considerable variation in participant's willingness to trust across domains, with participants reporting, on average, moderate trust in the robot to care for objects (just above the midpoint anchor of 'neither agree nor disagree'), or information (just below the midpoint anchor), and more skepticism regarding trust in the care of agents (midway between 'disagree' and 'somewhat disagree'). Future investigations should attempt to illuminate the individual differences driving the notable degree of variation, plausibly including determinants related to attitudes toward automation, familiarity with engineering and technology, and, as explored in the present studies, appraisals of the robots in question. In all three experiments, models using our face-valid measures of apparent intelligence, likability, and aliveness as predictors of trust outcomes evinced relatively good fit with the data, explaining between 18% and 49% of the variation. Future work either refining the way these constructs are measured or adding additional predictors, possibly including implicit or physiological responses to artificial agents rather than relying on self-report as here, may help to account for the considerable remaining variance.</p><p>Across all experiments, we obtained robustly consistent patterns of association between trust in specific domains and thematically related appraisals of the robots' qualities.</p><p>Simultaneous regression analyses revealed that appraisals of robots as intelligent tracked ratings of trust in them to take care of either objects or information (but not agents), whereas appraisals of robots as likable and alive tracked trust in them to care for agents, in a pattern resembling that reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ghazali et al. (2018)</ref>, who also found tendencies to trust a robot's advice to be positively correlated with perceptions of the robot as likable. <ref type="bibr">Mayer and colleagues' (1995)</ref> influential model of factors predicting trust appears to conceptually accord with this pattern.</p><p>Within their model, benevolence, or the perceived desire of an agent to beneficially help the trustor, promotes trust and is intrinsically related to affiliative feelings of attachment, whereas ability promotes trust rooted in the agent's task-relevant skills and competencies. Although we did not directly assess perceived benevolence or ability in the present studies, our measures of likability and intelligence arguably relate to these respective dimensions. If so, then trust in robots to care for agents appears intuitively driven by assessments of these machines as benevolent, and by implication to harbor reciprocal feelings of affiliative attachment motivating them to advance the welfare of pets, children, the elderly, or other agents in their charge.</p><p>Notwithstanding calls to implement artificial empathy aligning AI with goals to support human welfare (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Christov-Moore et al., 2023)</ref>, intuiting kindly motives to robots is troublingly irrational: machines lack capacities for affiliation or associated benevolent intentions. The robust replicability of our findings linking trust in a robot's capacity to care for living beings as driven by perceptions of their likability moreso than of their intelligence suggests a naïve propensity to overestimate machine agents' suitability for caregiving tasks should they be designed to mimic social warmth and affability. To be fair, insofar as living agents would emotionally benefit from machine caregivers exhibiting affiliative cues, it may be sensible to prefer these social qualities (e.g., a pet or child might be more comfortable with a socially warm robot taking care of them).</p><p>Nonetheless, with regard to artificial agents' capacities to respond to safetyor health-relevant circumstances, appraisals of ability should supersede appraisals of likability or seeming aliveness. Our findings therefore motivate further work exploring the extent to which apparent warmth and likability may lead to dangerous overestimates of machines' suitability to care for vulnerable agents.</p><p>The nonhumanoid robot in Experiment 3 was trusted less in all domains, and these reductions were mediated by lower appraisals of its intelligence, likability, and aliveness, in patterns corresponding to the thematic links between appraisal dimensions and trust outcomes also observed in the humanoid robot conditions. The finding that participants trusted the nonhumanoid less with regard to care of information, a task which does not entail physical demands, further supports the interpretation that it was not inferred limitations of its physical design which depressed trust in its capacity to perform, but rather effects of its physical design on perceptions of it as less human-and hence as less intelligent, likable, nurturant or alive.</p><p>Correspondingly, the null differences between trust in the less anthropomorphic, faceless humanoid and the gendered humanoids may be explained by the comparably high appraisals of the three humanoids on all dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>A possible take-home summary of the present research could be that overall physical anthropomorphism is an important determinant of trust in household service robots, whereas gender presentation is not. We encourage readers to resist this conclusion pending further investigation employing behavioral measures of trust and longitudinal designs. It may be the case that individuals evince more or less trust in contexts of actual interaction than is captured by their self-reports regarding counterfactual trust scenarios. Likewise, whereas latent effects of gender presentation may be masked in a one-shot encounter with a highly anthropomorphic agent, particularly at the time of writing when human-robot interaction remains relatively rare for most individuals, iterated interaction with service robots may reveal gender presentation to be an important determinant of trust over time, particularly in gendered task domains. For now, our results may be taken to predict consequences of design choices with regard to gender presentation and physical anthropomorphism on the public's initial appraisals of and trust in household robots.</p></div>

Representations of the robot as possessing emotional capacitieshere, to suffer-were gauged based on participants' own spontaneous feelings of sympathy toward it because, following Holbrook (2018), we speculated that this may be a more effective way of tapping intuitions of the robot as a feeling agent, as opposed to asking participants to state their declarative beliefs regarding the robot's putative emotional states (i.e., the 'correct' answer would be that the robot lacks emotion).</p><p>We conducted analyses of variance, including participant gender as a covariate, on participants' sympathy for the robot, finding no effects of robot condition, nor interactions between robot condition and participant gender, in either study, ps .123 -.925, nor any effect of gender in Experiment 2, p = .397.

In both cases, participants who expressed bias favoring men over women reported greater trust in the Feminine robot to care for household objects or agents, in line with gender stereotypes regarding tasks such as cooking, doing laundry, or providing childcare (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure   S1</ref>, below).

Mediation analyses revealed that differences between the Humanoid and Nonhumanoid with respect to trust in care of agents was partially mediated by differences in perceived Likability and Aliveness (but not Intelligence), whereas the lower trust in the Nonhumanoid to care for objects or information was mediated by lower appraisals of Intelligence and Likability. Correspondingly, and as in Experiments 1 and 2, we observed patterns of asymmetric association between appraisal dimensions and trust domains, such that trust in robots to care for vulnerable Agents was positively associated with appraisals of their Likability and Aliveness (but not Intelligence), and trust in robots to care for Objects or Information was positively associated with appraisals of their Intelligence and Likability (but not Aliveness).</figDesc></figure>
