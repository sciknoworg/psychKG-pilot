			<abstract>
				<p>The measurement of product appraisals is critical for research on consumer decision making. Past research has demonstrated that both carefully formed, contemplated attitudes, but also spontaneously elicited, automatic evaluations play a crucial role in guiding consumption choices. However, the accurate measurement of automatic product appraisals can be challenging because existing measures can assess automatic appraisals on single attribute dimensions only (e.g., &apos;pleasant&apos;/&apos;unpleasant&apos;). This limitation is critical because a) products are never unidimensional, and b) past research has demonstrated that the complex weighting of various product dimensions (e.g., price, taste, healthiness) often plays a crucial role in consumer decision making (Maehle, Iversen, Hem, &amp; Otnes, 2015). Here, we present the Implicit Attribute Classification Task (&apos;IMPACT&apos;), a new measure of automatic product appraisals that, crucially, was designed specifically to reflect the multidimensionality of products by assessing automatic product appraisals of multiple product facets simultaneously. Following guidelines put forward by De Houwer et al. (2009), we thoroughly examine the IMPACT in terms of key features of automaticity. Across five experiments, we show that the appraisals measured by the IMPACT occur fast, in the absence of intention, and when cognitive resources are constraint. Collectively, our findings make a substantial contribution to research on consumer decision making by introducing the IMPACT as a sophisticated new tool that, for the first time, facilitates the assessment of automatic appraisals of multiple product facets at once.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Marketing research has traditionally relied predominantly on self-report measures to investigate consumer choices. Such measures tap into easily accessible, often contemplated evaluations and attitudes, and are efficient, convenient, and economical research tools that have made valuable contributions to our understanding of consumer decision-making. However, the utility of self-reports in the study of consumer behaviour are subject to two key constraints.</p><p>First, the insights that self-reports provide are limited in situations in which consumers are incapable of introspection or reluctant to accurately report their attitudes or opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brunel, Tietje, and Greenwald, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bargh, 2021)</ref>. Second, because everyday consumption contexts are often characterised by distractors and limited time resources, consumers may not always have the capacity to contemplate their decisions and, instead, must rely on more automated evaluations to guide their decision-making.</p><p>Such automatic evaluations can be defined as processes that occur fast, may not rely on substantial cognitive resources, may occur in the absence of intention or awareness, and/or may be difficult to control <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Moors &amp; De Houwer, 2006)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wood and Neal (2009)</ref> collated evidence that consumer choices are particularly guided by automatic influences when the choice is made under time pressure, the consumer is distracted, or when self-control resources are limited. Moreover, many scholars have discussed the important role that automatic cognition plays in consumer judgement (see, e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bargh, 2021)</ref>, and a number of studies have demonstrated the critical role that automatic processes can play in guiding consumption decisions. For instance, automatic appraisals have been shown to predict brand preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Friese, WÃ¤nke, &amp; Plessner, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Maison, Greenwald, &amp; Bruin, 2004)</ref> environmental consumer decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beattie &amp; Sale, 2011)</ref>, and food choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kemps &amp; Tiggemann, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> as participants have been shown to produce larger IAT scores for the target-attribute pairing they are first presented with, compared to the reversed key assignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Greenwald &amp; Nosek, 2001</ref>).</p><p>In addition, the relative nature of IAT scores limits their interpretation. Instead of indicating an individual's absolute attitude, the IAT measures how closely one target category is associated with an attribute relative to the other target category. For instance, if an individual is quicker to associate positive stimuli with candy than with fruit, it does not necessarily imply a negative bias towards fruit. Instead, the individual could have positive associations with both categories and merely have a relative preference for one.</p><p>Another crucial issue with the IAT is that the format of the attribute categories reduces potentially complex attitudes into a binary format and allows the measurement of only one attribute binary per iteration of the IAT. This is particularly troublesome in the field of marketing research, because the appraisals that shape real-world consumer decisions are often not strictly binary (e.g., a product might fall anywhere on the continuum between healthy and unhealthy), and because products are complex stimuli that can be evaluated on a multitude of characteristics (e.g., aesthetics, price, taste, etc.). The latter is particularly relevant to capture where some product attributes increase the likelihood of consumption (e.g., 'chocolate is tasty'), while others decrease the likelihood of consumption (e.g., 'chocolate in unhealthy'). This limitation is not unique to the IAT though, and although obtaining a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of implicit consumer appraisals has the potential to substantially improve the link between automatic appraisals and real life consumer choices, there is currently no existing measure of automatic consumer appraisals that allows the recording of multiple product appraisals at once. Accordingly, while understanding the automatic attitudes that inform consumer preferences has the potential to significantly improve the prediction of The Implicit Attribute Classification Task consumer choices, the effectiveness of using these attitudes in consumer research is currently hindered by the methodological limitations of existing measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task</head><p>To directly address these issues, we developed the Implicit Attribute Classification Task ('IMPACT'). The IMPACT is a new implicit measure that was designed specifically to allow the measurement of automatic appraisals of multiple product characteristics simultaneously in order to more closely reflect the complex nature of products that consumers encounter in realworld settings.</p><p>The IMPACT is a reaction-time based measure that draws on task-rule congruency effects. This effect occurs when two tasks share the same stimuli and response mode (e.g., a key-press), and the response rule learned in one task interferes with the performance on a second task. Specifically, performance is facilitated if the response rules of both tasks are compatible, or hindered if the response rules of the tasks are incompatible (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liefooghe, Wenke, &amp; De Houwer, 2012)</ref>. In the IMPACT, respondents switch between an evaluative task rule, and a non-evaluative task rule.</p><p>Each trial of the IMPACT consists of a centrally displayed box that contains a target stimulus (e.g., an image of a product) positioned above an attribute word (e.g., 'HEALTHY').</p><p>These stimuli pairs remain on the screen for a short time before they disappear and a task cue is displayed below the box. Because the IMPACT consists of intermixed evaluative and a nonevaluative task trials, this cue is used to indicate to participants which task they are required to perform. In the evaluative task trials, participants are asked to indicate whether the target and the attribute match or mismatch by pressing either a left-hand or a right-hand key. These evaluative task trials are indicated by the cue "???" and are used to train participants to process the relation of the target-attribute pair, and map their evaluation onto the corresponding keys. hand or right-hand key depending on whether the cue 'YES' or the cue 'NO' appears. This keypress is independent of the participants' evaluation of the (mis-)match of the stimuli pairs (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for a schematic of the procedure).</p><p>Because each response key now shares two meanings (e.g., indicate the cue 'YES' or that the attribute applies to the target for the left hand key; indicate the cue 'NO' or that the attribute does not apply to the target for the right hand key), the automatic activation of the response rule learned in the evaluative task will interfere with performance in the nonevaluative task. Specifically, if the required non-evaluative key-press (press left for 'YES') is compatible with the evaluative key-press (press left because the attribute applies to the target), response speed and accuracy will be facilitated. In contrast, if the required non-evaluative keypress (press right for 'NO') is incompatible with the evaluative response (press left because the attribute applies to the target), response speed and accuracy will be obstructed. Following this procedure, automatic appraisals of a target can be derived from response latencies and accuracy rates in the non-evaluative trials.</p><p>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Example of an evaluative and non-evaluative trial presented in the IMPACT. Both trials start with a black screen with a random presentation time between 500 and 1500 ms, followed by a target-attribute compound that disappears after a short time. When the targetattribute compound disappears, a task cue is presented until a key press is registered. The evaluative trials (left) are indicated by three question marks and participants have to press a key to indicate whether the target-attribute compound is compatible (the E-key) or incompatible (the I-key). The non-evaluative trials (right) are indicated by the word YES or the word NO.</p><p>Participants have to press a key based on the cue regardless of their evaluation of the compatibility of the target-attribute compound (e.g., the E-key for the word YES and the I-key for the word NO).</p><p>To test this new method, we adopt the conceptual and theoretical approach proposed by De Houwer, Teige-Mocigemba, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Spruyt, and Moors (2009)</ref> in their normative analysis and review of implicit measures. They stressed that since the term 'automaticity' describes a number of characteristics <ref type="bibr">(i.e., fast, efficient, unintentional, uncontrolled, unconscious)</ref> that a process may possess to varying degrees, a measure can qualify as automatic in various ways. Accordingly, the emphasis shouldn't be merely on defining whether a measure is automatic, but on determining in what ways it is automatic. Obtaining this type of understanding is crucial in order to accurately interpret the measure and identify what type of behaviours the measure will most likely be related to. This is particularly relevant in a consumer context. For instance, because every-day consumer decisions often occur in contexts in which cognitive resources may be constraint, it is more likely that these decisions are guided by automatic processes that operate efficiently, as opposed to processes that require extensive cognitive capacity to operate.</p><p>Thus, in in a series of five experiments we tested whether and to what degree the measurement outcome of the IMPACT can be produced within a short amount of time (i.e., the extent to which it is 'fast', Experiment 1 and Experiment 2), under the absence of the goal to do so (i.e., the extent to which it is 'unintentional', Experiment 3), when participants were instructed to attempt to manipulate the measure (i.e., the extent to which it is 'uncontrolled', Experiment 4), and when participants' cognitive resources available for the task are limited (i.e., the extent to which it is 'efficient', Experiment 5). Because the IMPACT procedure specifically requires conscious processing and evaluation of the presented stimuli, we do not test the 'unconscious' feature of automaticity. Across all experiments, we adopted a knownappraisals approach. Specifically, we recorded appraisals of near-universally evaluated stimuli (e.g., fries and sprouts, with fries being commonly appraised as unhealthy but tasty and sprouts being commonly appraised as healthy but not tasty), to establish whether the IMPACT would successfully register the expected appraisal patterns across a range of manipulations chosen to test for each of the specified features of automaticity.</p><p>The methods, exclusions, data preparation, and analyses of Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5</p><p>were pre-registered prior to data collection. All pre-registrations are publicly available and linked individually in the method section of each experiment. All IMPACTs were built using PsychoPy software <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Peirce et al., 2019)</ref> and administered via the PsychoPy launching platform Pavlovia.org. All data were prepared and aggregated in the RStudio environment version 2022.07.1.554 (RStudio Team, 2022) using R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) (R Core Team, 2021)</p><p>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task and the packages tidyverse 1.3.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wickham et al., 2019)</ref> and gtools 3.9.2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Warnes, Bolker, &amp; Lumley, 2021)</ref>. All analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27, and Jamovi Version 2.2.5.0. (The Jamovi Project, 2021) with the packages afex <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Singmann, Bolker, Westfall, Aust, &amp; Ben-Shachar, 2022)</ref>, emmeans <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lenth, 2020)</ref>, and car <ref type="bibr">(Fox &amp; Weisberg, 2019)</ref>. The data of all experiments are publicly available and linked individually in the result section of each experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1 -'Fast'</head><p>A process can be considered to be fast if it occurs within a minimal period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Moors &amp; De Houwer, 2006)</ref>. Whether the appraisals measured by the IMPACT operate fast can be tested by manipulating the time that participants have to process the presented stimuli.</p><p>In the IMPACT, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) refers to the time for which the stimuli compounds are presented before they disappear and the task cue prompts the participants to respond. In the following, we tested whether the appraisals measured by the IMPACT occur fast by manipulating the SOA across three levels (2000 ms, 1500 ms, 1000 ms). We used French fries and Brussels sprouts because French fries are known to be generally appraised to be tasty, but unhealthy, while Brussels sprouts are generally appraised to be healthy, but not as tasty. If this known appraisal pattern can be recorded even at the short SOA (i.e., 1000 ms), it would demonstrate that the processes measured by the IMPACT operate fast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Experiment 1</head><p>Participants. Participants were 279 students from the Department of Marketing, Innovation and Organization at Ghent University. Participation took place online during November and December 2020 and participants were compensated with a course credit. The sampling size was determined by the number of students enrolled in the modules the course credit applied to. All participants reported being native Dutch speakers. No exclusion criteria were pre-registered for Experiment 1, however, we have applied the exclusion criteria that were pre-registered for Experiment 2. One participant did not complete the experiment. Two participants were excluded due to excessive error rates (40.6% and 51.6%). Error rates above a threshold of 39% were considered excessive for this experiment. Four participants were excluded as an excessive percentage of their trials had to be removed due to error rates and extreme response latencies taken together (ranging between 39.06% and 43.80%). Again, trial exclusions were considered as excessive above the threshold of 39%. Another four participants were excluded because their mean response speed (ranging between 980 ms and 1810 ms) deviated more than 2.5 SD from the samples' mean response speed. Finally, six data points were excluded because they were duplicate entries. A final sample of N = 262 (SOA 1000 ms: n = 86, SOA 1500 ms: n = 86, SOA 2000 ms: n = 90) was retained for analysis (181 women, 81 men, MAge = 21.75 years, RangeAge = 20 -24 years).</p><p>Materials and Procedure. After providing informed consent, participants were asked to confirm their native language and that they were working on a laptop or desktop PC. They were then forwarded at random to one of the three SOA conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPACT.</head><p>On each trial of the IMPACT, participants were presented with a rectangular box situated centrally on the screen containing randomised pairings of a target stimulus above an attribute word. The attribute words were presented in Dutch in white capital writing on a black background. The target stimuli consisted of four images of French fries, and four images of Brussels sprouts (resolution 512 x 384 pixels). The attribute words presented below the targets were "HEALTHY", "UNHEALTHY", "TASTY" and "YUCKY". We used the task cues '???', 'YES', and 'NO'.</p><p>The measure consisted of eight practice trials followed by 96 experimental trials presented as one block with no notable difference between the practice and experimental trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task</head><p>In the practice trials, each target was shown once, each attribute word was shown twice (once with each target category), and every task cue was presented at least once. These trials were identical to the experimental trials with the exception that the inter trial interval (ITI) was always set to 1500 ms. During the experimental trials each possible target (8) x attribute (4) x task cue (3) combination was presented once in random order. The SOA was manipulated to be either 1000 ms, 1500 ms, or 2000 ms across the three conditions. The ITI in the experimental trials was set to randomly vary between 500 ms -1500 ms. Following the IMPACT, participants were redirected to a brief questionnaire 1 . All items were generated and displayed using Qualtrics Software (2005), Version November 2020.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explicit evaluations 2</head><p>. Participants rated each target stimulus across the four attributes used in the IMPACT by indicating their agreement with statements such as 'I think this food product is healthy' on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Extremely disagree, 7 = Extremely agree).</p><p>The two attributes of each dimension were measured on separate scales as opposed to a continuum (e.g., seven points from unhealthy to healthy) in order to mirror the way that the automatic appraisals were measured and compiled (in the IMPACT the attributes are displayed in individual trials, not as pairs).</p><p>1 The original design of Experiment 1 and 2 included additional variables as we intended to analyse potential relationships between the appraisals measured by the IMPACT and reported body mass index, frequency of fries consumption, and frequency of sprout consumption, which were assessed in this questionnaire. We do not report these findings here for several reasons. First, all measures were collected after the completion of the IMPACT and should therefore have no influence on the IMPACT results. Second, we have since realised a number of caveats that were inherent to the outcome measures. For instance, neither French fries nor Brussels sprouts are foods that are commonly consumed as regularly as daily or even repeatedly during a week. Consequently, we decided not to report these additional methods and analyses here and instead made them publicly available in the linked osf project.</p><p>Demographics. Finally, participants indicated their weight and height, as well as their age and gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results Experiment 1</head><p>Data preparation. The data of this experiment are publicly available at https://osf.io/e6gcd/. Only the critical, non-evaluative trials were used for analysis, the practice trials and evaluative trials were discarded. Trials with extreme response latencies (below 300 ms or above ms) were winsorised, so that trials with a response latency below 300 ms were replaced with 300 ms, and trials with a response latency above 5000 ms were replaced with 5000 ms. Additionally, error trials were excluded and instead replaced by the participant's mean response latency based on correct trials plus a penalty of 600 ms. We then calculated health and taste scores for each target category following the standard D score formula by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003)</ref>. Specifically, we subtracted the mean response latency on incongruent trials (e.g., frieshealthyyes) from the mean response latency on congruent trials (e.g., friesunhealthy -yes), and divided this by the pooled SD. Following this procedure, a positive health score suggested that the target category was appraised as more healthy compared to unhealthy. A positive taste score suggested that the target category was appraised as more tasty compared to yucky.</p><p>Internal consistency. To estimate internal consistency of the IMPACT measure, we calculated Spearman-Brown corrected mean split-half correlations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pronk, Molenaar, Wiers, &amp; Murre, 2022)</ref>. For each participant, the critical trial data was first divided into compatible and incompatible trials and split into random halves. Next, we computed d-scores for each half using the procedure described above. We then correlated all d-scores of halve one with those of halve two. This process was repeated one hundred times. Finally, using Spearman-Brown prediction formula, we calculate an internal consistency estimate from the mean The Implicit Attribute Classification Task correlation. Using this method, we obtained internal consistency estimates for the measure as a whole, as well as separated by attribute dimension.</p><p>For the 2000-ms condition, this procedure resulted in internal consistency estimates of overall Rsb = .44, taste Rsb = .40, and health Rsb = .42. For the 1500-ms condition, the results indicated an overall Rsb = .50, taste Rsb = .44, and health Rsb = .37. For the 1000-ms condition, the results indicated an overall Rsb = .29, taste Rsb = .35, and health Rsb = .29.</p><p>Confirmatory analyses. We tested whether the IMPACT recorded the expected health and taste appraisal patterns of fries and sprouts across all three SOA conditions using a 2 (target: fries/sprouts) x 2 (attribute: taste/health) x 3 (SOA condition in ms: 1000/1500/2000) repeated measures ANOVA with target category and attribute dimension as within-subjects factors, and SOA condition as a between-subjects factor. There was a statistically significant three-way interaction among attribute, target category, and SOA condition F(2, 259) = 6.30, p = .002, Î·p 2 = .05, suggesting that appraisal patterns differed across the three SOA conditions.</p><p>To directly examine the target category by attribute interactions in each SOA condition, we used 2 (target category) x 2 (attribute dimension) repeated measures ANOVAs for each SOA condition, with target category and attribute dimension as within-subject factors. There was a statistically significant two-way interaction among attribute and target category in the 2000-ms SOA condition, F(1, 89) = 119.5, p = .001, Î·p 2 = .57, the 1500-ms SOA condition, F(1, 85) = 124.04, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .59, and the 1000-ms SOA condition, F(1, 85) = 51.26, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .38. Across all conditions, participants generally appraised fries lower on health compared to sprouts, and sprouts lower on taste compared to fries (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Descriptive statistics for health and taste appraisals of fries and sprouts (D scores) in Experiment 1.</p><p>Additional Analyses. Because participants may compensate for short SOAs by prolonging their response time, the mean reaction times should also be analysed to establish whether or not this is an alternative explanation of our results. A one-way ANOVA with mean reaction time as dependent variable and condition as fixed factor indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in mean reaction times between the conditions, F(2, 259) &lt; 1, p = .73. In fact, mean reaction times were virtually identical across the conditions (M1000 = 615 ms, SD1000 = 97 ms; M1500 = 608 ms, SD1500 = 113 ms; M2000 = 603 ms, SD2000 = 100 ms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Experiment 1</head><p>Experiment 1 investigated whether the appraisals measured by the IMPACT occur fast by testing whether the expected health and taste appraisals of fries and sprouts could be recorded across different SOA conditions. Crucially, although the effect of the two-way interaction between attribute and target category became smaller as the SOA became shorter, the IMPACT effect replicated at each SOA level. Moreover, additional analyses of the reaction times indicated that participants were not simply compensating for the shortened SOA by increasing processing time before responding. Because there is no firm threshold for distinguishing The Implicit Attribute Classification Task between fast and slow processes in the automaticity literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moors and De Houwer (2006)</ref> noted that researchers must rely on common-sense justifications. The IMPACT comprises several features that increase task complexity and consequently slow down processing speed (e.g., relational processing of the stimulus compounds and continuous task switching due to the intermixed trial structure). Given this high task complexity, Experiment 1's findings suggest that the processes assessed by the IMPACT can be accurately described as fast.</p><p>In addition to these findings, we conducted a follow-up experiment (Experiment 2) to establish whether we can replicate Experiment 1's findings at the 1000-ms SOA and also investigate whether the same effect can be observed at an even shorter SOA of 500 ms. The methods, exclusions, data preparation, and analyses for Experiment 2 were pre-registered prior to data collection at https://osf.io/e6gcd/. The 126 student participants received course credit in return for their participation, the 28 members of the consumer panel were compensated at a rate of eight euro/hour. The sample size was determined by the number of students enrolled in the modules the course credit applied to, as well as the number of panel members volunteering to sign up to the study during the predetermined time frame of data collection. All participants reported being native Dutch speakers.</p><p>Following our pre-registered exclusion criteria, nine participants were excluded as their data was missing or incomplete. Three participants were excluded due to excessive error rates (ranging between 39.1% and 64.1%). In line with Experiment 1, we considered any error rate above a threshold of 39% to be excessive. Another three participants were excluded as an excessive percentage of their trials had to be removed due to error rates and extreme response latencies taken together (ranging between 39.1% and 46.9%). Trial exclusions were considered as excessive above the threshold of 39%. Finally, two participants were excluded because their mean response speed (1190 ms and 1180 ms) deviated more than 2.5 SD from the samples' mean response speed. We retained a sample of N = 137 (SOA 500 ms: n = 70, SOA 1000 ms: n = 67) for analysis (92 women, 45 men, MAge = 23.08 years, RangeAge = 19 -53 years).</p><p>Materials and Procedure. The materials and procedures in this experiment were identical to those in Experiment 1, with the exception that there were only two SOA conditions.</p><p>Specifically, SOA in the IMPACT was set to either 500 ms or 1000 ms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results Experiment 2</head><p>Data preparation. The data of this Experiment are publicly available at https://osf.io/e6gcd/. All data preparation was identical to that in Experiment 1 3 .</p><p>Internal consistency. Calculation of the internal consistency estimates was identical to that in Experiment 1. For the 1000-ms condition, the results indicated an overall Rsb = .37, taste Rsb = .28, and health Rsb = .12. For the 500-ms condition, the results indicated an overall Rsb = -.01, taste Rsb = -.07, and health Rsb = -.03. These low estimates will be addressed in the general discussion.</p><p>3 Across all experiments, we treated the data by replacing extreme response latencies (&lt; 300ms, &gt; 5000ms) with winsorised cut-off values (300 ms, 5000 ms, respectively). This treatment is inconsistent with the data treatment we pre-registered for Experiments 2, 3, and 4. Specifically, we specified for these experiments that trials with extreme response latencies should be replaced by the participant's mean (correct) response latency plus a penalty of 600 ms. We are no longer convinced that this is the most adequate data treatment, as even extremely short response latencies (i.e., &lt; 300 ms) are replaced with response latencies over 1000 ms. Because the results of all analyses were virtually identical with either the winsorised or pre-registered data treatment, we decided to report the data treatment and analyses we recommend as the better practice.</p><p>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task Preregistered analyses. We tested whether the IMPACT recorded the expected health and taste appraisal patterns of fries and sprouts across both SOA conditions using a 2 (target category: fries/sprouts) x 2 (attribute: taste/health) x 2 (SOA condition in ms: 500/1000) repeated measures ANOVA with target category and attribute dimension as within-subjects factors, and SOA condition as between-subjects factor. The three-way interaction among attribute, target category, and SOA condition was significant, F(1, 135) = 5.07, p = .026, Î·p 2 = .04 suggesting that the appraisal patterns differed across the conditions.</p><p>To directly examine the target category by attribute interactions in each SOA condition, we used 2 (target category) x 2 (attribute dimension) repeated measures ANOVAs for each SOA condition, with target category and attribute dimension as within-subject factors. There was a statistically significant two-way interaction among attribute and target in the 1000-ms SOA condition, F(1, 66) = 24.49, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .27. Moreover, there was also a statistically significant two-way interaction among attribute and target for the 500-ms SOA condition, F(1, 69) = 7.16, p = .009, Î·p 2 = .09. In both conditions, participants generally appraised fries lower on health compared to sprouts, and sprouts lower on taste compared to fries (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Additional Analyses. We tested whether the shortened SOA may have resulted in increased response latencies using a one-way ANOVA with mean reaction time as the dependent variable and condition as fixed factor. Participants in the 1000-ms SOA condition reacted faster on average (M = 616 ms, SD = 126 ms) compared to respondents in the 500-ms SOA condition (M = 684 ms, SD = 154 ms). This difference was statistically significant F(1, 135) = 7.94, p = .006, Î·p 2 = .056.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Experiment 2</head><p>Like Experiment 1, Experiment 2 investigated whether the processes measured by the IMPACT occur within a short time frame. We aimed to both replicate our findings from Experiment 1 at an SOA of 1000 ms and establish whether the interaction among attribute and target category occurs at an SOA of 500 ms. Indeed, this two-way interaction was evident at both an SOA of 1000 ms and an SOA of 500 ms. Although the difference in mean reaction times between the 500-ms and 1000-ms SOA conditions was statistically significant, this difference was small (60 ms) and certainly not large enough to compensate for the 500 ms difference in SOA between conditions. Taken together, these results convincingly support the notion that the processes assessed by the IMPACT operate fast. In the next experiment, we assessed the unintentionality feature of automaticity.</p></div>

Here, the 'unintentionality' feature of automaticity would be evidenced if the expected health and taste appraisals of fries and sprouts can be recorded even if the explicit goal to evaluate the semantic match of the stimuli is removed. Importantly, because participants are explicitly required to make such judgements during the evaluative trials of a standard IMPACT, we removed this intention in Experiment 3</p><p>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task by adjusting the evaluative trial task. Using the same stimuli as in Experiment and 2, we did this by presenting the attribute words in different colours and instructing participants to judge the colour match of the target and attribute word, as opposed to their semantic fit. Thus, the IMPACT used in Experiment 3 promotes relational processing of the compounds but does not promote semantic relational processing. The methods, exclusions, data preparation, and analyses for Experiment 3 were pre-registered prior to data collection at https://osf.io/94g3a/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Experiment 3</head><p>Participants. We collected 180 valid responses.

All participants reported being native English speakers. Additionally, the following screening criteria were applied: participants had to be between the age of 18 -60 years, have a 90% minimum approval rate on Prolific, and have not participated in previous studies using the IMPACT. Following our pre-registered exclusion criteria, eight respondents were excluded because they did not complete the experiment. Twenty-four participants were excluded because they had excessive error rates (ranging between 40.62% and 54.17%). We considered any error rate above a threshold of 39% to be excessive. Additionally, seven participants were excluded as an excessive percentage of their trials had to be removed due to error rates and extreme response latencies taken together (ranging between 39.58% and 56.25%). Trial exclusions were considered as excessive above the threshold of 39%. Four responses were excluded because they were duplicate entries.

We again assessed automatic health ('healthy' / 'unhealthy') and taste ('tasty'</p><p>/ 'yucky') appraisals of the same images of French fries and Brussels sprouts as in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. The attribute words were presented in English in yellow (HEX colour code: #f0c800) or green (HEX colour code: #00be00) font on a black background. The target images and image specifications were identical to those in Experiments 1 and 2, with the exception that in Experiment 3 we used three, rather than four, images of fries and three, rather than four, images of sprouts. We reduced the number of targets because the colour dimension increased the total number of trials (each target-attribute-cue pairing was presented once in yellow writing and once in green writing). Instead of the standard IMPACT instructions, participants in Experiment 3 were asked to indicate whether the colour of the word matched the overall colour scheme of the presented image if the cue '???' appeared. The instructions for the cues 'NO' (always press the E-key) and 'YES' (always press the I-key) remained the same as in a standard IMPACT.</p><p>The measure consisted of six practice trials followed by 144 experimental trials presented as one block with no notable difference between the practice and experimental trials.</p><p>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task</p><p>In the practice trials, each target appeared once and each task cue appeared twice. These trials were identical to the experimental trials with the exception that the inter trial interval (ITI) was always set to 1500 ms. During the experimental trials each possible target (6) x attribute (4) x task cue (3) x word colour (2) combination was presented once in randomised order. The ITI in the experimental trials was set to randomly vary between 500ms -1500ms, SOA was set to 1500 ms.</p><p>Explicit appraisals 2 . Following the IMPACT, participants were redirected to a brief questionnaire. All items were generated and displayed using Qualtrics Software <ref type="formula">2005</ref>, Version</p><p>March 2022. For each of the stimulus groups, participants were asked to indicate their explicit evaluations of the products. Following the question "On a scale from 1 -7, I think this product isâ¦.", they answered how healthy, unhealthy, tasty and yucky they perceived each target group on a seven-point scale (1 = Extremely disagree -7 = Extremely agree).</p></div>

Data preparation was identical to Experiment 1 and 2 3 . Following the same procedure, we calculated individual health and taste scores for colour congruent trials, as well as for colour incongruent trials. In order to test for the colour-compatibility effect (see manipulation check below), we also calculated a D score for the colour congruence effect by subtracting the mean response latency on colour incongruent trials from the mean response latency on colour congruent trials and dividing by the pooled SD. compatibility were all within-subjects factors. The three-way interaction among target category, attribute, and colour compatibility was not significant, F(1, 179) &lt; 1, p = .32. There was, however, a significant two-way interaction among target category and attribute, F(1, 179) = 5.41, p = .02, Î·p 2 = .03. As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, irrespective of the colour compatibility condition, participants generally appraised fries lower on health compared to sprouts, and sprouts lower on taste compared to fries (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>).</p><p>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task Experiment 3 examined whether the appraisals measured by the IMPACT occur in the absence of the intent to engage in them by instructing participants to respond to the colour compatibility of the stimuli compounds instead of their semantic fit. The significant colourcompatibility effect demonstrates that we successfully altered participants' proximal task goal as participants were processing colour compatibility of the target and attribute word, as instructed. Although assessing the semantic fit of the target and attribute pairs was no longer the participants proximal task goal, we found that these appraisals occurred nonetheless and could be recorded by the IMPACT. These results suggest that the appraisals registered by the IMPACT can operate in the absence of direct intention. This type of unintentional semantic relational processing has not previously been demonstrated, but is particularly important in the context of consumer research, since it suggests that consumers may engage in goal-irrelevant product judgements. While Experiment 3 investigated the unintentional feature of automaticity, Experiment 4 examined the uncontrolled feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment -'Uncontrolled'</head><p>A process can be considered uncontrolled if attempts to manipulate engagement in the process are unsuccessful <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Moors &amp; De Houwer, 2006</ref>). This can be tested by providing participants with the necessary knowledge to strategically manipulate a measure. If participants are unable to manipulate their appraisals despite this knowledge, it can be assumed that the appraisals occur outwith control. We tested this by instructing participants to 'fake' responses on the IMPACT. As this faking task adds complexity to the task, we assessed only health appraisals of fresh produce and candy in Experiment 4. If participants were unable to fake their responses on the IMPACT, the appraisal patterns should not differ significantly between the faking and control condition.

The two-way interaction among target category and condition was significant, F(1, 328) = 210.1, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .39. These results suggest that participants in the faking condition were indeed successful at reversing the appraisal patterns recorded by the IMPACT.</p><p>Next, we compared participants' performance in the compatible and the incompatible trials.

The error rates were analysed using a 2 (condition: 47. In other words, the pattern of error rates in the control group, whereby participants made more errors on incompatible trials than compatible trials, was reversed in the faking group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Experiment</head><p>Experiment examined to which extent responses to the IMPACT could be strategically manipulated by instructing participants to 'fake' responses on the IMPACT. The analyses showed that the health appraisals of candy and produce were reversed in the faking group compared to the control group, as was the pattern for error rates. The analyses of response times showed that participants in the faking group were able to slow response times on traditionally compatible trials, compared to the control group, but were not able to reduce response times on traditionally incompatible trials. Collectively, these findings suggest that participants are able to fake responses on the IMPACT, at least under the parameters tested here. While these results then suggest that the processes measured by the IMPACT can be controlled, there are a number of important caveats to this conclusion.</p><p>First, Experiment 4 used a simplified version of the IMPACT, on which only a single appraisal dimension was assessed in order to counteract the additional task complexity introduced by the faking instructions. Because the intended application of the IMPACT is to assess multiple appraisals simultaneously, findings drawn from this 'over-simplification' of the task may not allow accurate conclusions about the controllability of the IMPACT in its intended form. Second, we applied a stringent criterion that included only participants who were able to correctly report how they had been instructed to respond on a comprehension-check task administered at the end of the experiment. A large number of participants in the faking group (n = 94) did not meet this criterion, suggesting that for this large number of participants the faking was indeed too demanding, and that participants who found it challenging to fake their responses were excluded. Parametrically manipulating task difficulty in future studies may yet reveal circumstances under which the processes measured by the IMPACT show evidence of The Implicit Attribute Classification Task occurring outwith control. While Experiment 4 investigated the uncontrollable feature of automaticity, Experiment investigated the efficiency feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment -'Efficient'</head><p>The efficiency feature refers to the cognitive capacity that is required by a process. As such, a process can be described as efficient if it can operate even in the absence of attentional and processing resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Moors &amp; de Houwer, 2006)</ref>. One common way to determine the efficiency of a process are dual task studies, whereby a secondary distractor task is implemented to deploy processing resources and divert attention from the primary task that assesses the process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Friese, Hofmann, &amp; WÃ¤nke, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Van Bockstaele et al. 2021)</ref>. If the effect of the process in question is unaltered by the secondary task, it can be assumed that it operates effectively. In many cases, the distractor task consists of an arithmetic or recollection task, such as memorising and later recite digit strings of varying lengths (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Friese, Hofmann, &amp; WÃ¤nke, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Van Bockstaele et al. 2021)</ref>. Similar to these examples, in Experiment 5 we used a "tallying task" to test whether performance in the IMPACT declines with increasing cognitive load. Using the same stimuli of fries and sprouts as in experiment 1, 2, and 3, we tested whether the expected health and taste appraisals could be recorded even when participants cognitive resources were limited. The methods, exclusions, data preparation, and analyses for Experiment 5 were pre-registered prior to data collection at https://osf.io/nwq4u/.</p></div>

Based on a GPower calculation (detect an effect of f = .2 with a power of .95), we collected 130 valid responses for each condition. Because the absence of an effect of increasing cognitive load would indicate that the appraisals operate efficiently, we used a small effect size for this calculation in order to ensure that we would have enough power to detect even small effects. Sampling took place during August 2022 through the online recruitment platform Prolific.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Load Manipulation.</head><p>To manipulate cognitive load during the IMPACT, participants in the low cognitive load were required to tally the number of evaluative trials (i.e., trials with the '???'-cue). Specifically, they were asked to report this tally once after the practice block and three subsequent times during and after the measurement blocks. Participants were instructed to restart their tally from zero after each reporting prompt. In the high cognitive load group, participants completed the same tallying task but were required to keep two separate tallies for the number of evaluative trials with sprouts, and the number of evaluative trials with fries. To mimic the reporting structure of the low cognitive load and high cognitive load conditions, the control condition (no cognitive load) was asked to count up by one each time they encountered the reporting prompt, starting the count at '5'.</p></div>

We first assessed whether the cognitive load manipulation successfully increased mental strain across the three cognitive load conditions.</p><p>Participants in the 'no load' condition (M = 3.08, SD = 1.67) reported feeling the least cognitively strained, followed by the 'low load' condition (M = 4.77, SD = 1.48) and the 'high load' condition (M = 5.40, SD = 1.32). A one-way ANOVA indicated that there was a significant effect of condition, F(2, 387) = 83.40, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .30. Trend analysis confirmed that there was a statistically significant, increasing, linear trend F(2, 387) = 156.02, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .29.</p><p>Preregistered analyses. To test whether the IMPACT recorded the expected health and taste appraisals of fries and sprouts across all three cognitive load conditions, we used a 2 (target category: fries/sprouts) x 2 (attribute dimension: taste/health) x 3 (condition: no load/low load/high load) repeated measures ANOVA with target category and attribute dimension as within-subjects factors, and cognitive load condition as between-subjects factor. There was a significant three-way interaction among target category, attribute, and condition F(2,387) = 5.39, p = .005, Î·p 2 = .03. This interaction suggests that the attribute by target category interaction differed across the conditions. Consequently, to examine the attribute by target category interactions in each cognitive load condition, we used 2 (target category) x 2 (attribute dimension) repeated measures ANOVAs for each cognitive load condition, with target category and attribute dimension as within-subject factors. There was a statistically significant two-way interaction among attribute and target category in the 'no load' condition, F(1, 129) = 56.42, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .30, the 'low load' condition, F(1, 129) = 16.00, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .11, and the 'high load' condition, F(1, 129) = 22.72, p &lt; .001, Î·p 2 = .15. Across all cognitive load conditions, participants generally appraised fries lower on health compared to sprouts, and sprouts lower on taste compared to fries (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>). Notably, while the attribute by target category interaction explained 11% and 15% of the variance in the 'low load' and 'high load' condition respectively, the effect size in the 'no load' condition was twice as large, whereby the interaction explained 30.4% of the variance. Additional analyses. To directly compare the magnitude of the two-way interaction effect between target category and attribute dimension in the low and high load conditions, we repeated the initial ANOVA, this time excluding data from the no load condition. The threeway interaction among target category, attribute dimension, and cognitive load condition was not significant, F(1, 258) &lt; 1, p = .821. These results confirm that the magnitude of the interaction effect between target category and attribute dimension did not differ significantly between the high and low load conditions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Although explicit (i.e., self-report) measures of product appraisals provide a useful tool in consumer research, they are of limited use when consumers are either unable or unwilling to accurately report explicit appraisals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bargh, 2002)</ref>. Implicit measures, such as the IAT, have been used to address this issue in consumer research but are limited to assessing automatic appraisals of single product attributes only. This limitation is important, because products typically vary on multiple attributes simultaneously, and these attributes may have conflicting influences on consumer decision making. Here, we presented a new automatic measure, the IMPACT, which was designed specifically to assess consumer appraisals on multiple product dimensions simultaneously and is, therefore, ideally suited for use in consumer research. We used a conceptual framework developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moors and De Houwer (2006)</ref> to identify which specific features of responses on the IMPACT show evidence of automaticity.</p><p>Experiments 1 and 2 tested whether the appraisals measured by the IMPACT occur fast.</p><p>Collectively, the results of these experiments showed clear evidence that the expected health and taste appraisal of fries and sprouts could be recorded at SOAs as short as ms (Experiment 1) and 500ms (Experiment 2). This is noteworthy, given that the IMPACT comprises several features that likely have a constraining effect on processing speed, such as continuous task-switching and the relational processing of the stimulus compounds.</p><p>Importantly, analyses of the mean response times also indicated that the IMPACT effect at short SOAs could not be explained by participants increasing response times to compensate for reduced processing times, confirming that responses on the IMPACT meet the criteria for the fast feature of automaticity.</p><p>Experiment 3 investigated whether the appraisals measured by the IMPACT occur unintentionally. The results confirmed that the expected health and taste appraisals could be recorded by the IMPACT even when judging the semantic fit of the stimuli the was not a task goal. Thus, Experiment 3 showed clear evidence that the appraisals measured with the IMPACT occur unintentionally. It is important to note that while the effect qualifies as unintentional, it was still goal-dependent to the degree that participants were asked to engage in a non-semantic comparison of the stimuli compounds, and that this non-semantic comparison is likely a requirement for the effect to occur. Nonetheless, the results of Experiment 3 demonstrate that complex comparisons between stimuli can take place automatically, even if these judgements are not the proximal goal. This type of unintentional relational processing has, to the best of our knowledge, not yet been demonstrated in the past. Moreover, this finding is particularly important in the context of establishing the utility of the IMPACT for consumer research since it demonstrates that consumer may engage in task-irrelevant comparisons when assessing products.</p><p>Experiment 4 investigated whether the appraisals measured by the IMPACT were uncontrollable. The results showed no evidence for this feature of automaticity as participants</p><p>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task were successful at 'faking' their responses. However, Experiment 4 used a simplified version of the IMPACT, in which products were appraised on only a single dimension and participants who found it challenging to fake responses were excluded based on their performance on an attention-check task. Thus, while our results show no evidence of the uncontrollable feature of automaticity, we do not rule out the possibility that a difficult version of this task would make it more complex for participants to fake the measure.</p><p>Experiment 5 investigated whether the appraisals measured by the IMPACT operate efficiently. The results showed that, although the expected effect was bigger when participants had no additional cognitive load, the expected health and taste appraisal of fries and sprouts could be recorded even when participants faced a high cognitive load. Importantly, increasing the difficulty of the additional task did not appear to reduce the size of the IMPACT effect further. Taken together, these results confirm that responses on the IMPACT meet the criteria for the efficiency feature of automaticity.</p><p>Collectively, these results demonstrate that the IMPACT is an implicit measure of appraisals in the sense that the appraisals it measures can occur fast, unintentional, and efficient.</p><p>By contrast, our results showed little evidence that the processes measured by the IMPACT are uncontrollable, at least under the parameters tested here. Increasing task difficulty (e.g., by</p><p>having participants assess products on multiple dimensions) and including participants who found the task challenging may reveal circumstances under which evidence that the processes measured by the IMPACT are less controllable. When taken as a whole, our results clearly demonstrate the suitability of the IMPACT for measuring automatic product appraisals in consumer research.</p><p>Importantly, the IMPACT has two key advantages over alternative implicit measures that mean it is likely to be particularly useful in consumer research. The key advantage of the IMPACT is that it is an implicit measure that allows researchers to assess product appraisals on multiple dimensions simultaneously. Thus, the appraisals measured by the IMPACT more closely resemble the multidimensional nature of products. Second, because we show that the IMPACT measures appraisals that occur unintentionally and efficiently, we demonstrate that the IMPACT is particularly well suited to studying consumer decision making because it is capable of assessing product appraisals in the presence of goal-irrelevant information and when processing capacity is limited, as is often be the case when consumers make real-world consumption decisions.</p><p>It is relevant to address that in certain experiments, the internal consistency was notably low. This was particularly apparent in the versions of the IMPACT that isolated and maximised individual features of automaticity. Expectedly, introducing disruptive conditions through these task adaptations lead to reduced estimates of internal consistency. Importantly, however, when using the default procedures, the IMPACT showed a notably higher internal consistency of Rsb = .5 in both Exp 1 and Exp 4. While these estimates might still seem low by traditional benchmarks of acceptable internal consistency, it is worth noting that these standards, rooted in explicit measurements, might not be wholly suited for assessing implicit measures, as implicit measures naturally exhibit greater response variability (e.g. due to increased task complexity), compared to explicit measures. Additionally, the fact that the IMPACT consistently recorded the expected patterns of appraisals attests to its validity in measuring automatic product appraisals. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that improving the internal consistency of the IMPACT can only be beneficial to the method and suggest that this could be achieved, without prolonging the procedure, by substituting a proportion of the evaluative induction trials with additional critical trials in order to increase the number of observations for each product and attribute combination.</p><p>The Implicit Attribute Classification Task A crucial next step in validating the IMPACT is to assess how well scores on the IMPACT relate to real-world consumer decisions compared with alternative automatic measures. Research addressing this issue should clarify the types of consumer decisions for which different automatic measures of product appraisals are best suited.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Participants were 154 students and members of the consumer panel from the Department of Marketing, Innovation and Organization at Ghent University.
