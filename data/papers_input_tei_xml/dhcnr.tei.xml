			<abstract>
				<p>We aimed to externally validate the Oxford Risk of Recidivism (OxRec) tool to estimate 1-and 2-year risk of violent reoffending in people released from prison in England. Methods: We identified people released from prison using administrative data shared between official prison and police services. We extracted information on criminal history, clinical and sociodemographic risk predictors, and outcomes. The outcomes were violent reoffending at 1 and 2 years after release from prison, identified using official police data. Predictive ability was examined using measures of calibration (calibration statistics and plots) and discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]; sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values [PPV; NPV]) for predetermined risk thresholds. Recalibration of the model was conducted when necessary. Results: In total, 1,770 individuals (median age = 33 [IQR 27-40]; 92% were male) were identified as recently released from prison. 31% (n = 550) and 43% (n = 765) reoffended within 1 and 2 years, respectively. Simple validation of the original model found a systematic underestimation of the probability of reoffending. However, after recalibration, OxRec was associated with AUCs of 0.71 (95%</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Eleven million people are currently estimated to be in prison worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Fair &amp; Walmsley, 2021)</ref>, with 2 year rates of reoffending typically around 40-60% in high income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Yukhnenko, Sridhar, &amp; Fazel, 2019)</ref>. In England and Wales, around 80,000 people are in prison at any one point <ref type="bibr">(Sturge, 2022)</ref>. Preventing reoffending is thus a priority for the criminal justice system as part of public safety initiatives <ref type="bibr">(Lancet Public Health, 2022)</ref>. Such initiatives include the use of risk assessment tools for repeat offending to identify high risk persons and inform sentencing, supervision, and rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(van Ginneken, 2019)</ref>. Applications of these tools are widespread and advocated as an evidence-based approach towards treatment allocation, particularly for people in prison with psychiatric disorders and substance misuse where treatments that modify risk exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fazel, 2019;</ref>. However, there are few high quality external validations of risk assessment tools; existing ones tend to be underpowered, have a high risk of bias, and do not report key performance measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fazel, Burghart, et al., 2022)</ref>. This is part of an imbalance between model development and external validation, which has also been highlighted for prognostic tools in medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ramspek, Jager, Dekker, Zoccali, &amp; van Diepen, 2020</ref>).</p><p>In the few external validations of criminal risk assessment tools, a common problem is that studies only report the AUC as a performance measure. However, this is difficult to interpret as a standalone metric since it measures how well the model discriminates across all possible cut-offs, most of which are not clinically relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mallett, Halligan, Thompson, Collins, &amp; Altman, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>International research guidelines have recommended reporting a fuller set of performance measures, including false positive and negative rates, and calibration measures to inform evidencebased clinical decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collins, Reitsma, Altman, &amp; Moons, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gulati et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Steyerberg, 2009)</ref>. For example, one risk tool-the Offender Assessment System (OASys) and the related OASys Violence Predictor (OVP)-is routinely used by probation officers in England and Wales to assess individual needs and future risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Howard, 2006)</ref>. To date, the published performance of this tool has been limited to discrimination measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Debidin, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Howard &amp; Dixon, 2011</ref>. Furthermore, most risk tools are not implemented in practice and lack external validation in settings different from where they were originally developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fazel, Burghart, et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>A new and scalable violence risk assessment tool has been recently developed to address these limitations. The Oxford Risk of Recidivism (OxRec) tool was derived and validated with total population-based registers from Sweden to estimate the risk of violent reoffending following release from prison. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, 14 routinely collected items on sociodemographic factors, criminal history, and clinical predictors were identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fazel et al., 2016)</ref>. External validation in the Netherlands required some proxy variables and recalibration to account for a different baseline risk in the local population compared with the original Swedish sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fazel, Burghart, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fazel, Wolf, Vazquez-Montes, &amp; Fanshawe, 2019)</ref>. In this study, we report an external validation of OxRec to estimate violent reoffending risk in people released from prison in England. This is the first such UK study and using routinely-collected police data to capture reoffending information. The use of risk assessment tools in police settings is rare as capacity is limited and hence a scalable brief tool could benefit police services, and provide more linkages with other stages of the criminal justice system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and participants</head><p>We identified the sample using administrative datasets shared between His Majesty's Prison and Probation Services (HMPPS) and police services. This dataset contains all movements in and out of the HMPPS establishments. We selected individuals who were present in both HMPPS and Thames Valley Police's crime recording system (using the NICHE Record Management System).</p><p>More specifically, we used data on criminal records that pooled information from people released from prison into the Thames Valley Police Force area (i.e., the three counties of Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire) in England aged 18 years and older (or treated as adults by the law).</p><p>The study sample included persons released from prison between April 1, 2017, and March 31, 2018, in a region of around 2.4 million population that includes both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The sample size was based on prognostic modelling guidelines that recommend at least 100 outcome events (i.e. reoffences for this study) for validation studies to be adequately powered <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Vergouwe, Steyerberg, Eijkemans, &amp; Habbema, 2005)</ref>. Individuals entering the national Criminal Justice Information Service are informed about secondary usage of data, thus the standard requirement of written informed consent was waived.</p><p>We used existing routinely collected police data. Ethical approval was granted by the Central University Research Ethics Committee (CUREC) of the University of Oxford (R44562/RE001).</p><p>This study complies with the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis statement (TRIPOD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collins et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p>We obtained information on reoffending outcomes from the NICHE Record Management System (a police register used to record offences that are reported and investigated by the police force).</p><p>The following outcome-related data were recorded: (i) suspected of a violent offence by police, (ii) convicted of a violent offence, (iii) not reoffended, and (iv) been lost to follow-up. At 1 and 2 years following prison release, outcomes were reported in binary terms (i.e. 'violent reoffence' vs.</p><p>'no violent reoffence'). The definition of violence was a standard one used by police that included two categories of 'assault violence or threat of violence' (i.e. any interpersonal violence and violent threats) and 'rape and penetrative sexual offences' (i.e. any contact sexual crimes). People released from prison were followed up from the date of their release until the outcome first occurred or the end of the study (within 24 months).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictor variables</head><p>We examined the predictor variables based on the original version of OxRec. Several modifications to variable definitions were required to adapt predictors to the local context (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). For instance, sex (assigned at birth) was replaced by gender. Immigrant status was based on nationality (instead of first or second-generation immigrant status in the development sample). Neighbourhood deprivation was calculated using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD; 2019), which is the official measure of deprivation for small areas in England.</p><p>More specifically, the last valid residential or family home address before the release date was linked with the Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) to determine the relevant IMD decile (Noble, 2019). Data on clinical variables (i.e. alcohol and drug use disorder, any mental disorder) were based on warnings recorded by police officers and custody staff in the NICHE Record Management System, rather than formal diagnoses according to ICD or DSM classifications. We could not include the following two predictors that were not available: highest education and disposable income. In addition, a second-level predictor, any severe mental disorder, was not available, which is only scored if someone meets 'any mental disorder' criteria. These differences had potential implications for calibration and were therefore considered in the validation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Baseline characteristics were detailed by counts and percentages for categorical variables, and as median (IQR) for continuous variables. These were compared to those of the Swedish derivation sample. OxRec was validated using an incremental strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Steyerberg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Su, Jaki, Hickey, Buchan, &amp; Sperrin, 2018)</ref>, and previously used <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Beaudry, Yu, Alaei, Alaei, &amp; Fazel, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fazel et al., 2019)</ref>. This approach involves three potential steps (1) simple validation, by applying the original prediction model (all model coefficients at their original value, including the baseline risk estimate); (2) updating the baseline risk and calculating a multiplicative recalibration value; (3) performing a selective re-estimation of coefficients for individual predictors. Each phase evaluates prognostic performance, and progression to the next step is only necessary in the event of poor performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Steyerberg, 2009)</ref>. The full validation protocol (including recalibration with a Cox proportional hazards model) has been published online as a part of the OxRec validation in the Netherlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fazel et al., 2019)</ref>. We examined several model performance indicators to determine the predictive ability of the model in terms of discrimination (the model's ability to separate out individuals who have reoffended from those who have not), and calibration (the level of agreement between observed and expected outcomes). These indicators included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), or c index, as well as sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) (for discrimination); and the Brier score, calibration slope and calibration-in-the-large (CITL) (for calibration), defined as the ratio of prevalence of observed to predicted events <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fazel, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Steyerberg, 2009)</ref>. We selected cut-off scores that were easy to interpret and close to the baseline rates to calculate sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV values.</p><p>We used multiple imputation by chained equations to replace missing values for immigrant status, length of incarceration, violent index offence, civil status, and employment. Twenty imputations were carried out based on recommended practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Steyerberg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">White, Royston, &amp; Wood, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, we averaged out the predictors that were missing completely (i.e. highest education, disposable income, and any severe mental disorder), by assigning all subjects their average value from the derivation sample. All analyses were conducted using STATA software (version 17.0, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline characteristics</head><p>The validation cohort included 1,770 people released from prison in England. The median (IQR) age was 33 (27-40) years, and males accounted for 92% of the sample. The proportion of missing data on predictors varied from &lt; 5% (immigrant status, length of incarceration, violent index offence) to 15% (employment status). We compared baseline characteristics between the validation (England) and the original derivation (Sweden) cohorts. The prevalence for most of the variables was similar, but there were differences. The length of incarceration appears on average longer in the validation cohort (31% over 24 months in the validation sample vs. 4% in the original derivation sample). A higher percentage of individuals were in employment at the time of incarceration (63% vs. 25%) <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Follow-up data were obtained from all participants (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Base rates of violent reoffending (i.e. including both suspected and convicted for violent crime) for the two time points (1 and 2 years) were higher in the validation cohort than in the original derivation study The primary outcome, violent reoffending, occurred in 31% (550 of 1,770; 1-year follow-up) and 43% (765 of 1,770; 2-year follow-up). This compares with violent reoffending rates of 12% at 1 year and 21% at 2 years in the derivation sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model performance and recalibration</head><p>When refitting the OxRec model in the validation data, there was some miscalibration for both time points (CITL = 1.72; [1 year]; CITL = 1.73; [2 years]). The observed violent reoffending probabilities were systematically higher (by around 20%) than expected, where the actual risk was 2-3 times what the model predicted. Thus, we updated the baseline survival function and recalibrated the linear predictor to align the predicted and observed survival probabilities for all risk deciles <ref type="table">(Table 2</ref>). This step improved OxRec's calibration and the revised model showed good calibration (i.e. calibration in the large was null for both time points). Despite this, calibration plots indicated a slight overestimation of violent reoffending risk in lower risk deciles and an underestimation in the higher deciles. The effects of predictors were similar in the development and validation samples, thus no re-estimation of the original coefficients was required (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>).</p><p>ROC curves and calibration plots for the updated OxRec model are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. As for discrimination, AUCs for violent reoffending at 1 and 2 years were 0.71 (95% CI 0.69-0.74 [1 year]; 0.68-0.74 [2 years]). For risk of violent reoffending at 1 year (using a 30% risk cut-off), sensitivity was 74% (95% CI 0.70-0.78) and specificity was 59% (95% CI 0.56-0.62), whilst positive and negative predictive values were 45% (95% CI 0.42-0.48) and 83% (95% CI 0.81-0.86), respectively. At 2 years, using a 40% cut-off, sensitivity was 77% (95% CI 0.74-0.80) and specificity was 54% (95% CI 0.51-0.58). Positive and negative predictive values were 56% (95% CI 0.53-0.59) and 76% (95% CI 0.73-0.79), respectively. Discrimination is presented for additional risk cut-offs, including for 10%, in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>We have externally validated a risk assessment tool for reoffending (OxRec) in a cohort of 1,770 people released from prison. One and two-year violent reoffending rates were 31% and 43%, respectively, which was consistent with national recidivism rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Yukhnenko et al., 2019</ref>). The final model yielded good discrimination (with an AUC of 0.71). Furthermore, unlike other risk assessment tools, we have updated the OxRec model by recalibration following a pre-determined protocol. The updated model demonstrated good calibration. In this study, we have also demonstrated how police data can be used to estimate reoffending outcomes, which allows for more comprehensive data for recidivism.</p><p>Two main implications follow. OxRec identified individuals at elevated risk of violent reoffending using cut-offs of 30% for 1-year risk and 40% for 2-year risk accurately (i.e. identifying 74% and 77% of people who violently reoffended within 1 and 2 years, respectively). These individuals could be prioritised for additional support on release given limited resources in criminal justice and likely benefits to the individual, such as psychological interventions directed at modifiable risk factors (e.g. substance misuse) and service-related ones such as ensuring linkage with community mental health services. Second, the tool also identified individuals at low risk of violent reoffending based on the same cut-offs (i.e. 59% and 54% who did not violently reoffend at one-and two-year follow-up periods). This could assist with decarceration efforts, whereby individuals in this low-risk group could be released with adequate supervision and treatment in the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fazel, Burghart, et al., 2022</ref>). There will be a balance between sensitivity and specificity in determining what cut-offs to use in practice, or to avoid categories and use probability scores alone. From a population and policy perspective, higher sensitivity (e.g. 77% for the primary outcome at 2 years), as found here, will be more important than specificity-in other words, missing those who will reoffend (false negatives or 1-sensitivity) is likely to be less acceptable than false positives (1-specificity). False positives, reported above 40% in the current study, can be tolerated if they lead to non-harmful consequences, such as adding treatments and interventions that target individual needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pickard &amp; Fazel, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Used in conjunction with professional judgement, evidence-based risk assessment tools such as</head><p>OxRec have the potential to reduce economic costs to the criminal justice system and beyond, allowing for criminal justice agencies to assist released prisoners to reintegrate safely into society.</p><p>The risk score obtained could be used to supplement professional judgement. In addition, as OxRec could be run on existing administrative data without the need for additional information, which would lend itself to provide automated risk assessments that are available alongside the release information that the police usually receive. This is particularly the case for individuals who are released from prison, some of whom will move to a new region, where it is not feasible to conduct clinical-based risk assessments. In the UK, high risk people are managed by the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (MAPPA), a national statutory process for managing people convicted of serious violent and sexual offences, which meets monthly and is jointly chaired by police and probation. In this context, OxRec could be used to identify people for appropriate management under MAPPA and, as it could be implemented at release from prison, depending on sentence or risk, identify those who should be actively managed under more intensive supervision (i.e. MAPPA categories 2 and 3). Such arrangements under MAPPA are consistent with national public health and safety initiatives (Nacro, 2022), which require police, other criminal justice agencies and community health to work together to reduce such crimes.</p><p>OxRec had similar predictive performance for identifying violent reoffending in the current cohort compared with the original Swedish derivation cohort. We also found similar associations of risk factors in OxRec with violent reoffending with original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fazel et al., 2016)</ref>. The base rate of violent reoffending in the English sample was more than double that of the Swedish sample (i.e. 31% vs. 12% [for 1 year] and 43% vs. 21% [for 2 years]), and therefore predicted OxRec probabilities of violent reoffending were underestimated compared to observed reoffending rates, before model updating. This difference reflects using a more sensitive outcome definition (i.e. police suspicions and official crime convictions in this validation vs. solely crime convictions in the Swedish sample), as official recidivism statistics are similar in both countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Yukhnenko et al., 2019)</ref>. The initial calibration would likely have been better if a similar outcome was used, underscoring the importance of outcome definition in validation studies. Moreover, differences in baseline characteristics such as employment and previous violence might also explain why the model needed recalibration.</p><p>The findings of this study further suggest that OxRec is transportable across different populations and geographical settings following recalibration, as evidenced by good discrimination and calibration in several external validations including the present study, and others conducted in Tajikistan <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Beaudry et al., 2022)</ref> and the Netherlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fazel et al., 2019)</ref>. As indicated by the AUC, the model achieved similar levels of discrimination in the English sample (0.71) to that of the Tajik  <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Thornton et al., 2003)</ref>. Calibration performance for the OVP has not been reported, despite being necessary to ensure that predictions are not misleading <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Van Calster et al., 2019)</ref>, and recommended by methodological guidelines for prediction modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collins et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, OxRec's external performance was evaluated using pre-specified risk thresholds (for discrimination) and appropriate measures and visualisations (for calibration). OxRec also has the advantage of including fewer predictors than OVP, and most of OxRec's factors are common and routinely collected, thereby allowing for its use in practice.</p><p>Hence, it can be easily calculated (in less than 10 minutes) and incorporated into existing risk assessment practices by probation officers. Another key strength of this validation study is that it used data from a routine source of information used by most UK police forces, the NICHE Record Management System. This suggests that the validated tool could be transferable to other UK criminal justice agencies.</p><p>Study strengths include combining the accuracy of probabilistic predictions with a relatively simple prediction tool. The contribution of predictor variables to the outcome is clear, and their relationship is interpretable. Another strength of OxRec is transparency, with the full model including the coefficients, being reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fazel et al., 2016)</ref>. This is lacking in most tools in criminal justice where the original development studies are typically not published and where actuarial tools do not publish their full models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fazel, Burghart, et al., 2022)</ref>. We have provided multiple performance indicators for independent examination, critical appraisal and reproducibility of the model and the methods used to validate it. Transparency in model development and validation is critical given the possible ramifications for justice-involved individuals and public health and safety, and to ensure a fair criminal justice system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fazel, Sariaslan, &amp; Fanshawe, 2022)</ref>. Several limitations should be noted. First, since NICHE includes information on both crimes solved and those under investigation, which was used as the outcome. At the same time, this is a more sensitive measure than convicted re-offending and captures the population-level effects of violent behaviour as police investigations (as distinct from police charges) require a threshold that conviction is more likely than not. Second, some predictors were missing from the English dataset (i.e. highest education and disposable income), whilst proxies were used for some others (i.e. clinical risk factors). For entirely missing predictors, although they had small effects on the predicted outcomes in the original model, all participants were assigned an average value (equivalent to the prevalence in the derivation study), which is the same as incorporating its effect into the estimate of baseline risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fazel et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Held et al., 2016)</ref>. To mitigate the impact of missingness for partially missing predictors, we employed multiple imputation, by which plausible values were derived based on other (observed) predictor values <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Harel et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Janssen et al., 2010)</ref>. To reduce the possible effects of missing data, future research should strive for linkage of population-based registers, although access to such data can be costly and restricted. Finally, this study provides no practical guidance on how OxRec could be utilised as a decision-support tool to help guide interventions to reduce violent reoffending. A clinical impact study, in which the feasibility of implementing OxRec, and its impact on current practices, reoffending outcomes and cost effectiveness will need to be studied (and eventually using a trial design to evaluate impact on outcomes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Labarère, Bertrand, &amp; Fine, 2014</ref>). This will allow for examination of how the risk prediction tool could be integrated effectively into existing operational systems and criminal justice workflows, and whether modifiable risk factors in OxRec could be targeted for treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mudumbai &amp; Rashidi, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>In this real-world external validation of more than 1700 people released from prison, a recalibrated version of the OxRec tool demonstrated good predictive performance for risk of violent reoffending within 1 and 2 years after release from prison in England. OxRec could be used to supplement professional judgement and assist with linkage to specific interventions and care pathways following prison release. Individuals in higher risk groups could potentially benefit most from effective interventions, given limited resources in criminal justice and health services. The use of evidence-based risk assessment tools has the potential to provide more accurate and consistent decision-making in criminal justice, and also preserve resources and reduce costs due to their scalability. Their potential contribution in reducing criminal outcomes needs to be examined.</p><p>those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR, or the Department of Health and Social Care.</p></div>

In comparison with OVP-currently being used by the National Offender Management Service in England and Wales for risk and needs assessment-the OxRec tool achieved similar levels of predictive performance when considering solely the AUC (0.74 [OxRec] vs. 0.72 [OVP]) (Howard &amp; Dixon, 2012). However, other key measures of OVP's predictive performance are poorly reported and many are lacking. Measures of OVP discrimination beyond the AUC (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) were calculated based on arbitrary classification risk thresholds, solely selected to match the distribution of another tool's categories (i.e. the V scale of Risk Matrix 2000 [RM2000/V]) for comparison purposes</figDesc></figure>
