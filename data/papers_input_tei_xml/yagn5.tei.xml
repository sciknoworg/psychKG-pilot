				<p>Why does decision-making sometimes feel demanding while other times feel effortless? The dominant view of cognitive effort suggests that, else being equal, individuals prefer to avoid mentally effortful courses of action-an empirical phenomenon which has been well-studied in cognitive control paradigms. However, less work has investigated cognitive demand avoidance in value-based decisions. Here we investigate subjective (self-reported) demand, preferences for demand, and psychophysiological measures of effort outlay in the context of risky decisionmaking. Across three experiments (N=199), we observe that individuals evaluate choice pairsconsisting of two options with described risk levels and reward magnitudes-with less discriminable expected value differences as subjectively more demanding. More interestingly, participants exhibit a robust preference for low-effort risky choice pairs in a novel Demand Avoidance Task, which we modeled after well-characterized effort preference paradigms used in the cognitive control domain. Finally, using pupillometry, we find that participants, contrary to our expectations, exhibit larger task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs)-a well-characterized measure of momentary effort exertion-when choosing between low-demand risky choice pairs, and that these TEPR magnitudes predicted demand-avoidant preferences in a subsequent test phase. Together, these results demonstrate that cognitive demand avoidance generalizes beyond cognitive control tasks to risky value-based choice.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A central tenet of theories of decision-making is that individuals are reluctant to engage in cognitively costly forms of information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Payne et al., 1993)</ref>. On this view, when people are faced with complex choices, they often employ simplifying heuristics in order to avoid effortful cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oprea, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shah &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008)</ref> or will delay or even avoid making choices entirely <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Dhar, 1996)</ref>. At the same time, a growing body of work investigating the phenomenology of mental effort observes, nearly ubiquitously, that individuals, when faced with the choice, avoid cognitively demanding courses of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Vogel et al., 2020)</ref>. In turn, this observed preference against effortful mental activity has spurred a more recent line of empirical work observing that individuals evaluate cognitively effortful situations as costly and unpleasant <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(David et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Devine et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>While previous investigations of cognitive effort avoidance have typically operationalized cognitive effort in terms of cognitive control demand-for example, in wellstudied response conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Desender et al., 2017)</ref> and task-switching paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Devine &amp; Otto, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kool et al., 2010)</ref>-or in terms of working memory and/or attentional demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bogdanov et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Vogel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>, it unclear whether individuals avoid effortful value-based choices in the same way. Here, we examine the possibly that individuals experience risky choices (e.g., would you rather have a 10% chance to win $100 and a 90% chance of winning nothing, or $10 for sure?) as effortful and, when given the choice, prefer to avoid making effortful risky choices in favor of less effortful risky choices. Accordingly, to better understand how cognitive effort avoidance manifests in risky choice, here we examine the following specific questions. First, can we effectively manipulate the subjective (i.e., self-reported) effort associated with risky choices by changing the properties of the risky choice pairs themselves? Second, when faced with a choice, do people systemically avoid risky choices that are experienced as effortful? Third, do physiological indices of momentary effort exertion-namely, task-evoked pupil diameter changes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(da Silva Castanheira, LoParco, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">van der Wel &amp; Steenbergen, 2018)</ref>-evoked by risky decision-making relate to individuals' preferences to avoid effortful risky choices?</p><p>To this end, demonstrating that we avoid cognitively demanding risky choices, much as we avoid situations with heightened cognitive control demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018)</ref>, is important for understanding the domain-generality of cognitive effort avoidance. At the same time, a direct examination of the interplay between effort avoidance and risky decision making-using self-reported effort, evoked preferences, and physiological measures of effortwould corroborate the influential notion that cognitive effort avoidance underlies many putatively irrational choice patterns in economic (i.e.,, value-based) choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Camerer &amp; Hogarth, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shah &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Smith &amp; Walker, 1993</ref>). Finally, a burgeoning literature in cognitive neuroscience has sought to understand how the brain-for example, in areas such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)represents effort costs, and integrates these costs with benefits (i.e., reward incentives) to efficiently direct costly cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(da Silva Castanheira et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Shenhav et al., 2013)</ref>. Elucidating how psychophysiological and self-report measures of cognitive effort relate to demand avoidance in risky choice will enrich our understanding of cost-benefit effort computations presumably occurring in these brain regions.</p><p>While, to our knowledge, the question of whether individuals also avoid demanding risky value-based choices has not been addressed directly, there is ample evidence supporting the idea that in many cases, evaluating-and choosing between-risky prospects imposes considerable cognitive processing demands on decision-makers. For example, constraining individuals' ability to deliberate between options by imposing concurrent cognitive demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hinson et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hinson et al., , 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Whitney et al., 2008)</ref> or time pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Guo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Madan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Olschewski &amp; Rieskamp, 2021)</ref> potentiates framing effects in risky choices-which are thought to arise from employing lower-effort strategies that are less deliberative in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kahneman &amp; Frederick, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Loewenstein et al., 2015)</ref>. Accordingly, in light of the considerable body of evidence indicating people systemically avoid situations with increased demands on executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018)</ref>, we reasoned that people may also avoid particularly demanding risky decisions as they may make similar demands on these same executive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hinson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Whitney et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In separate but parallel line of inquiry, cognitive effort research has typically operationalized task demand in terms of cognitive control demand, perhaps most famously using the Demand Selection Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kool et al., 2010)</ref>. In the these tasks, participants typically make repeated choices between two stimuli associated with different demand levels of cognitive demand-e.g., greater (versus smaller) likelihood of switching between two simple tasks. Under the assumption that more frequent switches between tasks impose increased demands for cognitive control, these studies typically find that individuals avoid choosing the (demanding) option associated with a high task switch rate in favor of the (less demanding) options associated with less frequent task switches <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bogdanov et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kool et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Patzelt et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sayalı &amp; Badre, 2021)</ref>. Supporting the idea that demand-avoidant preferences are driven by evaluations of subjective effort, individuals rate stimuli associated with a high demand leveli.e., higher task switching rate-as subjectively more demanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Devine &amp; Otto, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wu et al., 2022)</ref>. Here we develop a risky decision-making paradigm which sought to emulate the key properties of the Demand Selection Task in order to understand demand avoidance in the domain of risky choice.</p><p>However, one challenge inherent in understanding demand avoidance in the domain of risky choice is operationalization of choice demand itself. Here, we reasoned that an individual's ability to discriminate between the expected values of two risky prospects should influence subjective demand. For example, when choosing between concrete goods where the outcomes are certain, choices between options with similar subjective values are typically made more slowly <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Martino et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lebreton et al., 2009)</ref> and are accompanied by greater selfreported decision effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lee &amp; Daunizeau, 2021)</ref>, relative to choices between options with large differences in subjective value. Likewise, under risk-e.g. a 10% chance to win $100 and $0 otherwise, versus $10 with certainty-previous work has used differences in expected value (EV)-the sum of possible outcome values multiplied by the probability of each possible outcome occurring-to manipulate decision conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Venkatraman, Payne, et al., 2009)</ref>. Indeed, recent studies examining risky choice have found that that smaller differences in EV (i.e., lower discriminability) between two options leads to slower choices, accompanied by lower selfreported confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(da Silva Castanheira, Fleming, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hoven et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, in the present experiments, we operationalized cognitive demand in the risky choice setting as the discriminability of the EVs of two risky options faced by decisionmakers, with the presumption that choosing between pairs of risky prospects with similar EVs (e.g., Option A: a 84% chance of winning $355 and $250 otherwise, EV= 338.2; versus Option B: 35% chance of $611 and $192 otherwise, EV= 338.65) should evoke greater subjective demand than choosing pairs of risky prospects with highly discriminable EVs (e.g., Option C: 45% chance of $450 and $179 otherwise, EV= 300.95; versus Option D: 55% chance of $365 and $94 otherwise, EV= 243.05). To do this, we carefully constructed High-Demand and Low-Demand choice pairs which were defined, critically, by their level of EV discriminability, but importantly, equated the other important properties of these choice pairs-for example, the average EVs and risk levels of the options. In this way, participants would not form evaluations about (or preferences between) High-and Low-Demand choice pairs on the basis of, for example, the overall (average) values or risk levels of the two options, and instead on the basis of the difficulty in discriminating between the options' values. Finally, we also considered the possibility that individuals, rather than computing and choosing on the basis of EVs, may instead evaluate risky options using simple heuristics which do not integrate probability and outcome information <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pachur et al., 2017)</ref> and, accordingly, constructed these risky choice pairs so that low-demand (versus high-demand) choice pairs also engendered low (and high) levels of conflict between the prescriptions of two commonly used heuristics.</p><p>With this operationalization of choice demand, the present studies seek to provide an initial examination of demand avoidance in the domain of risky decision-making. First, in Experiment 1, we establish whether choosing between (High-demand) choice pairs with low EV discriminability evoke greater (self-reported) subjective cognitive demand relative to (Lowdemand) choice pairs with greater EV discriminability. Having established that these two types of choice pairs engender differential levels of subjective cognitive demand, in Experiment 2, we developed a novel decision-making paradigm inspired by influential studies of effort avoidance in the cognitive control domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kool et al., 2010</ref>)-which we termed the Decision Avoidance Task-to examine whether individuals, when given the choice, avoid choosing between Highdemand risky choice pairs in favor of Low-demand choice pairs. Finally, in Experiment 3, to understand the relationship between on-line effort exertion and demand avoidance in risky choice, we investigated pupillometric measures of on-line effort exertion while participants deliberated between risky choice pairs. As task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs) are believed to index momentary cognitive effort exertion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beatty, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">da Silva Castanheira, LoParco, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">van der Wel &amp; Steenbergen, 2018)</ref>, we reasoned that individuals that those who exerted more effort on High-Demand choice pairs (as indexed by TEPRs) would also exhibit the strongest demand-avoidant preferences. Together, these experiments aim to extend our understanding of cognitive demand avoidance to the domain of risky decision-making.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 37 adults (5 males, Age= 20.18, SD= 1.32) from McGill University's participant pool in exchange for course credits. Due to a technical error, data of 3 participants failed to record properly. Of the 34 resulting participants, we further excluded the data from one participant who failed to choose the EV-maximizing option for the low-demand choices (see below) more than 60% of the time, resulting in a final sample of 33. Participants provided informed consent and all procedures were in accordance with the McGill University's Research Ethics Board. Participants were instructed that they would be paid a cash bonus in proportion to their total earnings on the risky decision-making task at the end of the experiment and consequently had to choose options to maximize their bonus. However, at the end of the experiment, all participants were remunerated the same amount: $5.00.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risky Decision-Making Task</head><p>Participants completed a risky decision-making task consisting of a series of choices between risky options <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), represented side-by-side, using pie charts to depict the possible outcomes and their associated probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(da Silva Castanheira, Fleming, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">da Silva Castanheira, Sharp, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Guo et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, participants would be asked to choose between an option with a 16% chance of winning $250 and an 84% chance of winning $355, or an option with a 35% chance of winning $611 and a 65% chance of winning $192. The pairs of pie charts representing risky prospects were depicted in one of two colors (red or blue) randomly selected on each trial, and importantly, this presentation color had no relationship with the demand level of the choice pair 1 .</p><p>Participants indicated their choice on each trial using the left and right arrow keys and had 5 seconds to make a response. After a choice was made, the options were masked until the 5second response window elapsed. Participants were not provided with outcome information after making each choice. After each choice, participants were either asked to rate how demanding the preceding choice was ("How mentally demanding was that choice") following the NASA TLX scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hart, 2006)</ref>, or how confident they felt in having made the best choice ("How confident are you that the choice you made was the best choice?") <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Folke, Jacobsen, Fleming, &amp; De Martino, 2016)</ref>. Both ratings were collected on a 1-7 scale, with 1 indicating "not demanding"/"not confident" and 7 indicating "very demanding"/"very confident" using the <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We presented choice pairs using (non-informative) colors in Experiment 1 to assess whether choice pair presentation color biased demand ratings, because in Experiment 2, the demand level of a choice pair was conveyed by its (randomly assigned) presentation color. However, in Experiment 1 we observed no effect of presentation color (red versus blue) upon self-reported demand (b=-0.05, 95%CI: [-0.13, -0.03], p=0.213; Table 1) suggesting against the possibility that presentation color influenced subjective demand evaluations of choice pairs. number keys 1 through 7. Subjects completed 4 practice trials before choosing between (and subsequently rating) 200 presentations of choice pairs.</p><p>As part of our laboratory's standard data collection procedure, prior to the choice task, participants first completed two computerized tasks: the Digit Symbol Coding Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mathias et al., 2017)</ref> and the Operation Span task (OSPAN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Unsworth et al., 2005)</ref>, which were not analyzed in the present study. Participants then completed a risky decision-making task.</p><p>Following the choice task, participants responded to three questionnaires, which were also not analyzed in the present report: the Maximization scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Nenkov et al., 2008)</ref>, the Need for Cognition Scale (NFC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cacioppo et al., 1984)</ref>, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Spielberger, 1983)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risky Choice Pair Construction</head><p>We manipulated choice demand by altering the differences in Expected Values (EV) between the two options, defined as the weighted average of an options' possible outcomes by their associated probabilities (i.e., outcome magnitude multiplied by outcome probability), effectively creating two sets of 100 choice pairs each, defined by different levels of decision difficulty either Low-Demand (LD) or High-Demand (HD). Specifically, Low-Demand choice differed markedly in EV (e.g., a 45% chance of $450 and $179 otherwise, EV:300.95; versus a 55% chance of $365 and $94 otherwise, EV:243.05), while High-Demand choice pairs had similar EVs (e.g., an 84% chance of $355 and $250 otherwise, EV:338.2, versus a 35% chance of $611 and $192 otherwise, EV:388.65).</p><p>The complete lists of Low-Demand and High-Demand choice pairs presented to participants are provided in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. Critically, we constructed these sets of choice pairs such that the average EV (i.e., the mean EV of both options) did not differ appreciably across types of choice pairs <ref type="bibr">t(198)=0.38,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=0.70)</ref>, and so that the outcomes and risk levels (taken as the coefficient of variation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Weber et al., 2004)</ref>, as well the standard deviation of outcomes) associated to each option did not differ overall between Low-and High-Demand choice pairs. A statistical comparison of each choice pair attribute across Low-and High-Demand choice sets is provided in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>. Importantly, in both choice sets, the higher-EV option was equally likely to appear in the left and right position.</p><p>Finally, we also sought to ensure that Low-and High-demand choice pairs, from the perspective of a decision-maker employing a purely heuristic strategy, would also engender the same levels of strategic conflict between simple heuristics. In particular, we considered two commonly used simple heuristic strategies: 'maximin' and 'maximax' <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pachur et al., 2017)</ref>. The maximin heuristic prescribes choosing the option with the best of the worst possible outcomes, while the maximax heuristic prescribes choosing the option with the largest of the best possible outcomes. We constructed high-demand choice pairs such that the two heuristics would make conflicting prescriptions about choice. For example, faced with a (High-Demand) choice between an 84% chance of $355 and $250 otherwise, or a 35% chance of $611 and $192 otherwise, the maximin heuristic would prescribe choosing the former option, while the maximax heuristic would prescribe choosing the latter. In contrast, we constructed low-demand choice pairs such that the two heuristics made concordat prescriptions about choice-for example, faced with a (Low-Demand) choice between a 45% chance of $450 and $179 otherwise, or a 55% chance of $365 and $94 otherwise, both the maximin and the maximax heuristic would prescribe choosing the former option. In effect, under this operationalization of choice demand, the level of demand engendered by the EVs discriminability of the options accords with the level of conflict conflicting prescriptions of these two heuristics for the same options-that is, regardless of whether a decision-maker chooses on the basis of EVs versus simple heuristics, they would experience low and high levels of conflict in the Low-demand and High-demand choice pairs, respectively. By equating these features of the two choice sets, we ensured against the possibility participants' evaluations of choice pairs would reflect only the level of difficulty (i.e., EV discriminability, or strategic conflict) and not the overall value or risk level associated with Low-and High-Demand choice pairs.</p><p>We constructed 3 different choice pair presentation orders (of 200 choice pairs each) by pseudo-randomly interleaving choice pairs from the 100 High-demand and 100 Low-demand choice sets described above. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of these three presentation orders</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We used the lme4 package for R <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bates &amp; Maechler, 2009)</ref> to estimate mixed-effects regressions examining the impact of choice demand level upon subjective demand and confidence. Specifically, these models predicted demand ratings (or subjective confidence) as a function of dummy-coded task demand (hard=1, easy=0), choice RTs (Z-scored within-subject), as well as the interaction between RT and task demand. To control for potential effects of available reward on demand ratings and RTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Shevlin et al., 2022)</ref>, we included the maximum reward on offer (i.e., max of all four outcomes across options), Z-scored within-subjects, as well as the interaction between maximum available reward and demand level. We also assessed the effect of demand level on log-transformed choice RT by estimating a regression with the identical predictor variables. To analyze choices, we estimated a mixed-effects logistic regression predicting EV-maximizing choices as a function of demand level. In all regression models, we also estimated a linear effect of trial number (mean-centered), choice pair presentation color (red versus blue) as well as 3 dummy coded variables representing that participant's stimulus presentation order. These models included random intercepts and random effects of demand level, taken over participants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Demand and Confidence Ratings</head><p>We first assessed whether the demand level manipulation engendered different levels of subjective demand, as evinced by post-choice demand ratings ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>). We observed that participants rated high-demand choice pairs (M= 3.88) as more demanding than the low-demand choice pairs (M= 2.09), and this was difference confirmed statistically by a significant main effect of demand level upon demand ratings in a mixed-effects regression (b= 1.87, 95% CI= [1.47, 2.27], p&lt;0.001; <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). We also assessed whether choice RTs predicted subsequent demand ratings and found a significant positive relationship (b= 0.21, 95% CI= [0.11, 0.31], p&lt;0.001), indicating that participants rated choices that they made more slowly as more demanding. This regression also revealed a significant positive interaction between choice demand level and RT (b= 0.25, 95% CI= [0.16, 0.34], p&lt;0.001) suggesting that choice slowing exerted a greater influence on subjective demand during high-demand (versus low-demand) choices.</p><p>Examining post-choice confidence ratings ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>), participants reported feeling less confident after making a choice in a High-demand (M= 4.52) versus Low-demand choice pair (M= 6.11). Statistically, a mixed-effects regression revealing a significant main effect of demand level (b= -1.64, 95% CI= [-1.89, -1.40], p&lt; .001; see <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). We also assessed whether choice RTs predicted confidence ratings, but did not observe a significant effect of RT (b= -0.07, 95% CI= [-0.17, 0.03], p=.179;). However, demand level appeared to modulate the relationship between RT and confidence, such that the relationship between RT and confidence was stronger in high-demand choice pairs compared to low demand pairs (interaction b= -0.23, 95% CI = [-0.32, -0.14], p&lt;.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choices and Response Times (RTs)</head><p>We expected that the difficulty inherent in high-demand choices, by virtue of the low EV discriminability (and/or heuristic conflict) between options, would result in slower decisions and lower-rates of EV-maximizing choices. Examining choice RTs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2A</ref>), we observed that participants made slower choices in High-demand (M = 5.02s) versus Low-demand choice pairs (M = 3.57s). This RT slowing was confirmed statistically by a mixed-effects regression, which revealed a main effect of demand level (b= 0.35, 95% CI= [0.27, 0.43], p &lt; .001; see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>We also observed that participants made fewer EV-maximizing choices when faced with Highdemand (M= 0.47) versus Low-Demand choice pairs (M= 0.95; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2B</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Experiment 1 demonstrates that our operationalization of decision demand in the risky choice setting-which systematically manipulates EV discriminability while controlling for overall value, risk level, and differences in conflict between heuristics-successfully evoked different levels of subjective cognitive demand. Mirroring participants' self-reported demand ratings, we also observed that, when faced with High-demand choice pairs, participants made choices more slowly and more fewer (optimal) EV-maximizing choices, suggesting that these choices engendered greater decision difficulty  than Low-demand choice pairs.</p><p>Having established that our choice demand manipulation successfully evokes differential levels of subjective cognitive demand, Experiment 2 uses these same using Low-and Highdemand choice pairs to examine whether individuals, when given the choice, tend to avoid highdemand risky choices. To examine this question, we developed a novel paradigm termed the Decision Avoidance Task based on the Demand Selection Task, which has been used examine cognitive demand avoidance in the domain of cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kool et al., 2010)</ref>. In this paradigm (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>), participants first learned associations between two arbitrary stimuli and Low-versus High-demand risky choice pairs (the Learning Phase), and following that, made free choices between these two stimuli (the Test Phase) which led to risky choice pairs with demand levels determined by the chosen stimulus. To the extent that individuals avoid cognitively demanding risky choices, as they do in cognitive control paradigms <ref type="bibr">(</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 81 participants from McGill University's Psychology participant pool (20 males; 18-33 years old; M age= 21.17; SD= 2.81). We excluded data from two participants due to a technical error, and to ensure participants understood the choice task, we further excluded the data of three participants who failed to choose the EV maximizing choice on more than 60% trials for the low-demand stimuli during the Learning Phase, resulting in the exclusion of 5 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedure</head><p>As in Experiment 1, participants completed the Digit Symbol Coding and OSPAN tasks prior to the Decision Avoidance Task. In this paradigm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3)</ref>, participants first learned the associations between two distinct fractal stimuli and Low-versus High-demand risky choice pairs (the Learning Phase), and subsequently made choices between these stimuli. Critically, one stimulus was deterministically associated with decisions from the Low-demand set of choice pairs, while the other stimulus was associated with choice pairs drawn from the High-demand choice set (identical to those used in Experiment 1, see <ref type="table">Tables S2 and S3</ref> for complete choice pairs). Mappings between stimulus and demand levels were counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>The two task phases were separated by a self-paced break. Following the Decision Avoidance Task, participants completed the Maximization, NFC, and STAI questionnaires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Phase</head><p>In the Learning phase, participants learned the deterministic mappings between the fractal stimuli and the associated choice pairs using a forced choice procedure. Specifically, on each trial, one stimulus was made transparent and participants were instructed to choose the more opaque stimulus. After choosing the instructed stimulus, choice, participants were presented with a choice pair consisting of two risky options and were required to make a subsequent. The mapping of choice pair presentation color (red versus blue) to demand level (low versus high) was randomized across participants.</p><p>Critically, this choice pair was drawn either from the choice set <ref type="bibr">(Low-or High-Demand)</ref> that was associated with the fractal stimulus that preceded the choice pair. Participants had 5 seconds to choose between fractal stimuli and 5 seconds to choose between each pair of risky options. Participants performed 50 consecutive forced-choice trials with each stimulus (for a total of 200 trials over 4 blocks) with the order counterbalanced across participants. In effect, participants chose between every possible choice pair in the High-and Low-demand choice sets in this phase, while learning its mapping to the associated fractal stimulus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Phase</head><p>Following the Learning Phase, participants completed the Test Phase, in which they made 100 free choices choose between the (previously learned) fractal stimuli. The Test Phase procedure was structurally identical to the Learning Phase procedure but with the key difference that, instead of making forced (i.e. instructed choices), participants could choose freely between the two stimuli. That is, following their choice of fractal, participants were presented with a choice pair randomly drawn from the Low-demand choice pair set associated with low demand) or the High-demand choice pair set , depending on their choice, and participants were subsequently required to choose between the two risky options (presented in the associated color). In both the Learning and Test phases, Critically, participants were not provided with any instructions about demand levels associated with each stimulus, but rather, they were simply instructed to select the stimulus associated leading to choice pairs that they preferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We used mixed-effects regression to assess the effects of demand level upon risky choice RTs and rates of EV-maximizing choices in the Learning Phase (as this phased contained were equal numbers of observations for each demand level). To examine demand preferences in the Test Phase, we estimated a mixed-effects logistic regression predicting selection of the Highdemand stimulus on the basis of trial (i.e., choice) number, taking random intercepts over participants. Critically, the intercept term in this model was used to test for a reliable group-level preference for the low-demand stimulus. To examine individual differences, we estimated a separate model which additionally included participants' z-scored OSPAN, Digit Symbol, Maximization, Need for Cognition, and OSPAN scores as covariates. These individual difference measures were not strongly correlated to each other (all rs &lt; 0.30).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Phase RTs and Choices</head><p>We first examined choice behavior in the Learning Phase <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2)</ref>, where participants were required to make an equal number of Low-and High-Demand choices. As in Experiment 1, we observed slower RTs (b= 0.17, 95%CI= [0.12, 0.21], p &lt; .001), and lower rates EVmaximizing choice (b= -3.38, 95%CI= [-3.58, -3.19], p &lt; .001) indicating that, as in Experiment 1, High-demand choice pairs were more difficult than Low-demand choice pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demand Avoidance in Test Phase Choices</head><p>Our key question of interest in the Test Phase was whether individuals avoided demanding risky decisions-in other words, if participants systematically preferred the stimulus associated with Low-demand choice pairs. Examining Test phase preferences <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>), we found that participants had a marked preference for the stimulus associated with low-demand choice pairs, with the majority of participants choosing the High-Demand option less than 50% of choices (median proportion of high-demand stimulus selections: 0.27). Statistically, this preference was confirmed by a significant negative intercept in our mixed-effects logistic regression model (b=-1.7788, 95% CI= [-2.26, -1.29], p&lt;.001) indicating that participants' preference for the low-demand stimulus was greater than would be expected by chance. We did not observe a significant effect of trial number (b=0.0416, 95% CI= <ref type="bibr">[-0.06, 0.14], p=0.423)</ref> suggesting that these demand-avoidant preferences were stable over the 100 trials of the Test Phase.</p><p>We also examined, in an exploratory fashion, whether individual differences in intrinsic motivation to engage in mentally effortful activities (Need for Cognition), working memory capacity (OSPAN), processing speed (Digit symbol scores), and maximization predicted demand preferences. Estimating a separate logistic model which included these individual difference variables as covariates <ref type="table">(Table S5)</ref>, we found that neither cognitive ability measure (processing speed or OSPAN, ps &gt; .50) related to preference, nor did self-reported Need for Cognition or maximization tendency (ps &gt;. 20) ) emerge as a predictor of high-demand choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Building upon the considerable body of work demonstrating that people avoid demanding cognitive control tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Devine &amp; Otto, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kool et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Patzelt et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sayalı &amp; Badre, 2021)</ref>, the preferences we observed in the Test Phase of Experiment 2 suggest that individuals systematically avoid demanding risky choices. Because the overall (i.e., average) value and risk levels of High-Demand and Low-Demand choice pairs were equated, these observed preferences are difficult to explain by preferences for valuable choice pairs or by risk aversion. Taken together with the findings of Experiment 1, these observed patterns of preferences suggest that individuals, when given the choice, avoid decisions between options with low value discriminability (or heuristic conflict), which are experienced as subjectively demanding.</p><p>However, on the basis of the self-reported demand ratings observed in Experiment 1 and the demand preferences observed in Experiment 2, it is less clear how closely the subjective effort experienced during risky choice relates to demand avoidance. That is, while High-Demand (versus Low-Demand) choice pairs presumably evoked different levels of cognitive demand, individual participants may vary considerably in the extent that they invested and/or experienced effort during these risky choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Strobel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. In a final experiment, we measured task-evoked pupil diameter changes-which have previously been demonstrated to track momentary effort exertion in the context of cognitive control tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beatty, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chiew &amp; Braver, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">da Silva Castanheira, LoParco, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kostandyan et al.,</ref>  (CAD) or course credit with a performance-contingent cash bonus of up to $5. All participants were screened for corrected-to-normal, color blindness, and diagnoses of psychiatric or neurological conditions. We excluded those participants who failed 60% or more of the catch trials, those who failed to respond to more than 20% of trials, or those without usable pupil diameter measurements due to calibration issues or excessive eyeblinks. After applying these exclusions, 52 participants remained in the final sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedures</head><p>Participants were seated comfortably in front of a 24-inch monitor set to a resolution of 1280x1024 pixels in a dimly lit room and instructed to keep their heads rested on a chin mount positioned 60cm from the screen. During both phases of the Decision Avoidance Task, participants' left pupil diameter and fixations on the screen were measured using an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research, Osgoode, ON) at a sampling rate of 250Hz. Prior to the start of each experimental block, participants underwent a standard nine-point calibration procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Avoidance Task</head><p>Participants completed a version of the Decision Avoidance Task adapted for pupillometry recordings (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Like in Experiment 2, the task was broken into two phases: a Learning phase where they learned stimulus-choice set associations through forcedchoice and a Test phase where participants freely chose among the stimuli. To eliminate possible differences in luminance stemming from the fractal and bar charts stimuli employed in Experiment 2, we opted use two identical colored doors, represented as rectangles with identifying symbols (i.e., a five-point star or lightning bolt) in place of fractal stimuli.</p><p>Participants had 2 seconds to decide between the doors, and following their choice, the door stimuli were masked until the 2-second response window elapsed. After this choice, participants were presented with a pair of risky options, now presented as stacked bar charts, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tymula et al. (2012)</ref>. These choices had a fixed duration of 5 seconds, with a visual mask applied after a choice was made. Following this, participants were presented a fixation cross which served as a jittered inter-trial interval between 2.5 to 3.5 seconds. To ensure participants could complete both phases of the task within a 2-hour experimental session, we reduced the total number of Learning Phase trials from 200 to 120 in the learning phase (30 forced trials per block). Trials were organized into 4 Learning Phase blocks and 2 Test Phase blocks (50 trials per block). Between blocks, participants were permitted to take short self-paced breaks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Pupil Diameter and Eye Movements</head><p>Pupillary data were preprocessed using the 'pypillometry' package for Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mittner, 2020)</ref>. Following down-sampling of the pupillary timecourse data to 100hz, ye blinks were corrected using linear interpolation and the entire recording was passed through a low-pass filter, attenuating high-frequency signals above 1Hz. Learning phase pupillary data were baselinecorrected on a trial-by-trial basis by subtracting the mean diameter of a 500ms baseline period prior to stimulus presentation. TEPRs were be calculated as the maximum (baseline-subtracted) pupil diameter, observed between 1000ms and 3000ms after choice pair onset, following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(da Silva Castanheira, LoParco, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gilzenrat et al., 2010)</ref>. This time window of interest corresponds approximately to the median choice RT of 2.16s observed in the Learning phase of Experiment 2.</p><p>We also analyzed gaze behavior during choices between risky options in the Learning phase. As with the pupillary data, the eye-position data (x and y pixel coordinates) were blinkcorrected using linear interpolation and down-sampled to a frequency of 100Hz. We defined two large areas of interest (AOIs) corresponding to each of the two risky options, with a margin of 100 pixels to the left and right of the choice stimuli, covering the entire height of the display (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). We confirmed that these AOIs adequately captured fixations (and that participants were attending to the risky options), finding that overall, the vast majority participants' fixations were directed at either of the two options rather than elsewhere on the display (mean % of fixation in either AOI = 98.15%). We then computed, for each trial, the number of gaze shifts between these two AOIs before a choice was made , and the total Euclidean distance (in pixels) covered by the eye movements in the first second of the trial to capture both within-option and between-option shifts in attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Our analysis of choice behavior followed the procedure used in Experiment 2. To analyze trial-level TEPRs, we estimated a mixed-effects linear regression predicting Learning phase TEPRs as a function of the demand level of the choice pair, controlling for trial number, the total reward on offer, the outcome probabilities of the left and right options, and whether an EVmaximizing choice was made, taking random intercepts and slopes for demand level over participants. To examine individual differences in TEPRs, we computed participants' median TEPRs for the High-and Low-demand choices in the Learning phase and separately used these measures to predict subsequent demand avoidance in the Test phase using mixed-effects logistic regression models. To analyze gaze patterns during risky choices in the Learning Phase, we predicted the number of gaze switches and the total distance covered (using Poisson and linear mixed-effects regressions, respectively) as a function of demand level, trial number, the total reward on offer, the outcome probabilities of the left and right options, and whether and EV maximizing choice was made.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risky Choice Behavior and Demand Avoidance</head><p>Mirroring Experiments 1 and 2, we confirmed that participants made slower choices (b=0.12, 95% CI= [0.05, 0.19], p=0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2A</ref>) and fewer-EV-maximizing choices (b= -3.40, 95% CI= <ref type="bibr">[-3.66, -2.56</ref>], p&lt; .001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2B</ref>) on High-versus Low-demand choice pairs.</p><p>Further replicating Experiment 2, we observed in the Test Phase that participants significantly preferred the stimulus associated with Low-Demand Choices (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref>), which was confirmed statistically by mixed-effects regression (intercept: b=-0.97, 95% CI= [-1.43, -0.51], p&lt;0.001). Together, these results suggest the key behavioral signatures of cognitive demand in risky choice, and subsequent demand avoidance generalized replicate in a demand avoidance task adopted for pupillometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning Phase Task-Evoked Pupillary Responses (TEPRs)</head><p>To investigate whether our pupillometric index of effort investment tracked choice demand level during choice, we first examined TEPRs accompanying risky choices in the Learning Phase ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref>). We observed, rather unexpectedly, that TEPRs were larger accompanying Low-demand choices versus High-demand choices. Examining these TEPR magnitudes in the time window of interest using a regression ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6B</ref>; see Methods), we observed a significant negative effect of choice demand level upon TEPR (b= -61.52, 95%CI= <ref type="bibr">[-93.68, -29.36</ref>], p&lt;0.001; <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>). We also assessed whether average TEPRs accompanying low-demand trials was comparable between the Learning versus Test phases of the task but did not observe a significant difference between TEPRs in the two experiment phases (b= 38.60, 95% CI= <ref type="bibr">[-85.62, 8.42]</ref>, p=0.108).</p><p>We next examined the relationship between TEPRs measured during Learning phase choices-which we presume to index effort investment -and subsequent avoidance of highdemand choices in the Choice Phase. As we observed, unexpectedly, that low-demand choices evoked larger TEPRs than high-demand choices in the Learning Phase, we did not have a strong prediction about whether High-(versus Low-demand) choice TEPRs in the Learning Phase would relate more strongly to subsequent demand avoidance in the Test Phase. Examining participant-level median TEPRs ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6C</ref>), we observed that TEPR magnitudes accompanying Low-demand risky choices significantly predicted participants' subsequent preference for the Low-demand stimulus (b= -0.68, 95%CI= [-1.33, -0.03], p= 0.042)-that is, individuals exhibiting larger TEPRs during Low-demand choices in the Learning Phase chose the Lowdemand option more often frequently in the Test Phase. However, we did not find evidence for a predictive relationship between TEPRs accompanying High-demand risky choices and subsequent Test-phase preference for the low-demand stimulus (b= 0.25, 95%CI= [-0.40, 0.90], p= 0.444).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patterns of Gaze During Choice</head><p>We reasoned that the unexpectedly smaller TEPRs observed in High-, relative to Lowdemand choices might have arisen from a withdraw of effort prompted by the high difficulty of these choice pairs stemming from low discriminability of EVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Silvestrini et al., 2023)</ref>. To directly address the possibility that participants invested less effort in the comparison of risky options on High-demand choices, we conducted an exploratory analysis of participants' patterns of gaze during Learning Phase choices, examining the frequency of shifts in gaze between the two options preceding choices (see example gaze trajectory depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7A</ref>), which we took as a proxy for effortful information sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Folke, Jacobsen, Fleming, &amp; De Martino, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Horstmann et al., 2009)</ref>. Accordingly, if participants are indeed withholding effort during High-demand choices, we reasoned that we should observe fewer shifts in gaze relative to Lowdemand choices.</p><p>Examining gazes shifts during Learning phase choices ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7B</ref>), we observed participants made an average of approximately two between-option gaze shifts during each choice, but more interestingly, these gaze shifts were less frequent during High-demand choices (M=2.14) compared to Low-demand trials (M= 2.20). Statistically, a mixed-effects Poisson regression indicated that participants shifted their gaze between options significantly less frequently during High-demand choices (demand level: b= -0.06, 95% CI= [-0.12, -0.01], p=0.031), suggesting that participants engaged in more (effortful) between-option comparison on Low-demand, versus High-demand choices.</p><p>In a complementary analysis, we also computed the total Euclidian distance covered by eye movements during the first second of each trial, with the intuition that greater distance covered by eye movements in early choice periods reflects heightened information sampling.</p><p>Corroborating the observed gaze shift frequencies, we observed that participants' total gaze displacements were smaller during High-demand, relative to Low-demand choice pairs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure   7C</ref>), and a mixed-effects linear regression confirmed this effect of demand level (b= -40.89, 95%</p><p>CI= <ref type="bibr">[-67.34, -14.44]</ref>, p&lt;0.001). Finally, we examined whether total Euclidean distance covered (standardized within each demand level, for each participant) during individual choices predicted an EV-maximizing choice on that trial, and found that participants were more likely to make EVmaximizing choices on trials with larger gaze displacements (mixed-effects logistic regression: b= 0.44, 95% CI= [0.27, 0.60], p&lt;0.001), during which participants presumably sampled more information about the risky options. This relationship was stronger on Low-demand choices, as indicated by a significant interaction between Demand level and total distance covered (b= -0.41, 95% CI: <ref type="bibr">[-0.60, -0.22]</ref>; p&lt;0.001; <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The avoidance of cognitively effortful cognitive processing is a central assumption in many influential accounts of value-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Payne et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shah &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008)</ref>. Taking an approach inspired by a recent body of work examining effort-based decision-making in cognitive control paradigms, we examine, in the domain of risky value-based decision-making, whether people similarly avoid cognitively demanding situations. Specifically, the experiments reported here demonstrate that 1) individuals' subjective, self-reported demand varies systematically with discriminability of the options' values (and/or conflict between heuristics), all else being equal, 2) when given the choice, individuals avoid choosing between these more subjectively demanding risky choices, and 3) a physiological index of effort investment during risky choice-namely, task-evoked pupillary responses-appears to predict individuals' subsequent preferences to avoid these more subjectively demanding risky choices.</p><p>Taken together, the present experiments provide an important demonstration of the generality of cognitive demand avoidance-which has been well characterized in paradigms where cognitive demand is operationalized in terms of cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018</ref>) and working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Vogel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref> demands-to the domain of risky, value-based decision-making. The observation that individuals also systematically avoid risky choice situations for which evaluation and comparison of the options' values necessitates expenditure of cognitive effort, beyond expanding the scope of behaviors touched upon by cost-benefit accounts of effort-related decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>, dovetails well with the influential idea that ostensibly suboptimal judgment and choice behavior stems from individuals' reluctance to engage in effortful deliberation processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shah &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008</ref>).</p><p>Of note, we observed that participants in Experiments 2 and 3 exhibited a marked preference against High-demand risky choice pairs, which we operationalize as choice pairs for which discriminability between the EVs of the options is low (versus high). Importantly, our operationalization of choice demand anticipated the possibility that individuals might, use simple heuristics to choose between the pairs, rather than attempt to estimate EVs. As a result, the use of simplifying heuristics engendered conflict between risky options in High-demand choice pairs, presumably leading to the systematic differences in subjective demand between Low-and Highdemand choice pairs (observed in Experiment 1) and the systetmic avoidance of these choice pairs (observed in Experiments 2 and 3).</p><p>In Experiment 3, we examined task-evoked pupil responses (TEPRs) accompanying risky choices to better understand effort investment on Low-versus High-demand choice pairs during the Learning phase. Under the presumption that participants increase their level of effort investment in response to the demand level they encounter (here, in risky choice), we predicted that we would observe larger TEPRs-a marker of momentary effort exertion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(da Silva Castanheira, LoParco, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">van der Wel &amp; Steenbergen, 2018</ref>)-on High-demand choices. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that participants exhibited smaller TEPRs on Highdemand, relative to Low-demand choices suggesting that participants were withholding effortrelative to their effort investment level on Low-demand choices-as they made these choices.</p><p>Again, at the same time, participants in Experiment 1 rated these same High-demand choice pairs as more subjectively demanding.</p><p>One possible explanation for these pattern of TEPRs and subjective demand ratings is that participants perceive High-demand choice pairs as excessively difficult and accordingly, disengage (or withhold) effort on the assumption that increased decision effort yields little additional choice quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Silvestrini et al., 2023)</ref>. Indeed, this is a central tenet of Motivational Intensity Theory, which postulates that individuals invest effort when it yields a tangible benefit, but otherwise withhold effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brehm &amp; Self, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gendolla et al., 2012)</ref> -for example, in the case of choices with low EV discriminability. On this view, we would expect higher demand ratings, but smaller TEPRs accompanying High-demand choices. While it is difficult to ascertain whether the low rates of EV-maximizing choices observed on these trials occurred directly as a result of participants' disengagement of choice effort, the disadvantageous choices observed on these trials are not incompatible with an effort withdrawal interpretation. Moreover, examining participants' gaze patterns in Experiment 3, we found that participants' tendency to engage in between-option comparison-indexed by gaze shift frequency ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7B</ref>)-was lower for Highdemand (versus Low-demand) trials, corroborating the idea that participant disengaged from effortful choice processes on these trials.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that two observed patterns of results are difficult to explain under a simple effort withdrawal account. First, in all three experiments we observed slower choice RTs-typically interpreted as increased (effortful) deliberation between options <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bhui, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Frömer &amp; Shenhav, 2022</ref>)-on High-versus to Low-demand choice pairs, whereas under an effort withdrawal account, we would expect to see faster choice RTs on trials for which participants disengaged. Second, it is not clear at first blush why individual differences in TEPRs Finally, as previous theoretical accounts and neuroimaging studies delineate an important role for the dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) in representing relative cost-benefit effort evaluation, and in turn, mobilization of effortful cognitive processing directed by its presumed net benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(da Silva Castanheira et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Shenhav et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Silvestrini et al., 2023)</ref> -again, considered in the context of cognitive control paradigms-the present results suggest a role for this region in the evaluation of decision demand in risky decision-making. Possibly supporting this linkage, previous neuroimaging evidence finds evidence for a relationship between dACC activity and risky decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brown &amp; Alexander, 2017)</ref>. At the same time, research has delineated a role for the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC; which neighbors, or even overlaps functionally with the dACC) in in mobilizing effort in instrumental value-based choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Clairis &amp; Pessiglione, 2024)</ref> as well as representing control demands in multi-attribute decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Venkatraman, Rosati, et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>

In doing so, Experiment 3 is positioned to elucidate two key questions. First, do task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs)-an index of momentary effort exertion-measured during risky choices in the Learning Phase track the respective demand levels of choice pairs? Second, with the assumption that individuals avoid choice pairs that evoke greater (subjective) effort, to what extent do individual differences in risky choice-evoked TEPRs predict subsequent demandavoidant preferences in the Test Phase? participants (18 males, 2 non-binary participants, 18 -29, Mage= 20.99, SD=2.44) recruited from the McGill University community for a base remuneration of $20</figDesc></figure>

One speculative possibility that is an individual's average TEPR on Low-Demand choices may reflect their general level of effort investment in risky choice (irrespective of choice demand level), which could in turn predict subsequent avoidance of demand regardless of whether they engage effort in demanding situations-i.e., High-demand risky choice pairs. Under the assumption that High-demand choice pairs in this study were simply 'too difficult' owing to their low EV discriminability, future studies could test this disengagement account more comprehensively by examining self-reported demand, and TEPRs under a broader range of EV discriminability levels, including intermediate levels between the Low-and High-Demand discriminability levels examined here.</figDesc></figure>
