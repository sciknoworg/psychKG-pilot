				<p>Moral decision-making is a topic of great interest in the growing field of moral psychology. Yet, to our knowledge, there are no existing self-report scales for measuring the process of decision-making in individual moral dilemmas (as opposed to general moral attitudes or beliefs about moral decision-making), nor are there any equivalent self-report measures of meta-decision-making. We fill these gaps in the methodological toolbox of moral psychology by devising new self-report measures of several of the processes by which people make moral decisions and validate them using realistic moral dilemmas, including six new vignettes that we developed. The resulting scales can be used to measure how much people rely on rules versus cost-benefit reasoning, how much they rely on intuition versus deliberation, and whether they integrate these different considerations in the specific moral dilemmas they face in a laboratory experiment or the real world.

Some of the field&apos;s open questions include: How do people make moral decisions, and how does this depend on the situation and the person&apos;s prior experience?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>when do they override them by deliberation? Are these processes mutually exclusive? If not, does relying more on one of them mean relying less on the other? Can people increase their reliance on deliberation without decreasing their reliance on intuition, and vice versa?</p><p>In other words, are these two processes two poles of the same dimension, or are they better represented by two independent dimensions? Although moral psychology research has made considerable progress on these questions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Awad et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bear &amp; Rand, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Betsch, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Capraro, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crockett, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cushman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Garrigan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gawronski &amp; Ng, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Greene, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Greene &amp; Haidt, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Guzmán et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Haidt, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Pachur &amp; Spaar, 2015)</ref>, our understanding of these crucial aspects of moral decision-making is still far from complete. One contribution to closing this gap is to develop standardized measures of the processes by which people make decisions in moral dilemmas, which has yet to be done.</p><p>Most moral decision-making scales focus on presumably stable individual differences in people's general beliefs about and attitudes towards morality. According to a recent systematic review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ni et al. (2023)</ref>, only two of those measures have sound psychometric properties: the Defining Issues Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rest, 1974)</ref> and the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>. The Defining Issues Test is based on Kohlberg's theory of moral development <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kohlberg, 1981)</ref>, and measures what stage of moral development a person is in based on how they justify the actions they consider to be morally right in a predefined set of moral dilemmas. The Oxford Utilitarianism Scale measures people's endorsement of MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 4 one major moral theory, namely utilitarianism.</p><p>In addition, the recently developed Deontological-Consequentialist Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mata et al., 2022)</ref> can be used to measure people's endorsement of consequentialism as well as deontology, which are commonly regarded to be two oppositional philosophies. Another measure of moral decision-making, the <ref type="bibr">Moral Metacognition Scale (McMahon &amp; Good, 2016)</ref>, focuses on how much and how well people think about their moral thinking.</p><p>Further, there has been some work on measures of moral traits in personality psychology, which focus on honesty and humility <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashton et al., 2014)</ref>. Related prior work investigated how existing measures of stable personality traits correlate with moral decisions (e.g., Big</p><p>Five Personality Traits; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Luke and Gawronski, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>While the abovementioned studies and scales provide important insights into individual differences in moral decision-making, they do not measure the moral decision-making process. Although there are several self-report measures of people's decision-making styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Appelt et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Betsch, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bruine de Bruin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Epstein et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Pachur &amp; Spaar, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Scott &amp; Bruce, 1995)</ref>, those measures do not capture the unique aspects of moral decision-making, as they measure general tendencies rather than the process of a specific individual decision.</p><p>On the other hand, while many studies have investigated the process of how people make moral decisions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Oktar et al., 2023)</ref>, most did not use standardized, validated scales to measure moral decision-making. Those who did use validated scales either employed self-report measures of decision-making in general (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bartels, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Epstein et al., 1996)</ref> rather than moral decision-making in a specific moral dilemma, or only measured people's reliance on different types of moral values <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Clifford et al., 2015)</ref>. These two approaches neither measure the unique moral processes of utilitarian CBR and following deontological rules nor how people arbitrate between competing moral principles.</p><p>To avoid the limitations of self-report measures, moral psychologists commonly infer the decision process from people's choices in moral dilemmas where the theorized MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 5 mechanisms disagree about whether an action is morally right or wrong (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gawronski et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Körner et al., 2020)</ref>. These methods are confined to moral dilemmas that are designed such that people's behavior is diagnostic of which moral mechanism they rely on. However, in many real-world situations, the different moral mechanisms a person might rely on all recommend the same behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Parfit, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, to measure how people make moral decisions in any situation they might encounter in the real world, we need a different approach. In addition, the dilemmas are usually designed so that utilitarianism and deontology lead to opposite choices; however, as we argue in the next section, it is unclear whether this is actually achieved in many dilemmas, and even if it were achieved, it is unclear whether people really think about the decisions in those terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kahane, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Other methods for measuring the process of moral decision-making include paradigms that apply eye-tracking and process-tracing methods to moral decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fiedler &amp; Glöckner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ghaffari &amp; Fiedler, 2018)</ref>. While these methods reveal which information people consider, they do not directly measure what people do with that information. Moreover, previous studies found that process tracing paradigms can change how people make decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lohse &amp; Johnson, 1996)</ref>, and eye-tracking is more challenging than administering the simple self-report measures mentioned above.</p><p>This paper aims to close this crucial gap by providing self-report measures for the processes of moral decision-making. Across three studies, we developed scales measuring how much participants reported they relied on different processes involved in moral decision-making (rules versus CBR, and intuition versus deliberation) and integration of moral rules with CBR. In addition, we find that -contrary to prior research that assumed people have to choose between relying on CBR and moral rules (for a review, see J. F. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Christensen &amp; Gomila, 2012)</ref> -the degree to which people rely on CBR and the degree to which they rely on moral rules are two independent dimensions of their decision process. Moreover, we find that the same is also true for the interplay of intuition versus MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 6 deliberation; while previous work has often construed as a conflict that has to be resolved in favor of one or the other, some have argued that this is not necessarily the case <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Loewenstein et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.1">Theoretical Background on Decision Processes</head><p>Moral decision-making is often studied in terms of how much people follow moral rules versus rely on utilitarian CBR, and how much people rely on their moral institutions versus deliberation. Below, we discuss the literature on these topics and how people combine these different decision mechanisms when making moral decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.1.1">Utilitarianism versus Deontology</head><p>According to deontological moral theories, some actions, such as killing, are always morally wrong, regardless of their consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alexander &amp; Moore, 2021)</ref>. According to these theories, people should always follow certain moral rules, such as "Do no harm." By contrast, consequentialism is the view that whether something is right or wrong depends entirely on its consequences (Sinnott-Armstrong, 2022). Utilitarianism is a special case of consequentialism, according to which the consequences for all sentient beings are equally important <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driver, 2022)</ref>. Previous research in moral psychology usually mapped decision-making in moral dilemmas directly onto the meta-ethical theories of deontology and utilitarianism. For example, the CNI (Consequences, Norms, and Generalized Inaction) model of moral decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gawronski et al., 2017b)</ref> operationalizes utilitarianism as sensitivity to outcomes, and deontology as sensitivity to moral norms.</p><p>Recent work has also amended the CNI model to research individual differences in moral decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Körner et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.1.2">Moral Rules versus Cost-Benefit Reasoning (CBR)</head><p>Moral decision-making is commonly studied using sacrificial dilemmas, where people must decide whether to commit sacrificial harm for the "greater good". For instance, a MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 7 version of the classic trolley dilemma tasks the reader with choosing between letting the trolley run over five people or pushing a large man off a footbridge to use his body to stop the trolley <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Foot, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Thomson, 2019)</ref>. Typically, one option is identified as utilitarian, and one as deontological (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gawronski &amp; Beer, 2017)</ref>. Here, the "utilitarian" CBR-based option is to push the large man in front of the trolley (i.e., kill one person to save a greater number of people), whereas the deontological rule-based option is to abstain from it (to follow the moral rule "Do no harm").</p><p>Although the trolley dilemma is set up such that the evaluative standard of utilitarianism endorses the action that people would choose if they trusted their CBR, it is unclear whether this association also holds in the real world. Human CBR is inevitably fallible because it is computationally intractable to accurately predict and consider all possible consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bennis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gigerenzer, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gigerenzer, , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Maier et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, there is no guarantee that the action a person chooses by CBR will be the one that has the best possible consequences according to utilitarianism.</p><p>For example, in a real-world instantiation of the classic trolley dilemma, the large man's body could be insufficient to stop the trolley from killing the others; indeed, there is no compelling evidence that a single individual is able to stop a running trolley. Moreover, there is no guarantee that his body will land on the tracks when you push him. It is, therefore, quite possible that the action recommended by a person's naive CBR could kill the man without saving anyone. Even if the man's body does stop the trolley as intended, there are still a variety of negative indirect effects that are difficult to take into consideration; for instance, the homicide rate might increase because the moral norm against killing has been weakened. Therefore, following the rule may actually be better, even from a utilitarian perspective. Further, for participants not trained in moral philosophy, it is unlikely that they have in-depth knowledge about utilitarianism and deontology and explicitly use them as decision mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kahane, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>For these reasons, we refer to the two choices by their decision strategies, which is MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 8 "following moral rules" versus "relying on cost-benefit reasoning" (CBR). Note that CBR here refers to a "first-order" or "naive" CBR, which compares the numbers of people directly affected by the decision rather than a full utilitarian cost-benefit analysis, which would also consider all indirect consequences, which is computationally intractable for real-life decisions.</p><p>One of the three new self-report measures developed in this article is designed to help researchers investigate how much people rely on CBR versus moral rules in different types of moral decisions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.1.3">Intuition versus Deliberation</head><p>Previous research on moral decision-making distinguished between intuition and deliberation as two distinct types of cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Greene, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Greene et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Greene et al., , 2008</ref>. Intuition, driven by fast, automatic, and emotional responses, is usually linked to following moral rules (e.g., not pushing the man in the trolley dilemma). By contrast, deliberation involves slow, effortful, reason-based thinking, enabling us to weigh different factors and potential consequences more thoroughly. It is, therefore, linked to CBR. This work was later extended to reinforcement learning theories of moral decision-making, which link intuition and deliberation to specific types of reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms that might underlie people's choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Crockett, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cushman, 2013)</ref>. This RL theory of moral decision-making proposes that intuitive moral rules, such as "Do not kill", originate from simple, learned action-value associations. The distinctive feature of these value representations is that they are insensitive to the consequences the actions might have in the specific situation in which it is being considered. The RL theory of moral decision-making contrasts these so-called "model-free" representations to "model-based" moral decision-making, which uses a learned model of how taking different actions in the current situation would affect the state of affairs to reason out which of those choices would produce the best consequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cushman (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crockett (2013)</ref> proposed this MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 9 model-based decision mechanism as a model of CBR and deliberation more generally.</p><p>One of the three self-report measures developed in this article is designed to help researchers investigate how much people rely on model-free (moral) intuitions versus (model-based) deliberation in different types of moral decisions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.1.4">Meta-Control and Meta-Decision Making</head><p>When making decisions in moral dilemmas, people integrate considerations from different decision mechanisms. Which mechanisms are activated may depend on various situation factors and the features of the scenario. For instance, when presented with different variations of the trolley dilemma, many more people choose the sacrificial CBR-based option when it is operationalized as pulling a switch to redirect the trolley to a track with one person, compared to when it is operationalized as pushing a man in front of the trolley <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Awad et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Greene et al., 2009)</ref>. This suggests that people do not strictly follow a single general moral rule (e.g., "Do not kill"), nor do they strictly follow CBR (e.g., save a greater number of people); otherwise, they would have chosen the same option in both scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bartels et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Past research has shown that people are sensitive to a variety of features, such as whether the behavior is an action or an omission <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baron &amp; Ritov, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cheung et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Yeung et al., 2022)</ref>, the degree of personal force involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Feltz &amp; May, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Greene et al., 2009)</ref>, and the extent to which the norms regarding each feature are violated <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Nichols &amp; Mallon, 2006)</ref>. If people were strictly following only one decision mechanism, they should either always choose the CBR-based option independent of the number of people saved (as long as it is larger than the number of people saved by the deontological option), or always choose the rule-based option independent of how strongly the norm is violated by the utilitarian alternative (as long as it is violated more strongly than by the deontological option) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Everett &amp; Kahane, 2020)</ref>. Given that people make different decisions in different situations, they do not appear to be only following one decision mechanism. MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 10 Therefore, an important open question is how people decide which decision mechanisms to employ in any given situation. Are people explicitly thinking about whether rules, CBR, intuition, or deliberation tend to work well in this type of situation? If so, are they merely selecting one decision process, or are they combining multiple decision processes in each situation? To help researchers address these questions, one of the three scales developed in this article helps researchers measure whether people deliberately integrate these different considerations (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.2">Scenarios For Studying Moral Decision Making</head><p>Moral decision-making has been studied in a variety of contexts, such as realistic field studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Oktar et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Schwitzgebel et al., 2023)</ref> and lab experiments, where participants are confronted with moral dilemmas. The most popular task used to study moral decision-making is the trolley dilemma. However, classic trolley dilemmas are often criticized for being unrealistic and bizarre <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bauman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bennis et al., 2010)</ref> due to their complete lack of uncertainty and sometimes absurd situations. Another problem with these dilemmas is that they usually confound the CBR-based option with action, and the rule-based option with inaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Crone &amp; Laham, 2017)</ref>. For instance, in the footbridge version of the trolley dilemma, "push the man" is both the CBR-based option and a physical action, whereas the rule-based option "don't push the man" coincides with inaction (commonly referred to as "omission"). Because of this confound, a person's preference for the rule-based option could simply be a preference for inaction (i.e., omission bias; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron and Ritov, 2004)</ref> rather than a commitment to following moral rules.</p><p>To mitigate these limitations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Körner and Deutsch (2022)</ref> developed realistic trolley-type dilemmas (which were later revised and adapted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Maier et al., 2024)</ref>. Some of them are based on historical events. Importantly, they also dissociate rule-following from inaction and CBR from taking action. We extend this work by developing six new realistic moral dilemmas, which we also use to validate our new self-report measures of the process MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 11 of moral decision-making.</p><p>In the remainder of this article, we describe how we developed three new scales for measuring three important aspects of how a person made a specific moral decision: (i) reliance on moral rules versus CBR, (ii) reliance on deliberation versus intuition, and (iii) the integration different moral considerations. We also introduce the six new moral dilemmas we used to validate these scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Development and Evaluation of Measures of Reliance on Different Decision</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanisms</head><p>We developed and validated three self-report scales for measuring key aspects of how a person made a specific moral decision. The first scale measures how much the decision was driven by intuitive versus deliberative processing (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The second scale measures how much the person relied on CBR versus moral rules (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). The third scale measures how much the person integrated these different types of moral considerations (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>We developed and psychometrically evaluated these three measures in parallel over four studies. First, we developed initial item pools for measuring (1) people's reliance on intuition versus deliberation and (2) the integration of these complementary moral considerations. In Study 1, we collected data on people's responses to these initial items.</p><p>Each participant first made a decision in a moral dilemma and then rated their decision process according to the initial items. We then conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of these items and revised the scales accordingly. In Study 2, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the finalized scale items using six novel moral dilemma vignettes (more information about these vignettes in Section 2). We also added a new initial item set of how much they relied on rules versus consequences and conducted an EFA of these items. In Study 3, we conducted a CFA of the finalized scale items for rules versus consequences using our novel vignettes. Finally, in Study 4, we tested the construct MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 12 and predictive validity of our new scales by investigating the relationship with existing scales and testing whether they predict choices in moral dilemmas above and beyond these existing scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Development of the Initial Item Pools</head><p>We developed initial item sets for choice-level items on intuition versus deliberation and metacognitive-level items on arbitration and integration. In the next sections, we outline the process for deriving these items. A full list of the initial items can be found in the Appendix A1.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Items on Intuition versus Deliberation.</head><p>When developing the initial item set, we first considered other studies that have previously asked people about their decisions regarding specific moral dilemmas using ad-hoc measures. We based some of our items that measure intuition and deliberation (items ID1 -ID4) on <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Oktar et al. (2023)</ref>. In this paper, participants saw some moral dilemmas and completed some "metacognitive scale items":</p><p>"Is your judgment based on deliberation/analysis?" and "Is your judgment based on intuition/emotion?" As deliberation/analysis and intuition/emotion might be perceived as different concepts, we decided to keep these items separate into four separate questions.</p><p>We also renamed "analysis" to "cost-benefit reasoning" as this was a better fit for the type of analysis that participants would do when considering moral dilemmas.</p><p>Further, we chose specific phrases from the domain-specific version of The Unified Scale to Assess Individual Differences in Intuition and Deliberation (items ID5 -ID7, USID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Pachur &amp; Spaar, 2015)</ref>, such as "gut feeling" and "use my heart as a guide". This domain-specific extension of the USID was developed to measure people's domain-specific decision-making tendencies for six separate domains (i.e., Mate Choice, Clothing, Restaurants, Medical, Electronics, and Vacation). However, this scale still asks people to report on their general tendencies across all of their decisions in a given domain. By contrast, our goal is to measure how the person made a specific individual decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 13</head><p>Therefore, we only selected specific phrases and heavily adapted them to fit the purposes of our measurement.</p><p>To measure deliberation (items ID8 -ID13), we did not think that the domain-specific USID items on deliberation were suitable for measuring deliberation in moral decision-making as they focused on planning and preference for complexity. Rather, we wanted items that were more relevant to moral decision-making. Therefore, we developed new scale items to measure reliance on deliberation in moral decision-making through discussions with each other and by consulting the extant literature on moral decision-making.</p><p>Metacognitive Items on Integration. These items aimed to measure how much the person thought about arbitrating between or integrating the recommendations of model-free mechanisms (i.e., moral rules and moral values) versus model-based mechanisms of moral decision-making (i.e., CBR). For instance, some people may just rely on a rule without explicitly thinking about whether to do so or not, whereas other people might explicitly think about how the relative reliability of moral rules and CBR depends on relevant features of the current situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Study 1: Reliance on intuition versus deliberation in moral decision-making</head><p>Study 1 tested scales for measuring reliance on intuition versus deliberation, as well as participants' explicit metacognition about arbitrating/integrating the recommendations of model-based versus model-free moral mechanisms. Examining the factor structure of the scale for measuring reliance on intuition versus deliberation allowed us to examine whether relying more on deliberation necessarily means relying less on intuition or whether people's reliance on each mechanism varies independently of their reliance on the other. We recruited 300 participants between the 23rd and 24th of June 2023. Each participant was paid £2.48 for their time. We excluded three participants who did not pass one of our two attention checks, which instructed them to put the slider of certain questions to 0 or 100. Therefore, our final sample contained 297 participants. The mean age was 43.19 years (sd = 14.00); 149 participants were female, and 148 were male.</p><p>Materials and Procedure. We showed participants one of 13 randomly selected moral dilemmas from Maier et al. <ref type="formula">2024</ref>, which were adapted from vignettes used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Körner and Deutsch (2022)</ref>. After reading the moral dilemmas, participants saw the items about reliance on intuition and deliberation, followed by the items about metacognitive arbitration and integration. Within each level, the statements were presented in randomized order. Participants were asked to what extent they agreed with each statement and gave their responses on a scale from 0 ("Not at all") to 100 ("Entirely").</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unique Variable Analysis: Reliance on Intuition versus Deliberation.</head><p>We first conducted a unique variable analysis (UVA, A. P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Christensen et al., 2023)</ref> to remove any redundant items. This is a crucial step in scale development, as selection solely based on reliability can otherwise lead to a scale in which the different items are very similar duplicates of each other. Consequently, the scale would only ask about a small subset of the construct in question. Based on the UVA, we removed the items ID7 (which was redundant with ID2) and ID13 (which was redundant with ID1 and ID11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Factor Analysis: Reliance on Intuition versus Deliberation.</head><p>Second, we ran an EFA using the fa function in the psych package. We first tried to MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 15 extract a one-factor solution, viewing the items about intuition as reverse-coded items.</p><p>The single-factor solution showed a very poor fit (RMSEA = 0.172, TLI= 0.431). This very poor fit was also retained when running a CFA, which only selected the items that loaded more than .4 on the factor (RMSEA= 0.193, TLI= 0.656). Therefore, we proceeded to examine a two-factor solution with intuition and deliberation as two orthogonal factors using varimax rotation. The two-factor solution showed a better, though still poor, model fit (RMSEA= 0.087, TLI = 0.854). Thus, we proceeded to examine a solution where we only kept the three best items (in terms of the difference between loadings on the primary and secondary factors). All the items retained in this way had loadings larger than 0.5 on the primary factor and smaller than 0.2 on the other factor. This solution had a very good fit (RMSEA= 0.041, TLI= 0.980). Finally, we also compared this result to the result obtained using a non-orthogonal rotation (oblimin). This led to similar results, except for ID12 being included instead of ID1 for the intuition factor; however, we decided against this solution as item ID12 is inherently a trade-off item rather than an item measuring intuition. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we retained six items in our final item set based on the orthogonal rotation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Study 4: Construct Validity &amp; Concurrent Validity</head><p>Having established the reliability of our scales, we now turn to their construct and concurrent validity. To achieve this, Study 4 obtained three types of evidence for the construct validity of our scales. First, we wanted to test the discriminant construct validity of our scales by showing that the first pair of scales (rules versus CBR) measures different constructs than the second pair of scales (intuition versus deliberation). 1 Second, to establish convergent construct validity, we tested if our new scales relate to the Deontology Subcale of the Deontological-Consequentialist Scale (DCS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mata et al., 2022)</ref> and the Sacrificial Harm Subscale of the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Third, to assess concurrent validity, we tested if our scales can predict participants' decisions in moral dilemmas above and beyond existing scales.</p><p>To establish the convergent construct validity of our scales for measuring people's reliance on CBR versus rules, we measured their associations with the degrees to which people endorse the two conceptually most closely related moral theories, namely utilitarianism and deontology. To measure utilitarianism, we selected the OUS Sacrificial Harm Subscale, which is a well-known and commonly used measure of utilitarian beliefs. It specifically measures people's willingness to inflict sacrificial harm when it is outweighed by other benefits, which is the decision that people are faced with in our dilemmas and a signature of CBR. To measure deontology, we selected the DCS Deontology Subscale because it is the logical counterpart to the OUS and maps onto the rule-based choice in moral dilemmas.</p><p>Based on the philosophical definitions of utilitarianism and deontology introduced in Section 0.1.1, we made two sets of predictions. First, we predicted that reliance on CBR should be positively correlated with the OUS Sacrificial Harm Subscale and negatively correlated with the DCS Deontology Subscale. Second, we predicted that reliance on rules should be positively correlated with the DCS Deontology Subscale and negatively correlated with the OUS Sacrificial Harm Subscale. Assuming that reliance on CBR, reliance on rules, reliance on intuition, and reliance on deliberation are four separate constructs, we did not predict that reliance on deliberation versus intuition would be related to utilitarianism versus deontology in the same way.</p></div>

After reading each vignette, participants completed our self-report measures of reliance on rules, CBR, intuition, deliberation in a new specific moral decision. 2 They also gave responses to the DCS Deontology Subcale and the OUS Sacrificial Harm Subscale. More details about the procedure of this experiment are available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Maier et al. (2024)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discriminant Construct Validity: Two-Dimensional Structure of CBR</head><p>versus Deliberation and Rules versus Intuition. Studies 1-3 showed that reliance on rules and reliance on CBR are two separate factors. They also showed that reliance on intuition and reliance on deliberation are two separate factors. However, because of how the scales were distributed across different studies, they were unable to assess whether reliance on rules is conceptually distinct from reliance on intuition and whether reliance on CBR is conceptually distinct from reliance on deliberation. To answer each of these questions, we first conducted CFAs with a two-factor model and a one-factor model, and then compared the fit of both models.</p><p>The degrees to which participants reported relying on rules versus intuition were extremely well-captured by a measurement model with two independent factors (CFI = 1.00, SRMR = 0.019, RMSEA = 0.046) and very badly captured by a measurement model with only a single factor (CFI = 0.681, SRMR = 0.212, RMSEA = 0.386).</p><p>Consequently, a model comparison provided substantial evidence for the two-factor model explaining the data better than the one-factor model (BIC two = 22740, BIC one = 23238, AIC two = 22688, AIC one = 23191).</p><p>For reliance on CBR versus deliberation, we found an acceptable fit of the two-factor model (CFI= 0.95, SRMR= 0.053, RMSEA= 0.122) and a poor fit of the one-factor model (CFI= 0.82, SRMR= 0.088, RMSEA= 0.209). Again, a model comparison provided substantial evidence for the two-factor model explaining the data better than the one-factor model (BIC two = 22191, BIC one = 22290, AIC two = 22140, AIC one = 22243).</p><p>The results of the model comparisons between two-factor and one-factor models suggested that reliance on CBR is distinct from deliberation, and that reliance on rules is distinct from reliance on intuition. Them being distinct psychological constructs is positive evidence for the discriminant construct validity of our measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Validity: EFA shows that reliance on CBR, reliance on rules, reliance on intuition, and reliance on deliberation are four separate constructs.</head><p>Taken together, the confirmatory factor analyses reported above suggest that the four scales we developed measure four separate aspects of the process of moral decision-making. To further strengthen the evidence for this four-factor model, we conducted a parallel analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Horn, 1965)</ref> followed by an EFA. The scree plot suggested four factors or three factors (see <ref type="figure">Figure A1</ref>). We, therefore, conducted EFA for both a three-factor model and a four-factor model using oblimin rotation. The four-factor model recovered the factor structure with items measuring reliance on rules, intuition, deliberation, and CBR, each loading on separate factors (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref>). This four-factor model fitted the data substantially better than the three-factor model, which had to assume that items measuring reliance on CBR and items measuring reliance on deliberation load on the same factor (four-factor: RMSEA = 0.069, BIC = -75.02; three-factor: RMSEA = 0.098, BIC = -41.46; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table A2</ref>). These findings provide strong evidence for the structural validity of our four new scales. The relationships between the items from all four scales strongly support the four-factor MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 25 structure we assumed by grouping them into four separate scales measuring reliance on CBR, reliance on rules, reliance on intuition, and reliance on deliberation, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationships with Existing Scales Provide Evidence of Convergent</head><p>Validity. To test the relationship with existing scales, we fitted a single six-factor model with one factor for each of our four newly developed scales, one factor for the OUS Sacrificial Harm Subscale, and one factor for the DCS Deontology Subscale. We then inspected the correlations between the latent variables in this model. The six-factor model achieved a good fit to the data from the six corresponding questionnaires (CFI = 0.94, SRMR= 0.061, RMSEA= 0.059). <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> displays the correlations between the different scales. We can see that reliance on CBR relates most strongly to the OUS Sacrificial Harm Subscale, whereas reliance on rules correlates most strongly with the DCS Deontology Subscale. Further, we found a strong negative correlation between reliance on CBR and reliance on rules, which is unsurprising given that these are usually considered two competing processes in moral judgment (typically studied as utilitarianism versus deontology and used as two conflicting choices in moral dilemmas in psychology experiments, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Awad et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Körner and Deutsch, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with the dual-process theory of morality <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Greene, 2013)</ref>, we found a strong positive correlation between reliance on CBR and deliberation. In addition, we observed a moderate negative correlation between reliance on rules and reliance on intuition. This is in conflict with certain interpretations of an early version of the dual process theory of morality, according to which rule-based decision-making is commonly based on intuition <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Greene et al., 2008)</ref>. However, proponents of the theory have acknowledged that "this is not always the case" <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Greene, 2007)</ref> and noted that rule-based morality sometimes relies on reasoning, a phenomenon called "rationalist deontological philosophy". This phenomenon can be "best explained as a rationalization of evolved emotional intuition" <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Greene, 2007)</ref>. In other words, rule-based moral reasoning is a form of reasoning, regardless of where the rules come from. Consistent with our findings, this MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 26 interpretation of Greene's dual-process theory predicts that rule-based moral reasoning should be negatively correlated with intuition. Moreover, our finding is consistent with Haidt's social-intuitionist theory of moral judgment, according to which "going with the strongest intuition" is a competing alternative to "the conscious application of a moral rule or principle" <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Haidt, 2001)</ref>. Overall, these associations between our scale measures and self-report measures of people's moral theories support their convergent validity.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> shows the results of this analysis. We found that when testing all the scales in the same model, participants' self-reported reliance on CBR correctly predicted that they chose the CBR-based option over the rule-based option. Moreover, participants' self-reported reliance on rules strongly predicted that they chose the rule-based option over the CBR-based option. When we controlled for these two key predictors, none of the other self-report measures had a significant effect on participants' choices.  *** denotes p &lt; .001. The dependent variable was coded so that higher values on the predictor indicate a higher probability of choosing the CBR-based choice.</p><p>Overall, the results presented in this section showed that (1) all scales had high predictive validity for people's moral decisions, (2) the scales measuring reliance on CBR and rules predicted choices the best, and (3) once these scales were accounted for, there MORAL  was no evidence that the other scales provided additional information about people's decisions in sacrificial moral dilemmas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of Six New Moral Dilemmas</head><p>We extended upon the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Körner and Deutsch (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Maier et al. (2024)</ref> by developing six new realistic trolley-type dilemma vignettes. In half of these dilemmas, the action under consideration is the CBR-based option ("WW2", "Torture", and "Breaching Ethics"), and in the other half it is the rule-based option ("Organ Waitlist", "Sweatshop", and "Prisoner"). As an example of a CBR Action dilemma, in "WW2", the reader is asked to imagine themselves as a soldier fighting the Nazis in World War II. They need to decide whether to proceed with an attack on an enemy outpost. If they decide to proceed with the attack, they would probably harm some innocent civilians in the vicinity, but the attack would weaken the enemy's capabilities and potentially end the war sooner, saving many more innocent people. Thus, proceeding with the attack is the CBR-based option, and not doing so is the rule-based option. As an example of a Rule Action dilemma, in "Organ Waitlist", the reader is asked to imagine themselves as a surgeon who needs to decide whether to follow the organ donation waiting list and give the only available donor heart an older patient who is next on the list, or not follow the waiting list and give it to a younger patient with a higher chance of survival. Here, following the waiting list is the rule-based option, and not doing so is the CBR-based option, as it breaks the moral rule of fairness but could potentially save many more years of life. Full materials for this vignette and all other vignettes are available in Appendix A1.3.</p><p>We used these dilemmas to test our scales in Studies 2, 3, and 4. Our dilemmas covered a variety of realistic scenarios that involved different rule violations (i.e., harming civilians, torture, disregarding established safety rules or fairness regulations, exploiting others, and killing) and different contexts (i.e., war/military, medicine, industry, and justice). Having tested our scales on such a wide range of moral decisions makes our MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 30 findings about their reliability and validity more generalizable. We invite future studies using our scales to take advantage of these and other diverse moral dilemmas to increase their findings' generalizability.</p><p>In Study 2, we asked participants (N = 299) to evaluate the quality of the dilemmas by asking them how clear it was (on a scale of -50 = "Extremely unclear", 0 = "Neutral", to 50 = "Extremely clear"), how realistic it was (on a scale of -50 = "Extremely unrealistic", 0 = "Neutral", to 50 = "Extremely realistic"), and how much it constituted a moral dilemma (on a scale of -50 = "Completely not a dilemma", 0 = "Neutral", to 50 = "Completely a dilemma"). As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, participants rated the dilemmas as very clear and realistic and agreed that each of the situations constituted a moral dilemma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Concluding Remarks</head><p>We developed several scales that can be used to measure how people make moral decisions. We present reliable scales to measure their reliance on intuition, deliberation, rules, and cost-benefit reasoning. Further, we provide scales to measure whether people explicitly consider which decision mechanism to engage in a given moral dilemma. These reliable self-report measures can help researchers studying moral decision-making gain a more fine-grained understanding of the decision processes people employ in specific scenarios.</p><p>Across the four studies, we found a good fit of all our measures. Study 1 suggested that intuition and deliberation are two independent dimensions of moral decision-making, and Study 2 confirmed this conclusion. Likewise, Study 2 suggested that reliance on rules and reliance on CBR are two independent dimensions of moral decision-making, and Study 3 confirmed this conclusion. Finally, Study 4 confirms the construct and concurrent validity of our new scales.</p><p>Consistent with previous research on peoples' decision-making styles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Betsch, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Pachur &amp; Spaar, 2015)</ref>, these findings suggest that relying on intuition and MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 31</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Participants rated all six moral dilemma vignettes as being very clear, realistic, and constituted a moral dilemma. deliberation are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they should be considered two independent contributors to moral decision-making. This means that some decision processes may employ both more intuition and more deliberation than others. Intuition and deliberation are not necessarily two competing alternatives, as was sometimes (implicitly) assumed in previous research on moral judgment and moral decision-making.</p><p>Likewise, consistent with previous findings on the processes underlying moral decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gawronski et al., 2017a)</ref>, our findings suggest that people's reliance on rule-based decision-making and cost-benefit reasoning is not a zero-sum game, either.</p><p>Instead, people might be able to increase their reliance on either without having to MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 32 decrease their reliance on the other. This adds to the recent finding that people integrate the recommendations of rules and cost-benefit reasoning when making decisions in moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Guzmán et al., 2022</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Greene, 2023</ref>).</p><p>While we tested the reliability of the scales only for moral dilemmas, they can also be applied in other contexts where rules and cost-benefit reasoning are in conflict. This includes situations where one decides whether to break the law and situations where one chooses between relying on a heuristic decision process and an explicit cost-benefit analysis. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve the measurement of decision processes across a variety of areas in psychology. While we cannot think of a good reason why the factor structure or the reliability of the scales should change in a related domain, researchers could easily re-establish the measure's theoretic properties in a new domain by rerunning our confirmatory factor analysis on data from a different context.</p><p>In conclusion, our novel scales provide a robust tool for accurately measuring important facets of the decision processes individuals employ in moral dilemmas and beyond. We are hopeful that the application of these findings will facilitate scientific progress on these crucial topics.</p></div>

The dependent variable was coded so that higher values on the predictor indicate a higher probability of choosing the CBR-based option.We found that only reliance on rules and reliance on CBR were predictive of choices in a model including all six scales. This raises the question of whether the other scales MORAL DECISION-MAKING SCALES 28 simply do not predict behaviour well, or whether they merely do not have any incremental validity once reliance on rules and CBR are already taken into account. To answer this question, we also fitted six regression models that predicted choices from each of the six scales separately.
