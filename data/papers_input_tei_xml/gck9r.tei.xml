			<abstract>
				<p>Young people with foster care experience are often asked to provide input on policy, legislative, and research decisions at various levels of the child welfare system, indicating a shift toward centering lived experiences of service users in decision-making processes. Although vital to ethical work, current youth-adult partnership practices in the child welfare system often inappropriately engage individuals with lived experience. We highlight common values, attitudes, and practices within the child welfare system that may impede collaborative, meaningful, and effective partnerships with system-involved youth and young adults and describe subsequent harms that can occur as a result of these interactions. Finally, we provide several recommendations aimed at increasing authentic engagement and collaboration with young people with lived foster care experience.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The Foster Care Independence Act (1999) assists U.S. states in decreasing barriers faced by youth in and from foster care in their transition to adulthood through added funding and resources. As a requirement for funding, states are mandated to incorporate young people's perspectives in decision-making processes, a move intended to facilitate increased youth-adult partnerships in the planning, designing, and implementation of a variety of topics within the child welfare system (Administration for Children and Families <ref type="bibr">[ACF]</ref>, 2022). Agencies and organizations often seek to partner with foster youth (FY) and former foster youth <ref type="bibr">(FFY)</ref> collaboratively and ethically, with many using dimensional models that range from engagement practices that are manipulative to those where young people share equal power as partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arunkumar et al., 2018)</ref>. Traditionally, collaboration has occurred primarily through the use of youth advisory boards <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Forenza &amp; Happonen, 2016)</ref>. Through this integration, FY and FFY often identify and operate as youth or young adult advocates (YA) working to create change in the child welfare system to help others with lived foster care experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Augsberger et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Havlicek &amp; Samuels, 2018).</p><p>As <ref type="bibr">Havlicek et al. (2016b)</ref> highlight, understanding and addressing young people's experiences within the system are vital to ethical reform in the child welfare system. Yet, despite the mandate of youth involvement in child welfare practices and the subsequent widespread utilization of YA within the system, there remains a paucity of research exploring YA experiences within these youth-adult partnerships and scant literature examining the efficacy of these initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Haddad et al., 2022)</ref>. Furthermore, current practices often struggle to utilize YA appropriately even when institutions identify and reportedly endorse the use of collaborative dimensional models of youth-adult partnerships <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Forenza &amp; Havlicek, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Taft &amp; Gordon, 2013)</ref>, and there is little research exploring the discrepancies between endorsed values and the application of these values within the child welfare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arunkumar et al., 2018)</ref>. Several factors may contribute to this phenomenon, such as an institutional failure to fully understand dimensional engagement frameworks, verbal endorsement without true commitment to authentic collaboration, or a lack of careful and consistent attention to the connection between current institutional practices and adherence to dimensional models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Augsberger et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Haddad et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Author Positionality</head><p>As Ph.D. students with a variety of lived foster care experiences (youth with lived experience and a foster parent), we are passionate about centering the lived experiences of FY and FFY in all areas impacting them, including casework, policy work, academia, legislation, and beyond. Collectively, we have spent thousands of hours advocating for change in the child welfare system, meeting with FY and FFY advocates, and conducting foster care research. In doing this work, we have come to recognize the continuum of harms youth experience when engaging in advocacy efforts within this system-from unintentionally failing to prepare youth for advocacy work to intentionally tokenizing and exploiting youth to obtain outcomes that only benefit the system. In this article, we highlight current practices and possible subsequent harms of inappropriately engaging those with lived experience and provide suggestions for improving these interactions moving forward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Current Trends in Foster Youth Partnership</head><p>Within youth-adult partnerships in the child welfare system, YA are asked to share their personal stories and their perspectives on legislation, policy, direct practices, and more, and YA often report psychological and emotional benefits to participation in these types of advocacy efforts, including decreased feelings of isolation, pride in helping others, and making meaning of their experiences of trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Havlicek &amp; Samuels, 2018)</ref>. Less explored, however, are two critical issues. First are possible problematic practices occurring in these youth-adult partnerships, which could lead to significant harm to FY and FFY <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Forenza and Havlicek, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Teixeira et al., 2021)</ref>; and second are the system-level effects of how such problematic practices limit the degree of transformative and lasting changes to foster care systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rodr√≠guez &amp; Brown, 2009</ref>).</p><p>There is a continuum of harms youth can experience when engaging in advocacy efforts within youth-adult partnerships, from unintentional "missteps" <ref type="bibr">(Havlicek et al., 2016a, p.</ref> 3) to deliberate false portrayals of youth input where little to none exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lal et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Taft &amp; Gordon, 2013)</ref>. Although there may be a variety of concerning practices within these relationships, we posit that four current ways of interacting with YA contribute to reduced effectiveness of these partnerships and increased harms for YA: FFY involvement being viewed as one-sided and interventional only, FFY's contribution extending only to storytelling, a lack of purposeful professional development, and the exclusive use of few carefully selected YAs. As most advocates begin this work shortly after their transition to adulthood, they are often unprepared to assert appropriate professional and personal boundaries, thereby increasing their vulnerability for exploitation and tokenization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Partnerships Viewed Exclusively as Empowerment for Youths, Not Systems</head><p>One of the most common approaches to youth-adult partnerships is conceptualizing the working relationship solely as an intervention for YA rather than a mutually beneficial partnership <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kennedy, 2018)</ref>. These practices often lead to paternalism toward YA and a subsequent lack of value placed on YA input at all levels within the child welfare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Matthews, 2001)</ref>. When these partnerships are framed only as ways to assist YA in developing professional skills or as ways to "cultivate their voice" <ref type="bibr">(Courtney et al., 2014, p. 102</ref>) without also highlighting the benefits the system itself receives, it can lead to performative inclusion at the highest levels of the system where YA's perspectives are not valued or are simply ignored, resulting in increased trauma and burnout of YA <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lal et al., 2019</ref>).</p><p>There may be little understanding that YA have levels of expertise that can only come from lived experience or a lack of awareness of the federal mandates requiring YA involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Forenza &amp; Happonen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ozer, 2016)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">Havlicek and colleagues (2018a)</ref> evaluated the perspectives of child welfare workers and affiliates involved with a particular YA advisory board, and participants primarily focused on the benefit to youth (i.e., increasing confidence, building connections, etc.) and largely omitted any benefit to the system. Additionally, participants identified developing "motherly responses" (p. 7) toward YA, which highlights a common attitude of paternalism and infantilization toward YA. Given these attitudes, it is unsurprising that participants described their YAs as often feeling tokenized and unheard.</p><p>This type of one-sided understanding of the actual reciprocity that occurs allows child welfare professionals to boast about including youth without actually reckoning with the issues and barriers that these youths highlight, possibly because elevating these concerns might lead to a recognition that current practices are often harmful and substantial system level changes are needed, both for how youth are involved and the system overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lal et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lin, 2020)</ref>. For an already overburdened system, the prospect of committing to listening and addressing YA's concerns might be overwhelming or, perhaps, even feel impossible or futile.</p><p>These attitudes, however benevolent, may inadvertently decrease the legitimacy of YA perspectives and initiatives within the child welfare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gazit &amp; Perry-Hazan, 2020;</ref>. YA are not permitted to be professionals with lived expertise; instead, they are perpetual young people to be put on pedestals until they inevitably falter or struggle with the aftermath of their experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Salazar et al., 2016)</ref>. This can lead to questions about their ability to do the work, and at times, result in self-or other-imposed exclusion from future advocacy efforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">YA as "Storytellers" Only -Listening to Stories, without Hearing Them</head><p>At the opposite end of our proposed continuum of harms is the transactional operationalization of youth-adult partnerships as simply a way to satisfy inclusion or diversity requirements (Hipolito- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Delgado, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lac et al., 2019)</ref>, resulting in the tokenization of current and former foster youth where benefits to the system are prioritized over youth needs and priorities. Moreover, when benefits to the system are identified, they often extend only to YA storytelling for child welfare workers' morale boosts or as examples of what effective casework might lead to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bertrand &amp; Lozenski, 2023)</ref>. These realities similarly lead to the exclusion of the myriad of other things YA can offer, such as firsthand knowledge of problems, increased agency capacity, peer mentorship, training, and more <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Augsberger et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lac, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ozer et al., 2020</ref>). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS; 2021) found the use of YA as storytellers to be the most common way agencies partner with young people.</p><p>Unfortunately, instead of identifying advocates' strengths, many YA feel that child welfare agencies primarily use YA stories to reinforce their own talking points and agenda, leading to the repeated use of YA as a means to an end, resulting in feelings of tokenization and exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schoenfeld et al., 2019)</ref>. YA are harmed when they are repeatedly asked to illustrate concerns in the system by sharing intimate details of their stories as the primary mechanism of advocacy available to them, especially when these efforts do not lead to observable changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bertrand &amp; Lozenski, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">USDHHS, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>This harm can occur in multiple ways: retraumatization from sharing vulnerable details with strangers; being ill-equipped to receive feedback from affirming or jaded child welfare workers, foster parents, or other stakeholders; and decreased privacy and increased stigma as one moves from a "foster youth" identity toward a more professional role, especially within the child-welfare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Salazar et al., 2021)</ref>. When some of the most traumatic moments in FY and FFY's lives are viewed and manipulated to singularly benefit systems, young people can be intentionally or unintentionally coerced into disclosing, lest their presence be deemed unnecessary in future endeavors. As lived experience advocates, we have witnessed these dynamics firsthand.</p><p>While there are valid reasons for focusing on storytelling in some endeavors and initiatives within youth-adult partnerships, it is only one of the many ways engagement, increased capacity, and co-creation can occur. Moreover, an overemphasis on storytelling can inhibit efforts to adequately develop young advocates professionally. FY and FFY are more than their experiences in the system and have various skills, knowledge, and expertise to bring to youth-adult partnerships. When systems fail to acknowledge this, we dehumanize and categorize YAA by the worst things that have ever happened to them, thereby limiting their impact on system-wide change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Preferential Treatment of "Knighted" Youth</head><p>Despite numerous discussions about the importance of professional development for FFY, concrete instruction on how to appropriately provide professional development for FFY is lacking, which decreases the quality and consistency of development opportunities across the child welfare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hudson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Salazar et al., 2021)</ref>. This leaves child welfare agencies determining how and, more importantly, who to develop professionally, which often provides YAs from more privileged backgrounds greater opportunities for professional development because they are "naturally" good at professionalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nalani, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">USDHHS, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020)</ref>. That is, these youth often possess the background skills and knowledge needed to engage in professional spaces or are considered "easier" to engage with <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gazit &amp; Perry-Hazan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kri≈æ &amp; Roundtree-Swain, 2017)</ref>. For example, the child welfare specialists in Havlicek and Samuels' (2016a) study endorsed providing the most professional development opportunities to youth advisory board leaders, suggesting potential disparities in the accessibility or level of commitment for every young person interested in advocacy or those who may be interested if given a chance. Besides the clear inequity in this approach, it can also result in relegating the most marginalized YA to storytelling roles only, which may lead to greater marginalization and alienation of these youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lal et al., 2019)</ref>. Ultimately, this approach creates greater disparities between the most privileged FY and FFY and those with the least privilege <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bertrand &amp; Lozenski, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Even when these youth are utilized, they are often asked to share their stories without proper training, preparation, and debriefing, which can lead to oversharing or accidentally offending stakeholders in power positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nalani, 2021)</ref>, ultimately harming YA personally and professionally. Additionally, even when 'successful' in these endeavors, youths who share more than they truly feel comfortable disclosing may face negative emotional impacts, even if not in the short term (USDHHS, 2021). As a result, these YAs who do not possess the background skills and knowledge to engage in these spaces in the expected manner end up being excluded from further professional development and advocacy opportunities, leaving gaps in experience and further difficulties in recruiting and retaining FY and FFY (Hipolito- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Delgado, 2023)</ref>. This often leads to an overreliance on a few FFY, likely those with the most privilege, to speak for all young people from foster care. This is paradoxical as those who need the most professional development assistance are not receiving it because they cannot reciprocally benefit the system in the ways that others, in the eyes of child welfare, can. Not only does this harm these YA, but it also delegitimizes the perspectives of the few young people repeatedly chosen for advocacy initiatives since they are not truly representative of the experiences of most FY or FFY <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lal et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In our collective experience, this act of "knighting" certain youth to elite statuses can also negatively impact the "chosen ones." Placing one on a pedestal means the fall will be harder and more pronounced. When the chosen youths fail, even once, they are often cast aside, left with the knowledge that they once "mattered," but due to their own failures, they no longer do. This embedded shame component that is, perhaps unintentionally, perpetuated by the child welfare system, needs further exploration and analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and Steps Forward</head><p>It is important to remember that most of these practices do not necessarily result from malicious intentions but rather a possible subconscious bias toward FY and FFY, the legal and administrative designs of child welfare systems, and a lack of resources detailing specific solutions to these problems or sustainable ways of engaging in these interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Salazar et al., 2021</ref>). Furthermore, this speaks to how implicit biases might function in deleterious ways when discretion without critical system introspection is the norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Haapanen &amp; Christens, 2021)</ref>. When resources are scant, time is lacking, and a system is overloaded, discretion about how and who to collaborate with can directly oppose equity efforts (World Health Organization, 2020). However, in child welfare, those acts of discretion shape the lives of the individuals impacted by themmaking implicit bias even more of a pressing issue in child welfare than in other workplaces without similar life-or-death stakes.</p><p>Although tokenism and exploitation are frequently discussed in the context of youth-adult relationships, relatively few resources offer sustainable ways to interact with YA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Augsberger et al., 2023)</ref>. More specifically, most resources fail to offer specific solutions to the issues raised in this paper. For example, USDHHS (2021) developed guidelines on partnering with individuals with lived experience, providing broad recommendations, such as fairly compensating YA or intentionally engaging young people from marginalized backgrounds. However, they do not offer many concrete or actionable items agencies can use. Perhaps the differing needs of various agencies across the country prohibit greater specificity; however, we argue that more specific action steps could be helpful for individuals and agencies interested in ethically implementing these broader goals.</p><p>Among other suggestions, the USDHHS highlights the importance of clear expectations, trauma-informed interactions, and collaboration from the start of any project with FY and FFY.</p><p>They also emphasize that youth and families engaged in this work should be paid for their time rather than expected to feel content with a simple invitation to the table. Additionally, the guidelines highlight how people with lived expertise can co-collaborate in all areas of practice, research, advocacy, and evaluation. These strategies reject the paternalism and prescriptive nature of previous engagement-truly working towards youth and family-led collaboration efforts, and we agree with these recommendations.</p><p>In addition to these practices, we agree with researchers such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Salazar et al. (2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Teixeira et al. (2021)</ref> who recommend child welfare agencies engage in critical self-reflection about the ways they currently partner with YA to identify any barriers that are impeding or limiting effective partnerships with young people with lived foster care experience. As stated previously, the use of youth storytelling as the primary advocacy tool is among the most common barriers to effective engagement. When this is the case, it could be helpful to identify possible barriers or factors contributing to this, such as an agency culture that does not value input from young people, YA lacking the necessary professional skills, difficulties recruiting and retaining FY and FFY, etc. Solutions or recommended next steps will be determined by the perceived reason for this limited scope of engagement with young people and the specific needs and goals of various agencies. As an example, if agency culture impedes ethical partnerships with young people, initiatives that target misinformation about youth-adult partnerships or educational sessions providing information and evidence about the utility and capacity building that can result from these partnerships could be beneficial in moving the agency to a more youthfriendly culture.</p><p>Alternatively, if limited or ineffective youth engagement is the result of too few advocates or low capacity of currently involved YA, an evaluation of current recruitment and retainment practices may be helpful <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nalani et al., 2021)</ref>. Agencies will differ in their specific approach to recruitment, but we discuss two pathways that may increase engagement and include specific recommendations for each. First, if an agency has particular difficulty retaining or maintaining engagement of currently involved YA, we recommend facilitating conversations with these young people, individually or as a group, about their perceptions and experiences within the youth-adult partnerships, which will likely highlight key areas that should be investigated and addressed within the child welfare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arunkumar et al., 2018)</ref>. More specifically, we recommend having conversations about YA perceptions of their roles within the partnership and, more importantly, whether they are satisfied with the current dynamic and what, if anything, they would like to see changed. Eliciting YA motivations and reasons for engaging in foster care advocacy could provide rich information about what is important to them and ultimately provide agencies with vital information to implement targeted engagement efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Salazar et al., 2021)</ref>. For example, many YA report two primary motivations for foster care advocacy including relational or community aspects of advocacy and desires to make a difference in the lives of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gazit &amp; Perry-Hazan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moensted &amp; Buus, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, deliberate efforts to increase opportunities for connection and bonding between YA through community events or ongoing conversations about the importance and impact of their work might lead to higher engagement for youth who endorse these motivations. Actively inviting YA to actively engage with efforts to provide feedback and suggestions about the youthadult partnerships can also be instrumental in identifying solutions to low recruitment or retainment within a particular agency. Most broadly, flexibility and openness are critical components of engaging retaining YA, especially those from highly marginalized backgrounds.</p><p>Research suggests that YA appreciate flexible recruitment practices and differing participation opportunities within advocacy groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arunkumar et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gazit and Perry-Hazan, 2020)</ref>. In particular, participants in a study conducted by Gazit and Perry-Hazan (2020) noted that they were able to participate in ways that fit their unique abilities and goals because there was no hierarchy of youth based on their specific skillset or type of advocacy they engaged in. It may also be helpful to explicitly discuss personal and professional goals of currently involved YA and facilitate deliberate and ongoing discussions about how engagement in foster care advocacy could help them meet these goals. YA report that receiving sufficient training and information about advocacy initiatives are important components of effective partnership with youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gazit &amp; Perry-Hazan, 2020)</ref>. A discussion of YA goals may also provide insight into current gaps in professional development opportunities and trainings offered to YA, which highlights another important consideration related to retaining youth.</p><p>We previously provided recommendations for increasing the number of youth partnering with an agency, but consideration should also be given to increasing the capacity of YA; that is, increasing vital skills, knowledge, and opportunities required to heighten the impact of YA advocacy efforts and even provide YA with new opportunities. In particular, we recommend youth-serving agencies develop targeted and developmentally appropriate training programs to assist FY and FFY from a variety of backgrounds in developing advocacy and professional development skills (e.g., understanding professional norms within the system, conflict resolution and communication skills, strategic sharing, etc.). Moreover, partnering with older or more experienced YA to mentor and provide training to newer YA can increase training capacity and youth buy-in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Henson et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Salazar et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The second pathway previously mentioned includes recruitment of uninvolved FY and FFY, which could be addressed in myriad ways depending on the specific needs and culture of the youth and agency involved; therefore, we do not offer specific suggestions for recruitment efforts other than highlighting that retainment efforts can also be useful for recruitment (e.g., facilitating community, offering professional development opportunities, etc.). We do, however, suggest agencies carefully consider agency culture, attitudes, and behaviors related to values and engagement intentions with FY and FFY from a variety of backgrounds and developmental levels. An unwillingness or inability to partner with diverse young people often contributes to fewer young people considered available for youth-adult partnerships, therefore lowering the capacity and effectiveness of these partnerships. Possible indications of this include, but are not limited to, primarily recruiting college-bound FY and FFY, refusing to partner with youth deemed "inappropriate" for advocacy, blacklisting particular youth whom agencies perceive to have "messed up" in previous advocacy efforts, and an overreliance on a select number of YA.</p><p>We suggest systems take inventory of ways agencies may be ill-equipped to serve youth and alumni that do not automatically "fall in line" with standard professional value systems and norms, such as young people who have differing cultural norms and values than a particular agency or FY and FFY who experience difficulties related to interpersonal functioning. This will likely differ between specific programs, but attention should be given to how young people are recruited (i.e., Are recruitment efforts primarily targeted to FY/FFY receiving college funding from the independent living program? Do you invite the same individuals back again and again?</p><p>Are there YA who are not allowed to advocate anymore?). Many argue that true consideration of youth voice and efforts to share decision-making power with youth are fundamental rights of youth, especially those for whom the state has assumed custody and responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Delgado et al., 2023)</ref>. Moreover, we posit that agencies can partner with FY and FFY of all abilities and backgrounds if appropriate and comprehensive procedures are in place to offer sufficient support and training for youth with higher needs, such as additional coaching on strategic sharing or effective communication skills. We acknowledge that some might consider this an unrealistic goal. While there may be times that any shared decision-making or partnership with a particular youth is truly impossible given extreme and unusual circumstances (e.g., a comatose youth), we argue that the child welfare system has an obligation to make diligent efforts to find new and creative ways to partner with those in their care. While there has been limited exploration and implementation of innovative ways to partner with FY and FFY with higher needs, this does not imply that these endeavors are unrealistic or unfeasible. For example, Arunkumar and colleagues (2018) describe a framework where youth-adult partnerships are conceptualized as a flexible and dynamic rope ladder where youth and adults work to create new partnership and advocacy opportunities tailored to a youth's specific abilities, needs, availability, etc. rather than typical prescriptive and hierarchical views of youth engagement and participation. Offering training and professional development opportunities to all YA rather than simply focusing on a select few will decrease common disparities between the commonly used YA and those who may have been unintentionally or even intentionally excluded from youth-adult partnerships.</p><p>Finally, we encourage the system as a whole and individual agencies to identify possible ways they may have a role in facilitating or perpetrating inequities or harms that occur when partnering with FY and FFY and subsequently work to identify and address attitudes or practices contributing to this, particularly related to partnerships with FY and FFY from more marginalized backgrounds. Attention to staff-specific factors on the individual level is also important to consider. Research suggests effective youth-adult partnerships work best when adult partners operate from a strengths-based perspective and have the institutional support and flexibility to effectively engage with young people <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nalani et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, efforts targeting employee attitudes and increasing support could be an important factor in facilitating more effective youth-adult partnerships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>At a system-wide level, improving practices of engaging with YA can have significant consequences for meaningful change to child welfare systems. We believe that these practices create a system that limits not only ethical engagement and professional development of FY and FFY, but also limits the degree to which systems can transform to be more equitable, just, and effective for youth and families, even impeding possible positive outcomes for related institutions and even society as a whole. This work is iterative and ongoing. However, perhaps even as this paper suggests, those of us with lived expertise have more to offer than our stories.</p><p>As a collective, FFY are foster and adoptive parents, child welfare specialists, students, teachers, consultants, writers, researchers, and so much more.</p><p>As FFY who were "knighted," we feel extraordinarily lucky to have received support and opportunities to develop as professionals; however, we strongly believe that luck should not be a factor related to children and families receiving ethical support and engagement from the systems designed to serve them. YA who were not "knighted" have just as much to offer as those given preferential treatment, if and when they are given a chance. A concerted effort to equitably engage and mentor YA from marginalized backgrounds and provide diverse partnership opportunities to all YA may significantly decrease harms perpetrated by the system as well as increase engagement with YA and agency capacity. Thus, as luck still matters, years after we aged out, years after we have fought, advocated, and researched-we will continue to work to support and lift up others with lived experience who want to join in efforts to drastically change the child welfare system. Who can do it better than those who have lived it?</p></div>		</body>
