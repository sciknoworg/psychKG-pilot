			<abstract>
				<p>Adolescence is a time of pronounced cognitive, neural, and social change. Adolescents are prone to social influence from peers, with implications for development, both adaptive and maladaptive. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms of this influence, as well as their neuro-developmental correlates and real-life social consequences are poorly understood. Here, we replicate a crosssectional effect of more susceptibility to peer influence in adolescents in a large dataset of 14 to 24 years old. Crucially, we extend this finding by adopting a longitudinal perspective, showing that a within-person susceptibility to social influence decreases over a 1.5 years follow-up time period. Exploiting this longitudinal design, we show that susceptibility to social influences at baseline predicts an improvement in peer relations over the follow-up period. Using a Bayesian computational model, we provide novel mechanistic insight into these effects, showing that in younger adolescents a greater tendency to adopt others&apos; preferences arises out of a higher uncertainty about their own preferences (a phenomenon called &apos;taste uncertainty&apos;). This taste uncertainty decreases over time and, in turn, leads to a reduced susceptibility of one&apos;s own behaviour to an influence from others&apos;. Neurodevelopmentally, we show that a measure of myelination within medial prefrontal cortex, estimated at baseline, predicts a developmental decrease in taste uncertainty at follow up. Thus, using computational and neural evidence, we reveal adaptive mechanisms underpinning susceptibility to social influence during adolescence.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p>Adolescents are particularly susceptible to peer influences, and this can lead to maladaptive behaviours such as binge-drinking or unprotected sexual intercourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>, often linked to impulsivity. Assessing impulsivity with a measure of temporal discounting in a large longitudinal study, we show that younger teenagers are more susceptible to social influence. However, this susceptibility to social influence is not associated with maladaptive real-life behaviours, but instead predicts an increase in quality of real-life social relations. Using computational modelling, we identify a mechanism underlying this higher susceptibility to social influence: younger adolescents' higher uncertainty about what they like drives them to adopt peers' behaviour more strongly. As they grow older, such 'taste uncertainty' decreases, diminishing this susceptibility to social influence. At a neural level, a measure of myelination within the medial prefrontal cortex predicted the observed developmental decrease in taste uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Across many species adolescence is a key period for social development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Animal and human studies suggest social interactions are more salient for adolescents than for adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Adolescence is also a period of enhanced susceptibility to peer influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, an effect which remains highly relevant in the digital age, where adolescents are increasingly exposed to a range of social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Higher susceptibility to social influence is traditionally thought to have particular relevance for the emergence of psychopathology and health damaging real-life behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Thus, adolescents smoke and drink more alcohol when in the presence of peers, and peers' substance consumption is a predictor of a teenager's own substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</p><p>The prevalence of suicidal and self-injury behaviours, as well as unprotected sexual intercourse, are often related to a social contagion effect during adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. However, the directionality of such associations is not clear and alternative accounts frame susceptibility to social influence during adolescence in a less maladaptive context.</p><p>It is important to recognise that social influence can change behaviour for the better, an effect widely used for adaptive ends both in education and psychotherapy.</p><p>Susceptibility to peer influence can be associated with higher psychosocial functioning in young adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, while an enhanced impact of social influence is observed in neuro-typically developing, but not autistic, teenagers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. These findings suggest that a higher tendency to integrate social influence into one's own decisions might be an adaptive ingredient in healthy social development during adolescence, a period of life characterised by a shift in social orientation away from the parents towards one's peer group.</p><p>Although peer influences on decision-making during adolescence have been widely investigated, several important questions remain unanswered. Firstly, claims on social susceptibility and its real life consequences in adolescents mostly rely on crosssectional designs and modest sample sizes. Here, we applied a longitudinal design in a large cohort of adolescents and young adults to study peer influence on a well characterised task measuring delay discountinga key measure of temporal impulsivity relevant for development and psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. Longitudinal designs are important for addressing developmental questions as they provide a basis for disentangling cohort or sampling effects from developmental trajectories. We show that social susceptibility not only decreases with age cross-sectionally, but also longitudinally. Longitudinally, we demonstrate that susceptibility to peer influence at baseline predicts the quality of peer relationships over follow-up, highlighting an important adaptive role of social susceptibility in healthy adolescents.</p><p>Secondly, though previous studies have established higher conformity towards peers in adolescents than in adults, it remains unclear why this is the case. The adult conformity literature suggests two distinct routes towards conformity, namely informational influences ('copy-when-uncertain', observing others to gain information regarding behaviours that are currently adaptive) and normative influences (adhering to social norms / expectations of the other, bringing direct benefits through belonging, social tension reduction and acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. Many findings on peer influence in adolescent psychology are implicitly interpreted within the framework of normative influence, suggesting the pursuit of social acceptance and sensitivity towards social evaluation by peers is a significant determinant of adolescent decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>. Here, we tested an alternative hypothesis, namely that informational influences underlie higher conformity in adolescence. To this end, we built on our previously validated (Bayesian) probabilistic reasoning model (25) that describes conformity as a learning effect. In brief, If people are uncertain about exactly what to like ('taste uncertainty'(26)), they can learn about what tastes to adopt by adopting the tastes of their peers'. Using this model, we show that such taste uncertainty decreases both with age and over the course of our longitudinal follow-up, and longitudinal change is strongest in the youngest of our sample. Crucially, both cross-sectional and longitudinal developmental effects on social susceptibility are explained by developmental changes in taste uncertainty, suggesting that higher taste uncertainty in younger adolescents is a key mechanism facilitating peer influence in teenagers.</p><p>Thirdly, we were interested in the co-development of brain structures that are relevant for the expression of taste uncertainty. We previously found the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediating the influence of others' preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Building on this, and using novel in-vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer MRI (28), we identify a myelin marker in medial prefrontal cortex that predicts a developmental decrease in taste uncertainty over our longitudinal follow-up period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To probe a susceptibility to social influence, we used a social version of a delay discounting task ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>). In short, this task allows us to measures a person's temporal discounting coefficient (how much less a future reward is worth, depending on the delay of its delivery) as well as changes in their discount function pre vs. post learning about someone else's discount preferences (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>, Supplementary Methods and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref> for details). Here, we defined susceptibility to social influence as the degree of change in one's own discount rate towards the preference of a social partner, following exposure to the preferences of a social partner. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. Social Delay Discounting Task. A) Example trial for "self" and "other" trial types. In self trials, participants see an offer of a smaller amount of money they can receive on the same day or a larger amount of money they can receive after a variable delay period. Subjects were instructed to indicate their preference according to their true personal taste and, to enforce expression of true preferences, they were told that one trial would be chosen at random to determine their pay out. In "other" trials, subjects chose between the smaller, immediate and the larger, delayed option on behalf of another person, and received feedback on these choice thereby enabling them to learn the others' delay discounting preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of susceptibility to social influence</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-sectional baseline age effects</head><p>At baseline, we observed a significant negative association between social susceptibility (indexed as the change in discount rate upon learning about the discount rate of another agent) and age, such that social influence declined with age (r=-.10, df=782, t=-2.94, p=.003, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2a</ref>). Age explained about 1% of the variance in social susceptibility. Though this is significant, it is substantially lower than what has been observed in previous reports, as is often the case with larger, rigorously controlled, replication studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Longitudinal analysis</head><p>We tested whether social susceptibility also changed intra-individually, within the 1.5 years follow-up period. Indeed, a factor time (baseline vs. follow-up) significantly predicted social susceptibility in a linear mixed effects model (F(1, 566.64)=5.11, p=.02), along with baseline age. Social susceptibility decreased intra-individually over the 1.5 years follow-up period. The interaction of baseline age with time was not nominally significant (F(1,568.31)=3.78, p=.05). Although not nominally significant, suggests that intra-individual change in susceptibility was most pronounced in the youngest subgroup of the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Retest Subsample -Testing for training vs. developmental effects in a 6-month follow up subsample of participants</head><p>To determine whether the observed longitudinal differences were predominantly due to retest effects or development, we examined a sample of participants who were also tested 6 months apart ('short follow-up', judged to be a short time with respect to maturation). This comprised a sub-sample of n=55 of the total group who came to the lab three times (baseline, 6-month 'short' follow-up, 1.5-years 'long' follow-up), in the same manner as per our main sample (see Methods). Repeating the same analysis of longitudinal effects on social susceptibility in this short follow-up sample, we observed a significant effect of time point (baseline, short follow-up, long follow-up) on social susceptibility (F(2,104.926)=6.87, p=.002). Post-hoc analysis showed that susceptibility decreased significantly over the 18-month period (t=3.47, p&lt;.001), and between and 18 month of follow-up (t=2.88, p=.005), but critically did not do so over the 6-month period from baseline (t=.59, p=.56). This pattern does not support a mere training effect, as if this was the case we would expect a stronger change after 6 months than after months. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship with the development of psychosocial functioning</head><p>In previous work, we observed a positive association of susceptibility to peer influence and sociability in a smaller cross-sectional study, including young adolescents(8).</p><p>Here we tested for this association again, including in a longitudinal manner, in our larger dataset. We used a bivariate latent change score model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> to test for a codevelopment of social susceptibility and quality of peer relationships, as measured by the Cambridge Friendship Questionnaire (CFQ(32, 33)) The model showed that the perceived quality of peer relations increased from baseline to long follow-up (significant intercept of the latent CFQ change score: z=2.28, p=.022, standardised estimate=.09). There was no significant covariation of social susceptibility and peer relations at baseline (z=-.77, p=.44, standardised beta=.03). However, the latentchange model revealed a small, but significant, positive association between social susceptibility at baseline on rate of change in peer relation development from baseline to long follow-up. In effect, those who showed a higher tendency to shift their preferences towards their partners' also reported larger gains in social integration from baseline to long follow-up (z=2.12, p=.03, standardised beta=.08).</p><p>Previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref> show that developmental effects on social susceptibility might be particularly pronounced in younger teenagers. Thus, we repeated the path analysis separately on age specific subsamples of our main sample, namely a younger (participants who were &lt; 18 at both baseline and long follow-up, n=116) and an older (participants who were adults, i.e. ≥ 18 years old, at both measurement time points, n=248) subsample. Comparing this model to a model where the path of interest (social susceptibility at baseline → quality change in peer relations at long follow-up) was constrained to be equal between the younger and older subsample, revealed a significant advantage of fitting an age-dependent sub-group-specific parameters (Log likelihood Ratio Test, Δχ 2 =6.20, Δdf=1, p=.01). This indicates differences in a younger vs. older subgroup regarding the degree to which social susceptibility at baseline influences real life social development.</p><p>Analysing the path of interest separately for the younger (&lt;18 years) and older (≥18 years) subgroup revealed a significant effect of social susceptibility on social development in the adolescent (&lt;18 years) group alone (z=2.31, standardised beta=.23, p=.02, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>), whereas there was no significant coupling of social susceptibility on social development in the young adult (&lt;18 years) group (z=-.06, beta=.003, p=.96). This suggests that greater susceptibility to social influence earlier in adolescence might be an important factor affecting development of integrative social relationships as we grow up. Subsequently, we repeated the structural equation model to analyse an association with selected maladaptive traits, which had been discussed in the context of delay discounting and peer influence in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, namely externalising behaviours, and alcohol consumption, both assessed using the behaviours checklist questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. In neither of these models did we find an association of social susceptibility with maladaptive behaviours (all standardised betas ≤|.11|, all zs≤|1.27|, all ps&gt;.203). One reason for conformity is informational influence, whereby humans use observational information to reduce uncertainty about what to like, even if, as in our task, this does not produce immediate material benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. We tested the hypothesis that the observed developmental reductions on social susceptibility occur as a consequence of developmentally decreasing uncertainty about own preferences ("taste uncertainty"). Thus, in a next step, we used a previously validated formal computational model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> to estimate an individual 'taste uncertainty' parameter (see supplementary results for effects of other parameters of the model). This allowed us to test for developmental effects on taste uncertainty and whether this accounts for the observed susceptibility to social influence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modelling: Developmental Effects on taste uncertainty</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Taste uncertainty predicts susceptibility to social influences</head><p>Taste uncertainty was significantly associated with social shift at both measurement time points, consistent with an informational account of conformity (all r&gt;.50, all t&gt;15.57, all ps&lt;2.2e-16, see S- <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-sectional baseline age effects</head><p>At baseline, taste uncertainty negatively correlated with age (r=-.16, t=-4.56, df=780</p><p>p=5.869e-05, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Longitudinal Analysis</head><p>A linear mixed effects model revealed a significant effect of baseline age  In line with findings in our main study sample, we observed a significant effect of time on taste uncertainty (F(1,105.29)=3.57, p=.032) in the 'short follow-up' subsample.</p><p>Post-hoc inspection revealed that taste uncertainty decreased within-person over the three measurement time points in the reduced subsample. Post hoc tests showed that a contrast of first and last (1.5 years follow-up) time points was significant (t=2.670, p=.009), whereas the change between first and 6-month follow-up was not (t=1.23, p=.220). This pattern of findings is inconsistent with changes being due to a mere training effect, as we would expect stronger change after 6 compared to 18 months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation analyses: Taste uncertainty explains developmental effects of social susceptibility</head><p>Our computational model of social shifts posits a specific mechanism by which social influence arises, namely a reduction in one's own taste uncertainty by learning how someone else performs a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. As taste uncertainty declines with age, and decreases longitudinally within person, this raises a possibility that age-related changes in social susceptibility (as found here and in previous studies) is driven by the age-related change in taste uncertainty. To test this, we first set up a model where we tested a possible mediation of the cross-sectional age effects on preference shift by taste uncertainty on baseline (baseline) data. We found that an effect of age on preference shift was accounted for by the mediating effect of taste uncertainty, corresponding to a significant full mediation (significant proportion of mediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>: estimate=.72, z=3.03, p=.002, <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). That is, the significant age effects on social susceptibility, as found here and in many previous studies, are, in this study, explained by age effects on taste uncertainty.</p><p>In a next step, we examined the covariation of longitudinal change in taste uncertainty with longitudinal change in social susceptibility, using latent change score modelling.</p><p>To do so, we changed the autoregressive and coupling effects to co-variances, to display and model the unconditional change scores. We observed a significant covariation of rates of change in both parameters (raw beta=. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref>   Finally, using computational modelling, we provide a mechanistic account for the frequent previous observation of adolescents being more prone to peer influence than adults (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>  In our structural brain imaging analysis, we uncovered a neural correlate of taste uncertainty. Using the same social delay discounting task, during functional imaging,we have shown that mPFC expresses neuronal plasticity that predicts preference malleability <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Myelin maturation unfolds throughout adolescence and into young adulthood and is a key mechanism underlying neuronal plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>.</p><p>This motivated an hypothesis that a marker of myelin in the mPFC would relate to developmental effects on taste uncertainty. Indeed, we found that baseline MT in this region was predictive of a greater reduction in taste uncertainty over time. In contrast, baseline taste uncertainty did not predict changes in MT, and there was no association between the rates of change in both measures. This suggests that the observed longitudinal reduction in taste uncertainty over time is accelerated when myelin in the mPFC is at a more mature absolute level, underscoring the importance of brain structural maturation in cognitive development during adolescence. This is consistent with myelination specifically being a key neuro-developmental process relating to important dispositional differences in this period of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, the effect size of the developmental effects on susceptibility to social influence was lower than previously reported in theoretical accounts and lower sample size studies. This is consistent with reports on large-scale replication efforts of original findings in psychological science in bigger sample sizes, which reported only effect sizes on average of ½ the originally reported effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. On the one hand, it highlights the need for larger sample sizes and replication in order to estimate meaningful effect sizes in the field of developmental psychology. It may, however, also be dependent on precise methodological details and the specific demographics of our sample, e.g., on the fact that our sample did not include very young adolescents for whom strong susceptibility effects have been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>. Our findings stress the importance of longitudinal designs for developmental psychology.

In short, we adopt a Bayesian approach to model a change in belief in one's own delay discounting preferences as a function of I) "taste uncertainty" (as reflected in a participants' choice variability), that is how uncertain a person is about their own preferences in the delay discounting task prior to any social exposure in the task and ii) relevance of the social influence source. The model describes that subjects hold a Gaussian belief distribution over their log-discounting coefficient (they are uncertain about their discounting preferences). In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> we found based on model selection that decision variability during the task was best described as reflecting uncertainty about discounting preference, as opposed to decision noise added after evaluation (as, for example, in the softmax rule).

The task consisted of three phases. In phase 1, participants played trials of a temporal discounting task where they had to decide whether to choose between a smaller amount of money paid out immediately or a larger amount paid out at an indicated time in the future. Phase 1 decisions were used to determine their initial value kphase1 in a standard hyperbolic discounting model (51):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= 1 +</formula><p>where is the delay-discounted value of a reward, R is the reward, D is the delay, and K is the hyperbolic discounting parameter. In phase 2, a second player was introduced. Participants were instructed to make choices in the same delay discounting task for the other player so as to learn the discounting preferences of the other. This preference of the other person was based on the baseline preference of our participant. In a between-subjects manner, the observee's delay discounting preferences was manipulated such that the other was chosen to be either more or less patient than the participant himself. More specifically, in 2/3 of the cases, the observee was chosen to have kother shifted from kself_phase1 by one standard deviation towards the mean of the population distribution, and in 1/3 of cases away from it (in log space). Participants received feedback as to whether their choice on behalf of the other was correct in terms of the other's discounting preference.</p><p>where correct choices were defined using a simulation of the other's choice based on their discounting preference. In case the participant's response matched the simulation's prediction, the choice was coded as correct. These "learning about the other" trials were presented until either the participant got correct answers out of the most recent 10, or until 60 learning trials were completed.</p><p>In phase 3, we interleaved mini-blocks of 10 trials 'choose for self', which were as in phase 1, and 10 trials 'choose for other', in order to keep the other's discounting preference. This allowed us to estimate social shift scores (log kself_phase3log kself_phase1) that evaluate a change in delay discounting preference pre-vs. post learning about the other, and thus inter-individual differences in susceptibility to social influence.</p><p>We informed participants that one of the 'choose for self' trials from the entire task would be chosen at random and the choice they made paid out for real at the appropriate delay. Participants were instructed that there was no financial incentive to make correct choices in the 'choose for other' trials. The task was programmed in MATLAB 2012a using the Cogent graphics toolbox (http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/Cogent/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Modeling</head><p>The model assumes that both the subject and the social partner come from the same reference distribution ( , 2 ), the width of which describes the relevance of the other and is a fitted parameter of the model (see supplementary results). By observing the preference choice data of the other, dO, subjects can update their own preference belief distribution ( ) in light of what they learn about the other. In this Bayesian formulation, the more uncertain subjects are about their preferences, the more they shift after learning about others. Thus, this model formalizes the notion of informational conformity, namely conforming with others to reduce one's own uncertainty. Please refer to (25) for the algorithmic implementation. In this previous model validation study, we found that participants' behaviour showed evidence for taste 'shifting' correlated to their baseline decision variability, as would be expected if the latter represented uncertainty, upon which Bayesian updating then operated <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p></div>

Future studies should investigate the ecological selection of influencers and modulation of taste shift, as a function of the quality of earlier development. Bayesian modelling can then dissect the cognitive process of healthy social adaptation, a key requirement of adolescent development, as opposed to the maladaptive influence of undesirable role models.</figDesc></figure>

Mediation results: T1 data The direct path c', namely the age effect on preference shift after accounting for the mediation, was not significant. The proportion of total variance explained by the mediation effect was significant. Thus, the age effect on social susceptibility at baseline was accounted for by taste uncertainty. See table 1 for the full set of parameter estimates including standardised an unstandardised betas. B) In line with our assumption that development of social susceptibility is accounted for by development of taste uncertainty, the bivariate latent change score model not only showed a significant covariation of taste uncertainty with social susceptibility at T1, but also significant covariation of the rate of change in both domains. The full set of parameter estimates is included in supplementary table 3.To establish whether there is a structural neural correlate for developmental effects on taste uncertainty, we used bivariate latent change score modelling testing for the codevelopment of cognitive and brain structural development in a subsample of subjects who underwent both our experimental sessions (baseline and 18 months) and structural MRI (n=186, see Methods). Here, we focussed on myelination, given its pivotal role in adolescent brain development, and building on recent findings on its association with trait measures in adolescent development<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. In a similar discounting task, utilizing repetition-suppression to assess neural plasticity, we previously showed that medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is the principal region expressing within-task plasticity as preferences shift<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. See supplementary methods for pre-processing of the MRI data.Using an anatomically defined mPFC mask (based on the Harvard-Oxford atlas, see SI), we extracted estimates of a myelin-sensitive marker, Magnetisation Transfer saturation (MT). This allowed us to investigate a cross-domain coupling that captures the extent to which change in one domain is a function of the starting level in the other using latent change score modelling (model fit indices: pChi2=.22, CFI=.96, RMSEA=.04, SRMR=.03). Sex, age, scanning site and general IQ were included in the analysis as covariates<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. We observed that baseline intra-cortical mPFC MT was predictive of the longitudinal change in taste uncertainty (raw beta=-3.92, standardised beta=.-13, z=-2.12, p=.03,Figure 6), i.e. more intra-cortical mPFC myelin lead to a more pronounced reduction in taste uncertainty over the 1.5 year follow-up.Taste uncertainty did not significantly predict longitudinal brain development, and there was no covariance in rates of change in both domains (all betas .10≤ all ps ≥ .13, seeS-Table 3for full output of the latent change score model). Repeating the same structural equation model using estimates of myelin in the visual cortex as a control region (model fit indices: Chi2=.38, CFI=.99, RMSEA=.02, SRMR=.03) (39), we did not observe any cross-domain coupling of our task measure with myelination across development (all beta&lt;.033, all p&gt;.51).</figDesc><table><row><cell>path</cell><cell>notation</cell><cell>est</cell><cell>se</cell><cell>z</cell><cell>p</cell><cell>lower</cell><cell>upper</cell><cell>est</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>(unst)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>CI</cell><cell>CI</cell><cell>(stand)</cell></row><row><cell>social</cell><cell>c'</cell><cell>-0.01</cell><cell cols="2">0.02 -0.86</cell><cell>0.39</cell><cell>-0.04</cell><cell>0.02</cell><cell>-0.03</cell></row><row><cell>susceptibility ~</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>age</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>social</cell><cell>b</cell><cell>0.80</cell><cell cols="3">0.07 11.82 &lt;.001</cell><cell>0.66</cell><cell>0.93</cell><cell>0.50</cell></row><row><cell>susceptibility ~</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>taste uncertainty</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>taste uncertainty ~</cell><cell>a</cell><cell>-0.05</cell><cell cols="2">0.01 -4.37</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell><cell>-0.06</cell><cell>-0.02</cell><cell>-0.15</cell></row><row><cell>age</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>indirect</cell><cell>a*b</cell><cell>-0.04</cell><cell cols="2">0.01 -4.08</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell><cell>-0.05</cell><cell>-0.02</cell><cell>-0.08</cell></row><row><cell>(mediation) path</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>total</cell><cell>c'+(a*b)</cell><cell>-0.05</cell><cell cols="2">0.02 -2.71</cell><cell>.007</cell><cell>-0.08</cell><cell>-0.01</cell><cell>-0.11</cell></row><row><cell>proportion</cell><cell>indirect/tot</cell><cell>.72</cell><cell>.24</cell><cell>3.03</cell><cell>.002</cell><cell>.255</cell><cell>1.19</cell><cell>0.72</cell></row><row><cell>mediated</cell><cell>al</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

B) Higher values of the mPFC myelin marker at measurement timepoint 1 led to a more pronounced longitudinal change in taste uncertainty (note that a stronger longitudinal decline is coded as positive ("more change") for illustration purposes). C) Longitudinal change in Taste Uncertainty as a function of different levels of T1 myelin marker values.In adolescence, a greater susceptibility to social influence is considered a driver of maladaptive real-life behaviour (e.g. drinking, reckless driving, delinquency, suicidal behaviours)(10-13, 15, 16). Here, using a longitudinal design involving a large cohort of 14-24 year-olds, combined with quantitative brain imaging, we replicate a finding of increased social susceptibility in adolescents and characterise its neurodevelopmental and computational basis. Extending these findings, we now show that the degree of a preference shift is, in this sample of 14-24 years olds, most pronounced during younger adolescence, a developmental period characterised by significant social-affective transformations (3). Importantly, our longitudinal design allowed us for the first time to demonstrate a within-person developmental decrease in this social susceptibility. A separate analysis in a retest sample showed that these observations could not be explained by a training effect. Importantly, we found that such higher susceptibility at a younger age has an important adaptive, rather than maladaptive, role in this healthy population. Exploiting our accelerated longitudinal design<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref> 33,<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>, we demonstrate that the developmental improvements in real-life psycho-social functioning, assessed by the perceived quality of peer relations after 1.5 years, is predicted by higher susceptibility to social influence, particularly in younger teenagers. This extends cross-sectional findings in healthy younger adolescents which showed that behavioural contagion was associated with a higher degree of social functioning<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Notably, in previous accounts, susceptibility to social influence was mostly highlighted in the context of</figDesc><table><row><cell>Discussion</cell></row><row><cell>sensitivity to</cell></row><row><cell>peer influence for youth in distressed urban neighbourhoods may carry risk when a</cell></row><row><cell>teenager overgeneralizes and automatically, without mentalizing, deploys a learnt</cell></row><row><cell>response (e.g. fighting back aggressively when challenged) in a setting where it is not</cell></row><row><cell>adaptive, such as in school (41).</cell></row></table><note>). While the path indicating the mPFC myelin marker as a significant predictor of longitudinal change in taste uncertainty was significant (beta=.- 13, p=We replicate previous developmental effects on social susceptibility in the paradigmatic case of delay discounting, showing that social susceptibility decreases with age from adolescence to adulthood. We extend on this previous finding in a number of ways. Firstly, we provide longitudinal evidence for a developmental decrease in susceptibility to social influences. Secondly, we show that social susceptibility in young healthy adolescents is adaptive with respect to longitudinal improvements in peer relationships. Thirdly, we outline a cognitive and computational basis for these effects, showing that higher social susceptibility in younger adolescents is best explained by this age defined population being more uncertain about what they like, thereby rendering them more prone to adopt others' preferences. Over the course of development this 'taste uncertainty' decreases, which in turn attenuates a need, and consequential impact of, social influences on one's own behaviour. Lastly, we identify a candidate neuro-developmental correlate of this effect by showing that a myelin sensitive marker within mPFC, a key region mediating social preference shifts, predicts longitudinal change in taste uncertainty. We replicate our previous finding, from a young adult sample, showing delay discounting preferences can be systematically changed by learning about another's delay discounting preferences (27, 29).maladaptive real-life behaviours in teenagers. For example, both real-life and digital peer influence is suggested to lead to higher rates of delinquency, real-life risk-taking, unprotected sexual intercourse, substance consumption and suicidal behaviours (1, 2, 10-16, 18). In this study of healthy adolescents however, susceptibility to social influences did not relate to externalizing psychiatric symptoms or substance consumption, nor did it predict such potentially maladaptive behavioural tendencies in a longitudinal fashion. This discrepancy might suggest that the impact of higher susceptibility to peer influence in teenagers depends on the very nature of social influence, including the nature of the role models who exert this influence. Being behaviourally responsive to peers may be generally thought of as functional and predictive of resilience in the face of adversity. In our sample of relatively healthy teenagers, it indeed led to successful social adaptation in real life, a key requirement of adolescent development. However, it is equally the case that maladaptive consequences might arise if teenagers have to navigate less advantageous or unstable conditions, where they are likely to be confronted with less desirable role models. For example, as recent models of conduct problems emphasize,</note></figure>
