<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally <ref type="bibr">1</ref> , with an estimated 9.6 million cancer deaths worldwide in 2018 2 . There is increasing interest in the use of preventive therapy as part of cancer prevention and control efforts 3 . A meta-analysis of 45 observational studies found aspirin to be associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal and other digestive tract cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">4</ref> . Reviews have also examined the relationship between aspirin and cancer by synthesising the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating aspirin for vascular disease prevention. The results from these meta-analyses showed that individuals taking aspirin, versus no aspirin, had a significantly reduced 20-year risk of developing colon cancer <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , and a significantly reduced risk of colorectal cancer death at 10-20 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">6</ref> .</p><p>The US Preventive Services Taskforce recommends low-dose aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention among adults aged 50-69 who have 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">7</ref> . In the UK, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence <ref type="bibr">(NICE)</ref> recommends daily aspirin to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in people with Lynch syndrome 8 . There are several factors to consider when implementing guidelines into clinical practice, as deciding whether to use preventive therapy can be a complex choice for patients. Additionally, it is important to consider the barriers healthcare providers may experience when prescribing preventive therapy.</p><p>Studies have investigated the barriers and facilitators to using preventive therapy for breast cancer. The evidence suggests the factors associated with increased uptake of preventive therapy include having children <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">9</ref> , higher objective risk 10 , older age 10 , higher cancer-related worry <ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12</ref> , and having fewer concerns about the medication side-effects <ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> . Women with lower educational qualifications, depression and those who are older are also less likely to adhere to the medication <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . Prospective studies have also identified a positive association between healthcare provider recommendation and patients' use of breast cancer preventive therapy <ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12</ref> . To our knowledge, no review has examined decision-making in the context of aspirin for cancer prevention among potential users of aspirin and healthcare providers.</p><p>We undertook a systematic review to synthesise the quantitative and qualitative data on uptake and adherence behaviours related to aspirin for cancer prevention, investigate the factors affecting decisions to use aspirin, and examine healthcare providers' behaviour and attitudes towards implementing aspirin in clinical care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Search strategy</head><p>We first conducted a search of the literature in March 2018, and updated the searches in February 2020. Searches were conducted in the following databases from inception to February 2020: MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; DARE; NHS Economic Evaluation Database; Pan HTA Database; ProQuest Dissertation and Theses A&amp;I; and the Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched the trial registries ICTRP and Clinical trials.gov, and the websites of Cancer Research UK and cancer.gov for any ongoing trials.</p><p>After identifying relevant conference abstracts, clinical trials and dissertations, we searched for the peer-reviewed articles of these studies. Search terms were developed for the concepts: aspirin, cancer and prevention by an information specialist (RR) and project team members using subject headings and free text terms (see supplementary appendix for search strategies). We did not apply date limits or methodological filters to the searches.</p><p>We stored and de-duplicated the articles in an EndNote X9 library, and in the review management software Covidence. To find additional papers, we searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. The review was pre-registered (PROSPERO number: CRD42018093453), and PRISMA guidelines for reporting were followed throughout 15 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study selection</head><p>We included both quantitative and qualitative peer-reviewed studies, which provided empirical data and recruited individuals aged 18 or over. Only English language studies were included as we did not have the resources to translate. Studies were included if they reported rates of uptake and/or adherence to aspirin for primary or secondary prevention of cancer, and if they sampled individuals in the general population or populations at increased risk. Additionally, we included articles which reported patient, public or healthcare provider attitudes towards using aspirin for cancer prevention.</p><p>We deviated from the pre-registration by including articles reporting hospitals or healthcare providers' rates of recommending or prescribing aspirin. We also deviated by including quantitative studies exploring individuals' perceptions about taking aspirin for cancer prevention, instead of only qualitative data. Articles on the same trial were included if they provided additional data, such as adherence data at longer follow up. We excluded articles reporting adherence data on a smaller sub-sample from an included trial. Non-peer reviewed studies, reviews, and studies where aspirin was not used or prescribed for cancer prevention were excluded.</p><p>Screening of the titles and abstracts was completed by two authors (RJT, KEL), and two authors (RR, LHH) duplicated screening for 20% of articles. Discrepancies were resolved with a third reviewer (SGS). Full text articles were retrieved for all studies included after initial screening. Two authors (RJT, KEL) examined the articles against the inclusion criteria, and second reviewers (LHH, KEL) screened 20% of the articles. The review was managed in Covidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data extraction</head><p>Two authors (RJT, KEL) extracted the study data using Excel, and approximately 40% (17/42) of studies were verified by second reviewers (RR, KEL). The variables extracted included study characteristics (authors, country, study design and quality), and sample characteristics (sample size, population, age). We extracted data on aspirin dose; timing; uptake level; adherence method; adherence definitions; follow-up time; day-to-day adherence; persistence adherence; and factors associated with uptake/adherence. Additionally, we extracted data reporting individuals or healthcare providers' attitudes towards aspirin for cancer prevention, and healthcare providers' rates of recommending or prescribing aspirin in clinical practice.</p><p>Uptake rates were defined as the proportion of individuals who were offered aspirin and took the first dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">16</ref> . However, there was inconsistent reporting of uptake data in the included studies. We deviated from the pre-registration by reporting two assessments of uptake.</p><p>Uptake rates of all participants were calculated as the proportion of participants who started taking aspirin, and the denominator was the number of participants offered the opportunity to participate in the trial. Several of the included studies reported separately the number of participants who declined to participate in the trial, and the number of participants deemed ineligible to take part in the trial. The second assessment of uptake (i.e. eligible uptake) was calculated as the proportion of eligible participants who enrolled on the trial. The denominator was the number of participants offered the opportunity to take part in the trial, but participants who were reported as ineligible to take part in the study were excluded from the calculation. We classified participants who declined trial participation for unknown reasons as declining to take part.</p><p>We defined day-to-day adherence as the extent to which people took the medication as prescribed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">16</ref> . Data could be continuous (0-100% of medications) or categorical (proportion of individuals classed as adherent). We defined persistence as the length of time between uptake and last dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">16</ref> . Studies reporting the proportion of participants who completed the trial, without explicit reference to the medication, were excluded. We included both selfreport and objective measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality assessment</head><p>We used the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) to assess methodological quality 17 .</p><p>MMAT is reliable <ref type="bibr">18</ref> , and has been used in a review examining decision-making in breast cancer preventive therapy 10 . For each study design (qualitative, quantitative RCTs, nonrandomised quantitative studies, quantitative descriptive studies, mixed methods studies), there was a quality checklist consisting of 5 items. All items were categorised as 'Yes <ref type="bibr">', 'No', or 'Can't tell'.</ref> RCTs received a quality assessment score ranging from 0-4, as the criterion 'Did the participants adhere to the assigned intervention?' (2.5) was removed due to adherence being a review outcome. All other study types received a score 0-5. The MMAT guidance recommended study teams agreed on an acceptable dropout rate for the criterion 'Are there complete outcome data? <ref type="bibr">' (2.3, 3.3)</ref>. We decided a priori that an article would qualify as 'Yes' if they reported a dropout rate of ≤30% participants <ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref> . One author (KEL) assessed the quality of all articles, with over 30% of articles (14/42) verified by a second author (LHH).</p><p>Any discrepancies were resolved with a third author (SGS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synthesis of the evidence</head><p>A meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate as there was high heterogeneity, including variations in aspirin dose and assessments of adherence. Instead we conducted a narrative synthesis, with findings tabulated 20 . We organised the studies into logical categories and synthesised the findings across the included studies 20 . Where possible, comparisons were made between studies on the setting (trial vs. routine clinical practice), population (general population vs. higher risk), aspirin dose/frequency (e.g. daily vs. alternate days), and healthcare provider population (primary vs. secondary/tertiary care).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We identified 17,344 papers, of which 11,258 papers remained after duplicates were removed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). After screening titles and abstracts, we excluded 10,061 articles. We screened 1,197 full text articles, and 40 studies met the eligibility criteria. An additional two studies were identified by backwards citation searching, providing a total of 42 studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study quality</head><p>We assessed methodological quality using the MMAT <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>). A total of 25 studies were quantitative RCTs 21-45 , 12 were quantitative descriptive studies <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr">[57]</ref> , and five were quantitative non-randomised studies <ref type="bibr">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr">[62]</ref> . No qualitative studies were identified. Of the RCTs, one study (4%) scored the maximum of 4 for quality 42 , 36% (9/25) scored 3/4 <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">32,</ref><ref type="bibr">34,</ref><ref type="bibr">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">38,</ref><ref type="bibr">43</ref> , and 24% (6/25) of studies met one criterion <ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">33,</ref><ref type="bibr">37,</ref><ref type="bibr">40 . Most RCTs (20/25,</ref><ref type="bibr">80%)</ref> had comparable groups at baseline (criterion 2.2) <ref type="bibr">21-26, 28, 30-32, 34-36, 38, 39, 41-45 , and 76% (19/25)</ref> of studies had an acceptable dropout rate of ≤30% (criterion 2.3) <ref type="bibr">21, 24-27, 29-33, 35-38, 40-43, 45</ref> . Most RCTs (19/25, 76%) did not provide enough information to assess whether the randomisation was appropriate and if allocation concealment was used <ref type="bibr">21, 23-27, 29-33, 35-41, 45</ref> . Similarly, a high number (11/25, 44%) of studies did not provided information on who the outcome assessors were and if they were blinded to treatment allocation (criterion 2.4) <ref type="bibr">21, 23, 25, 27-29, 31, 37, 40, 41, 45</ref> . Higher quality assessment scores were observed for quantitative non-randomised studies.</p><p>Two studies (40%) scored 4/5 on the MMAT 58, 61 , two studies (40%) scored 3/5 <ref type="bibr">60,</ref><ref type="bibr">62</ref> , and one study (20%) scored 2/5 59 . All five non-randomised studies were classified as having appropriate measurements, with each using an objective measure of adherence (e.g. pill count, Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS)) 58-62 . Of the quantitative descriptive studies, 42% (5/12) scored 2/5 on the MMAT <ref type="bibr">48,</ref><ref type="bibr">49,</ref><ref type="bibr">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr">[54]</ref> , and 58% (7/12) scored 3/5 <ref type="bibr">46,</ref><ref type="bibr">47,</ref><ref type="bibr">50,</ref><ref type="bibr">51,</ref><ref type="bibr">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr">[57]</ref> . Lower scores were achieved on the criterion (4.2) assessing whether a representative sample was used, with only one study (8%) using stratified sampling to recruit participants representative of the target population 50 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uptake of aspirin</head><p>Four studies reported uptake rates of aspirin for the primary prevention of cancer <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">44</ref> .</p><p>Two studies were conducted in the UK <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">42</ref> , one in the US 23 , and one study was based in the UK and Canada 44 . All studies were RCTs <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">44</ref> , and of mixed quality with scores ranging from one 23 to four 42 on the MMAT. Three studies (75%) recruited participants at higher risk of developing cancer <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">44</ref> , and one (25%) recruited a healthy population sample 23 ( <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>The dose and frequency of prescribed aspirin varied, from 100mg every alternative day 23 to 325mg administered daily 44 .</p><p>Four trials reported data on uptake rates for all participants. A US study recruiting healthy participants reported the lowest uptake of aspirin (3.7%) 23 . Uptake rates were higher (13.3-44.7%) in the three studies that recruited participants at increased risk of cancer <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">44</ref> .</p><p>None of the studies compared different aspirin doses and rates of uptake, although the healthy population study reported the lowest rates of uptake and the lowest dose of aspirin 23 .</p><p>Rates of uptake among eligible participants only were higher (39.2-70.2%) <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">44</ref> . No studies examined the demographic, psychological or clinical factors associated with uptake.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adherence to aspirin</head><p>A total of 29 studies reported aspirin adherence data <ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr">[62]</ref> , and of these 83% (24/29) were RCTs <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">22,</ref> .

Day-to-day adherence estimates varied (30.0-100.0%), however 82% (18/22 studies) reported high adherence rates of aspirin (≥80.0% adherence levels) <ref type="bibr">21, 24, 25, 27-29, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 41-43, 45, 58, 61, 62</ref> . Four studies reported on day-to-day adherence three to four years after participants started aspirin <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">34</ref> . Of these studies, three observed adherence levels to be high (≥80%) <ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">34</ref> . One RCT reported data on healthy participants for eight years in the active trial, and for 15 years post-trial 30 . At eight years, 64.0% of participants were classed as adherent 30 . By 15 years, 46.0% were adherent 30 .</p><p>There was no clear evidence of a relationship between aspirin dose and day-to-day adherence. In an RCT of high-risk participants, lower adherence was reported among those taking 650mg of aspirin (79.0% adherent), compared with those taking aspirin at 325mg (100.0% adherent) and 81mg (93.0% adherent) 37 . Three other studies reported adherence rates across different doses of aspirin and identified few differences <ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">31</ref> .</p><p>Persistence was reported by 52% (15/29) of studies <ref type="bibr">22, 24, 26, 30, 33-35, 37-41, 44, 60, 62</ref> .</p><p>Measurements of persistence varied from average number of months/years participants were taking the medication <ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">38,</ref><ref type="bibr">44</ref> , to increase in bleeding time 60 . Short-term persistence adherence (i.e. weeks, months) was high (83.3-100.0%) <ref type="bibr">37,</ref><ref type="bibr">39,</ref><ref type="bibr">41,</ref><ref type="bibr">60,</ref><ref type="bibr">62</ref> . The proportion of participants reporting persistence with aspirin long-term (i.e. years) varied. Three RCTs, all recruiting participants with colorectal adenomas, examined persistence at three years <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">34</ref> .</p><p>One RCT observed high levels of persistence, with 93.6% of participants still taking at least 50% of the study medication at year three 24 . In contrast, two trials reported low to moderate levels of persistence, with 38.6% and 66.8% of participants completing the three year medication <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">34</ref> .</p><p>Four studies examined factors associated with day-to-day adherence. A non-randomised trial of healthy participants found self-report measures to be significantly associated with higher reported adherence (73.0% adherent), when compared with the objective measure of MEMS (44.0% adherent) <ref type="bibr">59</ref> . Two RCTs and one non-randomised trial observed no association between adherence and participants' gender <ref type="bibr">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">59</ref> . In an RCT of participants with history of colorectal adenomas, no association was found between adherence and being at higher risk of recurrence, when compared with those at lower risk <ref type="bibr">27</ref> . No other factors associated with day-to-day or persistence adherence were reported.</p></div>

Another survey recruiting Barrett's oesophagus patients found higher education and younger age to be significantly associated with higher willingness to use aspirin in the univariable analysis 48 . However, this association was not significant in the multivariable analysis 48 . Two studies also found no evidence of a relationship between demographic factors and willingness to use aspirin 52, 57 .</p><p>Mixed evidence was also observed for the relationship between participants' current aspirin use and whether they would use aspirin for cancer prevention <ref type="bibr">50,</ref><ref type="bibr">57</ref> .</p><p>Psychological variables associated with intentions to use aspirin were also identified.</p><p>Participants' with increased self-efficacy, response efficacy, barriers and perceived susceptibility to developing colorectal cancer were significantly more likely to report higher intentions to use aspirin 50 . Some of the barriers the study found to be significantly and positively associated with intentions included participants' believing their doctor would want them to take low-dose aspirin, and believing most people their age were being told to take aspirin 50 . Participants who believed there was low evidence for the use of aspirin for cancer prevention reported significantly lower intentions 50 .</p></div>

Of these, two (50%) were conducted in the UK <ref type="bibr">47,</ref><ref type="bibr">51</ref> , one (25%) in Australia 46 , and one in the US and Canada (25%) 55 . All studies were of medium quality (3/5) based on the MMAT scoring. Sample sizes ranged from 181 46 to 1007 51 participants, with samples consisting of gastroenterologists <ref type="bibr">46,</ref><ref type="bibr">47,</ref><ref type="bibr">55</ref> , genetics professionals 46 , colorectal surgeons 46 and general practitioners (GPs) <ref type="bibr">51</ref> . Two studies reported data on healthcare providers' attitudes towards the use of aspirin for patients at higher risk of cancer (Lynch syndrome, Barret's oesophagus) <ref type="bibr">46,</ref><ref type="bibr">47</ref> . In both studies, a high proportion of healthcare provider respondents (72.0-76.0%) perceived aspirin to be a suitable cancer prevention option <ref type="bibr">46,</ref><ref type="bibr">47</ref> .</p><p>Two studies examined healthcare provider willingness to prescribe aspirin to patients with Lynch syndrome. One study recruited GPs in the UK 51 , while the other recruited gastroenterologists in the US and Canada 55 . The study recruiting gastroenterologists reported moderate levels of willingness (51.7%) to prescribe aspirin to patients with Lynch syndrome 55 . In the UK survey of GPs, willingness to prescribe aspirin was higher at lower doses, with 91.3% willing at 100mg, 81.8% willing at 300mg, and 62.3% willing at 600mg 51 .</p><p>GPs were significantly more willing to prescribe aspirin at 600mg if they had over 10 years' professional experience, were aged 50 or above, had greater awareness of the preventive effects of aspirin, and if they had seen a Lynch syndrome patient in clinic (range, OR 1.44 to 1.58) <ref type="bibr">51</ref> . There was evidence to suggest professional background may influence willingness, with GPs who had a special interest in family history significantly less willing to prescribe aspirin 51 . An Australian survey also found that a higher proportion of gastroenterologists (41/49, 83.7%) and genetic professionals (49/59, 83.1%) perceived aspirin to be effective for cancer prevention, than colorectal surgeons (47/73, 64.4%) <ref type="bibr">46</ref> .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this systematic review investigating attitudes and behaviour towards aspirin for cancer preventive therapy, most people declined to use aspirin when offered. When people did use aspirin, a large proportion reported high levels of adherence on a day-to-day basis. At shortterm follow up, most people were still taking aspirin for cancer prevention. However, there was mixed evidence observed for long-term persistence with aspirin. Given that aspirin is recommended to be taken regularly for several years for a cancer preventive benefit <ref type="bibr">7, 8 ,</ref> persistence among users of aspirin should be investigated further.</p><p>Clinical trials were the only available studies reporting data on uptake and adherence behaviours related to aspirin for cancer prevention, which presents generalisability issues.</p><p>Clinical guidelines in the US and UK recommend aspirin for cancer prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref> , but it is currently unknown if people initiate and adhere to aspirin in routine care. In our review, several included studies reported data on healthcare providers' behaviour in routine care.</p><p>We found most studies observed low rates of healthcare providers recommending aspirin to patients in clinical practice, but few studies examined the factors associated with healthcare providers' behaviour. Further research is warranted to investigate decision-making in the context of aspirin for cancer prevention in routine care among both users of aspirin and healthcare providers.</p><p>In contrast to the more extensive behavioural research conducted in breast cancer preventive therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> , minimal research has examined the factors associated with use of aspirin for cancer prevention. In our review, we only identified four studies reporting any factors associated with adherence, and none with uptake. Additionally, no qualitative studies were identified. Several studies investigated hypothetical willingness or intention to use aspirin, which was found to be moderately high among members of the public and those at increased risk of cancer. The demographic, clinical and psychological factors associated with willingness and intentions were also investigated, but evidence was either limited or conflicting. As intentions do not always translate into behaviour 63 , further research should investigate how people form a decision to initiate and adhere to aspirin for preventive therapy, and the support they may need.</p><p>The review had limitations. Due to time and resource constraints, the literature was limited to English language articles, and second reviewers only screened, extracted data and assessed quality for a proportion of articles (20-40%). We observed high heterogeneity across the included studies, and therefore were unable to conduct a meta-analysis of the data. Due to inconsistencies in the reporting of uptake data, we calculated two different assessments of uptake (i.e. 'all participant uptake', 'eligible participant uptake'). When participants who were ineligible to take part in the trial were removed from the calculation, uptake rates were higher. There were limitations to both calculations. For example, it was unclear whether ineligible participants intended to accept or decline the trial. Therefore, 'all participant uptake' may have underestimated rates of uptake, and 'eligible participant uptake' may have overestimated rates of uptake. More standardised and transparent reporting of uptake data is warranted to compare across cohorts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this review on decision-making in the context of aspirin for cancer prevention, we found most people declined to use aspirin when offered. When people did use aspirin, the majority reported a good level of adherence on a day-to-day basis. We found high levels of shortterm persistence with aspirin, but evidence was mixed for long-term persistence. No studies examined levels of uptake and adherence in routine care, and minimal research investigated the factors associated with using aspirin. Overall, we found that there is substantial scope for behavioural research into the factors affecting use of aspirin, and the barriers and facilitators to implementing aspirin for cancer preventive therapy into clinical care.</p><p>Cook    </p></div>

A cross-sectional survey conducted in Japan examined the management strategies for patients with Lynch syndrome 53 . Of the 190 departments recruited, 3.2%(6/190) recommended aspirin to patients for colorectal cancer prevention 53 . Departments at designated cancer hospitals had similar low rates of recommending aspirin (4/127, 3.1%) when compared with other hospitals (2/63, 3.2%)53  . Another survey study, recruiting members of the American Gastroenterological Association, found that 10.3% (43/416) of healthcare providers recommended aspirin to patients with Barrett's oesophagus 54 . The rates of recommending aspirin were similar when comparing academics with community-based healthcare providers (10/111, 9.0% vs. 33/301, 11.0% respectively) 54 .An international survey examined worldwide patterns on the management of Lynch syndrome patients 56 . Of the practice teams recruited, 34.5% (19/55) currently recommended aspirin for cancer prevention to patients with Lynch syndrome. Comparisons between these studies are difficult, given the differences in the sample recruited (e.g. department vs. individual), however all three studies reported relatively low rates of aspirin recommendations in clinical practice.In contrast, an Australian survey of clinicians reported high rates (65/83, 78.3%) of respondents who had previously prescribed or recommended aspirin for cancer prevention to a patient with Lynch syndrome 46 . A higher proportion of gastroenterologists (25/29, 86.2%) and colorectal surgeons (25/31, 80.6%) reported prescribing or recommending aspirin, compared with genetics professionals (15/23, 65.2%) 46 .
