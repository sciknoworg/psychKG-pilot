			<abstract>
				<p>Human&apos;s ability of optimal motor-timing decision remains debated. The optimality seems context-dependent as the sub-optimality was often observed for tasks with different gain/loss configurations: people achieved optimality with symmetric gain configuration but not with asymmetric configuration. In the current study, we designed a temporal decision-making task where participants could adjust the sensitivity parameter (i.e., risk-return trade-off) of the gain function, in order to testify whether people could optimize the responses for asymmetric gain configuration by adjusting the sensitivity parameter. Participants were asked to click a point within a certain spatial region at a specified timing, where the click timing determined the reward whilst the click position determined the sensitivity parameter. We prepared three types of gain functions (symmetric, risk-after and risk-before conditions) and tested whether or not the participants achieved Bayesian optimality irrespective of gain structure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans always have to decide when to execute a motor action in daily life situations.</p><p>Each action corresponds to a specific gain/loss. We often find ourselves in a dilemmatic scenario for action selection. Imagine that you, standing on a road-side, detected a mad dog charging towards you, and faced an impromptu decision about when to get away by crossing the busy road. Sooner reaction would increase the chance of dodging the attack but have less time to examine the traffic condition. Taking time to find a safer side to cross the road, on the other hand, might not survive the dog attack. Among the infinite choices, a particular time point at which to execute the action that could minimize the loss and maximize the gain might exist.</p><p>The mathematical modeling using Bayesian decision-making theory (BDT) allows us to find the optimal solution for the temporal decision-making scenario, such as the one mentioned above <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. It has been documented that human participants' performance in various motor-timing tasks supports the BDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In line with this theory, any temporal decision-making scenarios can be modeled as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E[G]</head><p>= G(t)p t|t e , σ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> t dt (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G(t)</formula><p>is the gain function mapping from all possible timing of motor executions to their corresponding outcomes. The p(t|t e , σ 2 t ) defines the probability distribution of the the variance of the gain function by choosing the movement speed. By equalizing the optimal speed, the risk sensitivity (i.e., risk-neutral, risk-aversive and risk-seeking) for each participant could be assessed by varying the payoff variance. In contrast to the previous studies using pre-experimentally fixed gain structure, Nagenagst 's design firstly introduced an adjustable risk-return that constructed a mapping between the response variance and the payoff variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Focusing on the motor-timing tasks, we assumed that implementing the adjustable risk-return control in a trial-by-trial fashion would lead to optimal performance.</p><p>Here in the present study, we designed a temporal decision-making task to investigate the strategies with three types of gain functions (symmetric, risk-after and risk-before conditions). In our study, we designed an adaptive control to allow participants adjust the steepness of the gain function in a trial-by-trial fashion. If the sub-optimality discovered with asymmetric gain functions was a result of the given structure of the gain function, the sub-optimality could be altered under the adaptive control. Each participant's performance was evaluated by a Bayesian decision-making model incorporating both timing and spatial variance. In contrast to the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, we found participants not only reached optimal performance in the symmetric condition but also in the risk-after condition, although some retained sub-optimal in the risk-before condition. Our research provides experimental evidence regarding the effectiveness of adaptive risk-return control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Participants</head><p>Twenty-one right-handed participants (five females) took part in the symmetric condition. Eleven of them (two females) took part in the risk-after condition, and the October 7, 2020 4/24 remaining ten (three females) participants took part in the risk-before condition. All participants reported having normal visual and hearing acuity. All completed the whole experimental session, and each received a reciprocal reward for participation (a prepaid book voucher of 1,000 JPY, about 9 USD) was given for every experimental hour). This experiment was approved by the University of Electro-Communications Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research (#14007), and was in accordance with the ethical standards in the Declaration of Helsinki. We obtained written informed consent from all participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus</head><p>The experiment was conducted in a quiet lab room under fluorescent light. Participants sat at a distance of approximately 56 cm from the display. Stimuli were displayed over a white background on a 23-inch LCD screen (LG Inc.) with a 1920×1200 resolution and a refresh rate of 100 Hz. The signal tones (1000 Hz) and the clicking tone (900 Hz) used in the experiment session were played through a headphone. An optical mouse with a scroll wheel (Dell Inc.) was used for the clicking performance. Experimental stimuli were generated and controlled using Inquisit 5.0 <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and Experimental Procedure</head><p>In each experimental condition, the target stimulus (radius: 500 pixels) was a semi-circular ring-shaped and grey object ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref>). The target stimulus was equally differentiated into eighteen equal-area parts by black lines. A fixation circle (FC) was presented at the center of the ring, and all points on the stimulus were equidistant from the FC. All operations were executed through mouse click. Participants clicked the FC to initiate each trial ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b)</ref>. After a random interval (0.5 to 1 s), the target interval was demarcated by two signal tones. The target interval was fixed at 2.3 s for all trials, October 7, 2020 5/24 which was adopted from Ota et al. to make direct comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Participants were asked to initiate the mouse cursor from the FC to the target region after the presentation of the second tone and clicked at a certain timing.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian modeling of optimal decision-making</head><p>We designed a Bayesian decision-making model that consists of five elements: the planned action (click) timing t e , the actual action timing t, the planned movement direction r e , the actual movement direction r (defined by the directional angle of the October 7, 2020 7/24 clicked position), and the reward function G (t; r) associated with the action. Follow the previous model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the actual motor timing t is assumed to be distributed according to a Gaussian distribution due to the internal timing noise σ t . p (t|t e ; σ t ) = 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2πσ 2 t exp − (t − t e ) 2 2σ 2 t<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The actual movement direction was modeled by a Gaussian distribution ( r e , σ r ) on the assumption that the selected directions could converge to a particular end-point after restricting the search zone, where σ r is the standard deviation of directional motor noise. The number of reward received on each executed motor action was specified by the gain functions.</p><p>In the risk-symmetric condition, the gain was determined by a modified Gaussian function.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G(t; r) = 10 σ 0.7 (r) exp − (t − T ) 2 2σ 2 (r)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The maximum points were given where the executed timing t was equal to the target interval T (t = T , i.e., coincident timing), and received points reduced symmetrically with increased timing error from T given the r was fixed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2a</ref>).</p><p>In the risk-before condition, the gain function contained a "basin" and a "cliff " structure where any click actions occurred before the target time was equally penalized and that occurred after the target time brought the points reduced identically to the defined Gaussian structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2b</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">G(t; r) =          10 σ 0.7 s exp − (t − T ) 2 2σ 2 s , t T −5, t &lt; T<label>(6)</label></formula><p>On the contrary, the risk-after condition imposed the negative gain after the target time, encouraging earlier responses. The gain structure was a mirror image of Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> with respect to the target time ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>).</p><p>In all three conditions, the sensitivity of tto the point depended on the sensitivity </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">σ s =                σ min, r &lt; r min a(r − r min ) + σ min, r min ≤ r ≤ r max σ max, r &gt; r max<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Where a = σmax− σmin rmax−rmin , r min = 6 deg, r max = 174 deg, σ min = 0.023 s, σ max = 1.15</p><p>s. The values (σ min , σ max ) were used to cover the potential range of timing response variance of human participants.</p><p>Therefore, movement direction r defines the risk-return control of this task, that is, a larger value of r (moving leftward) brings low-risk and low-return whilst a smaller value of r (mover rightward) brings high-risk and high-return, and the participant could determine the risk-return configuration by adjusting the movement direction trial-by-trial. We termed this method as adaptive risk-return control.</p><p>Taken together, an optimal decision-maker is to choose a movement direction and a response time (r e , t e ) to maximize the following expected gain function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">EG(t e ; r e ) = rmax rmin p (r|r e ) ∞ 0 G (t; r) p (t|t e ) dtdr<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The timing variance of each participant was estimated using the dataset excluding the first 10 trials to avoid the effect of warming-up. We used the data in Block 5 where the response variance was limited within 20 degrees to estimate the motor variance. The reason for choosing the last block to estimate the variance is to avoid the fluctuation of selecting movement directions during exploration and to stabilize the estimation. We used the globalserach function with an SQP algorithm in MATLAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>One participant's dataset was removed from the analysis because the average timing response was negatively biased 2.5 SD from the group mean in the symmetric condition, indicating the participant did not pay attention to the task. Temporal outlier was defined as a timing response less than Q1 (the first quartile) -1.5 × IQR (inter-quartile range) or more than Q3 (the third quartile) + 1.5 × IQR of its corresponding response distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. Spatial outliers were defined as the movement direction that exceeded 2.5 ± SD from the restricted search zone in the last block. The removed data took up 0.77% (23/3000) of the dataset in risk-symmetric condition, 1.27% (19/1500) in risk-before condition and 0.67% (10/1500) in risk-after condition.</p><p>The statistical models were constructed using Rstan <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> and lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> packages.</p><p>The basic setting for running the MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) sampling was four chains (each chain contains 1500 warm-up steps and 3000 iterations). Rhat (a scale reduction factor) was used to examine the convergence of split chains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of performance of individual participants</head><p>We computed the optimal point p opt , the optimal timing response t opt and the optimal movement direction r opt for each participant in each condition by maximizing Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. To visualize the change in individual participant performance across blocks, we plotted the expected gains of each participant (plots of representative participants were shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>; for the results of the other participants, see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figures</ref>).</p><p>To analyze the individual optimality, we adopted the Relative Optimality (RO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , October 7, 2020 10/24 that is, the observed mean point p obs divided by the corresponding optimal point p opt :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">RO = p obs p opt<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The RO was calculated for each participant in each condition using the post-learning dataset (i.e., block 3-5). We notice that a well-accepted criterion of "optimality" has not been given in the previous studies. In line with Dean et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and to avoid bias, we defined optimality by whether the "RO = 1" fell within the 99% confidence interval. We therefore regarded the 99% CI as the optimality interval (OI). The OI was estimated by applying MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) sampling method via rstan <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> in R (See Model Availability for model structure). We used non-informative priors. All running chains were successfully converged (Rhat = 1). In addition, we regarded the "RO = 0.9" as a reference level for monitoring performance efficiency, as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. participants' ROs (RO = 1) lay within the OI. These findings were contracted to the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> where participants did not reach optimal performance in asymmetric conditions. On the other hand, our results supported that humans can achieve optimality in asymmetric conditions through the adaptive risk-return control.</p><p>However, we observed an inconsistent performance pattern in risk-before condition, October 7, 2020 11/24</p><p>where three of participants (one at marginal edge of the cut-off level) were classified as optimal performers whereas the rest seven were classified as sub-optimal performers (according to the criterion of optimality). Although the sub-optimal performers existed, five of them reached the 90% (RO = 0.9) optimality, indicating a high level of performance efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The observed inconsistency of performance existed between two risk-asymmetric conditions indicated that the risk-direction might have an influence on the performance optimality, which will be discussed later. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk sensitivity across risk-conditions</head><p>We observed that some participants' performance did not reach optimality in risk-before condition whereas participants in the risk-after condition could achieve optimal performance, even though an asymmetric gain structure was used. To further understand the observed inconsistency in task performance, we employed the concept of risk-sensitivity. In the previous studies, risk-sensivity was often employed to determine whether the chosen strategy is risk-aversive or risk-seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The risk-sensitivity is assumed to occur when an asymmetric gain structure is implemented whereas no risk-sensitivity (a.k.a, risk-neutral) occurs in the symmetric gain.</p><p>Here, we investigated how the risk-sensitivity exhibited in the risk-assymetric conditions. To this end, we focused on the relationship between the mean observed timing response t obs and the optimal timing response t opt ( = t obs − t opt ). Focusing October 7, 2020 12/24 on their relative values, the timing strategy was considered as risk-seeking if t obs &gt; t opt in the risk-after condition and if t obs &lt; t opt in the risk-before condition, and conversely for a risk-aversive strategy. If no difference detected, the strategy was risk-neutral (i.e., optimal, timing difference equals to 0). We evaluated participant-averaged values of in risk-after and risk-before conditions respectively, using the dataset (each condition contains 10 observations) after the learning session (block 3-5).</p><p>The mean, 95% confidence interval (CI), and effect size Cohen's d related to the group data were estimated using MCMC with non-informative priors (See Model Availability for model structure). All chains were successfully converged (Rhat = 1).</p><p>The statistical significance was determined by whether "0" lays within the 95% CI. The results were plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>. We found that the was not different from 0 in   <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref>. Therefore, if one performed in a manner of maximizing the expected gain (i.e., to achieve Bayesian optimality), the timing variance would be positively correlated with the movement direction. We first normalized the block-averaged movement direction and the by-block timing variance for each participant respectively using z-score. In our design, "block" was a within-subject effect whereas "participant" was a between-subject effect.</p><p>Therefore, applying a simple linear regression was not appropriate in our analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Instead, we then constructed linear mixed model using lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> to investigate whether or not timing variance is a significant predictor of movement direction. "Block"</p><p>and "participant" were considered as random effects. We compared the goodness of fitting and chose the random intercept model as the target model (for model comparison see Supplementary Materials):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Random intercept model (RIM) N M D ∼ N T V + (1 | participant) + (1 | block)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Where NMD is normalized movement direction and NTV is normalized timing variance, the model equation is written using pseudocode retrieved from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>We focused on estimating the coefficient of regression and its 95% confidence interval (CI) respectively for each condition using bootstrap method. The results were shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. We identified a significant fixed effect in risk-after condition, t(49.98) = 2.662, p = .0104 and symmetric condition, t(55.73) = 6.076, p &lt; .001, indicating the existence October 7, 2020 14/24</p><p>of Bayesian risk-return trade-off. However, the fixed effect in risk-before condition was not significant t(19.88) = -1.049, p = 0.307. The results indicated that the participants in risk-before condition might use different strategies rather than trading-off risk and returns. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the current research, we investigated whether participants could achieve optimal performance with the gain functions of modified symmetry when the risk-return trade-off were adjustable. To this end, we designed a hierarchical decision-making task in which participants chose a timing end-point to maximize the expected points. An adjustable risk-return control was implemented that allowed participants to select the shape of the gain function to match with the corresponding response variance. Using the Bayesian decision-making model, we found that participants were able to reach the optimality in the symmetric condition and the risk-after condition. In contrast, three out of ten participants ' performance in the risk-before condition was clearly sub-optimal and overal participants tended to adopt a risk-aversive strategy. Taken together, our findings concluded that optimality depended not directly on the symmetry of the gain structure but on the risk-neutral strategy induced by the adjustable risk-return control. Besides, risk-direction of temporal target (the tasks requiring the response after/before the target) might exert influence on the performance optimality.</p><p>Sub-optimality in motor timing was often observed in the decision-making tasks where an asymmetric gain function was adopted <ref type="bibr">[12-14, 26, 27]</ref>. For example, the "cliff " paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref> in which the highest risk-return was located in the "cliff-edge" of the gain function, was recently often used as an experimental design in motor-timing tasks.</p><p>Under the "cliff " paradigm, Ota et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> asked participants to search for an optimal response timing to maximize the expected gains. They found that participants failed to reach the optimal performance no matter whether the penalty region was before (risk-before) or after (risk-after) the target time. By contraries, we discovered optimal performance under the risk-after condition even though adopting the "cliff" paradigm.</p><p>Under "cliff" paradigm, how did participants reach optimal performance with asymmetric gains? For a primary reason, we designed a motor task that allowed participants to adjust the shape of gain function in a trial-by-trial manner. Similar risk-return control was introduced by Nagengast et al. concerning speed-accuracy trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In contrast to Ota et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the adjustable risk-return control ensured that the structure of gain function mapped with the participants' corresponding timing variance, so that the risk-return trade-off could be achieved by finding out "the more appropriate" gain function from infinite ones. Participants in our tasks could soon notice the drastic change in received points if there were any mismatches occurred. Note that previous studies used pre-experimentally estimated response variance to construct gain functions. For example, in Wu's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>, the estimated motor variance for each participant was used to configure the "motor lottery" (gain function) in the spatial target. Researchers found that participants tended to favor the riskier lottery than the safer one. Nagengast et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> used the pointing variance estimated from training session to construct the target region specified by the participant-dependent hitting probability. As a result, most participants ended up underestimating their response variance (i.e., believing the response variance was smaller than the actual one). The above-mentioned two findings indicated that the distortion of response variance could October 7, 2020 17/24 occur if participants were not allowed to control the variance of gain function while performing the risk-return task. On the other hand, our findings suggested that providing more flexibility in risk-return control was crucial for appximating optimality.</p><p>Many motor decision-making tasks, used in the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30]</ref>, require the knowledge of motor error to achieve optimal motor planning because perturbation often occurred from different sources. Similar in timing tasks, responses may be highly volatile especially when producing supra-second time intervals, due to the scalar property in interval estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> and the involvement of cognitive time processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. To reduce the multiplicative errors incurred from estimating longer intervals, we provided participants with feedback about their timing errors by signaling both the response time and the target time (i.e., 2.3 s). Participants could refer to the timing error to maintain timing accuracy without taking excessive trials, as we observed that most participants reached the optimal performance after five blocks (150 trials) of experiments.</p><p>Particularly in the risk-asymmetric conditions where the optimal time value required exploration, providing repeated corrective feedback could enhance the learning of internal representation of timing errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, and therefore led to optimal performance.</p><p>Thirdly, we introduced the penalty region to the gain function's structure, following the previous designs regarding the motor planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27]</ref>. Focusing on the temporal task, Hudson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> punished early/late timing responses and discovered that participants behaved in a manner of choosing the movement times that maximized the expected rewards. Studies also found the neural basis that humans were loss-aversive when involving in the gain/loss situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. Although there was no direct evidence showing that experiencing negative gains would enhance performance optimality, it remained a possibility that the risk-seeking tendency under the "cliff " paradigm would diminish if the early/late responses were punished by penalty.</p><p>Why did some participants exhibit sub-optimality in the risk-before condition? We October 7, 2020 18/24 firstly argued that the asymmetry of the gain function (or risk-direction) was not the primary reason for inducing sub-optimality, as all participants achieved optimality in the risk-after condition. Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> additionally proposed two types of distortions that may lead to sub-optimal performance with asymmetric gain functions:</p><p>1) distortion in numerical values, and 2) distortion in response variance. Distortion in numerical values was less likely occurring in our tasks because we provided both trial-by-trial points and block-averaged points as feedback which could potentially extenuate the value distortion <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36]</ref>. The implementation of adjustable risk-return control matching the response variance with the payoff variance could also reduce the chances of distortion in response variance. In concrete, a heuristic strategy was assumed to induce a risk-aversive tendency in our risk-before condition. Because higher points would be received as sooner the response was released after the target time, the "sub-optimal" participants might find it easy to earn points by relying on such a "simple reaction time" task. To sum up, at present, we have no clear explanation for the reason why participants could not achieve optimality only in the risk-before condition. Future studies are to clarify the strategy used by the "sub-optimal" participants.</p><p>Recent studies focused on modeling human decision-making under different risk-return configurations in either spatial tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref> or temporal tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, and most studies only concerned with the motor-decision in one dimension. To step forward, our decision making-model incorporated the movement direction and timing response that controlled the variance and the mean of payoffs respectively. Such modeling might offer an application in daily life situations. For example, modeling bowling using balls with different sizes. Large balls are heavy and easy to slip out of the hand (0 points) but can potentially hit more pins (high-risk high-return), whereas small balls may hit fewer pins but can be controlled more precisely (low-risk low return). To gain more points, the player needs to consider the October 7, 2020 19/24</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Stimulus and Task.
