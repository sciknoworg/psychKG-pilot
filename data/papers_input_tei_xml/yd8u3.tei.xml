			<abstract>
				<p>Behavioral sciences have largely demonstrated that psychological, emotional, and motivational factors influence financial behaviors. However, psychological characteristics have been quite overlooked concerning investment decision-making, as research focused mainly on financial knowledge and skills. By adopting a behavioral economics framework, the present study aimed to explore the role of specific psychological factors in predicting financial market participation. Analyzing cross-sectional data on a representative sample of 1,110 individuals, the impact of financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, financial risk attitude, and impulsivity on the decision to participate in financial markets was investigated. Findings from a logistic regression model showed that, besides financial literacy, psychological characteristics (i.e., risk tolerance, financial selfefficacy, and impulsivity) significantly affect the probability of investing. From one side, these results confirm the relevant role that financial literacy plays for proper investment decision-making. On the other side, the present study reveals that investment decision-making processes are strongly affected by psychological characteristics as well. Thus, considering psychological factors is essential to better understand investment decisions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Financial market participation puzzle is a well-known phenomenon that has been widely discussed in finance both on a micro and macroeconomic scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Haliassos &amp; Bertaut, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Investments consist in committing money to financial assets for a certain period of time to obtain an economic return. So, by participating in financial markets, individuals might increase their wealth.</p><p>Despite the potential positive impact of investments on individuals' finances, only a small percentage of people invest their savings in financial markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(EFAMA, 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, this trend is similar across countries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Christelis et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>The present study plunges its roots in a behavioral finance framework, to understand the role of financial literacy and psychological determinants in investment decision-making. Traditional financial theories assume that investors would take their decisions rationally, considering only riskreturn trade-off and expected performances. However, according to behavioral sciences, many psychological factors could shape investment decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sekścińska, &amp; Rudzińska-Wojciechowska, 2023)</ref>, such as differences in risk tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Plieger et al., 2021)</ref>, cognitive skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Christelis et al., 2010)</ref>, self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nadeem et al., 2020)</ref>, thinking styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>, inertia <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Haliassos &amp; Bertaut, 1995)</ref>, trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balloch et al., 2015)</ref>, self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sekścińska et al., 2021)</ref>, and social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brown et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Starting from this theoretical framework, our study intends to investigate the effect that financial literacy and various individual differences (i.e., financial risk attitude, financial selfefficacy, and impulsivity) have on the decision to make financial investments in a representative sample of Italian consumers. Specifically, through a logistic regression path analytic model, we compared investors and non-investors, to check whether psychological determinants may come into play, besides financial literacy, in the investment decision-making process. Hence, the purpose was to explore whether or how investors differ from non-investors.</p><p>This research contributes to the literature on economic psychology and behavioral finance for many reasons. First, we did not focus solely on how objective financial knowledge and skills (i.e., financial literacy) may shape investment decisions, but we also investigated the role of psychological variables, and specifically individual differences (e.g., self-efficacy and impulsivity), that are usually less considered in financial investments literature. Furthermore, these determinants of investment decisions were tested in a comprehensive model showing which are the strongest predictors of financial market participation. Indeed, considering simultaneously various antecedents of investment decision-making enables us to estimate the explanatory power of the single variable, also controlling for the relative weight of the other variables considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head><p>Below, we present a literature review with a specific focus on the variables considered in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Financial literacy</head><p>There is no agreement yet in literature on how to define financial literacy. However, one of the most common definitions has been proposed by OECD (2013), which defines financial literacy as "a combination of the awareness, knowledge, skills, attitude, and behaviors necessary to make sound financial decisions and ultimately achieve individual financial wellbeing". As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Huston (2010)</ref>, financial literacy should not be conceived as mere knowledge in financial domains, as it also includes an application dimension. In other words, financial literacy implies that individuals are able to turn their knowledge into appropriate financial decisions and behaviors. For instance, financial literacy might also imply basic computing skills, essential in calculating compounding interest or mortgage rates.</p><p>Despite the relevant role that financial literacy plays in financial behavior and decisionmaking, people often lack basic knowledge and skills in economic and financial domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lusardi &amp; Mitchell, 2011)</ref>. Low levels of literacy could lead people to wrong or ineffective decisions and behaviors. Financially illiterate individuals tend to save less money and get overindebted more frequently, whereas greater levels of financial literacy are associated with a proper wealth management <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Henager &amp; Cude, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Xiao et al., 2014)</ref>, retirement planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hauff et al., 2020)</ref>, emergency saving <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Despard et al., 2020)</ref> and financial market participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balloch et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Financial literacy not only predicts the decision to invest, but also portfolio quality and composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Yao &amp; Xu, 2015)</ref>. Literature also reveals a connection between financial literacy and risk appetite. While financially literate individuals appear to be more risk tolerant and tend to invest in riskier assets, less literate individuals are typically more conservative in their investment decisions (Hermanoss &amp; Jonsson, 2021).</p><p>Hp 1: Financial literacy has a positive effect on financial market participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Psychological factors</head><p>Risk and uncertainty are at the heart of any financial decision. When talking about risk, it is necessary to remember that the human perception of risks is strictly subjective and influenced by both cognitive and emotional factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Mousavi &amp; Gigerenzer, 2014)</ref>. Besides subjective risk perception, also risk tolerance is a key factor to understand, since it strongly affects financial behavior and decision-making. Financial risk tolerance could be defined as the "maximum amount of uncertainty that someone is willing to accept when making a financial decision" <ref type="bibr">(Grable, 2008, p.3</ref>).</p><p>There is a clear relationship between financial risk appetite and investment decision-making.</p><p>Risk tolerance is not solely linked to participation in capital markets but is also connected with the amount and the type of financial assets held <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Plieger et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Robba et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wong et al., 2018)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Keller and Siegrist (2006)</ref> reported that risk tolerant investors usually tend to invest more in stocks, while risk-averse investors prefer bonds.</p><p>Hp 2: Financial risk tolerance positively predicts financial market participation.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bandura (1997)</ref>, self-efficacy concerns people's beliefs and expectations about their capability to control, manage and achieve a certain goal. It refers to a cognitive evaluation of one's future performance that strongly affects human behavior. Individuals who are confident in their ability would be more motivated to reach their goals, more resilient in adverse situations, and tend to set higher goals.</p><p>Given that self-efficacy is a domain-specific construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>, in financial domains scholars refer to financial self-efficacy. Financial self-efficacy could be defined as people's belief in their ability to achieve financial goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Forbes &amp; Kara, 2010)</ref>. In brief, financial self-efficacy reflects individuals' perceptions and confidence in their own financial skills, competencies, and knowledge. Self-efficacy is the link between knowledge and behavior. For this reason, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rothwell et al. (2016)</ref> argue that, alone, objective financial literacy cannot explain financial behaviors. Evidence shows that both objective financial literacy and confidence in one's own financial capabilities can shape financial behaviors and decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bannier &amp; Schwarz, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu &amp; Zhang, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Even if self-efficacy in financial domains is less considered, it could play a relevant role in the investment decision-making process. Financial self-efficacy is related to responsible financial behaviors, such as investing and owning a savings account, and inversely associated with debts <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Farrell et al., 2016)</ref>. Likewise, greater levels of financial self-efficacy are related to a higher probability of emergency saving <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Babiarz &amp; Robb, 2014)</ref> and retirement planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rothwell et al., 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Montford and Goldsmith (2016)</ref> found that individuals with higher financial self-efficacy were also more willing to invest in riskier assets. Finally, according to a study by <ref type="bibr">Asebedo and</ref> Payne (2019), investors with higher financial self-efficacy are more resilient during financial adversities, such as market volatility.</p><p>Hp 3: Financial self-efficacy is positively related to financial market participation. Impulsivity could negatively affect consumers' time perspective. Impulsivity can be defined as the tendency to act without considering possible negative consequences of one's own decisions.</p><p>People often struggle with intertemporal choices, such as saving and investing to increase their future wealth, because they are not oriented on future goals but only on immediate rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Xiao &amp; Porto, 2019)</ref>. Indeed, impulsive individuals generally show a higher inclination to take immediate and unplanned actions, without thinking about consequences, as a response to internal and external stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frigerio et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Strayhorn (2002)</ref> reported that impulsivity is strictly connected with deficits in self-control and self-regulation, as impulsive individuals show great difficulties in delaying gratifications and, on the opposite, tend to prefer immediate smaller rewards over longerterm larger outcomes. Impulsivity has been linked with various financial misbehaviors, such as excessive spending <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Xiao &amp; Porto, 2019)</ref> and debt holding <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frigerio et al., 2020)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ottaviani and Vandone (2011)</ref> reported that individuals with higher scores on impulsivity were also more likely to hold debts. Moreover, they also found that there is a clear relationship with the type of debt. While there was no significant relationship with mortgages, impulsivity strongly predicted consumer credit. The authors suggest that individuals lacking self-control would make use of credit consumption to obtain an immediate gratification without considering the sustainability of the debts.</p><p>Lower levels of impulsivity predict better financial decisions. For instance, various studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allom et al., 2018)</ref> underlined an association between self-control and wealth accumulation, as individuals with higher self-regulation save significantly more than people with self-regulation issues. Likewise, self-control has a positive impact on investment decisions <ref type="bibr">(Goossens &amp; Werker, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sekścińska et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Since investments require delaying gratification -spending in the present -to get increased future returns, it is plausible that lack of self-control and impulsivity could be negatively related to the decision to participate in financial markets.</p><p>Hp 4: Impulsivity negatively affects financial market participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sample</head><p>For research purposes, an online survey was created and administered in March 2022 to a pool of Italian individuals. Data were collected through CAWI methodology, as the survey was hosted and distributed using the Qualtrics online survey platform. Participants' contacts were obtained by Prolific. Respondents received a small monetary compensation for study participation.</p><p>A quota sampling method was used, controlling that sample was representative for gender, age, geographical area, and educational level. Survey completion required 15 minutes. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The current study was approved by the MASKED FOR PEER REVIEW Ethical Committee and adhered to the American Psychological Association (APA) standard ethical guidelines for research. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Measure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Financial literacy</head><p>To assess financial literacy, respondents were asked to answer four questions regarding the investment domain. Three out of the four items were the so-called "Big 3" developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lusardi and Mitchell (2011)</ref>. These questions measure individuals' knowledge concerning interest rates, inflation, and risk diversification. A supplementary question was developed to assess the comprehension of the risk-return tradeoff: "There is a direct link between risk and the return on a financial asset, so an investment with a high expected return is probably very risky." Participants had to choose the correct answer from three or four alternatives. The index of financial literacy was obtained by adding the number of correct answers. The total score ranged between 0 (no correct answers) and 4 (all answers correct).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Financial risk attitude</head><p>Financial risk attitude (i.e., the general construct that consists of risk tolerance and risk aversion) was measured using a six-item scale retrieved from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kapteyn and Teppa (2011)</ref>. This measure assesses risk attitudes specifically in financial and investment domains. Respondents are asked to express their agreement on a Likert scale (1 = completely disagree; 7 = completely agree).</p><p>The instrument is composed of two factors. The first one measures financial risk aversion (e.g., "I would never consider investments in shares because I find this too risky"; ω = .661), while the second factor represents financial risk tolerance (e.g., "I get more and more convinced that I should take greater financial risks to improve my financial position"; ω = .757). Each sub-scale is measured by three items. Higher scores coincide with higher levels of risk tolerance/aversion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Financial self-efficacy</head><p>The measure of financial self-efficacy has been assessed with the Financial Self-Efficacy Scale (FSES; Lown, 2011), a single-factor scale composed of six items (ω = .730) measuring individuals' perceived difficulties and confidence (e.g., "When faced with a financial challenge, I</p><p>have a hard time figuring out a solution"). Items are rated on a four-step scale ranging from 1 (Exactly true) to 4 (Not at all true). The highest the score, the higher the level of perceived selfefficacy in financial matters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Impulsivity</head><p>Levels of individual impulsivity were measured with BIS-15, a 15-item psychometric instrument developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Spinella (2007)</ref>. The scale is composed of three factors, representing different aspects of impulsivity. The first one is Motor Impulsivity (ω = .804), which represents the tendency to act without thinking (e.g., "I act on the spur of the moment"); the second factor is Attentional impulsivity (ω = .715), which indicates lack or difficulties in focusing attention (e.g., "I get easily bored solving thought problems"); the Non-planning subscale (ω = .697), once items are reversed, measures people's lack of concerns about the future (e.g., "I plan for the future"). Each sub-scale consists of five items. Answers are indicated on a four-point scale ranging from 1 (rarely/never) to 4 (almost always/always). Higher scores are indicative of higher levels of impulsivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">Investment decision-making</head><p>To assess financial market participation, respondents were asked to select, within a list of financial investment product, the assets they were currently investing in. The category of investors was thus formed by merging individuals who held at least one financial asset among stocks, bonds and/or mutual funds. Participants were considered non-investors if they did not own any financial product. This variable has been used in the current study as a dependent variable, classifying individuals into two groups (investors and non-investors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Study design</head><p>The present study aims to investigate the role of financial literacy and psychological factors (financial self-efficacy, financial risk attitude, and impulsivity) in investment decision-making, also controlling for socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age, education). To investigate our hypotheses, we opted for a binomial logistic regression path analysis, as the sample was divided between investors and non-investors. First, descriptive statistics and socio-demographics were estimated for each variable and using SPSS software (version 27), both for the total sample and for the two sub-groups (investors and non-investors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>Before running the binomial logistic model, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for each psychometric scale was performed to confirm their theoretical model and evaluate their factorial structure. Different statistics were considered to assess the goodness of fit of the model(s): the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) were calculated. Furthermore, the confidence intervals (90%) of RMSEA and χ² significance tests were also checked, although the latter is largely influenced by sample size. The CFA also allowed us to save the factor scores of the scales and include in the path analysis a more reliable estimate of predictors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Logistic Regression Path Analysis</head><p>After verifying that quantitative variables were normally distributed and that there was no multicollinearity among independent variables, the role of financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, risk attitude, and impulsivity as predictors of the decision to invest was tested. Precisely, a logistic regression was performed, in which the observed coefficients were included, together with sociodemographic variables (gender, age, and educational level) for control, as predictors of the decision to invest. Analysis was performed in Mplus (version 8.7), and the "non-investors" group was used as the reference group. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> presents descriptive statistics of the variables under review for the entire sample and the two sub-groups (i.e., investors and non-investors). Correlations between predictors are reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Normality for each scale (i.e., financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, risk aversion, risk tolerance, and the three impulsivity factors) was checked through the estimation of skewness and kurtosis scores. Skewness values ranged from -.266 to .248, while kurtosis values ranged from -1.001 to .752. In accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Muthén and Kaplan (1985)</ref>'s cut-off, all the continuous variables we adopted could be considered normally distributed. Furthermore, to test the multicollinearity among the predictors included in our logistic regression, we estimated the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). VIF values ranged from 1.083 to 3.147, thus respecting the cut-offs provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kim (2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>[INSERT </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Confirmatory factor analysis</head><p>A CFA was performed for each psychometric scale (i.e., financial self-efficacy, financial risk attitude, and impulsivity). Since results obtained were satisfactory (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>), factor scores were saved and, subsequently, included in the path analysis.</p><p>[ <ref type="bibr">INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Path analysis</head><p>As expected, financial literacy (Hp 1) plays a key role in investment decision-making.</p><p>Particularly, an increase of one unit in the financial literacy score makes people 62.3% more likely to invest in financial assets. However, psychological characteristics affect the decision to participate in financial markets as well. Financial self-efficacy was found to be a relevant predictor in the model (Hp 2). An increase of one unit in the financial self-efficacy measure makes individuals 48.6% more likely to invest. As for attitudes towards risk (Hp 3), while risk aversion did not make any difference between investors and non-investors (p = .836), risk tolerance had a positive effect on investment decisions. Specifically, when the value of risk tolerance factor scores increases by one unit, participants are 46.1% more likely to be current investors than non-investors. Finally, regarding impulsivity (Hp 4), our hypothesis was partially supported. Indeed, only the "nonplanning" impulsivity factor had a significant impact on investment decision-making, while motor (p = .394) and attentional (p = .799) impulsivity turned out to be non-significant. To be precise, as lack of planning scores increase by one unit, the likelihood of participating in financial markets drops by 27.4%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[INSERT TABLE 4 HERE]</head><p>Among control variables, two out of the three socio-demographic characteristics significantly shaped investment decisions. Not surprisingly, gender had a significant impact on investment behavior. Particularly, being male (vs female) makes individuals 46% more likely to invest in capital markets. Age was significantly related to investment decision. When it increases by one unit, respondents are 19.8% more likely to be investors. Conversely, educational status did not make any difference between current investors and non-investors (p = .059). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4 summarizes</ref> the findings from the binomial logistic regression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The present study aimed to identify the main predictors that underlie the decision to invest in financial markets, comparing non-investors with both current investors and past investors.</p><p>Specifically, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the role that, besides financial literacy, psychological characteristics may play in shaping investment decision-making. Hence, through a logistic regression model, the impact of financial literacy, risk appetite, financial selfefficacy, and impulsivity in financial market participation was tested, also controlling for sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, and education).</p><p>In line with previous findings, financial literacy significantly affects the decision to invest in capital markets. However, psychological characteristics should not be overlooked, as both risk tolerance, self-efficacy, and non-planning impulsivity have a determinant role in investment decision-making as well. Precisely, while higher risk appetite and financial self-efficacy increase the likelihood of participating in financial markets, a lack of self-control and concerns for future consequences have a detrimental effect in investment decisions, thus reducing the probability of investing.</p><p>Such findings suggest that the investment decision-making process could be significantly shaped also by various psychological determinants and individual differences. It is worth highlighting that, besides objective financial skills (i.e., financial literacy), perceived self-efficacy in financial domains played a relevant role as well in investment decision-making. The finding is consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Farrell et al., 2016)</ref>. This trend is not unexpected if considering that individuals are more motivated to play out a behavior when they perceive to have the suitable skills to succeed and obtain positive outcomes. As well, financial risk tolerance makes a difference between investors and those avoiding financial markets, as a sign that risk propensity is also a key factor to consider when individuals decide to take part in financial markets. Lastly, it emerged that non-planning impulsivity negatively affects investment decision-making. Lack of planning implies a present moment focus with no regard for future consequences. Therefore, it is not surprising that those who are less concerned with their future are less likely to invest their money, since investing requires delaying an immediate gratification to get outcomes distant in time.</p><p>As for socio-demographic characteristics, gender resulted significantly related to investment behavior, suggesting a strong gender investment gap also in our sample. Indeed, men had more chance to be investors than women, which were more likely to have never invested in capital markets. Our findings are in line with previous studies, which reported gender differences in financial market participation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Montford &amp; Goldsmith, 2016)</ref>. Unsurprisingly, age was also found to be significant in the model. The result could be explained considering that older adults are more likely to have money to invest compared to younger ones. However, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sekścińska and Rudzińska-Wojciechowska (2023)</ref>, psychological characteristics have a greater explanatory power, compared to socio-demographics, in explaining investment decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Limitations</head><p>The present study is not lacking limitations. First of all, by considering only an Italian sample within the present study, any generalizations outside the Italian territory should be made cautiously.</p><p>Secondly, data used for research are exclusively self-reported. Thus, it's not certain that individuals' answers are sincere or not biased by social desirability. Furthermore, data are cross-sectional. In other words, even though our directional interpretation of results is strongly based on the theoretical background, it cannot be directly derived from data. Lastly, our study did not consider the level of income and individuals' wealth, which are socio-demographic information strongly associated with financial market participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The present research shows that psychological aspects (i.e., risk tolerance, financial selfefficacy and risk tolerance) can be as relevant as financial skills and knowledge in explaining differences in investment decision-making. Some insight for future research in the field of financial market participation can be drawn. First, by showing that financial self-efficacy plays a relevant role in investment decisions, we suggest future studies to take into account both objective and perceived financial competences. Specifically, we recommend further investigating how financial self-efficacy shapes different financial behaviors and decisions. Furthermore, previous studies generally investigated the role of psychological variables in investment decisions considering one psychological variable at a time. As done in the current study, future studies as well should consider these variables together in a unique theoretical model, to estimate the explanatory power of each single variable, also controlling for the relative weight of the other variables considered.</p><p>The results of this study may also have practical implications. Findings of the study highlight the importance of taking into account psychological characteristics, as they contribute to shaping financial decisions and behaviors. Hence, such factors should not be overlooked when designing financial education programs. Besides merely focusing on improving financial knowledge and skills, financial education programs might also consider individuals' psychological characteristics, such as people's confidence in their competences and capacity to control their own impulses. Such programs should also foster a better awareness of one's own financial capabilities and, at the same time, promote long-term attitudes to promote future-oriented financial behaviors, such as saving and investing. Indeed, providing information (i.e., increasing financial literacy) might not be enough for prompting sound financial decisions and behaviors.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The total sample (N = 1,110) was equally distributed for gender (49.7% female). The age of respondents ranged from 18 to 50 years old (M = 35.25, SD = 10.12). Considering education level, most of the sample (52.2%) had a high-school diploma. 29.7% of the participants had a university education and 18.1% had a middle school degree. Participants represented different Italian geographical areas: 41.1% of the respondents lived in northern parts of Italy (24.3% in the northwest and 16.8% in the north-east); 23.3% lived in central Italy, while the remaining part of the sample (35.6%) came from the south. Only 21% of the whole sample (n = 233) held at least one financial asset and were thus considered as current investors.</figDesc></figure>
