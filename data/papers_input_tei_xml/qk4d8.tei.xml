			<abstract>
				<p>Cooperative social behaviour in humans hinges upon our unique ability to make appropriate moral decisions in accordance with our ethical values. The complexity of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying moral reasoning is revealed when this capacity breaks down. Patients with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) display striking moral transgressions in the context of atrophy to frontotemporal regions supporting affective and social conceptual processing. Developmental studies have highlighted the importance of social knowledge to moral decision making in children, yet the role of social knowledge in relation to moral reasoning impairments in neurodegeneration has largely been overlooked. Here, we sought to examine the role of affective and social conceptual processes in personal moral reasoning in bvFTD, and their relationship to the integrity and structural connectivity of frontotemporal brain regions. Personal moral reasoning across varying degrees of conflict was assessed in 26 bvFTD patients and compared with demographically matched Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) patients (n = 14), and healthy older adults (n = 22). Following each moral decision, we directly probed participants&apos; subjective emotional experience as an index of their affective response, while social norm knowledge was assessed via an independent task. While groups did not differ significantly in terms of their moral decisions, bvFTD patients reported feeling better about their decisions than healthy Controls. In other words, although bvFTD patients could adjudicate between different courses of action in the moral scenarios, their affective responses to these decisions were highly irregular. This blunted emotional reaction was exclusive to the personal high-conflict condition, with 61.5% of bvFTD patients reporting feeling &apos;extremely good&apos; about their decisions, and was correlated with reduced knowledge of socially acceptable behaviour. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed a distributed network of frontal, subcortical, and lateral temporal grey matter regions involved in the attenuated affective response to moral conflict in bvFTD. Crucially, diffusion-tensor imaging implicated the uncinate fasciculus as the pathway by which social conceptual knowledge may influence emotional reactions to personal high-conflict moral dilemmas in bvFTD. Our findings suggest that altered moral behaviour in bvFTD reflects the dynamic interplay between degraded social conceptual knowledge and blunted affective responsiveness, attributable to atrophy of, and impaired information transfer between, frontal and temporal cortices. Delineating the mechanisms of impaired morality in bvFTD provides crucial clinical information for understanding and treating this challenging symptom, which may help pave the way for targeted behavioural interventions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In everyday life, we routinely make swift and effective moral judgments in accordance with our ethical values -a uniquely human attribute which forms the backbone of co-operative social behaviour. This capacity for moral reasoning has been the subject of vigorous philosophical debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hamlin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nichols, 2005)</ref>, most notably in relation to its origins and development throughout childhood. Specifically, the internalisation of societal rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Piaget, 1932)</ref> and maturity of social emotions such as guilt, shame, and empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hoffman, 1979)</ref> have emerged as key mechanisms underpinning the development of morality in children. What is less clear, however, is how these social, conceptual, and emotional processes unravel in neurodegenerative brain disorders. The study of moral reasoning in dementia offers a unique opportunity to characterise the neurocognitive mechanisms which must be functional to support highly sophisticated socioemotional processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Irish, Piguet, &amp; Hodges, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Contemporary studies of moral reasoning in adults have tended to invoke a dual processaccount to describe how emotional and rational processes compete <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cushman, Young, &amp; Greene, 2010)</ref>, particularly when deliberating on 'personal' versus 'impersonal' moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, &amp; Cohen, 2001)</ref>. Personal moral scenarios involve a decision to inflict direct harm on another individual (e.g., the footbridge problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Thomson, 1976)</ref>, and are thought to be heavily based on intuitive, emotional processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Valdesolo &amp; DeSteno, 2006)</ref>. By contrast, 'impersonal' moral dilemmas (e.g., the trolley problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Foot, 1967)</ref> preferentially draw upon controlled cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, &amp; Cohen, 2008)</ref>. Functional neuroimaging and lesion studies support this account, with an affective brain network anchored on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) implicated in personal moral reasoning, while lateral prefrontal regions have been associated with responses to impersonal dilemmas (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pascual, Rodrigues, &amp; Gallardo-Pujol, 2013)</ref>. Accumulating evidence, however, challenges this dichotomous approach, and suggests that additional cognitive processes may be involved in personal moral reasoning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McCormick, Rosenthal, Miller, &amp; Maguire, 2016)</ref>. Notably, social conceptual knowledge has been speculated to play an important role, whereby social rules and norms represented in anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) may be drawn upon to inform personal moral decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allison, Puce, &amp; McCarthy, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moll, Zahn, de Oliveira-Souza, Krueger, &amp; Grafman, 2005)</ref>. Empirical evidence for this perspective, however, is lacking. As such, it is unclear to what extent social conceptual knowledge contributes to personal moral reasoning, and how it may interact with emotional processes in supporting this endeavour.</p><p>One particularly fruitful avenue for exploring the mechanisms of moral reasoning is to study everyday examples of its breakdown. The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) offers a unique glimpse into the degeneration of the "social brain" given its hallmark alterations in personality and behaviour, including emotional blunting, loss of empathy, and an inability to consider the thoughts and perspectives of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dermody et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Strikwerda-Brown, Ramanan, &amp; Irish, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Synn et al., 2018)</ref>. These symptoms arise due to early degeneration of large-scale functional brain networks specialised for socioemotional functioning, centered on medial prefrontal and frontoinsular cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Seeley, Zhou, &amp; Kim, 2012)</ref>. With disease progression, atrophy gradually encroaches into lateral temporal areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Landin-Romero et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rosen et al., 2002)</ref> that support the processing of semantic and socioemotional concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Olson, McCoy, Klobusicky, &amp; Ross, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zahn et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Importantly, the frontotemporal regions harbouring early atrophy in bvFTD are consistently implicated in fMRI studies of personal moral reasoning in healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pascual et al., 2013</ref>), suggesting this capacity would be significantly compromised in this syndrome. Indeed, anecdotal evidence points to striking moral transgressions in bvFTD, ranging from acts of aggression, to urination in public, and making inappropriate sexual remarks to strangers <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Mendez, Chen, Shapira, &amp; Miller, 2005;</ref>. In some cases, these behaviours can result in criminal offences, including theft, violence, hypersexuality, traffic violations, and even homicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Liljegren et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To date, only a handful of studies have explored potential mechanisms mediating personal moral reasoning difficulties in bvFTD. Unsurprisingly, as emotional disturbances are a canonical feature of bvFTD, the majority of studies examining personal moral reasoning in this syndrome have placed particular emphasis on affective contributions. For example, the finding of increased utilitarian responses (i.e., 'for the greater good') to personal, but not impersonal, dilemmas in bvFTD compared with healthy controls has been suggested to reflect a diminished response to emotionally charged scenarios <ref type="bibr">(Chiong et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mendez, Anderson, &amp; Shapira, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mendez &amp; Shapira, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van den Stock et al., 2017)</ref>. Direct support for this proposal comes from the observation of decreased autonomic arousal and diminished emotional reactivity in bvFTD patients during personal moral decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fong et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, utilitarian responses to personal moral dilemmas in bvFTD have been shown to correlate with poor performance on an independent measure of facial emotion recognition <ref type="bibr">(Van den Stock et al., 2017)</ref>. On the neural level, these responses have been linked to structural and functional changes in medial prefrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices <ref type="bibr">(Chiong et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van den Stock et al., 2017)</ref>, particularly in the right hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mendez &amp; Shapira, 2009)</ref>. As such, the evidence to date suggests that impairments in personal moral reasoning in bvFTD are linked to attenuated emotional responsivity due to frontoinsular degeneration.</p><p>What remains less clear, however, is the role of social conceptual knowledge in moral reasoning difficulties in bvFTD. Deficits in semantic processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Williams, Nestor, &amp; Hodges, 2005)</ref>, including decreased knowledge of social rules and concepts <ref type="bibr">(Panchal et al., 2016)</ref>, are commonplace in bvFTD, particularly with encroachment of atrophy into ATLs. In this regard, it is notable that increased utilitarian responses to personal moral dilemmas have been associated with reduced perfusion/metabolism within the bilateral ATLs in bvFTD <ref type="bibr">(Mendez &amp; Shapiro, 2009)</ref>. While the processes underlying this association have not been explored, it is intuitive to propose that ATL dysfunction in these patients may hinder the consideration of social rules and norms during personal moral reasoning, resulting in aberrant moral decisions.</p><p>More recent findings in a small group of patients hint at a role for social conceptual knowledge in moral reasoning in bvFTD, with a correlation emerging between the understanding of social norms and experimenter ratings of patients' emotional reactivity toward a single personal moral dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fong et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus while the majority of studies on moral reasoning in bvFTD have focused on affective contributions, mediated by mPFC/frontoinsular regions, careful consideration of the extant literature suggests that social knowledge, supported by the ATLs, should also play a modulating role. Crucially, structural connectivity between the mPFC and ATLs via the uncinate fasciculus (UF) is compromised from early in the bvFTD disease trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lam, Halliday, Irish, Hodges, &amp; Piguet, 2014)</ref>. It is therefore possible that altered communication between regions supporting affective processing (i.e., mPFC) and those implicated in social conceptual knowledge (i.e., ATL) disrupt personal moral reasoning performance in this syndrome.</p><p>The objectives of the current study were four-fold. First, we sought to establish the nature of personal moral reasoning disturbances across varying degrees of conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Koenigs et al., 2007)</ref> in a large, well-characterised sample of bvFTD patients, and to contrast their performance with a disease control group of amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Second, we directly tested the contribution of impairments in affective responding to task performance in bvFTD by probing participants' own emotional experience following each morally conflicting decision. Third, to determine the potential role of social conceptual knowledge during highly conflicting moral deliberations, we included an objective measure of social rule understanding.</p><p>Finally, we used whole-brain multimodal structural neuroimaging to determine the grey-and white-matter correlates of personal moral reasoning in bvFTD. We predicted that both emotional responding and social conceptual knowledge would contribute to personal moral reasoning deficits in bvFTD, reflecting the degeneration of mPFC and ATLs, and crucially, the white-matter tracts connecting these regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Twenty-six patients with bvFTD, 14 AD patients, and 22 healthy Control participants completed this study. All participants were able to understand and follow task instructions.</p><p>Dementia patients met current international consensus criteria for bvFTD <ref type="bibr">(Rascovsky et al.,</ref>  Recall; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Schmidt, 1996)</ref> and nonverbal <ref type="bibr">(Rey Complex Figure [RCF]</ref> 3 minute recall; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rey, 1941)</ref> episodic memory, and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B-A; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Tombaugh, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Behavioural change was assessed using the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory (CBI Total Frequency Score; <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wedderburn et al., 2008)</ref>, and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (CDR-FTLD Sum of Boxes <ref type="bibr">[SOB]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Knopman et al., 2008)</ref> was employed as an index of disease severity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moral reasoning task</head><p>Participants completed a moral reasoning task, adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Koenigs et al. (2007)</ref>. Fourteen of the original 50 hypothetical scenarios were selected for the current study. These scenarios were representative of the full set of dilemmas (see Supplementary Methods for further detail).</p><p>The shortened version of the task lasted approximately 30-45 minutes, compared to &gt;60 minutes for the original version. This reduced task length was chosen to accommodate the cognitive abilities of the dementia patients, reduce the potential for participant distress, and avoid patient fatigue.</p><p>The 14 scenarios fell into four categories. Neutral scenarios (n = 4) were practical dilemmas without a moral component (e.g., choosing whether to buy a new DVD player, or have your old one fixed, for the same price). These scenarios acted as a control condition to ensure appropriate task understanding and compliance. Impersonal moral dilemmas (n = 4) required a choice whether to sacrifice the life of one person in order to save multiple lives, via the deflection of an existing threat (e.g., the traditional 'trolley problem', whereby flicking a switch would divert a runaway train from the track with five people on it, to a track with one person), or involved morally conflictual scenarios that did not require the infliction of direct personal harm (e.g., choosing whether to commit tax fraud). Personal moral dilemmas, requiring a choice to personally harm somebody in order to save multiple lives, were divided into High (n = 4) and Low (n = 2) Conflict scenarios. While Personal Low Conflict moral dilemmas involve rather inexcusable actions, which are often rejected by healthy individuals (e.g., committing cannibalism to save oneself and others), Personal High Conflict moral dilemmas (e.g., killing a fellow hostage so that oneself and others may escape from terrorists) are more divisive, and better differentiate between patient and control groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Koenigs et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McCormick et al., 2016)</ref> 1 .</p><p>Where necessary, phrasing of the scenarios was modified slightly from the original task for cultural appropriateness in an Australian context (e.g., exchanging 'watchman' for 'security guard'). The full text of all scenarios is provided in Supplementary Material, along with their original versions. Scenarios were presented in pseudorandomised order in text format on a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, and concurrently read aloud by the examiner to further ensure task understanding and compliance.</p><p>Each of the 14 dilemmas, along with one practice dilemma, consisted of five slides. An example five-slide trial for a Personal High Conflict moral dilemma is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The first slide displayed the scenario, ending with a yes/no question about the hypothetical action ("Would you … in order to …?"). No time limit was set, though if a response was not provided within approximately 15 seconds of the examiner reading the scenario, generic prompting was provided (e.g., re-reading of the question). Responses were classed as either Utilitarian (i.e., the maximising of aggregate welfare) or Deontological (i.e., a refusal to do harm). The percentage of Utilitarian decisions was calculated for each moral dilemma type (i.e., Impersonal, Personal Low Conflict, Personal High Conflict), for use in analysis.</p><p>In order to explore the mechanisms underlying moral decision making, the next four slides contained a series of follow-up questions regarding the decision-making process. Participants were required to rate "How sure are you about this decision?" (on a scale of 'Extremely Unsure'</p><p>(1) to 'Extremely Sure' (5)), "How do you feel about your decision?" (on a scale of 'Extremely Bad' (1) to 'Extremely Good' (5)) and "How vividly did you picture this scenario in your mind's eye?" (on a scale of 'Not Vividly at All (1) to 'Extremely Vividly' (5)). The average certainty, feeling, and vividness ratings were calculated for each of the moral dilemma types.</p><p>Finally, to capture the moral decision-making process, participants were asked the open-ended question: "How did you make your decision?" following every trial. During the practice trial at the beginning of the task, example responses to this question were provided (e.g., picturing the scene in the 'mind's eye'; emotions/gut reaction; knowledge of right/wrong; future consequences/outcome). In the main task, however, participants were encouraged to respond using their own words 2 . If the response was unclear, generic prompts were provided (e.g., "Can you tell me anything else about how you made your decision?"). Responses were later classed into either emotional (i.e., based on emotional reactions, or personal/societal beliefs about right and wrong) or rational (i.e., considering the outcome, or picturing the scene), consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McCormick et al. (2016)</ref>. A proportion of emotional reasons was then calculated for each dilemma type, by dividing the number of emotional responses by the number of dilemmas.</p><p>Example responses of each type are provided in Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social norms questionnaire</head><p>To explore the effect of social conceptual knowledge on moral decision making, the Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ; Possin et al., 2013) was administered. The SNQ measures the ability to identify socially appropriate and inappropriate behaviours. For each of the 22 items, participants are required to respond yes or no as to whether a hypothetical behaviour would be considered socially appropriate in mainstream local culture. To ensure cultural appropriateness for an Australian sample, slight modifications were made to the phrasing of the original version (e.g., switching 'sidewalk' to 'footpath'; see Supplementary Material for a comparison of the two versions). Total number of errors was calculated, with higher values reflecting poorer social knowledge. Separate scores were also obtained for errors on the 'Break Norms' (rating socially unacceptable behaviours as acceptable, e.g., telling a stranger you don't like their hairstyle), and 'Overadherence' (rating socially acceptable behaviours as unacceptable, e.g., telling a stranger you like their hairstyle) subscales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>First, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests were performed to determine the suitability of variables for parametric analyses. Experimental variables that were non-normally distributed (i.e., K-S test p &lt; .05 in one or both patient groups) were logarithmically transformed, though for ease of interpretation, untransformed values are presented in figures. One-way analyses of variance were employed to assess group differences on demographic measures and neuropsychological tasks. Frequencies of dichotomous variables (i.e., sex) were compared with chi-squared tests (c 2 ). Given significant differences in years of formal education between bvFTD and Controls, education was included as a covariate for all main between-group analyses on the experimental task. First, repeated measures ANCOVAs were used to investigate main effects of group (bvFTD, AD, Control) and dilemma type (Impersonal, Personal Low-Conflict, Personal High-Conflict), and their interaction, on the percentage of Utilitarian responses provided followed by Sidak post hoc tests where appropriate. For the subjective ratings, non-parametric Kruskal Wallis tests, were run to examine between-group differences in average Certainty, Feeling and Vividness ratings followed by Dunn-Bonferroni tests where relevant. Univariate ANCOVA was used to investigate between-group differences in the proportion of emotional reasons given for the decisions. For the SNQ, a repeatedmeasures ANCOVA, followed by Sidak post hoc tests, was employed to explore main effects of group and error type (Rule Break, Overadhere), and their interaction. Finally, Spearman's correlations were employed to examine the relationship between moral reasoning performance and the SNQ questionnaire. The significance level was set at p &lt; .05 for all analyses. Effect sizes were calculated using partial eta-squared (hp 2 ) for parametric analyses and eta-squared (h 2 ) for nonparametric analyses.</p></div>

Inspection of the individual responses of participants revealed that 3 Controls, 1 bvFTD, and 3 AD patients responded counterintuitively to one out of four of the neutral scenarios; however, their verbal explanations for these decisions indicated that these participants had nonetheless understood the dilemma (e.g., responding that they would rather save 15 minutes off a car trip than take the beautiful scenic route).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Moral reasoning forms the backbone of social groups, with deleterious consequences when this foundation breaks down. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that patients diagnosed with the behavioural variant of FTD display aberrant emotional responses to highly conflictual personal moral decisions. Importantly, their lack of negative affect is related, at least in part, to the deterioration of conceptual knowledge of what is right and wrong in social contexts. Our neuroimaging analyses revealed that diminished emotional responses to morally conflicting decisions in bvFTD reflects the degeneration of a distributed network of frontal, subcortical, and temporal regions, as well as their white-matter structural pathways. Crucially, the uncinate fasciculus (UF) emerged as a potential conduit by which social conceptual knowledge may influence emotional reactions to personal high-conflict moral dilemmas in bvFTD.</p><p>Deciding whether to personally harm somebody or indirectly cause the harm of many others is a highly conflictual endeavour that invariably invokes strong social emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Koenigs et al., 2007)</ref>. Although bvFTD patients appeared capable of adjudicating between different courses of action in these scenarios, with no significant between-group differences in the actual moral decisions made or in their verbal justifications, the emotional responses in bvFTD departed considerably from that of Controls. Strikingly, bvFTD patients displayed an abnormal affective response specific to personal high-(but not low-) conflict moral dilemmas, whereby they reported feeling less negative emotion about their decisions compared with Controls. At its most extreme, 16 out of the 26 (i.e., 61.5%) of bvFTD patients reported that they felt 'extremely good' about their decision on at least one personal high-conflict dilemma. Previous studies of moral reasoning in bvFTD have explored associations between task performance and non-task related measures of emotion processing <ref type="bibr">(Van den Stock et al., 2017)</ref>, or alternatively have used experimenter ratings as a proxy for the patient's emotional responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fong et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Disrupted emotion recognition is a core clinical feature of bvFTD, most pronounced in relation to negative emotions (e.g., disgust, fear; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kumfor, Irish, Hodges, &amp; Piguet, 2013)</ref>. Crucially, the blunting of emotional reactions is also prominent in this syndrome <ref type="bibr">(Neary et al., 1998)</ref>, particularly in relation to self-conscious moral emotions such as guilt, shame, and embarrassment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Darby, Edersheim, &amp; Price, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Sturm, Ascher, Miller, &amp; Levenson, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>By directly surveying the subjective emotional experience of bvFTD patients in response to highly conflictual personal moral dilemmas, we reveal for the first time that the blunting of socially relevant self-conscious emotions in bvFTD extends to the arena of moral decisionmaking.</p><p>On the neural level, the blunted emotional response to personal high-conflict moral dilemmas in bvFTD was associated with reduced grey matter intensity in frontal and subcortical brain regions typically associated with emotion and salience processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Frith, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Seeley et al., 2007)</ref>. Chief amongst these were the bilateral mPFC, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus. This finding converges strongly with functional neuroimaging studies of personal moral reasoning in healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pascual et al., 2013)</ref>, indicating that this affective network may be essential for personal moral reasoning (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Irish &amp; van Kesteren, 2018)</ref>. Of note, the brain regions that emerged in our analyses overlap with those implicated in moral emotions including guilt and shame in healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bastin, Harrison, Davey, Moll, &amp; Whittle, 2016)</ref>, along with the experience of Schadenfreude and envy in bvFTD <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Santamaría-García et al., 2017)</ref>. We tentatively suggest that fronto-subcortical atrophy disrupts the capacity to experience socially-oriented negative emotions in bvFTD, resulting in their seeming indifference towards the outcome of their</p><p>decisions.</p><p>An important aim of this study was to explore the contribution of social conceptual knowledge to personal high-conflict moral dilemmas. To date, the role of social rules and norms in moral reasoning has been studied almost exclusively in relation to moral development in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Piaget, 1932)</ref>. Here, we reveal its potential involvement in the unravelling of morality in neurodegeneration, via interactions with affective processes. Interestingly, we found a significant association between attenuated emotional reaction to these dilemmas and impaired conceptual knowledge of socially acceptable behaviour in bvFTD. Personal high-conflict moral dilemmas inherently involve the violation of social norms, regardless of one's decision (i.e., choosing to personally harm one person or bring about the harm of many others). Our findings therefore suggest that as conceptual knowledge of social standards and norms degrades in bvFTD, so too does the accompanying self-conscious, negative emotional experience when such standards are violated <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Staller &amp; Petta, 2001</ref>). For example, if these patients lose the conceptual knowledge that it is wrong to harm others, they may not feel remorseful when choosing this course of action in the moral dilemma. Supporting this proposal is the observation that bvFTD patients tend to judge intentional harm (i.e., the type of harm involved in personal high-conflict dilemmas) as more permissible than healthy subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baez et al., 2016)</ref>. Interestingly, however, the altered emotional responses in bvFTD do not seem to impact upon their actual moral judgments. As such, rather than representing a global decay in moral reasoning, the severe alterations in moral behaviour witnessed in bvFTD likely reflect the dynamic interplay between degraded social conceptual knowledge and blunted affective responsiveness.</p><p>In addition to regions typically associated with affective processing, an attenuated emotional response to personal high-conflict moral dilemmas was related to reduced grey matter integrity of the bilateral temporal poles. The ATLs have a well-established role in representing conceptual knowledge, including knowledge of social rules, norms, and socially appropriate behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Olson et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Panchal et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zahn et al., 2007)</ref>. While ATL activation is commonplace during functional neuroimaging studies of personal moral reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pascual et al., 2013)</ref>, the precise role of this region in moral decision making has thus far remained unclear. Taken together with the behavioural findings, we suggest that social conceptual knowledge represented in the ATLs may guide the appropriate affective response to highly conflictual personal moral dilemmas. Indeed, these complex socially-oriented emotional reactions are likely subtended by interacting emotional and social conceptual processes, supported by frontal and temporal regions, respectively. Accordingly, we can infer that the seamless and coordinated interplay between these processes hinges upon successful communication between frontal and temporal structures, suggesting a critical role for white matter pathways which connect these regions.</p><p>This proposal was borne out in our diffusion-weighted imaging analyses. Indeed, we revealed a robust association between the abnormal emotional response to personal high-conflict moral dilemmas in bvFTD and reduced integrity of the bilateral uncinate fasciculus (UF), a tract connecting the orbitofrontal/mPFC to the ATLs, but not with the control tract, the ILF.</p><p>Compellingly, when social conceptual knowledge was controlled for, the relationship between integrity of the UF and emotional response to moral dilemmas no longer reached statistical significance. This suggests that social conceptual knowledge partially explains the relationship between the emotional response to moral conflict and integrity of the UF. While the UF has been suggested to support socioemotional functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Von Der Heide et al., 2013)</ref>, the precise mechanism by which it operates has not yet been delineated. Its anatomical position, lying at the interface between regions specialised for affective (i.e., orbitofrontal/mPFC) and conceptual (i.e., ATL) cortical regions, offers important clues. For the first time, our findings suggest that during personal high-conflict moral dilemmas, the UF may form the pathway by which social conceptual knowledge (from the ATLs) is integrated with information represented in the mPFC (e.g., social schemas, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gilboa &amp; Marlatte, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Wilson et al., 2020)</ref> to inform the emotional response. The degradation of this tract in bvFTD likely impedes the transfer of socioemotional information between frontal and temporal regions, further blunting these patients' emotional responses under conditions of high moral conflict.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Future Directions</head><p>Due to the legal, ethical, and societal implications of moral transgressions, it is imperative to reach a precise understanding of the cognitive and neural bases of moral reasoning. Here, by leveraging a large sample of bvFTD patients, we demonstrate how affective processing and social conceptual knowledge likely interact during the service of personal high-conflict moral decision making. Based on our findings, we propose that knowledge of social norms, stored in the ATLs, is conveyed to the mPFC where it is incorporated in the production of an emotional response to personal, highly conflictual moral dilemmas. In order to confirm this hypothesised directionality, future studies examining functional and effective connectivity between mPFC and ATLs, and its relationship with specific aspects of emotion and conceptual knowledge during personal moral reasoning, will be of utmost interest. While we did not have the statistical power in the current study, it will also be important to explore whether, and how, these processes vary across different types of personal high-conflict moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Rosas &amp; Koenigs, 2014)</ref>. Finally, despite not forming the focus of our investigations, significant potential scope exists for delineating additional neurocognitive processes involved in personal moral decision making, such as episodic memory (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Craver et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">McCormick et al., 2016 and Supplementary Results)</ref>, cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, &amp; Cohen, 2004)</ref>, and theory of mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Roberts, Henry, &amp; Molenberghs, 2019;</ref>. By unpacking the mechanisms of altered morality in bvFTD, we provide crucial clinical information for understanding and treating this challenging symptom, in turn paving the way for targeted behavioural interventions. and the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders (CE11000102).

Control participants scored in the cognitively normal range (i.e., 88/100 or above) on a general cognitive screening measure, the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) (Hsieh, Schubert, Hoon, Mioshi, &amp; Hodges, 2013). Exclusion criteria for all participants included a significant history of another psychiatric or neurological condition or alcohol or substance abuse, and limited English proficiency. Ethics approval was obtained from the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District and University of New South Wales ethics committees. In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, informed consent was obtained from all participants or their person responsible. Neuropsychological assessment Participants completed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological assessment tasks. This included a measure of global cognition (ACE-III), along with more detailed examination of specific cognitive domains including verbal attention and working memory (Digit Span Forward and Backward Maximum Span; Wechsler, 1997), language (ACE-III Language subscale; Hsieh et al., 2013), verbal (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT] Delayed</figDesc></figure>
