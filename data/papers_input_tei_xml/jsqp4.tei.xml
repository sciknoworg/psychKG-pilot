			<abstract>
				<p>Previous research has shown that episodic memory influences decisions, with people exhibiting too strong preferences for remembered over forgotten options. However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying this memory bias remain elusive. Here, we propose that choosing forgotten (or poorly remembered) options is conceptually similar to choosing options with uncertain outcomes. Following this rationale, we predicted that the memory bias is reduced when options have negative subjective value-analogous to the reflection effect, according to which uncertainty aversion is stronger in gains than in losses. In two preregistered experiments, participants made memory-based decisions between sets of appetitive or aversive stimuli. As predicted, people preferred remembered over forgotten options in the gain domain, but this behavioral pattern reversed in the loss domain. Our results contribute to an increasing understanding of the role of memory in decision making and connect this emerging field to the well-established research on decisions under risk and uncertainty.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many of our daily choices require us to retrieve relevant information from memory, and the role of memory in shaping such value-based decisions is receiving growing interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Shadlen &amp; Shohamy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Weilbächer &amp; Gluth, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wimmer &amp; Büchel, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Weber &amp; Johnson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Murty, Feldmanhall, Hunter, Phelps, &amp; Davachi, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gershman &amp; Daw, 2017)</ref>. Episodic memory and decision making were studied separately for decades, but more recent studies have started to investigate how these two psychological constructs interact <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Murty et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gershman &amp; Daw, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wimmer &amp; Büchel, 2016)</ref>. In our own previous work, we have shown that memory-based decisions can give rise to a bias in choice behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gluth, Sommer, Rieskamp, &amp; Büchel, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mechera-Ostrovsky &amp; Gluth, 2018)</ref>. More precisely, the memory bias in preferential choice states that people tend to prefer options they remember better to an extent that is not compatible with standard notions of optimality and utility maximization. To illustrate this, take a decision between two hiking locations, A and B, of equal subjective value. Remembering past experiences of hiking location A more vividly than B will induce a preference for A over B. In fact, our findings suggest that even if A has somewhat lower subjective value than B, the memory bias still induces a preference for A.</p><p>An open question is why people exhibit this memory bias, or stated differently, what the cognitive mechanisms are that drive this effect. Here, we argue that uncertainty plays a critical role in decisions from memory and can explain why people show a memory bias.</p><p>We assume that choosing between a vividly remembered and a poorly remembered option is conceptually similar to choosing between a certain and an uncertain option. Importantly, research on decision making under risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</ref>) and ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kahn &amp; Sarin, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Viscusi &amp; Magat, 1992)</ref> have demonstrated a reflection effect, meaning that uncertainty aversion is less pronounced and sometimes even reverses in the loss as compared to the gain domain. Thus, we derive the analogous hypothesis that the memory bias is stronger in the gain domain than in the loss domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS 4</head><p>To investigate this hypothesis, we leveraged our remember-and-decide task <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gluth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mechera-Ostrovsky &amp; Gluth, 2018)</ref>, in which participants first learn to associate different choice options with different locations and then make a series of value-based decisions between two highlighted locations ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Since only the locations but not the choice options themselves are presented, participants need to recall the options from their memory when making decisions. Following these decisions, participants are then asked to recall the option-location associations, which allows us to identify remembered and forgotten options. Ultimately, the memory bias is quantified by the strength of preference for remembered over forgotten options. So far, this task has only been used with appetitive (food snack) items. As we aimed to investigate decisions in the gain as well as in the loss domain in the current study, we used appetitive and aversive images in one experiment and positive and negative monetary amounts in a second independent experiment. Beyond testing our main hypothesis, these two experiments with their different sets of stimuli also allowed us to assess to what extent the memory bias (and its putative reversal in the loss domain) generalizes to different domains of decision making.</p><p>In essence, we found that participants indeed preferred remembered over forgotten options in the gain domain, but showed the opposite pattern in the loss domain. This confirms our hypothesis of an analogy between decisions from memory and decisions under uncertainty. Thus, with respect to options of positive subjective value, people stick to better remembered options and avoid the risk of choosing what they do not recall well. But when it comes to options of negative subjective value, people take the risk of choosing the unknown.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> . The remember-and-decide task for the Images Experiment. Participants first encode the association of images with locations on the screen. After a distracting working-memory task, they make binary decisions between the images from memory. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We preregistered our two experiments (including hypotheses, experimental design, and analysis plan) on the Open Science Framework website (https://osf.io/eumj5). The complete project (including the processed data and data analysis files in the programming language R) can be found here https://osf.io/x935r/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited at the University of Basel (convenience sampling). In the Images Experiment a total of 53 participants started the experiment. In the Money Experiment a total of 47 participants started the experiment. Participants were between 18 and 35 years old, did not suffer from mental disorders, and were allowed to participate in only one of the two experiments.</p><p>Based on our preregistered exclusion criteria, we did not analyze the data of 17 participants from the Images Experiment for the following reasons: The participant aborted the study (n=2), did not perform all tasks (n=1), were not in the targeted age range (n=1), did not yield the minimal number of trials for the logistic regression analysis (see below; n=8), rated less than 30 images as positive or less than 30 images as negative (n=5). For the Money experiment, we did not analyze the data of 11 participants for the following reasons: Participant aborted the study (n=5), did not perform all tasks (n=2), were not in the targeted age range (n=1), did not yield the minimal number of trials for the logistic regression analysis (n=2), did not understand the n-back task (n=1). We thus included n=36 participants for the analysis of the Images Experiment (25 women, age: Participants could only take part in the study after reading and signing the informed consent form, which had been approved by the ethics committee of north-west and central Switzerland (EKNZ). Participants were reimbursed 5 CHF for every started 15 minutes REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS 7 (resulting in CHF per hour). Psychology students of the University of Basel had the opportunity to receive course credits instead of the monetary reimbursement. Additionally, in the Images Experiment participants received a bonus in the sense of looking at the image that they selected in a randomly selected choice trial (details provided below). In the Money Experiment participants could earn a monetary bonus between 0 and 9.50 CHF based on their decision in a randomly selected choice trial. In the additional gambles task that participants in both experiments performed on a separate day (details provided below), participants also had the opportunity to receive a monetary bonus between 0 and 60 CHF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus and Stimuli</head><p>Participants were seated in front of a 24-in. computer screen (resolution 1680 x 1050 pixel, refresh rate 60Hz). Stimulus presentation and creation of choice sets were realized using MATLAB Version R2016a and its toolbox Cogent 2000 (version 1.33). The screen resolution was set to 1280 x 1024 pixel.</p><p>The images for the Images Experiment were selected from the OASIS database <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kurdi, Lozano, &amp; Banaji, 2017)</ref>. The OASIS database includes a total of 900 images. To reduce the amount of images for our preference rating task, we first excluded all images with arousal and/or valence ratings &lt;2 and &gt;5 (ratings were on a scale from 1 to 7, rated by a large sample of n=822 participants; details provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kurdi et al. (2017)</ref>). Thereby, we excluded too arousing images (e.g., mutilations) and not arousing images, to avoid that some images were much more memorable than others. Second, we excluded all images from the category "Nudes". Third, we renamed redundant categories (e.g. "Graveyard" and "Cemetery"). Fourth, we selected one image per category (e.g., if 5 images displayed a dog, one of them which was judged to be most representative was selected). This procedure resulted in a final set of 103 images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS 8</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedures</head><p>We conducted two independent experiments, and each participant was allowed to take part in only one of them. Each experiment consisted of two sessions, performed with a delay of one week ± three days. The two experiments differed only in the used stimulus material: images or money. In the first session, after participants gave their informed consent, they read the instructions for the remember-and-decide task (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gluth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mechera-Ostrovsky and Gluth, 2018)</ref>. The task consists of multiple blocks of 4 phases each: 1) encoding of the association of six locations and the choice options (money or images), 2) 2-back working memory task, 3) binary choice task (in which the options need to be recalled from memory, as only the locations are presented), and 4) cued recall of the six stimuli ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Participants were familiarized with the task by performing two training rounds. Afterwards, they conducted 24 rounds in total -12 times with negative stimuli and 12 times with positive stimuli. The order (positive or negative first) was counterbalanced across participants. In the Images Experiment participants made one break between the two blocks (12 rounds). In the Money Experiment participants made a break after each quarter of the rounds (6 rounds).</p><p>In the Images Experiment, participants' subjective value of the images was assessed with an incentivized rating task prior to the remember-and-decide task. Participants rated the images on a discrete rating scale ranging from -10 to 10 in steps of 1. They were asked to use the entire range of the rating scale and rated every image twice. To incentivize the rating task, participants were informed that at the end of the experiment two images were drawn randomly, and that the higher-rated image was presented to them for 3 minutes.</p><p>The 103 rated images were divided into positive and negative images, based on the mean rating value. For the remember-and-decide task, at least 30 positively and 30 negatively rated images were needed to generate enough trials. Based on previous experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gluth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mechera-Ostrovsky &amp; Gluth, 2018)</ref>, the two images with the most extreme negative and positive ratings were excluded, because people tend to have exceptionally REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS 9 good memory for these items. In case a participant had rated less than 30 images as positive on average or less than 30 images as negative on average (for example when the participant used only the negative part of the rating scale), the participant was informed that it was not possible to generate enough trials and the experiment was aborted. In this case, the data being collected so far was not used for data analysis. In the Money Experiment, the positive (appetitive) stimuli were monetary values ranging from 10 to 95 in experimental currency unit (ECU) which were translated into Swiss Francs (CHF) by being divided by 20 (e.g. 95 ECU = 4.75 CHF). Similarly, the negative (aversive) stimuli were monetary values ranging from -95 to -10 in steps of 5, resulting in 18 stimuli each.</p><p>Participants could win up to 4.75 CHF from the gains trials and the loss trials, respectively, resulting in a possible bonus of 9.5 CHF. In the gains lottery, participants earned the monetary amount they chose in the randomly selected choice trial, whereas in the losses the amount of the choice was subtracted from and initial endowment of 4.75 CHF (e.g., if a trial was selected, where the participant choose -50 ECU, she received the following bonus: 4.75 -[50 ECU / 20] = 2.25).</p><p>This first session lasted approximately 75 to 90 minutes. On average the Images Experiment lasted approximately 15 to 20 minutes longer than the Money Experiment, because of the additional rating task. At the end of session 1, participants could indicate in an answer box which strategy they used to memorize the stimuli.</p><p>In the second session (approx. 30 min), participants first reported demographic information about their age, country, education, gender, handiness, income, current job and mother tongue. Afterwards, they completed two tasks. First, they performed the estimate-your-memory task, in which they indicated how well they remembered each possible item from the remember-and-decide task of session 1 (similar to Mechera-Ostrovsky and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gluth, 2018)</ref>. Second, they performed a gambling task (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3)</ref> including risky and ambiguous gambles in the gain and the loss domain. We included this task to test whether participants who exhibit a stronger reduction of the memory bias in REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS 10 the loss compared to the gain domain would also show a stronger reflection effect in decision under risk or ambiguity. We adapted a task from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Levy, Snell, Nelson, Rustichini, &amp; Glimcher, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Tymula, Rosenberg Belmaker, Ruderman, Glimcher, &amp; Levy, 2013)</ref>, in which participants made binary decisions between a sure gain/loss of a small amount of money (in our case ±5 CHF) and a risky or ambiguous gamble of a larger gain/loss amount. More specifically, participants could either choose ±5 CHF for sure or an amount between ±6 and ±30 CHF with a given probability. During a trial, participants first saw a fixation cross for 1s, followed by the depiction of the safe amount and the lottery. They had 10s to indicate their choice by pressing either the Q (left choice) or P (right choice) button on a keyboard. Finally, a green feedback rectangle appeared around their chosen option for 1s. The gambles included six gain/loss amounts <ref type="bibr">(±6 ,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">30 CHF)</ref>. The risky trials had five winning probability levels (0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.65, 0.8). In the ambiguous trials, the five levels of ambiguity (0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.65, 0.8) were indicated by the area of a grey bar which prevented a glimpse on the underlying probabilities. Following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Levy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Tymula et al., 2013)</ref>, the grey bar covered the red (lottery probability) and the blue (safe option probability) parts to the same extent.</p><p>Therefore, if an ambiguous trial was played at the end of the experiment, a random number between the lowest winning probability and the highest (area covered by the grey bar) was drawn. Then an outcome was drawn based on this randomly selected probability.</p><p>We repeated each amount twice, thus resulting in a total of 240 trials [12 unique amounts x (5 probability levels + 5 ambiguity levels) x 2 repetitions]. Seven participants in the Money Experiment did 280 trials, because an older version of the experiment was used, in which 40 catch trials with one option stochastically dominating the other option (e.g., choice between 5 CHF for sure and 5 CHF with a probability of 80%) were included. These trials were excluded for analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data exclusion</head><p>To ensure high data quality, we specified and preregistered a number of exclusion criteria. The following criteria were assessed separately for positive and negative trials:</p><p>First, to reliably assess the memory bias with a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression model, we determined a minimum number of 20 trials per participant, in which one option has been remembered, while the other has been forgotten. Moreover, we required a minimum number of 5 per observed choice (i.e., remembered option chosen; forgotten option chosen). These numbers were based on analyzes of pilot data. Additionally, we adopted a hierarchical Bayesian approach with mildly informed priors that is more robust compared to frequentist approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gordóvil-Merino, Guàrdia-Olmos, &amp; Peró-Cebollero, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McNeish, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kruschke, 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, participants who responded too fast (i.e., RT &lt;200 ms) in ≥ 30% of trials of the decision task or in ≥ 30% of the gambles task were excluded (however, none of the participants had to be excluded for being too fast).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Memory bias estimation. The memory bias was assessed in a similar way compared to our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gluth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mechera-Ostrovsky &amp; Gluth, 2018)</ref>, but instead of maximum likelihood estimation we employed hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression analyses. The memory bias analyses are based on trials with one remembered and one forgotten option. The probability p i to choose the remembered option i over the forgotten option is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p i = logit(β 0 + β 1 * x i ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x i refers to the standardized subjective value of option i, and β 0 and β 1 refer to intercept and slope coefficients, respectively. The probability that the remembered item will be chosen is estimated by drawing from a Bernoulli distribution with success probability p i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y ∼ Bern(p i ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>Hierarchical priors for the two regression coefficients in the model (β and β ) and hyper priors are specified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">µ β ∼ N (0, 1) σ β ∼ Inv-Gamma(3, 0.5) β ∼ N (µ β , σ β )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In words, for each coefficient the mean µ β was drawn from a normal distribution, and the standard deviation σ β was drawn from an inverse gamma distribution. The standard deviation had a lower bound of 0.</p><p>The slope of the logistic function β 1 specifies to what extent decisions depend on the value of the remembered option, the intercept β 0 quantifies the overall tendency to prefer remembered or forgotten options, and thus the memory bias. Notably, in our previous work we introduced a corrected version of the memory bias which controls for the possibility that participants remember high-value options better than low-value options <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mechera-Ostrovsky &amp; Gluth, 2018)</ref>. This correction consists of subtracting the average value of all forgotten options from the value of the remembered option x i . In the present study, we also implemented this correction when quantifying the memory bias.</p><p>The statistical test for an influence of memory on choice was based on the group posterior distributions of the intercept parameter β 0 . If the 90% HDI of the distribution did not overlap with 0, we inferred a significant memory bias (a positive memory bias if the distribution lies to the right of 0, a negative memory bias if the distribution lies to the left of 0). 1 Moreover, to test for the difference between gains and losses, we subtracted the 1 At this point, we deviated from our preregistration protocol, in which we announced to fit the logistic regression model and perform frequentist tests on the means of the individual posterior distributions. Such a two-step procedure can lead to inflated results in favor of the alternative hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boehm, Marsman, Matzke, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, here we report the fully Bayesian tests only. For completeness the SOM includes the (invalid) two-step approach as well as a (purely frequentist) random-effects regression analysis (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gluth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mechera-Ostrovsky and Gluth, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS 13</head><p>respective group posterior distributions and tested for an overlap with as before. As a sanity check that participants take the value of remembered options into account when choosing between a remembered and a forgotten option, we also checked that the posterior distribution of the mean slope parameter β 1 was larger than 0 in all conditions (gains and losses, Images and Money Experiments) by testing whether the 90% HDI (highest density interval) did not overlap with 0.</p><p>Risk and ambiguity attitudes assessment. To assess participants' risk and ambiguity parameters we used an adapted version of a previously proposed model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Levy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">FeldmanHall, Glimcher, Baker, &amp; Phelps, 2016)</ref>. According to this model, the subjective value of an option is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">SV = (p − β * A 2 ) * v α (4)</formula><p>where p is the probability of the gain/loss amount of the lottery, A indicates the level of ambiguity, v is the gain/loss amount, α the individual risk attitude and β the individual ambiguity attitude. Note that a loss aversion parameter is not included, because the task does not contain mixed lotteries, and risk and ambiguity attitudes are estimated separately for gains and losses. The probability of choosing the lottery is given by a logit function (as in Equation 1) with the intercept being fixed at 0.</p><p>Notably, we adopted a "bug fix" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Stewart, Scheibehenne, &amp; Pachur, 2018)</ref> that ensures commensurability of the sensitivity parameter γ across different risk preferences. Without this bug fix the risk parameter α trades off with the sensitivity parameter, because the risk parameter determines the range of possible values (e.g., the range is much larger if α=2 compared to α=1/2). This problem is solved by transforming the subjective value SV as follows: Similar to the logistic regression described above, the model prior and hyper-priors were specified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">SV = SV 1/α for SV ≥ 0 SV = −(| SV |) 1/α for SV &lt; 0<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">µ β ∼ N (0, 1) σ β ∼ Inv-Gamma(3, 0.5) β ∼ N (µ β , σ β )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Risk and Ambiguity attitudes were estimated separately for gains and losses, and for the two experiments (Images and Money).</p><p>To test our predictions that the memory bias is related to ambiguity (but not risk)</p><p>attitudes, we estimated a linear regression predicting the difference of the memory bias between gains and losses with the following three predictors: i) the experiment (Images and Money), ii) the difference in risk attitudes (gains -losses), and iii) the ambiguity attitudes (gains -losses). As exploratory analyses, we also correlated the mean estimates for the memory bias with the mean estimates of the risk and ambiguity attitudes (separately for gains and losses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The memory bias in preferential choice in gains and losses. Our central hypothesis was that the memory bias, that is, the tendency to prefer remembered over forgotten options, is more positive in the gain as compared to the loss domain. To test this hypothesis, we performed hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression analyses for trials with one remembered and one forgotten option, and predicted the choice of the remembered option based on its value. Before testing for the memory bias, however, we checked whether participants were more likely to choose remembered options of higher subjective More importantly, to test for a more positive memory bias in gains compared to losses we contrasted the group-level posterior distributions of the logistic intercept coefficient between gains and losses. In both experiments, we found that the memory bias was more positive in the gain than in the loss domain, and that the overlap of the two posterior distributions was less than 5% (i.e., 0.01% in the Images Experiment and 4.24%</p><p>in the Money Experiment), which confirmed our hypothesis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 2)</ref>. In addition, we tested whether the memory bias was positive in the gain domain and negative in the loss domain Testing an association of the memory bias with risk and ambiguity aversion. In addition to our main hypothesis, we tested whether the difference of the memory bias in gains vs. losses is correlated with the difference in risk or ambiguity aversion in gains vs. losses. We predicted to find an association with ambiguity but not risk, because choosing a forgotten option should be conceptually similar to choosing a lottery option whose probabilities are not even known. To test this hypothesis, participants in both experiments performed an additional task, in which they made binary decisions between a sure gain or loss and either a risky or ambiguous lottery ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2a and b)</ref>.

We found that neither the ambiguity nor the risk attitudes as measured by the gambles task were related to the memory bias (effect of ambiguity: p = .58; effect of risk: p = .95).</p><p>As additional exploratory analyses, we correlated the gain-loss difference in the memory bias with the gain-loss difference in risk and ambiguity attitudes. Results indicate that neither the risk attitude nor the ambiguity attitude as measured by the gambles task was related to the memory bias ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3c and d)</ref>. More specifically, we calculated the correlations separate per experiment (money or images), finding no significant correlation </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the current preregistered study, we investigated an analogy between decisions from memory and decisions under uncertainty. More specifically we tested whether the memory bias on preferential choice underlies characteristics of the well-known reflection effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kahn &amp; Sarin, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Viscusi &amp; Magat, 1992)</ref>. If so, it should be reduced and possibly even reversed in the loss domain, meaning that people should prefer forgotten over remembered options of negative subjective value. We conducted two experiments in which participants made preferential choices from memory between images and money amounts. Both experiments were carried out within the gain and loss domain. In both experiments, we observed that participants preferred remembered options in the gain domain but forgotten options in the loss domain, with the gain-loss difference being significant. These results confirm our hypothesis that the memory bias shares characteristics with decisions under uncertainty.</p><p>By drawing a link between memory and uncertainty, our work connects two hitherto separate branches of decision-making research. It suggests that the uncertainty entailed in weak memories influence our choice behavior. Importantly, this connection offers several new avenues for future research. First, it will be important to further specify the nature of memory-induced uncertainty in more detail. Along this line, we speculate that the strength of memory for an option could be conceptualized as the probability weight assigned to it.</p><p>Thus, a parametric effect of memory strength could exhibit a similar profile as the probability weighting function of prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref> and lead to similar effects on behavior. Among such effects are the certainty and the possibility effect, according to which the subjective weighting of sure (i.e., 100%) and impossible (i.e., 0%)</p><p>events is exceptionally larger/smaller than those of almost sure (e.g., 99%) and almost impossible (e.g., 1%) events. If memory strength exhibits a similar weighting profile, then remembering an option "for sure" (i.e., in all its episodic details) and not remembering an option at all should have exceptionally strong influences on our decisions. Second, the link between memory and uncertainty could stimulate research on the impact of inter-individual differences in memory abilities on decision making. For example, the fact that episodic memory shows a considerable decline over the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Nyberg, Lövdén, Riklund, Lindenberger, &amp; Bäckman, 2012)</ref> should have important implications for older adults' attitudes toward uncertainty, at least with respect to those decisions that rely heavily on memory retrieval. Third, it will be critical to test whether our notion of a memory-uncertainty link can be supported by neuroscientific data. More specifically, REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS 20 neuroimaging research on decision under risk and uncertainty suggest a brain circuitry comprising the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) being involved in ambiguous choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hsu, Bhatt, Adolphs, Tranel, &amp; Camerer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Huettel, Stowe, Gordon, Warner, &amp; Platt, 2006)</ref>, as well as the dmPFC and the anterior insula (aIns) being critical to risky choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Morriss, Gell, &amp; van Reekum, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mohr, Biele, &amp; Heekeren, 2010)</ref>. The aIns is also central to the processing of aversive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nitschke, Sarinopoulos, Mackiewicz, Schaefer, &amp; Davidson, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, we assert that these areas should also be involved in memory-based decisions, possibly as a (negative) function of the vividness with which the chosen option is remembered.</p><p>Contrary to our prediction, the gain-loss difference in the memory bias was not related to the corresponding difference in participants' ambiguity (or risk) attitudes. This result may relate to the finding that behavioral risk measures appear to have a low test-retest reliability and low construct validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Frey, Pedroni, Mata, Rieskamp, &amp; Hertwig, 2017)</ref>, rendering them less suitable for studying inter-individual differences. In this light, future studies may consider adding self-report measures of risk and ambiguity, as these measures appear to have higher reliability and validity. On the other hand, with our lottery task, we may have been measuring a domain-specific risk and ambiguity attitude, which is not or only weakly related to the uncertainty evoked in memory-based choices.</p><p>Notably, previous research has shown that risk attitudes are indeed highly domain-specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Weber, Blais, &amp; Betz, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Blais &amp; Weber, 2006)</ref>. Certainly, a comprehensive understanding of the exact nature of memory-induced uncertainty in decision making requires more research efforts in the future.</p><p>Importantly, we do not consider uncertainty to be the sole driver of the memory bias on preferential choice. Our previous work showed that, in the gain domain, people believe to remember high-value options better than low-value options, and that the strength of this subjective belief was associated with the strength of the memory bias (Mechera-Ostrovsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">&amp; Gluth, 2018)</ref>. Remarkably, in the current study we found that not only participants' REFLECTION EFFECT IN MEMORY-BASED DECISIONS 21 preferences but also their beliefs were inverted in the loss domain. That is, participants believed to remember strongly negative items better than weakly negative items (see SOM). Yet, after taking these value-and domain-dependent beliefs into account, the gain-loss difference of the memory bias remained significant (see SOM). Thus, the influence of memory on decisions appears to be multifaceted and to depend on both, what we infer about poorly remembered choice options (belief) and how we feel about choosing such options (uncertainty).</p><p>In sum, our two experiments showed that the influence of memory on preferential decisions generalizes to different types of choice options and exhibits a striking parallel to decisions from uncertainty: In the gain domain, people prefer remembered items, but in the loss domain they tend to prefer forgotten options. We take this finding as evidence for a conceptual similarity between choosing poorly remembered options and choosing options with uncertain outcomes, thus connecting two different branches of decision-making research. Further research that should include neuroimaging and computational modeling approaches will be required to develop a comprehensive theory of the interplay between memory, uncertainty and preferential choice. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Finally</head><label></label><figDesc>, they are asked to recall each image.
