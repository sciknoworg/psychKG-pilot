				<p>Many social interactions are characterised by dynamic interplay, such that individuals exert reciprocal influence over each other&apos;s behaviours and opinions. The present study investigated how the dynamics of reciprocal influence affect decisions made in a social context, over and above the information communicated in an interaction. To this end, we developed a simple social decision-making paradigm in which two people are asked to make perceptual judgments while receiving information about each other&apos;s decisions. In a Static condition, information about the partner only conveyed their initial, independent judgment. However, in a Dynamic condition, each individual saw the evolving opinion of their partner as they learnt about and responded to the individual&apos;s own judgment. The results indicated that in both conditions, the majority of confidence adjustments followed a step function characterised by an abrupt change followed by smaller adjustments around an equilibrium, and that participants&apos; confidence was used to arbitrate conflict (although deviating from Bayesian norm). Crucially, interaction had systematic effects on opinion change relative to the Static baseline, magnifying confidence change when partners agreed and reducing confidence change when they disagreed. These findings indicate that during dynamic interactions-often a characteristic of real-life and online social contexts-information is collectively transformed rather than acted upon by individuals in isolation. Consequently, the output of social events is not only influenced by what the dyad knows but also by predictable non-linear and self-reinforcing dynamics.</p>

One particularly fruitful approach to this question is the judge-advisor system paradigm (5, 9, 10), in which participants (the "judges") form independent opinions, then are asked to revise their initial judg-ment after seeing the opinion of one or more advisors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D R A F T Conclusion</head><p>In many daily life scenarios, information is collectively manipulated by several agents who interact in closed-loop recursive dynamic systems. Here we explored these dynamics in a controlled setting, using a simple perceptual decision task and computer interface for communication, to allow quantification of the impact of social exchange on individual decision making. We find that interaction dynamics affect individuals' decisions above and beyond the content of their shared information-the medium becomes (part of) the message. In the aggregate, the impact of interaction dynamics is subtle but consistent, evident as a general increase in confidence in decisions made. However, the impact is very marked in specific situations, notably when shared but uncertain beliefs become mutually reinforced to a state of near certainty, and when a decision maker interprets vacillation in a partner's weak disagreement as positive evidence for their views.</p></div>

The scale used in the actual task had 50 levels per interval. advisor system paradigm (5), where confidence updates happen in discrete steps, here we recorded confidence judgements as they evolved over time: The mouse x-position along the scale was recorded every 200 ms and each data point so collected was treated as an individual post-decisional bet, contributing to the total amount of tokens participants were supposed to maximise. This was done to incentivise participants to update their cursor position along the scale as soon as their internal confidence changed. No clicking nor confirmation were required during the social stage to facilitate reliable and continuous tracking of confidence change. This stage expired after five seconds (26 data points). At this point feedback was provided to both members about the tokens earned by each member, and then a new trial began. Manipulation. Our manipulation concerned only the social exchange stage. Two conditions alternated across blocks. In the Static condition, the choice and confidence level selected by each dyad member in the private phase appeared on their partner's scale as a static coloured cursor. Dyad members were at this point asked to continuously monitor and update their confidence by moving their mouse along the scale. In the Dynamic condition, the social exchange part started exactly as in the Static one, with each dyad member's cursor appearing on their partner's scale. However, and for the whole duration of the social part (five seconds), if a member updated their confidence, this would instantly appear also on their partner's scale and vice-versa. This led to a situation where participants were not only informed of their partner's original opinions, but also how those opinions changed in real-time as a function of their own updates (Figure 1b). The experiment began with three blocks of practice of 10 trials each (practice with the perceptual task alone, then in-cluding the social exchange stage separately with static or 236 dynamic interaction) followed by 14 experimental blocks 237 of 25 trials each. Each experimental block contained 2 238 null trials randomly interleaved, which were private de-239 cision only trials, included so that participants were mo-240 tivated to report their confidence accurately also during 241 the private decision. In null trials, earnings were cal-242 culated from the confidence expressed during the private 243 phase only. All other trials' earnings were computed in-244 stead from the social part. Analyses were performed to 245 assess how social exchange (interactive or static) affected 246 dependent variables of interest: confidence, accuracy and 247 confidence-to-accuracy calibration. Data and analyses are 248 available via OSF, https://osf.io/7b6py/?view_ The use of continuous post-decision wagering 253 gave us a time series of confidence positions for both dyad 254 members on every trial over the five seconds time window 255 of each trial's social part. During the social stage, partici-256 pants updated their confidence over a protracted period, with 257 the largest changes occurring about one second after first ex-258 posure to their partner's opinion (Figure 2a).

The sign of δ C is expected to be positive in agreement trials, when participants typically increase their confidence, and negative in disagreement trials, when they typically decrease their confidence. A 2x2 ANOVA on confidence change (Figure 2b) with factors of consensus with respect to the initial, private decisions (disagreement vs. agreement) and condition (Static vs. Dynamic) revealed significant main effects of both consensus (F (1, 47) = 150.26, p &lt; .001, η 2 G = .7) and condition (F (1, 47) = 9.40, p &lt; .01, η 2 G = .005), but no significant interaction (F &lt; 1). As expected, average δ C was negative in disagreement and positive in agreement (Figure 2c). The main effect of condition indicated that participants' final level of confidence was greater in the Dynamic condition than in the Static condition, with separate paired t-tests confirming this effect held regardless of consensus: Participants increased their confidence more when in agreement (t(47) = 2.69, p = .009) and decreased their confidence less when in disagreement (t(47) = 2.08, p = .04), in Dynamic compared to Static blocks. The results indicate that opinion change is dominated by the information content conveyed (i.e., agreement vs. disagreement), with the nature of interaction (static vs. dynamic) modulating rather than fundamentally altering this pattern. Nevertheless, the observed increase in confidence in the dynamic case (averaging 1.0 points on the scale) is non-trivial, for example, when considered in some parts of the opinion space (Figure 3) and when considering that it represents an average including trials when participants did not change their confidence at all (Figures 2c and 4b).</figDesc></figure>

In a Static condition, the agents update their initial opinion with their discounted partner's opinion (dashed lines). In Dynamic interaction, the same update rule is applied on every iteration until equilibrium is reached (solid lines). To explore this surprising pattern of confidence change more 325 formally, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was com-326 puted on the probability of an irrational confidence change, 327 defined as confidence decreases in cases of agreement and 328 confidence increases in cases of disagreement, again with 329 factors of consensus and condition. To avoid including tri-330 als where increases/decreases in confidence were simply due331</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>340</head><label></label><figDesc>ment than agreement (0.018 vs. 0.004 of trials) and that the 341 Dynamic condition produced more frequent irrational confi-342 dence increases than the Static condition (0.020 vs. 0.015 of 343 trials, t(47) = 2.59, p = .01), as well as numerically fewer 344 irrational confidence decreases (0.003 vs. 0.005 of trials, 345 t(47) = 1.98, p = .05). The interaction between condition 346 and consensus was however not replicated in Experiment 2 347 (Supplementary Information), indicating that the result was 348 not robust to changes in the use of the confidence scale.349 Although not normatively prescribed (e.g., in a Bayesian 350 framework), opinion aggregation strategies described in the 351 literature (3, 40, 41) can explain irrational decreases in con-352 fidence in cases of agreement. For example, averaging of D R A F T confidence would lead to this outcome when a partner agrees but is much less confident than the participant, such that the participant concludes that they should not have been so confident in the first place. Of more interest, therefore, are irrational increases in confidence after disagreement, which occurred more frequently than irrational decreases but which are difficult to reconcile with any obvious confidence-update strategy. Notably, this irrationality could occur through non-linear dynamics introduced by real-time interaction, as explored in a simple simulation of belief update in the two conditions. Consider an example trial in which a participant (P max ) starts off on a confidence level of C pre max = 0.6(a.u.) while their partner (P min ) weakly disagrees (C pre min = −0.4(a.u.)). Suppose next that both participants use a simple update strategy, namely summing their own initial confidence with their partner's weighted confidence (here: weight = 0.80). This strategy has been shown elsewhere to be a good approximation of confidence change in joint decisions (40). In a situation where no interaction is allowed, participants can only use their partner's initial opinion to get to a new confidence, thus reaching levels of C post max = 0.28 and C post min = 0.08. However, a different outcome is observed in the interactive scenario in which the participant has access at each iteration to the partner's current confidence level and uses it to recursively updates his/her initial confidence. Figure 2d shows that this simple strategy leads to an oscillatory update that stabilises for P max on a higher confidence than initially held. The effect reflects the fact that if P min crosses the decision boundary 0, disagreement turns into agreement, thus supporting P max 's initial opinion, instead of providing contradictory evidence, and therefore leads to an increase in confidence despite initial disagreement.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>443 Figure 3</head><label>4433</label><figDesc>for each trial i. Across participants, the average number of vacillations in a trial was significantly more frequent in the Dynamic than Static condition, providing some support for the intuition behind our simple model, although the effect was a small one (Static = 2.41 ± 1.26, Dynamic = 2.55 ± 1.27, t(47) = 2.62, p = .01, d = 0.11). In this way, irrational increases in confidence in cases of disagreement could arise if participants updated their judgments based on the observed updates of their partner (which in turn are influenced by their own judgment), thus treating these updates as if they were independent evidence. A prediction arising from this simulation is that confidence increases in disagreement should only be observed for the participant expressing higher confidence in their judgment on the trial (the dominant individual). Indeed, participants showed a significantly higher rate of irrational increases in the Dynamic condition compared to a Static condition when they were the more confident of the partners on the trial (0.012 vs. 0.008 of disagreement trials, t(47) = 3.29, p = .001, d = .21), and not when less confident (0.007 vs. 0.007 of disagreement trials, 411 p &gt; .8). 412 Dyadic interactions in opinion space. The preceding anal-413 yses explore opinion change when the data are aggregated 414 across broad categories (e.g., agreement vs. disagreement 415 trials). To explore more nuanced behaviour as a function of 416 participants' absolute and relative levels of confidence, we 417 explored our data as a function of a 2-dimensional "opinion 418 space" (40) as shown in Figure 3. The figure plots confi-419 dence change following interaction within this space. Here, 420 the x-axis value indicates the confidence of whichever par-421 ticipant in the dyad is the more confident on any given trial 422 in the private judgment phase, henceforth the "dominant" 423 member (P max ) on the trial, thus ranging from 1 (mini-424 mum confidence) to 50 (maximum confidence). The y-axis 425 value gives the confidence of the less confident, or "domi-426 nated", member of the dyad in their initial judgment on the 427 trial (P min ), on a scale ranging from -50 (disagreement with 428 maximum confidence) to 50 (agreement with maximum con-429 fidence). This plot creates a grid of possible social situations 430 in which the dyad's state -both members' choices and their 431 confidence -is fully represented by (x,y) coordinates, while 432 collapsing across the particular side of participants' choices 433 (left vs. right box).

Thus, dynamic interaction leads to par-453 ticularly marked confidence increases when partners began 454 the social stage in agreement but with low confidence (points 455 marked x in Figure 3).

The corresponding point in Figure 3f indicates that, similarly, larger shifts in the dominated participant's confidence toward the dominant individual's posi-473 tion were observed in Dynamic compared to Static blocks. 474 Overall, therefore, this opinion space analysis identifies the 475 conditions under which dynamic interaction has its largest 476 impact-when partners agree with symmetric low levels of 477 confidence, and when they disagree with asymmetric levels 478 of confidence-and shows that this impact is substantial in 479 these conditions.</figDesc></figure>

Further analysis (Supplementary Analysis) confirmed that in both interactions conditions, and both when holding the dominant or dominated view, par-548 ticipants tended to use partner's objectively stated opinion 549 in a self-serving manner, thus overplaying the support that 550 social information information provided for one's own initial judgment. To formally test for this distortion, agreement trials (i.e., x-axis greater than 0.50) were divided into 553 six bins of evidence, and a linear model with a linear and 554 quadratic terms was fitted: f requency = β 0 + β 1 evidence + 555 β 2 evidence 2 . Results showed that the quadratic terms was 556 not significant for partner's stated evidence (dominant: β 2 = 557 0.50, SE = 0.21; dominated: β 2 = 0.22, SE = 0.46), but 558 was significant for the participant's perceived evidence (dom-559 inant: β 2 = 2.39, SE = 0.57, t = 4.19, p = .02; dominated: 560 β 2 = 3.84, SE = 0.56, t = 6.75, p = .006), explaining 80% 561 and 90% of the variance for dominant and dominated trials 562 respectively (AdjustedR 2 ). The result is evidence of the fact 563 that participants tended to treat advice bimodally as either 564 highly supportive of their own initial opinion or as carrying 565 little informational value. 566 Coupling of confidence changes during interaction. The 567 analyses above consider opinion change for each dyad mem-568 ber separately. To investigate how the magnitude of part-569 ners' opinion changes co-varied across trials, we calcu-570 lated across-trial correlations of absolute confidence change, 571 |δ C |, for members of each dyad. Pearson's r coefficients 572 were calculated for each dyad as a function of dyadic con-573 sensus (agree vs. disagree) and interaction condition (dy-574 namic vs. static). A 2x2 ANOVA on the resulting values 575 across dyads (Figure 5) revealed a main effect of consensus 576 (F (1, 22) = 20.93, p &lt; .001) but not of condition (F (1, 22) = 577 1.71, p = .20), and a significant interaction between the two 578 (F (1, 22) = 38.39, p &lt; .001). When dyad members did not 579 see each other's confidence changes in the social exchange 580 stage (Static condition), confidence changes did not correlate 581 significantly between partners (h 1 = r &gt; 0, t(22) &lt; 1.28, p &gt; 582 .2, d = 0.26). This finding is not unexpected, but nor is it triv-583 ial-for example, a positive correlation might be expected in 584 agreement trials as a consequence of a boost to both partic-585 ipants' confidence when they agreed but were initially un-586 certain, such that agreement led to increased confidence for 587 both. This did not seem to occur. In contrast, in the Dynamic 588 condition, partners' confidence changes became coupled: In 589 agreement trials, the correlation was positive, indicating that 590 the more one member increased their confidence, the more 591 their partner also increased their confidence. In disagree-592 ment, the correlation was negative, indicating that the more 593 one member decreased their confidence in their initial deci-594 sion, the less the partner decreased theirs. Pairwise contrasts 595 showed that, compared to Static condition, in the Dynamic 596 condition correlation coefficients were significantly greater 597 for agreement (t(22) = 4.89, p &lt; .001, d = 1.20) and some-598 what smaller for disagreement (t(22) = −2.02, p = .05, d = 599 −0.52). The negative correlation found in disagreement Dy-600 namic trials, was replicated in Experiment 3, but not in Ex-601 periment 2 (Supplementary Information). Further analyses 602 (Supplementary Information) showed that the effect could 603 not be explained by participants using their partner's reaction 604 times (i.e., "unwillingness to move") in the Dynamic but not 605 in the Static condition. Coupling of confidence changes in in-606 teraction suggests that participants were influenced by their 607 partner's confidence change when updating their own opin-608 ion, rather than basing their change solely on their partner's 609 initial (independent) judgment as normatively prescribed.610 Performance analysis. A tenet in the judgment aggregation 611 literature is that social interaction hampers collective wis-612 dom by breaking the independence of the individual judg-613 ments (48). The traditional interpretation of the wisdom of 614 crowds (2, 49), named here the "noise cancelling hypothe-615 sis", explains the accuracy improvement observed in opinion 616 aggregates as a statistical phenomenon where noise reduces 617 after independent samples (here the private initial opinions) 618 are averaged together.

Social 635 information had a beneficial effect on average accuracy (pre-636 exchange accuracy = 0.72, post-exchange accuracy = 0.75). 637 The finding indicates that, contrary to (48), exposure to another person's opinion did not reduce accuracy. Furthermore, 639 Dynamic interaction did not reduce accuracy improvement 640 compared to Static, indicating that increased dependence be-641 tween confidence updates (as indicated in the analyses of Fig-642 ure 5) had no significant damaging effect on accuracy (or ac-643 curacy improvement) either. 644 However, condition might have affected people's opinions 645 without making them changing their initial answer (5). We 646 thus tried to define a more nuanced definition of accuracy 647 improvement as confidence changes toward or away the cor-648 rect end of the scale:δ acc G = (C post − C pre ) Acc * (C pre − 649 C post ) 1−Acc ,where Acc ∈ {0, 1}. We tested whether partic-650 ipants improved their initial judgment although keeping their 651 initial views. The same 2x2 ANOVA did not show any ef-652 fect of condition on graded accuracy improvement δ acc G nor 653 significant interaction (F &lt; 1), thus rejecting the idea that 654 condition had an influence on accuracy. 655 A third and final measure of performance considered was 656 the calibration of confidence relatively to objective accuracy, 657 defined here as the type II A ROC (50). The same two-658 way ANOVA used for choice accuracy was run on type II 659 A ROC . Results show a significant effect of decision stage 660 (F (1, 47) = 89.58, p &lt; .001, η 2 G = .25), indicating calibra-661 tion improvement from pre-to post-exchange phase (0.60 vs. 662 0.66), but no effect of condition nor interaction between the 663 two (F &lt; 1), further confirming that, overall, the nature of 664 interaction (static vs. dynamic) did not impact on calibration 665 or improvement thereof. 666 Discussion 667The present study compared social exchange involving static,668 one-step communication with exchange characterised by dy-669 namic and recursive interaction. We hypothesized that real-670 time bi-directional dynamics, which characterise many daily 671 life interactions of social influence (22), would have system-672 atic impact on decisions made in a social context, over and 673 above the effects of the information brought by each individ-674 ual to the interaction, as studied in traditional judge-advisor 675 system experiments (5, 51). Across conditions with equal in-676 formation available-because in both the Dynamic and Static 677 conditions, dyad members viewed perceptual evidence sepa-678 rately and for 160 ms only-we observed different opinion 679 aggregation strategies according to the nature of communica-680 tion between partners. Specifically, dynamic interaction pro-681 duced higher confidence changes in agreement and smaller 682 confidence changes in disagreement by breaking the inde-683 pendence of dyad members' opinions: Confidence changes 684 of the two participants became correlated during Dynamic 685 interaction compared to a Static baseline so that, in agree-686 ment, greater increases in confidence for one member were 687 associated with greater confidence increases for their partner, 688 leading to belief escalation. In disagreement, greater changes 689 in confidence for one member were associated with smaller 690 changes in confidence for their partner, reducing the impact 691 of disagreement on belief updating. 692 These combined results can be understood in terms of indi-693 viduals making use of their partner's change in confidence 694 to update their opinion, without taking into account that this 695 change was biased (and indeed generated) by exposure to 696 their own judgment. People are known to quickly reach deci-697 sions even when information is scarcely available by taking 698 into account a host of circumstantial variables that are known 699 to co-vary with problem-specific evidence, but that are not 700 themselves strictly task-relevant (52-54). Interpreting some-701 one's changes of mind as another cue for confidence is sen-702 sible in many daily life situations. Indeed, if somebody's be-703 liefs are fickle, we have reasons to believe s/he must be uncer-704 tain. In the case of social interaction, however, this heuristic 705 leads to potentially sub-optimal self-reinforcing dynamics, 706 when a person uses the impact of his/her own opinion on the 707 other person as evidence for the opinion itself. The impact of 708 this circular reasoning was particularly marked in the case of 709 two partners agreeing but with low or intermediate levels of 710 confidence: In these cases, dyads often escalated together to-D R A F T wards maximal confidence in their shared judgement through dynamic interaction, an effect not observed when information exchange was static and limited to each individual's independent judgment. Phenomena of belief escalation have already been observed in relation to sharing confidence judgments in group decisions (27, 55). These studies found that reciprocal social interaction can make people's judgments more risky and extreme, a result reminiscent of earlier findings on group polarisation (29). The present study shows that a crucial cause of confidence escalation is the use of redundant information: People should only use each other's independent opinions to arrive at a final decision, because this is the only information that carries task-relevant value. However, they also (incorrectly) use how much their own opinion is affecting their partners. This strategy creates dependencies that can potentially create unwanted non-linear dynamics. Beyond confidence escalation as described above, a more subtle but nevertheless consistent effect of this strategy in our data was that participants occasionally increased their confidence despite initially learning that their partner disagreed with them (a surprising irrationality that occurred more frequently than the mirror effect of decreasing their confidence when a partner agreed). Our analyses suggest that partner's changes of mind are sometimes perceived as supporting evidence for one's views: When a partner initially disagrees, but subsequently loses confidence in this view (or even reverses it) on learning the participant's view, it seems that the participant takes this as evidence in favour of their initial position, and therefore increase their confidence. This phenomenon cannot easily be explained by static aggregation rules like averaging, summing or Bayesian integration (3, 40, 41), but is predicted by a recursive update model. Notwithstanding these differences in confidence updating across static vs. dynamic interactions, participants' overall accuracy showed a consistent benefit from social information exchange. The benefits of social exchange were of similar magnitude across static and dynamic interaction conditions, whether this benefit was measured in terms of overall accuracy, confidence in the correct answer, or the calibration between confidence and objective performance. This parity was observed despite different interaction dynamics across conditions, at least in part because these dynamics led to opposing effects on accuracy across trials. Thus, when we contrast participants' behaviour with a Bayes optimal strategy, we find that they consistently underweighted their partners opinion and thus did not benefit optimally from social exchange. When comparing dynamic to static interaction, this underweighting relative to Bayes was greater in cases of disagreement and reduced in cases of agreement, for the reasons discussed above, resulting in little net difference in accuracy across conditions. An interesting issue for future is whether the introduction of systematic biases across members' initial judgments (e.g., 40) might generate greater errors in interaction than non-interaction, due to escalation of confidence in incorrect answers (56-58).</figDesc></figure>

The 773 use of inverse Bayes allowed us to compare the objective in-774 formation conveyed from social partners with the informa-775 tion perceived by a participant. Results evidenced that social 776 information was distorted by the receiver in a self-serving 777 manner and asymmetrically for agreement and disagreement, 778 in line with the advice-taking literature suggesting the pres-779 ence of egocentric and confirmation biases (10, 46). More 780 specifically, the weighting of partner's information (i.e., use 781 of social information) seemed to follow a bimodal distribu-782 tion, with peaks around 50%, corresponding to neutral social 783 information, and 100%, corresponding to maximally sup-784 porting social information. These results are consistent with 785 the hypothesis that people are solving a categorical inference 786 problem (cf. 47): Instead of using continuous social infor-787 mation as it is provided by their social partners, participants 788 seem to classify each trial as "partner is wrong" vs. "partner is 789 correct" and, once this categorization is performed, use social 790 information accordingly to update their views. Accordingly, 791 participants would try to minimize situations of uncertainty 792 (e.g. 0.25 or 0.75 evidence), thus maximizing the impact of 793 social information on final confidence. 794 Our key experimental results were replicated using linear-795 mixed effects regressions and by running two further exper-796 iments, reported in the Supplementary Information material. 797 The same paradigm used in Experiment 1 was extended with 798 two aims: (a) to replicate the results found in the current ex-799 periment using a different method to report confidence, and 800 (b) to make sure that the escalation effects found were not 801 due to confounding factors. Indeed, a perhaps more parsi-802 monious explanation of the interactive effects found is that 803 participants quickly forgot the initial configuration and were 804 only left with their current expressed opinions. This hypoth-805 esis can, for example, explain non-linear opinion reinforce-806 ment. We therefore included confidence anchors to remind 807 each participant of the initial, independently expressed con-808 fidence in their own judgment (Experiment 2) and from their 809 partner (Experiment 3). Replication of key findings across 810 experiments-including confidence change asymmetry, up-811 date coupling, and confidence escalation-indicated that the 812 results are robust to different instructions and different uses 813 of the confidence scale. Collectively, these findings show that 814 social influence depends not only the task-relevant informa-815 tion provided by social partners, but also on the modality in 816 which information is shared and transformed across individ-817 uals. Real-time interaction, as seen in most daily social ex-818 changes, is recursive and dynamic in nature, and thus an un-819 derstanding of social decision making requires consideration 820 of these phenomena.</figDesc></figure>
