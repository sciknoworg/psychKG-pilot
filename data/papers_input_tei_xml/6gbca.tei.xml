			<abstract>
				<p>The cumulative redundancy bias (CRB) refers to people&apos;s difficulty in ignoring the redundancy in cumulatively presented information. When people consider which of two competing agents is better, they are influenced by the sequence of events that led to their accumulative total performance. If one agent was ahead most of the time, people consider this agent better-even if the agents are tied eventually. However, we show that an opposite performance-slope bias (PSB) emerges when participants focus on the performance trajectories of agents. When a trailing agent is substantially catching up to the leading agent, people judge the former as the better agent. In four experiments where we manipulated the magnitude of performance slope difference between two agents, we obtained both effects. In Experiments 1 and 2, a large slope difference between agents overshadowed other factors that may have influenced the reversal from CRB to PSB. In Experiments 3 and 4 we showed conclusively with the same design, but for different real-life contexts that the CRB emerges when the slope difference between agents is small while it reverses as the PSB when the slope difference is large. The four experiments demonstrate individuals&apos; ability for flexible cue utilization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The formation of attitudes, judgments, and decisions is the result of a sequential process, in which more information becomes available to perceivers over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hogarth &amp; Einhorn, 1992)</ref>. For example, we may form an impression about a person by observing that person's behavior across situations, we may decide whether to buy a product by sampling reviews from several sources, or we may follow our favorite sports team's performance over the course of the season and estimate its chances for the championship. To form valid attitudes and make correct judgments and decisions, individual pieces of information need to be integrated subsequently in a larger body of knowledge, for example, by means of summation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Betsch et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1974)</ref> or averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 1965</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson, , 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson &amp; Alexander, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kahneman et al., 1993)</ref>. Such information aggregation is a central function of the human mind. It has been the target of extensive research in the past.</p><p>Alves and Mata (2019; see also <ref type="bibr">Alves et al., accepted)</ref> recently pointed out that many natural environments provide the perceiver with already aggregated sequential observations such as a running total or a running average. Vote counts of presidential candidates, the total number of points collected by sports teams in a season, or current stock prices are just some of many examples. When an observation sequence is comprised of such cumulative information, perceivers do not need to integrate information over time, but ought to rely only on the most recent observation and disregard previous observations, as they are redundant.</p><p>For instance, across all games in a soccer season, the best estimate of success might be given by a team's total collected points. Previous point scores, after an intermediate number of games, do not necessarily provide additional informational value about the team's success beyond the most recent score. Cumulative redundancy emphasizes the diagnostic value of the total score and downplays the informative value of all interim scores. However, people often fail to adequately account for information redundancy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fiedler et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Unkelbach et Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization 4 al., 2007)</ref>. Based on this well-documented human tendency, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref> predicted, and found robust evidence for, a cumulative redundancy bias (hereafter CRB). When sequences of information were cumulative, judgments not only relied on the most recent summary score, but were also systematically influenced by preceding interim scores. Judges tended to favor the competitor who was ahead during most of the competition sequence, even when the end result was a draw. This outcome of repeated rank-frequency learning was inconsistent with the notion that the most recent performance is most diagnostic.</p><p>The CRB has relevant theoretical and practical implications. It represents a distinct type of a generalized primacy effect, transcending the domain of person impression formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alves &amp; Mata, 2019)</ref> and pointing to similar primacy effects in marketing, politics, and sports, to name just a few other domains. A recent memorable CRB example was observed during the 2020 US presidential election vote count, when high-ranking Republicans including the President Donald Trump himself long refused to revise the early impression that he was winning the electoral college amid the ongoing vote count.</p><p>CRB revisited and reversed. Yet, the CRB may not be the only viable outcome in a sequence of cumulative observations. As we shall explain in this section, attention to another cue can produce the opposite effect. Explaining and testing such a CRB reversal is the purpose of a series of four experiments reported in the present article. We first report two experiments with plainly opposite results. They show that cumulative coding does not determine any fixed cognitive-processing constraints that favor the leading agent. It is rather easy to modify the experimental task conditions in a way that facilitates incremental coding, resulting in a bias that favors the trailing competitor, that is, the agent that starts behind but finally reaches a tie or even overtakes the leading competitor. Such a reversal can be understood as a trend effect, whereby observers extrapolate a recent trend (slope) to the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hohle &amp; Teigen, 2015)</ref>. Specifically, we propose that the small difference in performance Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization 5 slopes of leading and trailing agents in the experiments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref> promoted the reliance on ranking frequency as the dominant cue that informed participants' judgment of agent performance. However, a trailing agent with a steep performance trajectory should be favored despite them lagging behind the leading competitor for most of the time. This consideration is in line with insights from other fields, like behavioral economics (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Carlson &amp; She, 2007)</ref> and research on forecasting (De <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bondt, 1993)</ref>, which demonstrate influences of performance trends on judgment and decision making.</p><p>Considered against the original evidence from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref>, our present experiments corroborate the conclusion that illusions in sequential evaluation cannot be explained mechanistically in terms of a fixed advantage of one encoding mode, or an inability to switch to another encoding process. Rather, people possess the cognitive capacity to engage in both cumulative and incremental encoding. Which encoding strategy they turn to depends on the most salient cues provided by the task. If the task focus shifts from the competitors' ranking frequency, as in previous research, to their relative performance slope over time, judges might give more weight to the slope than to ranking frequencies. As a result, they may produce evaluations and future predictions that favor the competitor that catches up over time.</p><p>Moreover, different performance slopes may receive even more weight if the two competitors' results are not presented in isolation but embedded in a more comprehensive display of many other agents' performance, while ranking frequency may receive even lesser weight then.</p><p>Given an enriched comparative context, unequal performance slopes may be even more visible than when an impoverished context displays only the two focal competitors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resulting biases depend on metacognition. Crucial for a rational evaluation strategy</head><p>in multi-cue settings is the individual's metacognitive ability to choose informative cues by the logic of the evaluation task and not to be misled by whatever cue happens to be salient in a given situation. Judges are capable of encoding either type of information: ranking Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization 6 frequencies and performance slope differences. They are sensitive to any cues provided by the task context, calling for either cumulative or incremental encoding, following these cues spontaneously and possibly missing the logical constraints imposed on the evaluation task.</p><p>The deficit that causes serious bias in such sequential evaluation does not lie in lacking or insufficient cognitive algorithms to process the different informative cues but rather originates from a deficit, a myopia, at the metacognitive level <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fiedler, 2012)</ref>, to understand when certain cues are (un)informative and should (not) be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequential evaluation of competing targets: Analyzing the task setting</head><p>To inspect the structure of the sequential evaluation task in more detail, consider the stimulus series used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata's (2019)</ref> Experiment 6. As in the present Experiments 1-3, it referred to the performance of two soccer teams, A and B, over 15 weeks (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Both teams performed equally well, as the number of points gained every week was invariant for both teams (+0 for a loss, +1 for a tie, +3 for a won match) except for the fact that A outperforms B in week 1 (+3 vs. +0), whereas B outperforms A in week 15 by the same margin (+0 vs. +3; see incremental format). A final draw between both teams at 24 points in total after the 15 weeks highlights their equivalence. Yet, because the leading Team A was ahead of the trailing Team B in 14 weekly updates, A received more positive evaluations as well as more optimistic future performance prospects than B.</p><p>This unwarranted bias in favor of Team A could not be due to a primacy effect per se because the bias only arose when weekly stands were presented in cumulative format; it disappeared when the same data were presented in incremental format (i.e., in terms of the difference between present and preceding records, see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Apparently, Team A's superiority was confined to a redundant encoding illusion in the cumulative-format condition.</p><p>The 14-fold leading status of Team A was coded as if it reflected 14 independent success outcomes for Team A over the trailing Team B. Ruling out this redundancy illusion by Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization 7 presenting the same sequence in an incremental format <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, the bias favoring Team A disappeared. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Stimulus sequences used in Experiment 6 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref> While the incremental format led to divergent results, this format appears to be less natural than the cumulative format that is commonly used to represent performance curves in sports, political elections, the stock market, or scientific citation indices. The strong and persistent CRB in favor of the frequently leading agent that <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref> found was robust across multiple experiments.</p><p>Yet, it would be premature to equate a frequently replicated finding with a universal law or mechanism. Here we present new evidence from the same paradigm, revealing that the CRB only reflects one possible outcome triggered by a selected cue (i.e., tallying of leading positions). Participants were also capable of utilizing other cues triggering other mechanisms of sequential evaluation. We will show that enhancing the salience of cues other than the redundant rank-frequency cue can undo the elusive advantage of the early-leading agent and instead create a reverse bias in favor of a late-rising competitor that started weak but exhibited a stronger leeway over time.</p><p>Sequential evaluation as a multi-cue task. Keeping with the example of two focal soccer teams' performance over time, sequential evaluation can be conceived as a multi-cue</p><p>Week No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 At first, it seems reasonable to assume that the best criterion of past and present performance evaluation and the best predictor of future performance should be the final summary score. However, ascribing superiority to the one team that outperformed the other at the beginning or at the end of the season can also be justified. On one hand, one might argue that a recency advantage is more suggestive of the future than a primacy advantage. On the other hand, one might argue that a permanently leading team has to cope with all opponent teams' enhanced motivation to beat the best and can therefore be considered superior.</p><p>However, neither possibility is more valid on a-priori grounds. At the same time, we increased the salience of the relative slope favoring the trailing team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preview of the Present Research</head><p>Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>Whereas the teams' slopes were rather small and similar in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata's (2019)</ref> original setting, with the trailing team lagging only slightly behind the leading team (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), the present design renders an upward slope of the trailing team clearly steeper than the slope of the leading team (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>; and <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 3</ref>).</p><p>Using these constant modifications, we manipulate two factors, the Final Outcome of the competition (i.e., whether the leading or the trailing team finally wins the race on the last game day) and the Simultaneous versus Successive Presentation Mode. The rationale of the latter manipulation is that in the sequential-mode condition, when participants first follow only one focal team before they focus on the other team in a subsequent separate run, the encoding of ranking frequency should be impaired if not eliminated, while the encoding of each team's slope should be facilitated. In a Simultaneous Presentation Mode, when the results of both focal teams can be observed and compared on each game day within a single stimulus sequence, the participants should have at least a fair chance to encode ranking frequency of both teams; performance slope should, therefore, be less dominant. After watching the animated stimulus display over all 17 trials, or two runs of 17 given Successive Mode, and observing which of the two teams finally won the competition, participants completed a single comparative (dichotomous) rating of future performance:</p><p>"Which of the two teams do you think will have the edge next season -Team E or Team Y?"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The participants in all four conditions rated the trailing Team Y more favorably than the leading Team E, contrary to the findings reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref>. Average ratings were consistently lower than the scale midpoint of 1.5 of the dichotomous Y-(coded 1) versus E-scale (coded 2); the mean deviation score was Mdev = -0. (1) = .185, p = .667, and Final Outcome, χ 2 (1) = .362, p = .547, as well as for the interaction, χ 2 (1) = .538, p = .463, were</p><p>negligible. An omnibus test of the full 2 × 2 model, including Presentation Mode, Final</p><p>Outcome and their interaction, did not outperform a null model in predicting whether Team Y</p><p>or Team E was evaluated more favorably, χ 2 (3) = 1.330, p = .722.</p><p>Thus, the results of Experiment 1 clearly support the expectation that it is possible to eliminate and even reverse the CRB findings obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref>  The second experiment offers an extended replication of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref>  When stimulus presentation was complete, participants provided comparative ratings of Team Y versus Team E on three 11-point Likert scales, with "Team E" and "Team Y" as left and right scale anchors, respectively. The three ratings, administered in constant order, referred to past performance,"Which of the two teams was the better one in the past season you just watched?", future performance, "Which of the two teams do you think will have the edge next season?", and a direct comparison of present performance, "If the two teams were to play against each other right now, which team would win?" Note that the past-performance question offers a manipulation check for actual team performance. Ratings below (above) the scale midpoint indicated higher evaluations of Team Y (Team E).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>To anticipate, while participants' past performance ratings were sensitive to the manipulation of the Final Outcome, their average ratings of present and future performance (below the midpoint) obviously reflected the same perceived superiority of the trailing Team  regularly obtained CRB could be easily converted into an opposite PSB, by modifying the cues and the context of stimulus presentation. The reversal received even stronger support in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1. Together, these results provide strong support for the contention that Alves and Mata's (2019) persistent findings do not reflect an invariant mental disposition but a systematic cognitive strategy that is attuned to distinct cues and stimulus contexts and can therefore be altered in a malleable fashion. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>In both experiments reported so far, we found the expected reversal from CRB to PSB for the teams' present and future performance evaluations. The extra manipulations employed in both experiments were not required to achieve this reversal. Subtle manipulations of cue salience and stimulus context were sufficient to cause a strong reversal. No Successive Presentation (Experiment 1) and no Incremental Format (Experiment 2) were needed to induce a bias in favor of the trailing team (PSB). The reversal was more radical than expected, apparently reflective of the combination of steeper performance slope and contextual embedding.</p><p>Metacognitive</p><note type="other">Flexibility in Cue Utilization 20</note><p>To validate this explanation of the pervasive reversal, as a causal consequence of the enhanced salience of the performance slope difference between agents and the richer embedding context, we conducted a third experiment, in a deliberate attempt to systematically solicit both phenomena, CSB and PSB, depending on the manipulation of these two factors.</p><p>Specifically, Experiment 3 manipulated slope difference and context enrichment. First, the relative slope of both teams' performance curve should clearly affect the teams' evaluative ratings. Highly divergent performance slopes between the teams should facilitate a superior evaluation of the trailing team over the leading team (PSB), whereas similar slopes should facilitate a superior evaluation of the leading team (CRB). Second, the enrichment of the context in which the two focal teams are embedded should moderate the main effect of the performance slope difference. The PSB arising when the slope difference between Team Y</p><p>and Team E is high should be further boosted by an enriched context that renders the display of the slope difference even more salient than an impoverished context concentrated on only the two teams (Y vs. E). Conversely, the CRB given a small slope difference may also be more visible in an enriched context, although it then renders the negligible difference between the teams' performance slopes more salient. Thus, the goal of Experiment 3 was to produce both the CRB and PSB by manipulating the relative salience of these two factors: whether the slope of the two performance curves varied only slightly (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves &amp; Mata, 2019)</ref> or markedly (as in Experiments 1 and 2), and whether the focal teams' results were presented in isolation (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves &amp; Mata, 2019)</ref> or embedded in an enriched context (as in Experiments 1</p><p>and 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants and design. We lowered the required sample size and aimed for 170 participants to approximate a test power of 0.80 while expecting medium effect sizes.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 3)</ref>. In all conditions, the Final Outcome was held constant with an equal overall performance of both teams at the end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>As in Experiment 2, all three dependent measures were assessed on 11-point rating scales such that ratings lower (higher) than the scale midpoint of 6 indicated superior past, present or future performance ascribed to the trailing Team Y (leading Team E). Past performance ratings. To examine the impact of both independent variables, we conducted Slope Difference × Embedded Context ANOVAs. An analysis of past-performance ratings (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) yielded a performance-slope main effect, F(1, 157) = 25.00, p &lt; .001, η² = .13, with higher ratings (i.e., indicating superiority of the leading Team E) when the performance slope diverged only weakly rather than strongly. No main effect of Embedded Future performance ratings. The same pattern held for future-performance ratings <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>. In addition to a large main effect for the performance slope, F(1, 157) = 37.11, p &lt; .001, η² = .18, and an absent context main effect, F(1, 157) = 0.69, p = .408, η² &lt; .01, a significant interaction, F(1, 157) = 9.57, p = .002, η² = .05, reflected the same accentuation of the Slope Difference in the Enriched Context (Mdev = -1.67, SD = 2.36, vs. 2.03, SD = 2.11) relative to the Impoverished Context (Mdev = -0.76, SD = 2.96, vs. 0.45, SD = 2.63) as was shown for direct comparison ratings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General</head><p>Aggregate ratings. As the internal consistency of all three ratings was reasonably substantial (α = .65), we conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA of average ratings, aggregating across past, present and future performance. This analysis corroborated the same pattern as in all three previous ANOVAs, although with higher statistical power. The overall main effect for Slope Difference amounted to F(1, 157) = 55.62, p &lt; .001, η² = .14; no main effect of the Embedded Context was found, F(1, 157) = 0.30, p = .588, η² &lt; .01; but the interaction was substantive, F(1, 157) = 11.19, p = .001, η² = .03. In summary, Experiment 3 resulted in a successful interpolation between the contrasting findings obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref> and in the present Experiments 1 and 2. Based on the orthogonal manipulation of two task features that distinguished between the two series of experiments, we were able to reproduce both the CRB reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref>, as well as the PSB (i.e., reverse the CRB) obtained in the present Experiments 1 and 2. Apparently, the crucial task feature that enables CRB to switch into PSB is the divergence of the two focal teams' performance slopes. If the slopes of both curves are similar, a CRB reflects the rank-frequency cue dominating the performance slopes of the two Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization 25 focal teams. In contrast, if strongly divergent trajectories render the performance slopes more salient, a similarly strong PSB occurs. The other distinctive feature, context enrichment, serves to accentuate the basic performance slope effect when the two focal teams' performance is embedded in the context of all weekly results and the table updates of the entire soccer league.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4</head><p>Experiment 3 showed that the CRB can be replicated and reversed within the same design. However, important issues must still be addressed. All findings reported so far might be peculiar to soccer matches. To make a strong point for the flexibility of cognitive processes, it would thus be appropriate at least to replicate similar findings in another content domain. We thus conducted one more experiment designed to demonstrate that a similar strong reversal as in Experiment 3 for two soccer teams can be replicated in a different domain like political elections.</p><p>Specifically, in Experiment 4, we replaced the competition of two soccer teams with the competition of two political parties in an election. Participants observed the counting of votes for different parties. However, although the cumulative vote counts also appeared in a stepwise sequence across 17 time periods, the temporal task setting differed from the soccer setting in one crucial way. Whereas the interim results throughout a soccer season might causally influence the subsequent performance of the teams (e.g., motivating better performance when playing against a superior or against an inferior team) the election scenario rules out such a causal interpretation. This is because the scenario said that the voting day is over; the temporal sequence exclusively reflected the time required to count votes in a random order. According to this scenario, interim results could never influence subsequent voting behavior. This scenario rendered both cues, rank frequency and slope difference, uninformative regarding the political parties' real performance as leading and an upwards Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization 26 performance trend were merely the products of the (random) order in which the collected votes were counted.</p><p>As in Experiment 3, we manipulated two factors: whether the slope of the two performance curves varied only slightly (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves &amp; Mata, 2019)</ref> or markedly (as in Experiments 1 and 2), and whether the focal parties' results were presented in isolation (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves &amp; Mata, 2019)</ref> or embedded in an enriched context (as in Experiments 1 and 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants and design. Given the rather small interaction effects in Experiment 3, we doubled the sample size and aimed for 320 participants, corresponding to a desired power of 0.80 to detect small effects. A total sample of 321 participants was recruited via Prolific, from which none had to be excluded. Sample size was never contingent on preceding data analysis.</p><p>The sample consisted of 133 (41.43%) female and 165 (51.40%) male participants; two (.67%) respondents indicated "non-binary" and 21 (6.50%) did not indicate their gender. Age ranged from 18 to 72 years (M = 32.27, SD = 10.01). As in Experiment 3, participants were randomly assigned to the four conditions of a Slope Difference (Low vs. High) × Embedded Context (Impoverished vs. Enriched) design.</p><p>Procedure. The procedure was the same as in Experiment 3 besides adopting the narrative of a political voting race between different parties instead of a soccer season.</p><p>Respondents were told that they would watch the second part of the vote counting for an ongoing political race between parties. The second part was divided into 17 days of vote counting. After each day the votes for the parties were updated and presented to the participants. All numerical data for the vote-counting trajectories in Experiment 4 were the same as in Experiment 3. Dependent measures were again assessed on three 11-point rating scales, with ratings lower (higher) than the scale midpoint of 6 indicating superior past, present or future performance of the trailing Party Y (leading Party E).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General</head><p>In summary, Experiment 4 clearly showed that a strong (disordinal) reversal from CRB to PSB is not peculiar to soccer scenarios but extends to a political voting scenario.</p><p>Depending on the manipulation of the relative slope over time, we were able to reproduce both the CRB reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref> but also the PSB in another sensible task setting, namely, the temporal unfolding of vote counts after a political election. Moreover, the task setting used for Experiment 4 rules out a problem that remained unaddressed by the soccer results in Experiment 3. As participants were told that the votes for each political party had already been collected and were counted in random order, the intermediate voting results</p><p>could not exert any causal effect on the subsequent performance of parties. Rather, the slope difference of parties neither reflected a temporal trend nor a causal influence on subsequent voting results and the same was true for rank frequency, highlighting the notion that the only reasonable index of party performance was the final voting result. Still, more divergent slopes fostered higher ratings of the trailing party (PSB), whereas more similar slopes led to more favorable ratings of the leading party (CBR).</p><p>It should be noted that the Slope Difference × Embedded Context interaction was clearly less pronounced than in Experiment 3; embedding the two focal parties in an enriched context (of all parties in the election) did not render the slope difference significantly more visible. While we refrain from much post-hoc speculations about the causal origin of the Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization 30 diluted interaction effect, we believe it only makes the reversal more context independent.</p><p>The very fact that the party scenario ruled out any causal influence of intermediate results on</p><p>the party trajectories may have served to downplay the impact of comparative context embedding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The reported experiments corroborate and extend recently published findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alves &amp; Mata, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Alves et al., accepted)</ref> that performance evaluations of competing agents are not exclusively determined by the final cumulative performance measure (i.e. the overall score), which takes all prior performance into account. Evaluations of past, present, and future performance are also sensitive to the historical trajectories of the final scores. What matters is not just the objective end result reached by a team but also the way in which the teams reached the final end state. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref> showed that participants consistently favored the frequently leading team over a trailing team even when both ended with the same score. Similarly to sportive performance, this CRB extended to the evaluation of political and financial success, student grades, and algorithms.</p><p>The dependence on the antecedent performance history implies that evaluative judgments go beyond the mere assessment of manifest performance. Judges are sensitive to distinct "theories" about the meaning of the same manifest outcomes. At first glance, the results reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref> and the present findings evoke "theories" that seem to be contradictory in how they determine the relative evaluation of competing teams.</p><p>Whereas the earlier investigation pointed to a persistent advantage of the team that takes an early lead and is then more frequently in a better ranking position, judges in the present Experiments 1 and 2 provided more favorable ratings for the other team with the lower starting level but the steeper upward performance slope. These novel findings fit well into the broader evidence from behavioral economics for sensitivity to performance trends in general (De <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bondt, 1993</ref>) and people's eagerness to identify trends from scarce information (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hohle &amp; Teigen, 2015</ref>.</p><p>However, closer reflection in Experiments 3 and 4 showed that <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata's (2019)</ref> and the present diametrically opposite findings are by no means contradictory. The diverging results reflect flexible cognitive processes that give different meanings to the same performance scores. As embedding of the two focal teams in the context of an entire league apparently downplayed the salience of frequent leading (relative to the focal rival but not to the entire league), the rank frequency cue was no longer sufficient to induce the CRB, even when cumulative scores rendered leading teams more salient than incremental scores. Yet, the distinct manipulation of the performance slope difference between agents was sufficient for a reversal from PSB to CRB.</p><p>Experiments 3 and 4 corroborated the intuition that two seemingly contradictory biases can peacefully coexist. To translate the PSB (performance-slope bias) obtained in Experiments 1 and 2 into the CRB (cumulative redundancy bias) obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref>, it was only necessary to render the performance slope difference less salient. We were thus able to induce either bias within the same experiment. Moreover, at least for the soccer results, either bias was reinforced when the focal competitors' results were embedded in the broader context of all 18 agents.</p><p>To repeat, neither bias, CRB or PSB, is more or less rational than the other one, nor is there an a-priori rationale to assume that either primacy (early leading) or recency (trend toward improvement) affords a better proxy of a team's true performance. No a-priori ground ensures that the final update of all cumulative performance provides a better prediction of future performance, or a fairer account of past performance, than either the performance slope or the number of weeks in a leading position.</p><p>Metacognitive Flexibility in Cue Utilization</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>32</head><p>The best team may be the one team that was leading most of the time, showing highest resistance and motivation against all competing teams that mobilized their highest motivation against the leading team. It is as well possible that the team with the most positive upward slope will most likely perpetuate a steep upward trend in the future season. A third reasonable theory may assume that the final standing affords the most objective and fairest evaluation, with the highest predictive validity.</p><p>Given this agnostic situation, and the lack of a single normatively optimal strategy, our findings demonstrate an adaptive flexibility of our cognitive system, which can (1) switch between different modes of encoding or (2) focus on different invariances (i.e., one team consistently being ahead of the other or the other team's steeper upward performance trend).</p><p>Moreover, (3) judgments of past, present, and future performance can flexibly rely on manifest records when judging past performance, but giving more weight to their theories of trajectories when predicting future performance. Lastly, (4) the present Experiment 4 attests that the flexible cognitive system can also lead to biased judgments based on uninformative cues.</p><p>The present work raises intriguing questions for future research. For instance, it is not clear if the PSB arises from the higher salience of the performance trend cue, from merely a strong trend of the trailing agent, or from both in interaction. That is, while increased salience of the agents' trends reduces the influence of rank frequency on performance judgments, a steeper trend also emphasizes the trailing agent's growing potential. Future experimental research should disentangle this conflation to inspect how much influence comes from salience on the performance slope difference alone.</p><p>Further, the Gricean (1975) maxims of cooperative communication (see <ref type="bibr">Schwarz, 1994)</ref>, which imply that the stimuli presented in an experiment are never uninformative, allow participants to trust in either information, whether ranking frequency or slope difference, depending on their communication goals. While these norms do not explain the flexible cue utilization shown in Experiments 3 and 4, they urge caution for practical implications of the biases' effects as redundancy under natural conditions might be more readily identified as such and corrected for. Lastly, it is important to consider that cue usage might, in part, also be the result of participants perceiving the experimenters as cooperative communicators. This fact makes presenting specific informative cues themselves a social signal for what type of agent ability respondents should focus on when asked about the agent's past, present, and future performance. The effect of differently salient cues might therefore be partially explained by social signaling perceived by participants rather than the cues inherently triggering a specific type of information processing. Future research should address this possibility.</p><p>While social motivation was largely excluded so far, we suspect that motivated reasoning can strategically guide people's attention to whichever cues support a more desired theory and evaluation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Braga et al., 2017)</ref>. Fans of the leading team might argue for their team's ranking superiority, whereas fans of a trailing team, which is gaining terrain, might argue that their team is stronger on the basis of the observed performance slopes. Similarly, supporters of a political candidate who was a long-time leader during the vote counting process may attribute this to the true outcome, while supporters of the candidate who eventually took the lead may point at the steeper trend favoring their candidate, and that the candidate's win was indeed foreseeable early on. A challenging task for applied cognitive psychology is to exploit this cognitive flexibility, choosing the processing strategy that is most appropriate for the payoff structure in a given problem context. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Changes in agent evaluation as a function of Final Outcome and Presentation Mode Experiment 2</figDesc></figure>

Another main effect for the Stimulus Format, F (1, 285) = 4.97, p = .027, η² = .016, was due to generally higher ratings of the leading Team E in the Cumulative than in the Incremental Format, consistent with<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves and Mata (2019)</ref>. The interaction was negligible, F(1, 285) = .006, p = .940, η² &lt; .01. Thus, participants were obviously sensitive to the manipulation of the presented performance reports.Direct Comparisons of Present Performance.Figure 2 also indicates the same tendency as in Experiment 1 to consider the trailing Team Y superior to the leading Team E in a direct comparison of present performance. The perceived superiority of the trailing team was manifested in ratings below the scale midpoint across all conditions, Mdev = -1.02 (SD = 2.62), t(285) = -6.56, p &lt; .001, d = -0.39. Separate analyses revealed the same trend for the Cumulative Format condition with trailing Team Y winning, Mdev = -1.43 (SD = 2.56), t(68) = -4.66, p &lt; .001, d = -0.56; Cumulative Format with leading Team E winning, Mdev = -0.79, SD = 2.77, t (72) = -2.45, p = .017, d = -0.29; Incremental Format if the trailing Team wins, M = -1.04 (SD = 2.39), t (68) = -3.63, p &lt; .001, d = -0.44; and Incremental Format if the leading Team wins, M = -0.83 (SD = 2.74), t (74) = -2.62, p = .011, d = -0.30. The lack of any 2 ANOVA effects (all Fs &lt; 1.91, all ps &gt; .168) once more corroborated the regularity of this shift from CRB to PSB. Future performance ratings. Participants also expected the future performance for the trailing Team Y to be superior to the leading Team E, as evident from a negative Mdev = -1.52 (SD = 2.68), t(285) = -9.59, p &lt; .001, d = -0.57. Again, as shown in Figure 2, no differences between conditions were found in an ANOVA (all Fs &lt; 2.49, all ps &gt; .115). The trailing Team Y received more favorable ratings in all four experimental conditions: Cumulative Format with Team Y winning, Mdev = -1.91 (SD = 2.59), t (68) = -6.14, p &lt; .001, d = -0.74; Cumulative Format with Team E winning, Mdev = -1.16 (SD = 2.73), t(72) = -3.64, p &lt; .001, d = -0.43; Incremental Format if Team Y wins, Mdev = -1.38 (SD = 2.72), t(68) = -4.21, p &lt; .001, d = -0.51; and Incremental Format if Team E wins, Mdev = -1.63 (SD = 2.66), t(74) = -5.30, p &lt; .001, d = -0.61. 3Ratings across time. Finally, we included past, present, and future performance measures as an additional repeated-measures factor. A significant main effect for Final Outcome (team E vs. Y wins), F(1, 282) = 14.13, p &lt; .001, η² = .02, showed that winning All findings remained significant after a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.2 Bonferroni correction, again, changed no significance of the results. teams received generally higher ratings, Mdev = -1.28 (SD = 2.03), than loosing teams, Mdev = -0.37 (SD = 2.05). The rated superiority of the trailing Team Y increased over time, F(1, 282) = 26.66, p &lt; .001, η² = .05, from past, Mdev = 0.11 (SD = 3.72), to present, M = -1.02 (SD = 2.62), to future performance, Mdev = -1.52 (SD = 2.68). Notably, the time perspective interacted with the Final Outcome, F(1, 282) = 9.79, p &lt; .001, η² = .02. The difference between winning Team Y, Mdev = -0.95 (SD = 3.60), and winning Team E, Mdev = 1.09 (SD = 3.56), was only manifest in ratings of past performance, but not in present (Mdev = -1.24, SD = 2.47; Mdev = -0.81, SD = 2.75, respectively) and future performance ratings (Mdev = -1.65, SD = 2.66; Mdev = -1.40, SD = 2.70, respectively). Lastly, a significant result was also obtained for the interaction of the ratings' temporal perspective with Stimulus Format, F(1, 282) = 3.72, p = .025, η² = .006. Past performance ratings were higher for Cumulative, Mdev = 0.57 (SD = 3.62), than for Incremental Format, Mdev = -0.35 (SD = 3.76), whereas ratings of Final Outcomes (Mdev = -0.93, SD = 2.57; Mdev = -1.11, SD = 2.68, respectively) and future performance (Mdev = -1.51, SD = 2.68; Mdev = -1.53, SD = 2.68, respectively) were not.Thus, regardless of Stimulus Format (Cumulative vs. Incremental) and Final Outcome (Team Y vs. Team E wins), ratings of present and future performance in all conditions favored the trailing Team Y over the leading Team E.

Aiming for a test power of at least 0.80 detecting a medium effect size, we planned to collect data from around 160 participants. Participants were1 recruited via an online-recruitment platform of the University of Mannheim. After exclusion due to missings on relevant variables a total of 158 participants remained. Sample size was determined before data analysis and never contingent on preceding data analysis. The participant sample consisted primarily of students (96.8%); 122 (77.2%) were female, 34 (21.5%) were male; two persons (1.3%) indicated "diverse". Age ranged from 18 to 68 years (M = 25.27, SD = 8.43).

Participants first gave their informed consent. Then, general instructions informed them that they would see the second half of a soccer season (17 weeks played) and would, afterward, be asked to predict the course of the subsequent season. Participants were then first presented with the table of a soccer league, which reflected the standings right after the first half of the season (Illustration 1 in the Appendix). Depending on the condition, the focal teams' results on every game day were then presented either simultaneously, facilitatingAs an exact odds ratio for an informed logistic regression was not derivable from past literature.comparativeThe stimulus display on each trial unfolded over three stages. First, participants saw the full table of all 18 teams for one and a half seconds, with no team highlighted, along with an updated point account indicated on the right (Illustration 2a, Appendix). During this stage, the table view was the same for both Presentation Modes. For a second period of 1.5 seconds, the name and point account of a focal team (Successive Mode) or of both focal teams (Simultaneous Mode) were highlighted in the table (Illustration 2b). In a final two-second stage, only the highlighted part of the latter stage was conserved (clearly visible and enlarged); the remaining part of the table was blurred, thus inviting participants to encode the critical part of the complex display, namely the two focal teams' information (Illustration 2c).</note></figure>

Recruitment was never contingent on interim data analyses. Most participants were students (95.8%); 219 (76.6%) were female and 67 (23.4%) were male. Age ranged from 18 to 91 years (M = 24.88, SD = 11.01). Participants were randomly assigned to , the results for every game day were embedded in the context of the full soccer league table. The focal teams' results were highlighted. Yet, in addition to the cumulative scores, in both conditions stimulus displays also indicated each team's point increments gained on a game day. Depending on Stimulus Format, the display highlighted either the teams' overall score(Cumulative Format)    or the points gained on the current game day (Incremental Format) as displayed in Illustration 3 in the Appendix.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Method</cell></row><row><cell>Participants and design.</cell></row></table><note>conditions of a Final Outcome (Team Y wins vs. Team E wins) × Stimulus Format (Cumulative vs. Incremental) design.Procedure The procedure of Experiment 2 was identical to that of Experiment 1, except for the replacement of the Presentation Mode by the Stimulus Format (Cumulative vs. Incremental) manipulation.
