			<abstract>
				<p>This article highlights the importance of a patient-centered approach (PCC) in providing effective care for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Despite increasing awareness of ASD, many misconceptions persist, such as the belief that all individuals with ASD share the same characteristics or that the condition is limited to childhood. The article emphasizes that ASD affects people of all ages, genders, and ethnic backgrounds, and calls for a more personalized approach to care that goes beyond medical needs to address the social, emotional, and educational aspects of patients&apos; lives. It argues that listening to the experiences of both patients and their families is crucial to offering compassionate and empathetic care. It even provides evidence-based practical guidance for primary care providers (PCPs) to adapt their approaches, emphasizing the use of the biopsychosocial model for a more comprehensive treatment strategy. Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects individuals of all ages and backgrounds, yet misconceptions and stigma persist. Effective healthcare requires a patient-centered approach that addresses their unique medical, emotional, and social needs. This study surveyed caregivers Brain Sci. 2025, 01, FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13 of individuals with ASD from Myanmar to understand their experiences with healthcare services, communication, and unmet needs, offering insights to improve care delivery and inclusivity. Objective: This study aims to explore the healthcare experiences of caregivers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from Myanmar to identify challenges and gaps in communication, support, and service delivery. By analyzing these perspectives, the study seeks to provide insights that inform patient-centered care strategies, addressing the unique medical, emotional, and social needs of individuals with ASD. Ultimately, the objective is to promote inclusive and empathetic healthcare practices that improve long-term outcomes for individuals with ASD and their families. Methodology: This study employed a survey-based approach to collect data from caregivers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from Myanmar. The survey contained structured questions aimed at evaluating caregivers&apos; experiences with healthcare services, communication practices, and challenges. The collected responses were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics to identify trends, while qualitative responses were subjected to thematic analysis to uncover recurring patterns and insights. This dual approach ensured a comprehensive understanding of the caregivers&apos; perspectives and highlighted key areas for improving patient-centered care strategies. Results: The survey revealed significant challenges faced by caregivers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in accessing and navigating healthcare. Quantitative analysis showed that a majority of respondents reported difficulties with communication between providers and patients, as well as unmet needs in addressing sensory sensitivities and behavioral concerns. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses highlighted a lack of tailored care, gaps in provider training, and the need for greater caregiver involvement in decision-making. These findings Brain Sci. 2025, 01, FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 13 underscore the importance of adopting inclusive, patient-centered care practices to better support individuals with ASD and their families. Conclusion: Adopting a patient-centered care approach and the biopsychosocial model significantly enhances care for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). By addressing their unique health challenges with empathy, communication, and collaboration, healthcare providers can offer more effective and inclusive treatment. Ultimately, fostering understanding and reducing stigma around ASD is essential for improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for these individuals.</p>

Despite increasing awareness and understanding, persistent misconceptions and stigma continue to challenge the effective care and support of those with ASD. Providing healthcare for individuals with ASD requires more than just addressing medical concerns-it necessitates a comprehensive, patient-centered approach (PCC) that incorporates social, emotional, and educational aspects of care. This study insights from caregivers, the study highlights areas where improvements are needed, particularly in enhancing communication, fostering inclusivity, and addressing the unique challenges faced by those with ASD. The findings emphasize the critical need for a holistic approach that combines empathy, collaboration, and coordinated care. It is essential to consider not only the medical and clinical needs of individuals with ASD but also the broader, multifaceted support required to improve their quality of life and well-being. The study advocates for healthcare providers to engage more actively with caregivers and adopt patient-centered practices that can lead to better long-term outcomes for individuals with ASD and their families.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Quantitative Findings</head><p>The Likert-scale questions revealed several noteworthy trends:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1.3.Care Coordination:</head><p>A clear theme emerged that care coordination was often lacking.</p><p>Many caregivers reported doing much of the work in keeping multiple healthcare providers informed, with some feeling overwhelmed by the need to repeatedly communicate the same details to various specialists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4.">Caregiver Involvement in Decision-Making:</head><p>While most caregivers were included in decisions about their child's care, many felt that their input was undervalued. Some reported that the final decisions often seemed to be made without sufficient consideration of their opinions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Qualitative Findings</head><p>The open-ended responses provided deeper insight into the specific challenges caregivers faced:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Lack of Proactive Support:</head><p>Many caregivers reported that healthcare providers did not offer proactive support and often waited for caregivers to initiate contact. There was a strong desire for more regular check-ins and guidance, particularly concerning mental health and sleep-related issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Inconsistent Understanding of Caregiving Challenges: Some caregivers felt that</head><p>healthcare providers did not fully grasp the emotional and physical demands of caring for a child with ASD. This led to feelings of frustration, as providers were sometimes perceived as dismissive or unaware of the challenges faced by caregivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Care Coordination Issues:</head><p>The lack of effective coordination between primary care providers(PCPs) emerged as a significant concern. Caregivers frequently mentioned that Brain Sci. 2025, 01, FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 13 they had to manage the logistics of scheduling, follow-up, and ensuring that all providers were aware of their child's care needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.">Limited Involvement in Decision-Making:</head><p>Although caregivers were often consulted in decisions regarding care, many felt their input was not fully incorporated into the decision-making process. There was a recurring sense that healthcare providers made final decisions without adequately considering caregivers' perspectives.</p><p>The results of this study highlight the need for more proactive and coordinated care in the healthcare services for individuals with ASD in Myanmar. Caregivers expressed a desire for more consistent support, better communication, and a more holistic approach to care that includes mental health, sleep health, and emotional well-being. Additionally, there is a strong need for healthcare providers to better understand the full scope of challenges that caregivers face and to actively involve them in decision-making processes to improve care outcomes for both the child and the caregiver. A notable concern raised by caregivers was the lack of holistic care that addresses not only the medical needs of patients but also the emotional and psychological needs of caregivers. This aligns with prior studies that suggest the need for healthcare systems to adopt a more integrated approach to care (Kasari &amp; Smith, 2013). Effective care coordination across various specialists was also identified as a major gap, with many caregivers reporting that they had to manage and track appointments and information independently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>While the study highlights these important issues, it also suggests potential solutions. The findings point to a need for healthcare providers to offer more proactive follow-ups, better communication, and more comprehensive care planning that includes both the patient's and the caregiver's needs. Establishing consistent check-ins and ensuring that caregivers feel fully involved in the decision-making process could help reduce the burden they experience.</p><p>There are limitations to this study, including a small sample size and potential biases associated with self-reported data. Caregivers' perspectives may also vary depending on their geographical location and access to healthcare resources. Future research should aim to include a larger, more diverse sample and examine the effectiveness of specific interventions designed to improve caregiver support and care coordination.</p><p>In conclusion, this study underscores the need for healthcare systems to provide more proactive, holistic, and coordinated care for individuals with ASD and their caregivers.</p><p>Implementing these changes could significantly alleviate caregiver stress, improve their satisfaction with healthcare services, and enhance the quality of care for individuals with ASD.
