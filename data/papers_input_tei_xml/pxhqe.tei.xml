<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Why are you reading this article? You might answer this question by referring to a series of events in your past which culminated in an interest in teleological reasoning or speeded decision-making tasks. Another possible answer is that you are reading this article to learn whether speeded decision-making can reveal tacit teleological tendencies. Whereas the former is a causal explanation about teleology, the latter is a teleological explanation about teleology. Put simply, teleological explanations are those in which something is explained with reference to a function, outcome, or goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948)</ref>.</p><p>Teleological reasoning is commonly used to explain the actions of intentional agents (as in the example above), the existence of human-made artefacts (e.g., "pens exist for writing"), and sometimes controversially (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dennett, 2017)</ref>, biological traits (e.g., "birds have wings in order to fly"). For intentional action and the existence of human-made artefacts, teleological reasoning is appropriate because both can be explained with reference to the intentions of an agent. If an agent creates a pen with the intention that this device will allow him or her to write, then that pen exists for writing. In the case of biological traits, teleological reasoning is appropriate not because of intentional action, but because of the consequence aetiology of natural selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dennett, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lombrozo &amp; Carey, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wright, 1976)</ref>. That is, "birds have wings in order to fly", because the function of flight resulted in fitness advantages for those creatures with ancient wing-like structures. The function that wings serve, is the very reason for their current existence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Intention-Based Teleology</head><p>Teleological reasoning is sometimes used to explain things which cannot be attributed to the actions of an intentional agent or the consequence aetiology of natural selection.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kelemen (1999a)</ref> all teleological reasoning is psychologically based in the application of an intentional stance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dennett, 1987)</ref>. This intention-based theory of teleology SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 4 posits that from an early age, an intentional stance is applied beyond the domain of explaining intentional action. This is similar to the idea that the actual domain of a modular cognitive process extends beyond the module's proper domain (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Atran &amp; Norenzayan, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Boyer, 1994)</ref> 1 . Just as the application of an intentional stance to its proper domain results in a teleological explanation (e.g., "she crossed the road in order to get to the other side"), the application of this stance beyond its proper domain also results in a teleological explanation (e.g., "the computer crashed in order to annoy me"). As teleological beliefs are said to be based in the application of this early-developing predictive strategy, according to <ref type="bibr">Kelemen</ref>, people often hold teleological beliefs even when the actions of an intentional agent are lacking. One domain of teleological reasoning that has received considerable attention, is the function-based explanation of biological and nonbiological natural entities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kelemen, 1999c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Roberts et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Willard et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1.">Non-Experimental Evidence for Intention-Based Teleology</head><p>Teleological explanations such as "rivers flow downstream in order to get to the ocean", or "trees produce oxygen so that animals can breathe", tend to be accepted by children to a greater extent than adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kelemen, 1999b)</ref>. However, under certain circumstances, adults also display high levels of acceptance for such teleological explanations. Rates of teleological acceptance in adults are positively correlated with anthropomorphism <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Roberts et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">White et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Willard et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Willard &amp; Norenzayan, 2013)</ref> and belief in God <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kelemen &amp; Diyanni, 2005</ref>), suggesting that 1 Although a discussion of modularity is beyond the scope of the current paper, there are many accessible sources on this topic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grossi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kurzban, 2010)</ref>. Modularity theory posits that certain neural circuits are domain specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fodor, 1983)</ref>. That is, cognitive modules selectively respond to certain stimuli in the environment. By the proper domain of a module, we mean the class of stimuli that a given cognitive process evolved "in response to" (e.g., a face detection module afforded fitness advantages to organisms with this neural circuit by allowing them to recognise faces of conspecifics). By the actual domain of a module, we mean all the stimuli to which a given cognitive process responds to (e.g., a face detection module may respond to masks because masks resemble faces). SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 5 teleological reasoning is facilitated by notions of intentionality (whether to the natural world itself or to an intending designer). However, even non-religious individuals display evidence of teleological beliefs about biological and nonbiological natural entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(JÃ¤rnefelt et al., 2015)</ref>, supporting the view that such beliefs represent somewhat of a default mode of explanation.</p><p>Convergent non-experimental evidence also suggests that when people lack an alternative causal explanation, or that when access to the cognitive resources needed to inhibit intuitions is limited, people tend to be more accepting of teleological explanations about biological and non-biological natural entities. Evidence for this claim comes from studies showing increased teleological acceptance in 1) Alzheimer's patients relative to agematched controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lombrozo et al., 2007)</ref>; 2) individuals with low levels of formal education relative to those with high levels of formal education <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Casler &amp; Kelemen, 2008)</ref>; and 3) children relative to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kelemen, 1999b)</ref>. Further non-experimental evidence comes from the negative relationship between performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and rates of acceptance for teleological explanations about biological and non-biological natural entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Roberts et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Zemla et al., 2012)</ref>. Each item in the CRT is designed to elicit an intuitively appealing, yet incorrect response (e.g., "if you are running a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in?"). In this example, the intuitive response is "first place", but the correct response is "second place". As performance on the CRT requires an individual to inhibit the intuitive response, the negative relationship between CRT performance and rates of teleological acceptance has been taken as evidence that compared to low-scoring CRT participants, high-scoring CRT participants may simply be better at inhibiting their teleological intuitions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2.">Experimental Evidence for Intention-Based Teleology</head><p>Experimental evidence for the claim that adults find teleological explanations about biological and nonbiological natural entities compelling, comes from the use of speeded vs.</p><p>un-speeded decision-making tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mills &amp; Frowley, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al., 2020)</ref>. In this paradigm, participants are allocated to either a speeded or un-speeded condition and are asked to respond "true" or "false" <ref type="bibr">(or "yes" or "no")</ref> to a series of teleological test statements and control statements. In the speeded condition, participants typically have either 3200ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mills &amp; Frowley, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al., 2020)</ref> or 5000ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mills &amp; Frowley, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rottman et al., 2017)</ref> to respond to each statement 2 . The logic behind using a speeded decision-making paradigm in the study of tacit teleological tendencies, is based in dual-process theories of reasoning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">De Neys, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pennycook et al., 2015)</ref>. As time-pressure limits the opportunity to reflect upon and inhibit an initial response, responses in the speeded condition are thought to provide an indication of pre-reflective belief <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013)</ref>. Consistent with the non-experimental evidence, studies employing this paradigm have reported significantly greater teleological acceptance in the speeded condition compared to the un-speeded condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.3.">Problems with Speeded Decision-Making</head><p>Despite the consistency between experimental and non-experimental evidence, a potential problem with the speeded vs. un-speeded paradigm, as it is commonly used, is that it may lead to selection bias. Inclusion criteria vary across studies, but participants in both conditions are typically required to respond correctly to a certain percentage of control statements, ranging from just 25% correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009)</ref>, to over 80% correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al., 2020)</ref>. Additionally, participants in the speeded condition are required to answer a certain percentage of test statements within the time limit, ranging from 25% <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009)</ref>, to over 75% <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al., 2020)</ref>. These inclusion criteria can result in a higher rate of exclusion in the speeded condition compared to the un-speeded condition. For example, despite <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al. (2020)</ref> allocating 138 participants to either a speeded or un-speeded condition at a ratio of 1.5 (speeded): 1 (un-speeded), only 34 participants in the speeded condition and 54 in the unspeeded condition met the inclusion criteria. The different rates of exclusion mean it is possible that the participants vary systematically in certain ways between the two conditions.</p><p>As mentioned previously, there is a negative relationship between CRT performance and rates of teleological acceptance in the absence of time pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Roberts et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Zemla et al., 2012)</ref>. Given that each question on the CRT is designed to elicit an intuitively appealing incorrect answer, performance on the CRT requires an individual to first inhibit their intuitions, and to then reflect to produce the correct response. This leads to two possibilities regarding the relationship between CRT performance and inclusion in the decision-making task. If high-scoring CRT participants are more likely to pause and reflect before providing an answer, this could lead to the systematic exclusion of these individuals in the speeded condition if they fail to answer a sufficient percentage of test statements within the time-limit. Due to the negative relationship between CRT performance and teleological acceptance, excluding high-scoring CRT participants in the speeded condition could artificially increase rates of teleological acceptance in this condition. However, it is also conceivable that high-scoring CRT participants may be better able to answer quickly when under time pressure to respond. As such, this could lead to the systematic exclusion of lowscoring CRT participants in the speeded condition, thereby artificially decreasing rates of teleological acceptance in this condition. Either of these possibilities would be problematic SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 8 for the claim that speeded decision-making can provide an accurate assessment of tacit teleological tendencies.</p><p>While the finding of increased teleological acceptance in the speeded compared to unspeeded condition appears to be robust <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al., 2020</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr">Liquin &amp; Lombrozo, 2018 -study 5)</ref>, this alone is not evidence of tacit teleological tendencies. The claim that this paradigm provides evidence of such tacit tendencies, rests on the idea that the difference in responses between conditions is due to the speeded condition limiting the opportunity to inhibit reflective thought. However, in this paradigm, participants also respond to a series of objectively false and objectively true control statements in either condition. As such, unless we are also willing to concede that speeded decision-making provides evidence of implicit belief in things that are objectively false (e.g., "people smoke cigarettes in order to get lung cancer"), or evidence of implicit disbelief in things that are objectively true (e.g., "doctors prescribe antibiotics in order to treat infections"), the effect of time pressure must be greater for teleological test statements than for control statements.</p><p>At present, there is little evidence to suggest that the effect of time pressure is greater for teleological test statements than for control statements. This is not necessarily due to the absence of such evidence in the data, but rather, due to the ways in which results have been reported, and to the slight differences in procedures across studies. For example, by presenting groups of participants with statements on an overhead screen for varying durations (un-speeded; moderately-speeded, 5000ms; and fast-speeded, 3200ms) and asking them to respond by ticking boxes on an answer sheet, studies have found an effect of speed on response accuracy for certain teleological statements <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mills &amp; Frowley, 2014)</ref>. When looking at control statement accuracy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kelemen and Rosset (2009)</ref> found that un-speeded participants were significantly less accurate than the other groups SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 9 (Study One), although this effect failed to replicate in a second study (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mills &amp; Frowley, 2014)</ref>. However, given the manipulation of speed in these studies involved participants being presented with statements on an overhead screen and responding by ticking boxes on an answer sheet, it was possible for participants to respond after the statements had disappeared from the screen. Therefore, it may not be so surprising that using this procedure, participants were still highly accurate in responding to control statements in the speeded conditions.</p><p>A more rigorous approach has been to use computerised tasks to limit not only the duration of presentation, but also the response window. Using this approach, studies have found an interaction between condition (un-speeded, speeded) and statement-type accuracy (teleological, control). However, the way in which this interaction has been reported does not necessarily provide evidence of tacit teleological tendencies. Using the speeded vs. unspeeded paradigm to investigate the teleological beliefs of professional scientists, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kelemen et al. (2013)</ref> found a larger mean difference between conditions for test statements (14% difference) than control statements (3% difference). Similarly, using an undergraduate sample, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al. (2020)</ref> found a larger mean difference between conditions for test statements (18.9% difference) than control statements (3.5% difference). Such results have also been replicated in a Chinese adult sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Rottman et al., 2017)</ref>, with a larger mean difference between conditions for test statements (14% difference) than control statements (6% difference). Examination of the descriptive statistics in these studies show that although the mean differences were indeed larger for test statements than for control statements, since control statements tend to be answered quite accurately, the variation in responses was also larger for test statements than for control statements. As measures of effect size take account of not only a difference in means, but also some component of error variance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lakens, 2013</ref>), a greater mean difference in response accuracy between conditions for test statements SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 10 than for control statements, does not necessarily equate to a larger effect size for the former than for the latter.</p><p>Finally, even if it can be shown that speeded decision-making has a greater effect on test statement accuracy than on control statement accuracy, this would still not necessarily provide evidence of implicit teleological beliefs. As placing participants under cognitive load has been shown to increase yea-saying <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Knowles &amp; Condon, 1999)</ref>, it is possible that speeded decision-making merely increases the likelihood of accepting statements as true. As the control statements used in the previously mentioned studies describe things which are objectively true or false, when presented without a time-limit, they tend to be accepted at close to ceiling and floor levels, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Roberts et al., 2021)</ref>. If speeded decisionmaking does increase the likelihood of accepting statements as true, then comparing test statement accuracy to the aggregate of all control statements may be problematic, as the true control statements could reduce the difference in accuracy between conditions for control statements as a whole. As teleological test statements describe beliefs that adults are hypothesised to inhibit, a stronger test of the hypothesis that speeded decision-making can uncover tacit teleological tendencies, would be to compare the effect of time pressure for teleological test statements relative to control statements that are objectively false. To provide evidence of tacit teleological tendencies, this paradigm must be able to demonstrate that the effect of time pressure for test statements is significantly greater than the effect of time pressure for false control statements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Current Studies</head><p>In summary, there are three key issues in studies that have used the speeded vs. un- responses to teleological test statements to the aggregate of all control statements (i.e., those which are objectively false and those which are objectively true), may obscure differences in accuracy between conditions. In the current two studies, we aimed to explore these issues and determine whether the speeded decision-making paradigm provides evidence of tacit teleological tendencies. These studies were approved by the [BLINDED] University Human Research Ethics Committee (protocol number <ref type="bibr">[BLINDED]</ref>), under the project titled "The Intentional Stance and Teleological Endorsement".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Study One</head><p>In Study One, we sought to explore the issues raised above using a large online sample. First, we investigated whether the typical speeded vs. un-speeded paradigm results in selection bias. Due to the higher expected rate of exclusion in the speeded condition compared to the un-speeded condition, and due to the additional inclusion criterion and greater difficulty of the task in the former, we predicted that participants who met inclusion criteria in the speeded condition would differ significantly in their ability to inhibit intuitions relative to participants who did not meet inclusion criteria in this condition. Second, we investigated whether the speeded vs. un-speeded paradigm provides evidence of a dissociation between implicit and explicit teleological beliefs. If implicit teleological beliefs are truly driving the effects of interest, then the effect of time pressure should be greater for teleological test statements than for control statements. Specifically, any increase in rates of acceptance for teleological test statements under time pressure, should not be attributable to acceptance of statements that are objectively false.

Participants received payment of Â£2.22 for taking part in an online study that took approximately 15 minutes to complete. As we aimed to investigate whether inclusion in the speeded condition varied systematically with the tendency to inhibit intuitions, and as highly educated individuals tend to be both less teleological <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013)</ref> and more analytical <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Purcell et al., 2020)</ref>, only individuals with formal educational qualifications no higher than an undergraduate university degree were eligible to participate.

Participants completed the Teleological Beliefs</head><p>Scale (TBS: <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Roberts et al., 2021)</ref> which measures teleological beliefs about biological and non-biological natural entities. The TBS contains 98 statements across six categories: biological teleological test (n = 14; e.g., "Plants consume CO2 in order to reduce greenhouse gases"), non-biological teleological test (n = 14; e.g., "The Earth has a moon in order to control the tides"), false causal (n = 25; e.g., "Pebbles have rounded edges because they are little"), false teleological (n = 10; e.g., "Houses have doorbells in order to make dogs bark"), true causal (n = 25; e.g., "Fireworks explode because gunpowder ignites when a fuse is lit"), and true teleological (n = 10; e.g., "Alarm clocks beep in order to wake people up"). In the current study, we collapsed both categories of test statements, both categories of false control statements, and both categories of true control statements. Participants responded "true" or "false" to each statement, and a total score for each category was calculated as the proportion of statements endorsed. The teleological test statements displayed good internal consistency (Î± = .894).</p></div>

Participants completed the Anthropomorphism</head><p>Questionnaire (AQ: <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Neave et al., 2015)</ref>, which contains 20 items measuring anthropomorphic experiences in childhood (e.g., "When I was a child, I held birthday parties for my favourite toys") and adulthood (e.g., "I sometimes feel that the sea can be angry"). Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 6 (Very much so). A total score is obtained by summing all items, such that scores have a potential range of 0 to 120.

The full version of the CRS contains 15 items balanced across five subscales: experience (e.g., "How often do you experience situations in which you have the feeling that God or something divine intervenes in your life?"), ideology (e.g., "To what extent do you believe that God or something divine exists?"), intellect (e.g., "How often do you think about religious issues?"), private practise (e.g., "How often do you pray?"), and public practise (e.g., "How often do you take part in SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 14 religious services?"). As belief in God is not necessarily related to a desire to learn about religious topics (intellect subscale) or attendance at religious services (public practise subscale), we used a reduced version of the CRS which contained only the experience, ideology, and private practise subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Roberts et al., 2021)</ref>.

The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?": <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Frederick, 2005</ref>). In the current study, we used slightly re-worded versions of the original three questions (e.g., "The ages of Mark and Adam add up to 28 years. Mark is 20 years older than Adam. How many years old is Adam?"). Additionally, the extended version of the CRT contains four less math focused questions (e.g., "Emily's father has three daughters. The first two are named April and May. What is the third daughter's name?": <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Thomson &amp; Oppenheimer, 2016)</ref>.

Collapsed across conditions, participants who met the inclusion criteria were significantly less religious and significantly better at inhibiting their intuitions. This is problematic, as it demonstrates the systematic exclusion of certain individuals in one condition, but not in the other. The direction of this relationship was such that individuals who tend to express more teleological beliefs are systematically excluded from the speeded condition, thereby potentially resulting in decreased teleological acceptance in this condition. In other words, the exclusion of these individuals from the speeded condition may provide an overly conservative estimate of tacit teleological tendencies.</p><p>However, more fundamentally problematic for claims of speeded decision-making providing evidence for tacit teleological tendencies, was the effect of time pressure on responses to teleological test statements and control statements. The results of Study One showed that the effect of time pressure for teleological test statements, was weaker than the effect of time pressure for control statements on average. Contrast testing revealed that this difference was driven by reduced accuracy when responding to objectively false control statements in the speeded condition. Rather than time pressure uncovering tacit teleological tendencies, this suggests that time pressure increases acceptance of things which are false; of which, it could be argued, teleological explanations about biological and nonbiological natural entities are a part.</p></div>

The basis for using speeded decision-making to uncover tacit teleological tendencies, is that additional processing, and hence, time, should be required to inhibit the expression of such beliefs. Contrary to these predictions, we found that response latencies for correctly rejected and incorrectly accepted teleological test statements did not differ. Even when restricting our analysis to those statements with a mean acceptance of between 40% and 60%, there was no evidence of a difference in response latencies between correct and incorrect responses on these items.

While there is convergent non-experimental evidence to support this claim (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Casler &amp; Kelemen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lombrozo et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Zemla et al., 2012)</ref>, experimental evidence comes from comparing rates of teleological acceptance in speeded and un-speeded conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mills &amp; Frowley, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al., 2020)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 32</head><p>Using both an online community sample and an undergraduate psychology student sample, the current studies identified several problems with the use of the speeded vs. unspeeded paradigm in the study of teleological beliefs. As this paradigm necessitates the exclusion of participants who respond inaccurately to control statements or fail to respond to a sufficient proportion of test statements within the time limit, this leads to different rates of exclusion between the conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Roberts et al., 2020)</ref>. Exclusion was also found to vary systematically with the tendency to inhibit intuitions, with participants scoring lower on the CRT more likely to be excluded. Due to the significantly higher rate of participant exclusion in the speeded condition than in the un-speeded condition, participants scoring lower on the CRT were disproportionately excluded in the speeded condition, but not in the un-speeded condition. As scores on the CRT were negatively related to rates of teleological acceptance, systematically excluding low-scoring CRT participants from the speeded condition means this paradigm may artificially decrease the mean rate of teleological acceptance in the speeded condition following participant exclusion. As a result, this paradigm may provide an overly conservative estimate of teleological acceptance in the speeded condition.</p><p>More problematic for research employing this paradigm in the study of teleological beliefs, is that the effect of time pressure on teleological acceptance, which has previously been taken as evidence of tacit teleological tendencies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mills &amp; Frowley, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al., 2020)</ref>, was weaker than the effect of time pressure on control statement (in)accuracy. That is, although the mean difference in accuracy between conditions was larger for teleological test statements than for control statements, the variation in accuracy for teleological test statements was also larger than for control statements. In both studies, the effect of time pressure for control statement inaccuracy was driven by responses to control statements that were objectively false. Rather than speeded decision-making uncovering tacit teleological tendencies, these findings suggest SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 33 that speeded decision-making increases rates of acceptance for statements that are objectively false. Therefore, unless we are willing to concede that people implicitly believe that "post-it notes are sticky because they are yellow", or that "people smoke cigarettes in order to get lung cancer", it is problematic to claim that this paradigm provides evidence of tacit teleological tendencies.</p><p>While our results show that the speeded vs. un-speeded paradigm does not provide evidence for a dissociation of implicit and explicit teleological beliefs, in isolation, this would be considered a methodological issue, but not necessarily a theoretical one. That is, an</p><p>intention-based theory of teleology suggests that teleological beliefs about biological and non-biological natural entities are a "developmentally persistent cognitive default" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">(Kelemen et al., , p. 1075</ref>, but this theory does not rest on the claim that a speeded decisionmaking task can uncover such tendencies. However, the appropriateness of speeded decision-making in dissociating implicit and explicit teleological beliefs, is based on two theoretical assumptions. First, teleological beliefs are conceptualised as existing within a dual-process framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kelemen &amp; Rosset, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Zemla et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>According to this view, there exist two qualitatively different types of cognitive processes;</p><p>type-1 processes which are fast, effortless, and do not require working memory, and type-2 processes which are slow, effortful, and do require working memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013</ref>). In the current context, teleological beliefs are conceptualised as resulting from a type-1 process. According to this view, as speeded responding precludes the opportunity to engage in reflective thought, responses in the speeded condition are said to reflect a person's belief at an implicit level. Second, it is implicitly assumed that teleological and non-teleological beliefs about a given entity or phenomenon cannot coexist at a prereflective level and be held with equivalent conviction. The finding that response latencies did not differ between teleological statements that were correctly rejected and teleological SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 34 statements that were incorrectly accepted, suggests that if this first assumption is true, and teleological beliefs do result from type-1 cognitive processes, the second assumption must be false.</p><p>Although non-experimental evidence suggests teleological beliefs are the default when alternative causal modes of explanation have not been obtained through formal education <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Casler &amp; Kelemen, 2008)</ref>, or when alternative knowledge structures are impaired as a result of neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lombrozo et al., 2007)</ref>, this does not speak to whether the non-teleological beliefs of educated individuals without neurological impairment are merely "expressed", or whether they are held at a deeper "implicit" level. Recent work in the field of judgment and decision-making suggests that multiple automatic responses to a given stimulus can occur in parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(De Neys, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pennycook et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, people are intuitively aware of both the believability  and logical structure of arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morsanyi &amp; Handley, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Trippas et al., 2016)</ref>, despite the fact that each of these factors may interfere with judgements of the other factor. People may hold implicit teleological beliefs about biological and nonbiological natural entities, but if they also have an intuitive awareness of an alternative non-teleological explanation, time pressure would not necessarily lead to the expression of the teleological explanation over the alternative. Given the broader field of thinking and reasoning has moved towards dual-process models which allow for multiple type-1 processes to co-occur, theories which situate teleological beliefs with a dual-process framework should do the same. Future research should seek to test alternative paradigms that are not contingent upon the assumption that teleological and nonteleological beliefs about a particular entity cannot coexist implicitly and be held with equivalent conviction.</p><p>Drawing from the judgement and decision-making literature, one such alternative approach would be to make use of the belief bias effect. When asked to judge an argument as SPEEDED DECISION-MAKING AND TELEOLOGY 35 either logically valid or invalid, people are often biased by their belief in the conclusion of the argument <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pennycook et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Pennycook et al., , 2014</ref>. Specifically, when a logically valid argument contains an unbelievable conclusion, or when a logically invalid argument contains a believable conclusion, people experience a conflict between logical validity and belief, and are less accurate and slower to respond compared to when the logical validity and believability of the conclusion are congruent <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">TrÃ©moliÃ¨re et al., 2014)</ref>. By pairing teleological and non-teleological conclusions with both logically valid and logically invalid argument structures, it would be possible, based on an individual's stated beliefs, to determine whether they should experience a conflict for any given argument.</p><p>Making use of the belief bias effect in this way, it may be possible to dissociate implicitly held and explicitly expressed teleological beliefs.</p><p>Although the current findings may seem inconsistent with the existing literature in showing that the speeded vs. un-speeded paradigm does not provide evidence of a dissociation of implicit and explicit teleological beliefs, many aspects of our work are consistent with the existing literature. First, the bivariate relationships between belief in God, anthropomorphism, inhibition of intuitions, and teleological acceptance replicate previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Roberts et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Willard et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Willard &amp; Norenzayan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Zemla et al., 2012)</ref>. Second, in terms of the effect of time pressure on teleological test statements, the difference in accuracy between conditions (17% Study One; 21% Study Two) are similar to previously reported findings. In fact, the mean difference between conditions reported in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Roberts et al., 2020)</ref> are contained within the confidence intervals of the current results. In conjunction with the fact that the findings of Study One replicated when using a large undergraduate sample in Study Two, this provides additional confidence in the current results.</p><p>SPEEDED  In summary, the current studies have shown that the standard experimental paradigm for demonstrating tacit teleological tendenciesto compare rates of teleological acceptance in an un-speeded condition to that in a speeded conditionmay not, in fact, provide evidence for such tendencies. Rather, this paradigm results in selection bias and increased rates of acceptance for statements that are objectively false. This is more than just a methodological issue, as the use of speeded decision-making in this context is based on the theoretical assumption that teleological beliefs can be conceptualised within a dual-process framework.</p><p>We have argued that for the dual-process perspective of teleological beliefs to accommodate the current results, a particular aspect of this view may need to be modified. Teleological beliefs about biological and nonbiological natural entities may well be a "developmentally persistent cognitive default" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelemen et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">(Kelemen et al., , p. 1075</ref>, but for adults who have learnt alternative mechanistic explanations, there is no reason why teleological beliefs could not coexist with their non-teleological alternatives at an implicit level. This reframing of the current dual-process perspective of teleology would not only align with recent theoretical and empirical work within the broader field of thinking and reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(De Neys, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Howarth et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Morsanyi &amp; Handley, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pennycook et al., 2015)</ref>, but it would also inform new methodologies in the study of teleological beliefs.

Standardised scores were computed based on these means, resulting the exclusion of four participants with zscores greater than 4.25. All other z-scores were within a range of -0.75 to 2.13. Next, standardised scores were calculated for individual trials. Latencies for trials with a corresponding z-score greater than +/-3 were replaced with the mean latency of either correctly or incorrectly answered trials. A further four participants were excluded for nothaving both correct and incorrect responses to the test statements, leaving 111 participants. A paired t-test revealed no significant difference in response latencies between correctly rejected (M = 4812.52, SD = 1919.15) and incorrectly accepted teleological test statements (M = 4898.53, SD = 2386.45), t (110) = -0.43, p = .668. A Bayesian paired t-test using an uninformative prior provided strong support for the null hypothesis of no difference between conditions (BF10 = 0.077).As a more conservative test of the difference in response latencies between correctly rejected and incorrectly accepted teleological test statements, we restricted our analysis to statements with a mean accuracy of between 40% and 60%.
