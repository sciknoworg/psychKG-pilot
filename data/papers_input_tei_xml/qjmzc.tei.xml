			<abstract>
				<p>Receiving affirmation, whether from ourselves or others, is crucial for interpersonal relationships and goes awry in mental disorders. Meaningful evaluations emerge during interactions, where people can support or let each other down. However, such dynamics are difficult to understand comprehensively without quantitative theory and modeling. Here, we implemented an interactive decision-making game wherein two real-life participants evaluated, i.e. graded their approval, for themselves and their play partner. Young adult participants interacted in a multi-level version of the iterated prisoner&apos;s dilemma. Crucially, each participant did not interact with the other directly, but instructed an avatar to do so on their behalf. This allowed increased experimental control while preserving considerable ecological validity. We tested computational models of participants&apos; evaluations of self and other, based on their beliefs about the quality of their decisions. However such models were less successful than a novel class of models, where self-and other-evaluations depended directly on the combination of self-and other-outcomes. The winning models suggested that for a given participant, evaluation of the self is proportional to how much one&apos;s partner benefits, and vice versa. We found marked self-positivity bias, especially in dyads where neither partner cooperated. This was consistent with attributional theory, negatively evaluating others rather than the self for adverse outcomes. Between participants, selfpositivity bias was explained by a reduced weight of one&apos;s partner&apos;s benefits for selfevaluation, hinting that the negative outcome subject to external attribution was the partner&apos;s, rather than one&apos;s own, poor returns. Preliminary analysis also suggested that a reduced sensitivity to others&apos; outcomes was associated, in this context when participants may have both cooperative and competitive motives, with reduced earnings for the self. The proposed computational model provides a concise and novel account of self-serving bias in evaluations, clearly observed during interactions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A positive assessment of the self is crucial for our well-being, and this is based on a holistic self-appraisal of our positive and negative 'value', alongside other's perceptions of us <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Elder et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Taylor &amp; Brown, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Y. Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>. In recent years, evidence from computational psychiatry studies has indicated that dynamic self-esteem has a similar computational structure to other emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Will et al., 2017)</ref>. Finessing the 'sociometer hypothesis', we found that the rate of increase in approval received from others matters more than the average level of approval in influencing self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Low et al., 2021)</ref>. However, these studies, which are based on simulated social feedback, have not elucidated how evaluating self and other takes place in real life. This is crucial, as appraisals of self and other determine how we act in social situations. We hypothesized that social approval during interactions would primarily depend on material outcomes for the self, but would also be informed by inequity relative to one's partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fehr &amp; Camerer, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hula et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this study we strive for ecological validity. Social interaction studies based on gametheoretical paradigms have been popular with researchers, but may be perceived as rarefied <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Colman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rilling &amp; Sanfey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schilbach et al., 2013)</ref> and even deceptive (deceive-then-debrief practices), damaging ecological validity. To study person-evaluations, we therefore introduced a new paradigm that entirely avoids deception, increases the reallife vividness of exchanges, and preserves the uncertain nature of real interactions. After validating this task, we used it to study the putative computations underlying self-and otherevaluation.</p><p>In the present task, a modified iterated prisoner's dilemma game, the outcome of each decision to risk social collaboration was followed by approval ratings of the self and of the other player. Additionally, participants rated how much the other player was likely to approve of them. On each trial, participants chose how much effort to invest in collaboration. Importantly, to increase ecological validity, the actual investment only noisily reflected intentions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A)</ref>. Participants could choose among four intended levels of investment, and were subject to the temptation to free-ride ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B)</ref>. To enhance ecological validity, two 'partners' met in the lab before and after the task, potentially exposing each other to feelings such as gratitude or embarrassment about how the task went.</p><p>We also introduced assessment of the key beliefs and preferences about self and other before the task started. These formed the basis of a computer avatar for each participant, which represented the participant when interacting with the other player. Crucially, the avatar behaved in important ways like the participant themselves. To build the model underpinning avatar behavior, we took as a starting point an observation that in game-theoretical tasks, a simple a priori strategy can exactly substitute, under certain conditions, for decisions that maximize returns through sophisticated (and computationally very demanding) recursive mentalizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Yoshida et al., 2008)</ref>. To illustrate, it may be possible but difficult to estimate the long-term expected costs of lying, and hence decide that telling the truth is the best decision -or one may follow a simple moral imperative, to the same effect. This makes models more easily interpretable in terms of psychology and phenomenology ('algorithmic' Marrian models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Marr, 1982)</ref>, complementing the 'ideal computational' models of our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hula et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moutoussis et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Armed with these preferences, we see people as acting to 'make them who they want to be' within their relationships. In short, actively inferring about themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Friston et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Moutoussis et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Smith et al., 2022)</ref>. Here, each person has goals (C s ) not only about themselves, but about the relationship they enter -technically, joint goals about self and other. Following the framework of 'active inference', we formalize these goals as prior probability distributions over the joint actions of self and other, where higher probability is assigned to more desirable action combinations. A desired distribution over dispositions of both self (S) and others (O) can be expressed as probabilities, or dispositions, to act:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Equation 1 [aka S1]</formula><p>Here, the conditional distribution P(S|O) specifies desired disposition to act of the self, given the other's disposition. We used these preference beliefs, or 'goal priors' in a relatively simple cognitive model, whereby participants assume that others have different goals, C O , which they also try to fulfill through their decisions. Agents refined their beliefs about C O based on their observations. They consider who their partner has inferred them to be (e.g., 'they have witnessed me acting erratically, I must provide evidence against that'), and so act so as to steer the joint outcomes to diverge as little from CS as possible. This, then, implements a minimum set of principles of risk-sensitive active inference <ref type="bibr">(Friston et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>One of our central concerns was to understand self-positivity bias. Here, other things being equal, we evaluate ourselves more positively than others. Dominant attribution theory, and before that, psychoanalytic theories postulated that people do this simply in order to feel bettera self serving bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Robins &amp; Beer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2017)</ref>. It is difficult to refute such a hypothesis, as it is teleological or even circular, but from a computational point of view we challenge it by hypothesizing that self-and other-evaluation may follow different rules and report different outcomes of the interaction that may be useful for decision-making. Specifically, we hypothesized that one evaluates others depending on how they deviate from our ideals; whereas the self is primarily judged by how good our behavior is conditional on others' character. For example, we may approve of ourselves investing little with people that we believe are uncooperative. We compared and contrasted these belief-based models with returns-based ('reinforcement') models based on our previously successful, rewardprediction-error based ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Low et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Will et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The present studies were approved by the University College London Ethics Committee (3450/002). It formed part of the 'Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network Project' (NSPN). Three study groups were recruited into two studies. The three stages of each trial (total: 23 trials) i. Participants decide how much to invest in during this trial, on average. The partner makes a similar decision, which is hidden. ii. Noisy implementation of the decision taken in (i) for three rounds. iii. The participant is asked how much they approve of themselves and the partner in this round, and also to mentalize how much the partner may approve of them. B. Each participant does not play directly with their human partner, but with their avatar i. Before the task, each participant instructs their avatar about their preferred investment for each level of investment of the partner. ii. During the scanning version of the task only, participants first played with an avatar expressing the averaged preferences of the previous experiments, iii. then with the avatar trained by their real-life lab partner. C. Returns matrix for the four levels of investment by each player. Temptation to freeride is at top-right. D. Markov decision generative model from the point of view of the Self, who holds self-other goals (bottom) and actively infers 'who my actions would make me' (grey-blue), according to which actions are taken in the current interaction (red).</p><p>Study 1 included 24 participants, 12 female and 12 male, who performed the 'River Crossing' task. Study 2 had 40 participants performing the task during fMRI scanning (results of neuroimaging not reported here); and 24 participants who were laboratory task partners of the aforementioned 40 (29/64 female gender, 35/64 male). All participants were recruited from the healthy adult (18-25 year old) volunteers of the NSPN cohort. This was a volunteer sample of healthy young people recruited in either North London or Cambridge, UK, who were broadly representative of the UK as a whole in terms of gender and ethnicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kiddle et al., 2018)</ref>. In our study, the only other criteria applied were suitability for fMRI scanning. On 16 occasions, the partner of a scanned participant did not attend, and an approximately age-matched, female research assistant filled in, but their data was not analyzed. All participants gave written informed consent and were paid for their time and, separately, their returns in the game. Here, we focus on the self-and other-evaluation behavioral data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Task</head><p>This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. and was based on a probabilistic, four-level iterated prisoner's dilemma. Prior to the experiment, participants were extensively instructed and explicitly asked about different scenarios, including 'what do you think your partner will do if you let them down?', so that they understood the possible consequences of honoring cooperation, letting the other down, etc. They knew their own decision, but had to infer their partner's decision from noisy outcomes. The computer played three 'rounds' based on the decisions of the two players. Having been trained on the returns matrix ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1C)</ref>, participants were only shown the contributions of the two players, not directly their returns. After each triad of 'rounds', participants were asked to give approval ratings of themselves, their partner and (in the validation samples only) their guess about how much their partner approved of them. The game ended probabilistically, to reduce end-anticipation effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Avatar players &amp; Decision Making modeling</head><p>Participants did not play each other directly, but each played with an avatar representing the other participant. Thus Participant 1 would play with Participant 2's avatar, while Participant 2 would play with Participant 1's avatar ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B)</ref> Prior to the main game play, each participant performed a practice task, playing with a 'Ms Average' avatar, which had modal preferences from a pilot run. This game play -which is not analyzed here -prepared them for play with their real-life lab-partner's avatar. Hence, there were as many dyads as players. Each player got their own winnings plus the winnings of their own avatar.</p><p>Each avatar incorporated their player's preferences, but all had the same, known decisionmaking abilities. Participants were truthfully told that avatars were of good, but not exceptional intelligence so that they would be able to adequately represent their preferences while playing their real-life partner. This referred to a theory-of-mind-depth = 2 model, 'I think that you think that I am the kind of person who usually prefers to play X'. Depth of planning was also two. In other words, avatars played as if both themselves and their human partner would explicitly infer each other's preferences for the next two trials, and then settle into steady play (but of course this two-trial horizon was renewed at every trial).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Belief-based evaluation modeling</head><p>Here, we hypothesized that people evaluate their partner on the basis of how well their decision-making matched that of their ideal partner. Specifically, the probability of the actions taken by the partner under this 'ideal partner' policy was calculated; a 'partner positivity bias' parameter was brought to bear, forming an evaluation score. This 'positivity bias' parameter systematically shifted reports towards a higher or lower value, to model the concept that people may adopt or at least report biased evaluations compared to their initial inferences, for example to feel better about themselves or to please experimenters. A further partnerevaluation-noise parameter influenced the evaluation score reported (Supplement Equations S7 -S8). The (unseen but guessed) evaluation of self by the partner should then follow the model of other evaluation, but applied to the probability of self-actions under the inferred preferences of the partner.</p><p>Approval of the self was again based on the probability of the actions one actually took under 'ideal' decision-making. However this followed a 'regret model' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Coricelli et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Steiner &amp; Redish, 2014)</ref>. That is, the ideal reference policy was the one that would obtain had the participant known their partner's actions in this trial. We thus hypothesized that the self was evaluated against a different criterion, relevant to the ideal policy that one might follow, rather than one obtaining unconditionally. Once this probability was calculated, it was mapped to evaluations reported following the same procedure, but with independent selfpositivity bias and self-evaluation-noise parameters. If the key hypothesis that the different rules used for evaluation explained self-positivity bias, then the two positivity bias parameters should not differ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcement-learning evaluation modeling</head><p>Drawing on previous modeling of self-evaluation and emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Emanuel &amp; Eldar, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rutledge et al., 2014)</ref>, we hypothesized that current evaluations should depend on a weighted sum of both most recent and past outcomes for self and other, with greater weights for more recent outcomes. If updated at each trial, this weighted sum is estimated by a simple recurrent learning rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Emanuel &amp; Eldar, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Low et al., 2021)</ref>. Note that if iteratively estimated, a weighted sum of past prediction errors reduces to a (somewhat differently weighted) sum of past outcomes, as each past expectation is itself a weighted sum of past outcomes. Next, we note that evaluation of one person may depend on the gains or losses of the other; thus rather than two one-dimensional equations, we should allow for a matrix form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Equation 2</formula><p>Here, E is a vector of self-and other-Evaluation, R is a function of outcomes (say, returns and prediction errors), W are constant matrices, and E0 an intercept. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>People can 'teach' their avatars to invest in others -or not Study 1 showed that the behavior of participants was similar to that of the avatars that they instructed in key ways, supporting the hypothesis that people could disclose their two-person goals to instruct their avatars. It also showed that given these instructions, the model driving the avatars resulted in overall decision-making similar to their instructors, and that feelings of approval elicited by this behavior were also similar <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1A</ref>). This was successfully replicated in our main study ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1B)</ref>, supporting the validity of further analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of collaboration is associated with self-serving evaluation bias</head><p>Participants showed more cooperative than uncooperative behavior, but only just <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1A)</ref>.</p><p>They approved more of themselves than of their partners, showing self-positivity biases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.  1C)</ref>. This self-positivity showed a structure: Uncooperative behavior by the partner tended to reduce other-approvals (as might be expected), but even unilateral uncooperative behavior by the self did not reduce approvals of the self below that of the partner <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C, red)</ref>. Strikingly, the most pronounced self-positivity bias was observed when neither partner played cooperatively (one-way ANOVA of average self-other evaluation difference vs. cooperation group p=0.00117. Tuckey's test: competitive &gt; collaborative p=0.00152, competitive &gt; unfair self p=0.0114, unfair other &gt; cooperative p=0.0653, all other pairwise comparisons p &gt; 0.32).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>A. Distribution of average participant work contributions. Despite training, the mean (green line) is just into the cooperative zone ( &gt; 1.5). B. Here, dyads are separated with respect to the average level of cooperation into mutually competitive (both partners contributing in bottom tertile, lower left area, gold), mutually cooperative (both in upper tertile, upper right, green), unfair self (Not in the first two, plus Self Contribution &gt; Partner Contribution, upper left, red) and unfair other (the rest, lower right, cyan). C. Self-and Other-average evaluations for each group. Note the marked self-positivity bias in the Competitive group, the absence of low self-evaluation in the 'Unfair self' group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with Ideal decision-making explains evaluations to a limited extend</head><p>Ideal decision-making evaluation models relied on beliefs about decisions. For most participants, Other-evaluation amounted to how far the other's behavior deviated from a highly cooperative one. They performed better than chance, but also better than the Selfevaluation 'comparison with ideal decision' belief models <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B, left)</ref>. We therefore tested these models against simple reinforcement-learning models relying on outcomes rather than actions. We used a weighted-average of past outcomes, based on our previous work of selfesteem in non-interactive contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Will et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Prediction errors not needed for Self-and Other-evaluation</p><p>As expectations are calculated from weighted sums of returns, a diminishing power series sum of prediction errors (PEs) is necessarily a diminishing power series sum of returns, albeit with different weights. Whereas PEs may be used for computations in the brain, at the algorithmic level simply using returns gave a more parsimonious account of the data. (compared to using PEs or mixtures of PEs and returns in the outcome-dependent term of Equation 2). However, the winning models <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3A)</ref> contained a full matrix of weights by which self-and other-returns updated both self-and other-evaluations (W r in Equation 2).</p><p>They also contained separate trait-evaluations for self and other.</p></div>

Model VII taken as reference, and its advantage over the 'Ideal Bayesian decisions' model for Self and Other shown at left; and (dis)advantage compared to more complex, winning model I at right. C. The preferred Returns-based model (I) is more accurate than the best PE-based model (IV) for a few subjects, but for most, it gives a very similar account of the data with a lesser complexity penalty.</p><p>The resulting reinforcement learning models captured precisely Self-and other-evaluations, and also their difference, that is, the self-positivity bias. To quantify this, we first generated synthetic data using the fitted parameters, using the veridical experimental returns. For each participant, we formed the average of the first 6, middle 11, and last 6 trials. The respective adjusted r 2 were 0.88, 0.94 and 0.86 respectively, all p &lt; 1E-10. Averaging over all trials, the self-positivity score (average Self-eval. -Other-eval) was almost perfectly captured, adjusted r 2 = 0.99. Note that the model could do this last fit in an un-interesting manner, by simply capturing the average behavior in the 'trait evaluation parameters' (5 and 6 in table 1). This was not the case.</p><p>Self-positivity bias decreases with increasing weight of Other-returns on Self-Evaluation</p><p>We then regressed the self positivity bias against all the parameters. The weight of otherreturn on self-evaluation parameter was strongly associated with self positivity (beta = -0.20, p = 2.3E-5 ). The weight of other-returns on self-evaluation parameter was also significantly, but much less strongly associated (beta = 0.068, p=-0.035 ). Other parameters, notably trait evaluations, did not contribute to self-positivity. The two parameters that did were the weights that most heavily influenced evaluation updates ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>). Linear regression with parameters as predictors was highly significant, but accounted for a far smaller amount of variance than the synthetic data (adjusted r 2 = 0.36, p=4.6E-5).</p><p>We then explored the correlation matrix between all parameters, indicating a number of psychologically interesting results. People who had high trait self-evaluation also tended to have high trait other-evaluation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4A, B)</ref>; while those whose self-evaluation was most strongly influenced by their partner's gains were also more influenced by the same outcome to form other-evaluations ( <ref type="figure">Fig 4B)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4</head><p>How parameters are distributed in the sample A. Other-Evaluation is most strongly influenced by Self-returns (wOS) and vice versa (wSO).

Full correlation structure between posterior parameter estimates, with bivariate correlations pointed at for Bonferroni-corrected significant values.</p><p>We asked whether the association between self-positivity and w SO was mechanistic, or due to a confounder (e.g., the structure of returns for those with high or low w SO ). To do this, we sampled scrambled w SO and created synthetic data again. This time, the overall sample did not now have a statistically significant self-positivity (paired t-test t-value=0.82, p=0.414), while the simulated self-positivity only explained adjusted r 2 = 0.54 of the experimentally obtained values (p &lt; 1E-10). These results indicate that w SO is mechanistically important for self-positivity bias.</p><p>Of the other parameters, we note that only â of our sample was fitted with autoregression weights less than 0.9 (Î· in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>; first tertile=0.894, median=0.98). As each evaluation followed three outcomes played noisily by the computer on the basis of the last decision, this means that most participants made evaluations just on the basis of these last three outcomes. Although our study was not optimized to study the impact of evaluative style on outcomes, we performed a preliminary analysis regressing average returns for the self of evaluation parameters. The regression was significant, p=0.011, adjusted r 2 = 0.185. Two parameters had significant, positive weights: w SO (t=2.51, p=0.015) and E 0 Self <ref type="bibr">(t=2.38, p=0.021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Starting from the premise that self-and other-evaluations are interlinked and clinically important (Udachina et al., 2012, 2017), we introduced a task played by pairs of participants for real returns. Each instructed an artificial intelligence (AI) avatar as to their preferences for collaboration and competition, and the avatars played on the participants behalf, blending experimental control (of avatars) with real-life motives (of their 'masters'). Trial-by-trial selfand other-evaluations showed a characteristic pattern of self-positivity, where selfevaluations were on average greater than other-evaluations. Computational models explored whether beliefs about how good one's decision-making was, and how close to the 'ideal' one's partner was, accounted for evaluations. We also explored reinforcement-learning models, where evaluations depended on outcomes, rather than beliefs about actions. Reinforcement-learning models performed much better. They provided crucial evidence that self-positivity depended on how benefits to one's partner weighed into one's self-evaluation. The less they did, the greater the self bias.</p><p>A key methodological advance offered here is to use the preferences about relationships of real-life participants, to inform the behavior of avatars playing on their behalf. We also used salient returns that have both a psychologically immersive ('he let me down') and monetary value. The fact that people's actual behavior was correlated with that of their avatars indicated that a) they could and did self-disclose their preferences, and b) that the generative model (the AI) implemented these successfully. The procedure guaranteed to participants that their computer partners were of fixed and average intelligence, and that variation in behavior was either due to chance, or to motivation. Participants playing each other's avatars also showed preliminary evidence that other-evaluations (A evaluating B) correlated with their partner's inference of how they might be evaluated (B inferring how A's avatar evaluated them), showing remarkable theory-of-mind.</p><p>Self-evaluations were higher than other-evaluations, as expected from the literature on selfserving and self-positivity biases. This was significant in the overall sample, but it was particularly pronounced if both participant and partner played uncooperatively. Strikingly, mean self-evaluation was almost identical to other-evaluation when the self behaved less cooperatively than the partner. We thus speculate that the 'external-personal attribution for negative events' which, whose function was once hypothesized to be to make people feel better <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Murphy et al., 2018)</ref>, is something healthy people do to avoid negative evaluation of their own uncooperative actions during interactions. It is outside our scope here to tell whether the benefit of this is intrinsic (psychological defense) and/or social (to avoid moral or material punishment).</p><p>Turning to modeling of self-evaluations, we found that models explaining personal evaluations in terms of the gains and losses of self and others were superior to those that compared actions taken to the best possible ones given the circumstances. Crucially, people did not primarily approve of themselves the better they did in task, but the better their partner did -and vice versa. People did not evaluate themselves qua homines oeconomici <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Crockett et al., 2014)</ref>. The winning models also included trait-evaluations of self and other but these did not contribute to self-serving bias.</p><p>Winning models estimated evaluations as based on a weighted sum of outcomes, with rapidly decreasing weights for outcomes further into the past, rather like self-esteem models in non-interactive contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Low et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Will et al., 2020)</ref>. Winning models did not sum over prediction errors, unlike previous work, but simply over returns. We note, however, that if the weights of a PE-based model are allowed to vary freely, it closely approximates a returns-based model. Thus the superiority of returns-based models points more to their algorithmic parsimony, rather than whether PEs or returns are used at the implementation level in the brain for the present purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Marr, 1982)</ref>.</p><p>Most importantly, just one parameter correlated with self-positivity bias, the weight of returns for one's partner on self-evaluation. Insensitivity to others' returns increased self-serving bias, and when this parameter was shuffled across participants in synthetic data, overall selfserving bias was no longer significant. This is very interesting, as self-serving bias was mostly found in mutually competitive interactions, meaning that the negative outcome which is defended against is specifically the poor returns for the partner, more than the self. Though only one parameter linearly correlated with self-positivity bias, we note that evaluation parameters showed complex patterns of correlations between them, even under strict Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. Some of these correlations are understandable in psychological terms -for example, people who rely more on trait evaluations for the self, also do so for their partner, r=0.41), but we believe it unwise to interpret this pattern in detail before it is replicated. Preliminary analyses indicated that a greater sensitivity to others' returns for self-evaluation also predicted a greater average return for the self.</p><p>Arguably the most important limitation of our study is that our key findings emerged from model exploration after our initial hypothesis was relatively unsuccessful (i.e., that people would evaluate themselves based on how close their most recent decisions were to their ideal decisions). Thus the superiority of our matrix model based on self-and other-returns needs to be further validated. Another limitation is that the framing of each trial may have encouraged participants to perceive it mostly as self-contained, as evidenced by the high values of parameter Î·. Thus the task was not designed to assess the trial-to-trial impact of person-evaluations on decision-making. This should be the object of further research, taking into account that people may interact in part so that they approve of themselves and others, a form of affective forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Charpentier et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The paradigm introduced here offers rich avenues for further research, including understanding self-and other-evaluation in relational psychopathology. This is central to psychiatric disorders ranging from paranoia to post-traumatic and personality disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Luyten et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Moutoussis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zavlis, 2023)</ref>. Future research can also take forward the current advances in combining ecological validity with experimental control, especially providing holistic sensory feedback, as facial expressions and experience of the body are crucial for social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hamilton &amp; Holler, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">H. Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide behavioral and computational evidence that during social interactions which may be of mutual benefit, but where participants can also let each other down or attempt to exploit each other, being sensitive to the benefits and costs of one's partner is more important than other considerations. A decreased sensitivity is associated with self-serving bias, which is itself particularly prominent when mutually un-cooperative interactions occur, consistent with attribution theory. On the other hand, a higher sensitivity may, in this context, be associated with better material outcomes for oneself. The paradigm provided here, where participants instruct an AI avatar as to their preferences, which then plays on their behalf, isolates preferences for collaboration while controlling for other cognitive variables and may find fruitful application in the study of relational psychopathology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generative model of economic exchange</head><p>Inspired by the planning-as-inference and specifically the active inference approach, we formulated these outcome values as prior (log) probabilities, encoded in preference maps (C-matrix of active inference <ref type="bibr">(Friston et al., 2013)</ref> . This joint probability has a very intuitive decompositione.g. `I want to be trusting to the benevolent' is decomposed into `how likely you are to be benevolent' and `how likely I am to be trusting, given your benevolence', a decomposition into a prior and a conditional. Writing S for the dispositions of self and O for the other, Equation 1 [aka S1]</p><p>We now consider a Markovian formulation of a mixed motives exchange, leading to how each agent (for example, the Self) takes their decisions. This will be useful in studying collaborative states, allowing us to model hidden brain states of collaboration or antagonism (competition </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beliefs-about-actions model of self-and other-evaluation</head><p>We hypothesized that participants evaluated others depending on the probability that their actions were emitted had they been the 'ideal partner' that was described during instruction of the avatar, here denoted as g :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Eq. S7</formula><p>In these models, we allowed for a magnanimity parameter m, which shifted this probability in a more positive ( if m &gt; 1 ) direction. The report probability, PA, was mapped to the Likert scale provided for participants, which had nL levels, by using it as the parameter of a binomial distribution of nL draws, sharpened (or blunted) by a decision uncertainty parameter u :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Eq. S8</formula><p>We used a 'noisified' binomial distribution, NB, to parameterize all unimodal probability mass functions, unless stated otherwise.</p><p>To calculate self-approvals through beliefs-about-actions models, a very similar strategy was used. Here, the probabilities forming the product in Eq. S7 were replaced by the probabilities for one's observed actions under a policy updated in the light of what the partner's decision actually was, based on their now observed actions. Self-disapproval was then a matter of regret about the actions one took.</p><p>Note that the belief-about-actions model of other-evaluation is similar to the eventual model winnermost people would describe an ideal partner as one who was highly collaborative, and hence provide high rewards for the self. However the belief-about-actions model of selfevaluation is not so close to the eventual winner, and indeed did not do well in accounting for the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructing one's avatar</head><p>Each participant's avatar used the generative model of economic exchange above. This took place on-line during the game. The self-and other-evaluations were neither computed nor used by avatars during the experiment. In order to implement the avatars, these had to be 'instructed' by their 'master' participant. Participants first received instructions as to how the game would be played. They then provide the following information:</p><p>â¢ What action an ideal partner would choose â¢ If they had a choice, how much time would they spend with such a partner, compared to one who chose a one-level-less-cooperative action.</p><p>The second of these questions allowed calculation of how sharp the participant's goals ('goal priors', or C map in active inference terms) was. Then, participants were asked for â¢ their own preferred action, for each of the four possible levels of cooperation by their partner. E.g., 'if my partner were to always choose to fully cooperate, 3/3, I would prefer to only contribute 1/3'. The sharpness, or precision, calculated in the second step above was then applied to each level in the second step, to give the complete 4 x 4 goal probability array (C-map).</p><p>Following a very similar procedure as the first two steps above, we also asked participants to guess what the preferred action of their potential partners might be, and how sharply peaked this prevalence distribution might be. This provided avatars with prior beliefs about the preferences (or 'character') of partners, which they then updated through Bayesian inference as per the generative model above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcement learning model of self-and other-evaluation</head><p>The full equation for self-esteem update is:</p><p>Eq. S9 [aka Eq. 2 in main text]</p><p>The RHS is an Evaluation vector, containing self and other approval. The first term of the LHS is the trait-evaluation vector, considered constant. The second term consists of a matrix of weights, which multiplies the previous evaluation. We term this the autoregression weights. In the winning model, it had the form of a 2 x 2 identity matrix, times (1-Î· ). Î· is the parameter termed autoregression weight in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The last term of the RHS turned out to be the most important one, and consists of the product of a weights matrix with a vector of outcomes for self and other. The weight parameters wSS , wSO , wOS , wOS are described in the main text and <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. The outcome vector R could, in different versions of the model, contain either returns, or prediction errors, or a weighted sum of the two. In the winning model, it simply contained the returns for self and other.</p><p>In the limiting case, assuming play has stabilized for a long time so that returns are stably expected and there is no prediction errors, the above can be solved to give:</p><p>Eq. S10</p><p>Where I is the identity matrix. We used this equilibrium expectation, rather than introduce further parameters, to initiate the Evaluation vector when necessary.</p></div>
