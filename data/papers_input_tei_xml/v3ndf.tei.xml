			<abstract>
				<p>Background: Changes in motivational biases appear at the heart of many psychiatric disorders. Alterations in motivational biases, in the form of invigorated responding when promised rewards, and holding back when threatened with punishment, have been observed in many psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. However, the specificity of these changes remains unclear. Here, we relate the (in)ability to suppress (maladaptive) motivational biases, to continuous, dimensional measures of psychiatric symptom levels in a sample from the general population focusing on mood-anxiety and impulsive-compulsive symptoms. Methods: We recruited an online sample from the general population (n = 500) through Prolific Academic, that performed a motivational Go/NoGo task, a cognitive test and a clinical questionnaire battery. We used factor analysis, mixed-effects regressions and computational modelling to link transdiagnostic symptom dimensions to the ability to adaptively suppress motivational biases. Results: We observed a double dissociation. Higher anxious-depressed symptoms predicted more suppression of motivational biases on trials on which these were incongruent with instrumental demands, resulting in better overall performance. Using a novel computational model, we show that this behaviour might arise from enhanced learning to flexibly suppress the impact of motivational biases. In contrast, higher compulsive symptom scores were associated with overall worse performance, likely reflecting a more general performance deficit. Discussion: We speculate that anxious-depressed individuals, showing heightened rumination and anxiety, might recruit excessive cognitive effort for suppressing motivational biases. This more &apos;controlled&apos; mode of decision-making might lead to improved performance in tasks such as this one, but on the other hand exhaust participants and contribute to their symptoms. 157 relied on continuous values (here 1,2,3,4,5,6). b The mean of the 158 reported LSAS score represents all items summed from both the 159 avoidance and the fear/anxiety section. For the remaining 160 analyses, ratings for both sections per item were averaged.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Decision-making involves learning which actions lead to desired outcomes and which ones help to avoid harmful events. However, in addition to such adaptively learnt responses, cues or contexts signaling the valence of prospective outcomes also shape responding in a Pavlovian manner <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Pavlovian action biases, e.g. invigoration in a rewarding context and inhibition in a punishment context, have been proposed to provide sensible 'default' actions that are helpful for example in novel environments, or when speed is of essence <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. Behaviour is regulated by an intricate interplay of these Pavlovian and instrumental controllers <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. Most of the time, these controllers concur, so that their interaction is cooperative <ref type="bibr">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">6)</ref>. For example, a goal-directed approach to obtain a reward is enhanced by Pavlovian invigoration elicited by the reward cue <ref type="bibr">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8)</ref>. However, sometimes, Pavlovian response tendencies are at odds with optimal, learnt responses, leading to interference with instrumental control <ref type="bibr">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10)</ref>. Such Pavlovian interference can lead to detrimental consequences and has recently been implicated in the aetiology and prognosis of several psychiatric disorders including addiction, depression and personality disorders <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr">(15)</ref> Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by rigid, stimulus-driven behaviours that individuals fail to exert control over. Examples include drug craving in addiction and substance abuse, repetitive behaviours in obsessive-compulsive disorders, or reflexive avoidance behaviour in anxiety and depression. These behaviours can be interpreted as instances of altered motivational biases, and various branches of human and animal research have proposed phenomena akin to motivational biases to lie at the roots of these psychiatric disorders. For example, the phenomenon of sign-tracking in which animals approach reward-predictive cues rather than rewards itself, might reflect aberrantly strong appetitive biases <ref type="bibr">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17)</ref>. It has been linked to alcohol and drug addiction in both animals <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr">(20)</ref> and humans <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">22)</ref>. Conversely, individuals with anhedonia lack the automatic attraction by such appetitive cues <ref type="bibr">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr">24)</ref>. Indeed, past research has shown lower motivational biases in depression <ref type="bibr">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26)</ref>, with relatively conserved biases predicting eventual remission <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. In the aversive domain, stronger inhibition induced by aversive cues has been observed in social anxiety <ref type="bibr">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28)</ref> and depression <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>, suggesting that motivational biases might underlie freezing and withdrawal behaviour in these disorders <ref type="bibr">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr">31)</ref>. Conversely, pathologically strong invigoration of behaviour by aversive cues has been observed in PTSD <ref type="bibr">(32)</ref> and suicide ideation <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>. In sum, various psychiatric disorders show altered stimulus-driven behaviour as reflected in motivational biases. As such, these biases may constitute a valuable neurocognitive test bed to better understand these disorders.</p><p>In order to suppress motivational biases in situations in which they are maladaptive, individuals need to recruit cognitive control <ref type="bibr">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr">34,</ref><ref type="bibr">35)</ref>, a process considered to be effortful. In choices between different levels of effort, depressed individuals typically avoid more effortful options <ref type="bibr">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">37)</ref>, but show performance comparable to healthy controls. However, when obliged to perform cognitively demanding tasks, depressed individuals paradoxically invest more effort and use slower, more deliberate and effortful strategies compared to healthy controls <ref type="bibr">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr">(41)</ref>, a phenomenon potentially linked to increased worry and rumination <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">43)</ref>. Hence, apart from alterations in motivational biases themselves, psychiatric patients might also differ in the amount of control they exert to suppress these biases.</p><p>Given that motivational biases are prominent in various psychiatric disorders, the question arises whether altered biases reflect a general cognitive alteration common to these disorders, or whether specific sub-facets of these biases can be mapped onto specific diseases. If the former hypothesis were true, this would explain why effects are so widespread across psychiatric disorders. In line with this idea of generalized dysfunction, altered biases across disorders could originate from a generally compromised cognitive system, leading to increased reliance on default behavioural strategies and failures to override default strategies when applicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(44)</ref>. Alternatively, what initially appears as a lack of disease specificity might in fact arise from the presence of distinct clusters of symptoms in multiple psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(47)</ref>. Rather than making categorical distinctions between psychiatric disorders as currently defined by diagnostic systems such as DSM-5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(48)</ref> or , changes in motivational biases may perhaps be better conceptualized as relating to a distinct (group of) symptoms that is common to several disorders, such as apathy or compulsivity.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the link between the ability to adaptively control motivational biases and previously defined transdiagnostic psychiatric symptom dimensions capturing mood/anxiety symptoms and impulsive/compulsive symptoms. For this purpose, we recruited a large online sample that completed a previously used questionnaire battery <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(50)</ref>. In addition, they completed a wellestablished probabilistic Motivational Go/NoGo Learning Task that reliably elicits motivational biases in choice behaviour and reaction times. Participants had to learn by trial and error to execute (Go) or withhold (NoGo) a response to acquire a desired outcome. Some cues offered the chance to win a reward ("Win" cues) while others signaled the need to avoid a punishment ("Avoid" cues). Participants typically show better performance for bias-congruent cues (i.e. perform a Go response to Win cues and a NoGo response to Avoid cues) than to bias-incongruent cues (NoGo to Win cues, Go to Avoid cues) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">52)</ref>. We quantified motivational biases as the relative performance difference between bias congruent vs. incongruent cues. Relating individual differences in motivational biases to two transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, namely anxiety/depression (AD) vs. compulsions and intrusive thoughts (CIT), we observed a double dissociation: One the one hand, increased anxious-depressed symptoms predicted stronger suppression of their motivational biases for incongruent cues, i.e., when biases were maladaptive and led to incorrect responses. This pattern of behaviour was captured by a computational model in which the value of controlling/ suppressing Pavlovian choice biases is itself learned. On the other hand, higher CIT symptoms were associated with a nonspecific performance deficit for both bias-congruent and incongruent task cues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 500 participants via Prolific (https://www.prolific.ac.uk). Registered individuals on this platform can be considered a general-population sample, who are not specifically pre-screened for clinical criteria. Participants indicated English as their first language and had (corrected to) normal vision. Participation in previous, related studies from the lab precluded inclusion. Participants were reimbursed with a base rate of £5.83/ hour for study completion and could earn a performance-based bonus of up to £1.00. Before participation, all subjects provided informed consent in accordance with the requirements of the local Ethics Review Committee of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Radboud University, which approved all study procedures (ID: 17U.003546). Participants completed a Motivational Go/NoGo Task, a reversal learning task (will be reported elsewhere), demographic questions, a test of cognitive abilities, and a battery of clinical questionnaires <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref>. After exclusion, a final sample of n=481 participants remained for initial analysis (4% exclusion rate; demographic details in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) (see supplement information (SI) for more details on exclusion and quality assessment).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>155</head><p>This was done to ensure comparability of mean questionnaire 156 scores with previous studies. For all remaining analyses, we Motivational Go/NoGo task We employed a well-established motivational Go/NoGo learning task that robustly evokes motivational biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">52)</ref>. On each trial, participants were shown one of four cues and had to decide whether to respond (Go, button press) or not (NoGo). If participants made an in-time Go response, the edge of the cue would briefly flash white (150 ms), signaling response registration. This edge flash was an adaptation of this task for the less controlled online environment to reassure participants that their responses were recorded. Cues were valenced such that participants could either receive a reward for certain cues (Win cues: 100 points for correct responses, 0 points for incorrect), or avoid loss for others (Avoid cues: 0 points for correct responses, -100 points for incorrect responses). This resulted in a 2x2 design of required Action (Go/NoGo) and cue valence (Win/Avoid loss). Cue valence was explicitly cued through the colour of the cue edge (Avoid loss cue -red edge; Win cue -green edge). Subjects received feedback based on their response after each trial ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). For each cue, participants needed to learn by trial and error which response resulted in the desired outcome. Feedback followed a probabilistic schedule with validity set to 75 %, i.e., participants received the desired outcome 75% of the time for a correct response. The opposite ratio applied for incorrect responses. The task consisted of two blocks of 200 trials (4 cues/block, 50 trials/cue, pseudorandom order: cue never shown &gt; 2x in a row), and took 25-30 minutes to complete (see SI for task adaptations).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Test and Clinical Questionnaires</head><p>Participants completed a cognitive test (I-CAR: https://icar-project.org/)(63) containing 16 items from four areas (Letter and Number Series, 3-dimensional Rotation, Matrix and Verbal Reasoning). Scores on this test served as global measure for participants' cognitive abilities (64), used to correct for differences in cognitive ability. Participants then completed a well-established questionnaire battery (50) assessing a wide range of clinical symptoms and states with a focus on mood-anxiety and compulsive symptoms ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The Almost Perfect Scale (APS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(54)</ref> and Padua Inventory (59) were added to the battery <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(50)</ref> with the intention of further increasing the sensitivity of the dimensional assessment of the compulsivity component. The questionnaire section also contained two catch items to ensure compliance (see SI section factor analysis). We additionally provide information on clinical relevance of the assessed symptoms in the SI <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>).   <ref type="bibr">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">64)</ref>. To assess whether our factor structure replicated the previous findings, we correlated the factor weights of previous work (50) with our own factor weights. Second, in a more exploratory approach, we added additional items from a perfectionism questionnaire (APS) (which has been related to Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">69)</ref>), and the Padua Inventory (PI) (59) measuring Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms with a focus on dissociating between obsessions and compulsions. This added 62 items to the factor analysis, up from 209, which primarily loaded onto the OCD domain. We had hoped to create a factor solution for which the CIT dimension would split up into compulsions and obsessive thoughts respectively thereby allowing the investigation of their distinct impact on motivational biases. However, this was not the case, and the addition of such a large number of items on a very specific aspect of mental health, led to a so-called 'bloated specific factors, which can emerge when a specific facet is over-represented, in our case the OCD domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(70)</ref>. We therefore report results from using the factor solution from the established questionnaire set. For completeness, results using the 'extended' FA are reported in the SI (see the section supplementary questionnaire effects and dimension scores). Importantly, overall, the conclusions remain broadly the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Behaviour</head><p>We analyzed the effect of cue valence (Win/Avoid) and required action (Go/NoGo) on the probability of making a Go response P(Go), using a generalized logistic mixed-effects model implemented in the R package lme4, version 1.1-21 (Bates et al. 2015). In this model, the main effect of Required Action (ReqAct)) quantifies the degree to which participants learnt to perform the correct responses (i.e. they make Go responses when they should). The main effect of Valence quantifies the degree of motivational bias (i.e., they preferentially make Go responses when responding to a Win cue, and NoGo responses for Avoid cues). We also included the interaction term capturing the degree to which performance varies as a function of cue valence. Age and ICAR scores were included as covariates controlling for potential effects of age and cognitive performance. All continuous variables were zstandardized and factors sum-to-zero coded. All models included a full random effects structure. We computed p-values using likelihood ratio tests (LRT) implemented in the afex package in R. Statistical significance was defined as p-values with α &lt; 0.05. We excluded trials with RT &lt; 200 ms., as at such short RTs cues are unlikely to have been processed. As secondary analysis, we assessed the same model for RT data using linear mixed-level models. Note that this analysis is less powered as RTs are only available for trials with 'Go' response, so roughly 50% of trials. Here, we expected to replicate many previous studies reporting effects of both learning (faster correct than incorrect Go responses) and motivational bias (action invigoration, i.e., faster responding to Win than Avoid cues).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation between psychiatric symptoms and task behaviour</head><p>We assessed how psychiatric symptom dimensions related to overall task performance and motivational biasing by adding z-standardized factor scores for each dimension (i.e. factor) as between-subject predictors to the mixed-effects models. As these factors could still be correlated, i.e. competing for variance and masking each other, we used two approaches (DV: Response (binary, Go or NoGo) or RT(continuous): 1) we examined models with the extracted symptom dimension score entered separately and 2) we included all factor scores together in a combined model. The latter analysis allowed examination of the unique variance each dimension explained for motivational biases. We further post-hoc characterized the loading of each clinical questionnaire on these effects by repeating the analysis using individual questionnaire scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory computational modelling</head><p>We employed reinforcement learning (RL) models to identify differences in computational processing underlying interindividual differences in behaviour as a function of psychiatric symptom dimensions. This approach allowed for a more sensitive dissection of motivational effects on decision-making while accounting for learning effects and differences in reward and punishment sensitivity across individuals. We used the cbm toolbox implemented in MATLAB to estimate a selection of previously established and newly developed RL models for this task <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">52)</ref>. This toolbox implements Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) which allows for a random effects model comparison, i.e. different models might have generated data in individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(71)</ref>. We then tested which model provided the most parsimonious explanation of the data, using protected exceedance probability (PXP) as selection criterion for the optimal model (71).</p><p>We initially fitted five hierarchically nested RL models, following previous works ; base model comparison). Model M1 was a basic Rescorla Wagner model (72) entailing two parameters, feedback sensitivity (ρ) and a learning rate (ε), based on which the model learned the value (Q(a,s)) for each action (a: Go or NoGo) and stimulus (s), and was updated on each trial. M2 included an additional 'Go bias' parameter (b) capturing the general tendency to make a Go response, while M3 further extended M2 by a motivational bias parameter π. In Models M4 and M5, learning rate (M4) or feedback sensitivity (M5) were estimated separately for Win and Avoid cues to capture potential asymmetries in how participants learned from rewards and punishment (see SI methods for details and equations). Of note, feedback sensitivities play a role similar to inverse temperature in that they determine how deterministic choices follow from learnt action values.</p><p>Having established the winning model (M5) from the base comparison, we extended this model so that it could capture modulation of the impact of motivational biases on choice. This model is inspired by the proposal that exerting cognitive control is not so much dependent on the ability to exert control, but rather the result of a choice process in which we evaluate the value of exerting cognitive control relative to its costs (e.g. deliberation time, computational resources) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(73)</ref>. The underlying idea here is that making a bias-congruent response is computationally cheap and easy, while making a biasincongruent response requires suppression of (i.e. control over) the Pavlovian system. In this model, the 'value' of bias 'control' was learnt on a trial-by-trial basis through a simple RL mechanism. Briefly, the value of control increased if a bias-incongruent response (i.e. control was exerted) led to a desired outcome, or if a bias-congruent response (i.e. failure to exert control) led to an undesired outcome, and vice versa. The degree of this value of control updating was governed by a learning rate. We then ran a second model comparison including models M1-6 to evaluate evidence in favor of this additional mechanism (see SI for model space, comparison, validation and parameter transformations, tables S5-7).</p><p>We explored how symptom scores linked to i) the relative evidence for each model, using Pearson's chi squared tests) and ii) individual parameter estimates from the winning model, using linear regression models (see SI).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivational biases and learning</head><p>The p(Go) mixed-model showed that participants learnt the task, i.e., they made more Go responses to Go compared to NoGo cues (ReqAct: χ The RT linear mixed regression showed that participants were faster for correct than incorrect Go responses (ReqAct: χ 2 (1) = 274.8, p &lt; .001, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1F</ref>). This likely indicates that participants learn the task, as they speed up responding when they know what to do, in line with observations that length of RTs is associated with reduced choice certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(74)</ref>. RTs also showed evidence of a motivational bias, such that responding was invigorated to Win relative to Avoid cues (Valence: χ 2 (1) = 456.00, p &lt; .001) and a significant interaction for ReqAct x Valence (χ 2 (1) = 18.5, p &lt; .001). </p></div>

To examine the association between clinical dimensions, motivational biases and learning, we computed six mixed logistic regression models including the dimension scores. Note that all analyses below have also been performed with the 'bloated' factor analysis that includes the APS and Padua Inventory, and results reported below are robust (see SI section extended factor analysis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anxiety-Depression factor</head><p>The P(Go) model including AD dimension scores indicated a significant 3-way interaction (ReqAct x Valence x AD; χ 2 (1) = 7.31, p = .007). Further breaking down the 3-way interaction into simple effects showed that individuals with higher symptom severity showed improved performance on biasincongruent trials, specifically NoGo2Win cues, often the condition participants have most difficulty with (75) (Go2Win: χ 2 (1) = 1.3, p=0.3; Go2Avoid: χ 2 (1) = 3.7, p=0.054; NoGo2Win: χ 2 (1) = 10.4, p = .001; NoGo2Avoid: χ (1) = 0.8, p = 0.4). To assess directly if participants had most difficulty on incongruent trials, we analyzed accuracy as DV, cue congruency as independent factor, and AD dimension scores. There was a significant (negative) association of accuracy and AD for bias-incongruent cues (AD (Incongruent): χ 2 (1) = 9.1, p= 0.003), but not congruent cues (AD (Congruent): χ 2 (1) = 0.6, p= 0.4), indicating better performance for incongruent cues with higher AD dimension scores ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig 3A-B</ref>).</p><p>Compulsions and Intrusive Thought factor Higher CIT scores were associated with worse task performance overall (ReqAct x CIT: χ 2 (1) = 15.3, p &lt; .001, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3A-B</ref>). Symptom severity was not associated with overall Go responding (CIT: χ 2 (1) &lt; 0.001, p &gt; 0.9), motivational biases (Valence x CIT: χ 2 (1) = 0.1, p = 0.7) nor the interaction (ReqAct x Valence x CIT: χ 2 (1) = 2.69, p = .1; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Withdrawal factor</head><p>Paralleling the finding for AD, there was a significant 3-way interaction for SW (ReqAct x Valence x SW: χ 2 (1) = 6.3, p = .01). This effect appears driven by Go2Win and NoGo2Win cues, though none of the effects became significant for individual task conditions (p-values &gt;.2: Go2Win: χ 2 (1) = 1.7, p = 0.2; Go2Avoid: χ 2 (1) = 0.1, p = .7; NoGo2Win: χ 2 (1) = 1.7, p=0.2; NoGo2Avoid: χ 2 (1) = 0.31, p = 0.6) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>).</p><p>There was no effect of SW on overall tendency for Go responding (SW: χ 2 (1) = 0.1, p = .7) or significant 2-way interactions (ReqAct x SW: χ 2 (1) = 1.1, p = 0.3; Valence x SW: χ 2 (1) = 0.1, p = .7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of individual questionnaire scores</head><p>As a post-hoc follow-up, we further characterized the relationship of each clinical questionnaire to the behavioral effects by assessing the dependence of performance on congruency, separately computing the relation between questionnaire score and accuracy for bias-congruent (G2W, NG2A) and biasincongruent cues (G2A, NG2W). Here, particularly higher apathy and trait anxiety scores were significantly linked to higher task performance on bias-incongruent trials, while no such increase was detected for bias-congruent cues <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3A</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table S5</ref>). Meanwhile, worse task performance across congruent and incongruent cues was significantly linked to clinical symptoms from questionnaires encompassing eating disorder symptoms and OCD <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3A</ref>) across congruent and incongruent cues.</p><p>Transdiagnostic factors predict reaction time RT analyses complemented the choice data by showing a clear dissociation between the AD and CIT dimensions. Note that for the main effect of RT, participants are faster for correct versus incorrect responses, likely reflecting effects of learning. Increased AD symptoms were associated with a larger RT difference for correct versus incorrect responses (ReqAct x F1: χ 2 (1) = 6.7, p = .001). This effect was driven by stronger slowing for incorrect responses with higher symptoms (F1 (Go): χ 2 (1) = 0.03, p = .9; F1 (NoGo): χ 2 (1) = 4.5, p = .03), suggesting increased uncertainty about incorrect responses. Paralleling the weaker effects in the choice domain, this effect in the SW dimension was not significant but showed a trend (χ 2 (1) = 3.66, p = .06). In contrast, a higher CIT symptom score was associated with a smaller difference in RT for correct versus incorrect responses (ReqAct x Fr2: χ 2 (1) = 4.9, p = .02), driven by slower responding for correct responses with increasing symptoms (F2 (Go): χ 2 (1) = 4.2, p = .04; F2 (NoGo): χ 2 (1) = 0.03, p = .9). This corroborates findings in the choice domain ( worse performance with increasing compulsive symptoms), as higher CIT individuals appear less certain of correct choices. Remaining effects of dimensions were non-significant (p &gt; .2) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3)</ref>. Separate visualization of ß estimates from mixed-effects models with p(correct) as dependent variable and z-standardized questionnaire scores, age and cognitive score as independent variables for congruent and incongruent cues. Increased AD symptoms were linked to better task performance specifically on bias-incongruent cues. In contrast, more CIT symptoms were associated with poorer performance across bias-congruent and incongruent cues. Effects of the SW dimension were similar to the AD dimension, though weaker and non-significant.

This model allows for adaptive learning of the bias weight, importantly reducing motivational bias over trials for incongruent trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4B</ref>). This feature may enable this model to capture improved performance on incongruent trials for high-scoring AD individuals. Despite the relation of optimal fitting model, none of the parameters were significantly linked to the AD dimension <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table S8</ref>). However, this may reflect that the effective bias weight is an interplay between all parameters and may not be captured by a single parameter. There was no relation between CIT scores and the optimal model (χ 2 (8,476) = 7.596, p-value = .5; p-value SIM = .5) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we adopted a dimensional approach using online-data collection (47) in a generalpopulation sample to investigate how the nature of aberrant motivational biases in decision-making manifests in a range of psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">77)</ref>. Specifically, we tested two alternative hypotheses: (i) that motivational bias alterations are linked to specific symptoms shared across various psychiatric diagnoses, or (ii) that they are the consequence of a generalized 'illness factor' nonspecifically impairing adaptive responding.</p><p>Factor analysis of a broad set of psychiatric symptom questionnaires collected in this large population sample replicated previous findings, identifying three primary symptom dimensions: anxietydepression (AD), compulsivity-intrusive thoughts (CIT), and social withdrawal (SW). Surprisingly, we found that increased AD symptoms were associated with improved performance on bias-incongruent trials-those requiring the suppression of Pavlovian response tendencies. This effect was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent, in individuals with higher SW symptoms. In contrast, CIT symptoms were linked to general performance deficits across the task.</p><p>Decreased performance or 'decision acuity' in individuals with high psychiatric symptom severity, is a common phenomenon found in many reward learning tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(78,</ref><ref type="bibr">79)</ref>. It might reflect both cognitive limitations (e.g., concentration difficulties) and motivational problems that preclude the recruitment of sophisticated strategies needed to solve these tasks. Here, we observed such generalized task impairment for the CIT dimension. In contrast, a higher AD symptom score was associated with increased performance on bias-incongruent trials, which demand suppression of and control over Pavlovian response tendencies <ref type="bibr">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr">34,</ref><ref type="bibr">35)</ref>, but was unaltered on congruent trials. This dissociation of CIT and AD symptoms was present in both choice and RT data.</p><p>The fact that the relationship between AD symptoms and improved performance was specific to biasincongruent trials, suggest that AD individuals do not simply show global suppression of motivational bias. Such global suppression would have resulted in reduced performance on congruent trials, as we observed in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(51)</ref>. Rather, our finding suggests that what distinguishes higher anxiousdepressive individuals is the ability to exert cognitive control to suppress biases when they are maladaptive (80,81). This effect was captured well by a computational model that allowed for adaptive learning to suppress motivational biases for incongruent cues, which better explained behaviour particularly for high AD individuals.</p><p>While the observation of reduced biases associated with increased symptoms is at odds with some previous findings from patient and subclinical samples reporting stronger (aversive) motivational biases in social anxiety <ref type="bibr">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28)</ref>, they chime with a previous study reporting lower biases in depressed patients (in a slightly different, Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer paradigm), where relatively intact biases predicted future remission <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. Other previous research has linked depression to effort avoidance, i.e. preferential choice of low-effort options, which suggests that depressed individuals prefer to exert less cognitive control <ref type="bibr">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr">82,</ref><ref type="bibr">83)</ref>. In seeming contrast, other studies suggests that when tasks are relatively easy, depressed patients exert more control <ref type="bibr">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr">(41)</ref>. These findings highlight the possibility that effort avoidance and increased effort exertion may reflect a shared cognitive attitude of perceiving tasks as overly difficult and requiring dedicated effort and diligence. In line with this, research has shown that depressed individuals are more sensitive to effort costs <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref>, and under certain circumstances, may perform better than healthy controls. For example, higher self-reported anxiety was associated with improved probability ratings and better inference of hidden states (84) and apathy has been linked to improved task performance in a vigilance and threat detection task (85). In sum, these results suggest individuals with anxious-depressive symptoms may exert more cognitive control over motivational biases in situations in which these biases are maladaptive.</p><p>Increased cognitive control in anxious-depressive individuals might stem from heightened risk aversion and an overly cautious, deliberative style of responding. An increased fear of failure, even for relatively easy tasks, might motivate these individuals to over-exert control to suppress their biases when realizing they might result in poor performance. As such, behavior may be less guided by stimuli signaling potential rewards, underlying loss of pleasure and interest, core aspects of anhedonia <ref type="bibr">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr">86)</ref>. Outsourcing behavior to simple default strategies such as motivational biases can be healthy and adaptive in everyday life (87), but anxious-depressive individuals might not benefit from this possibility. Similarly, less guidance by stimuli signaling threats of punishment might lead to unexpected negative experiences and an increased sense of worry and caution <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr">88)</ref>. Lastly, while cognitive control recruitment is typically conducive to solving problems in everyday life and thus to a positive mental health status, chronic overexertion of cognitive control can become maladaptive (89) and might be linked to long-term consequences such as fatigue (90), apathy (91) or increased risk of relapse in depression (91). Future studies should further explore the clinical relevance of inter-individual differences in controlling motivational biases for treatment outcome.</p><p>Interestingly, one 'transdiagnostic' clinical feature that depression and social anxiety share is rumination (92). Rumination can be construed as extensive recruitment of cognitive effort to think through a decision strategy. It might reflect the inability to rely on simple heuristics-like motivational biases-to make decisions instead relying on more effortful, deliberate control mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">43)</ref>. In our data, the severity of anxious-depressive symptoms correlated with slower response times, particularly for incorrect responses, which further supports the idea that rumination and the suppression of motivational biases might reflect an abnormally high recruitment of cognitive effort. Thus, improvement in adaptive Pavlovian bias suppression could speculatively be construed as "sideeffects" of neurobiological changes associated with cognitive, depressogenic processes such as rumination. Nonetheless, while this suggests potential clinical significance of our findings, it is important to note that we did not collect data on participants' medical histories, medications, or prior diagnoses, meaning we cannot draw conclusions about how these factors might have influenced the results. In summary, using factor analysis, mixed-effects models, and computational modeling, we replicate and extend previous research on transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we find that anxious-depressive individuals are better able to suppress Pavlovian biases when these biases are maladaptive, whereas individuals with compulsive/intrusive symptoms show more generalized performance deficits. Our results suggest that previously observed wide-spread changes in motivational biases in psychiatric disorders may reflect both a general performance deficit as well as symptom-specific modulation of biases. We speculate that lower reliance on simple default strategies and chronic recruitment of cognitive control to suppress biases might contribute to symptoms of apathy and fatigue. Future research could explore whether individual differences in cognitive control over motivational biases predict the development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Device verification</head><p>In order to increase data quality, we first verified that task participation was from a laptop or stationary PC, excluding smartphones. This ensured that participants were using the same mode of responding (on a keyboard), resulting in a similar range of reaction times. To this end, participants needed to strike a key on their keyboard to commence the study, so that smartphones would be unable to start the task. After this verification step, participants were required to give informed consent by ticking a consent box after being presented with a full description of the study set-up and prior to starting the motivational Go/NoGo Task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructions and attention checks</head><p>For the motivational Go/NoGo task, participants received extensive instructions and performed practice trials for each cue type before starting the main task. During practice, participants received explicit instructions which response to perform (press / not press) for the respective practice cues. A performance criterion of performing the instructed response three out of four trials was enforced: If participants failed the criterion, they had to repeat the practice trials until they reached the criterion.</p><p>After successful completion of all practice rounds, participants continued to the actual task. For further details on the instructions see the full experiment code, which is available at https://github.com/denOudenLab/OnlineMotivationalGNGTask/ as well as an online demo version: https://exp.socsci.ru.nl/demonstration/ pavlovian/pavlovian.html?ppn=999).</p><p>To ensure participants' sustained attention, attention check trials were interspersed with regular trials throughout the Go/NoGo task (3% of trials). Here, participants were instructed to wait for a white fixation cross to appear in the centre of the screen and respond to its appearance as fast as they could with a button press. The appearance of the fixation cross was variably timed within an inter-trialinterval (ITI) of 500-1500ms to avoid automatic responding by the participants. This was done to ensure that participants were still engaged in the task, as a failure to respond resulted in the task not further proceeding.</p><p>While answering the clinical questionnaires, participants were presented with two catch items. Participants who did not pass one or both catch items included in the questionnaire section were omitted from subsequent analyses, based on the assumption that they likely had not read at least some of the questions properly. The first catch item read "If you are paying attention to this question, please select "a little" as your answer, while the second catch item instructed participants to indicate "a lot" as their answer for this item.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor analysis</head><p>To accommodate the two item per question structure of the social anxiety scale (LSAS) (1), we averaged both items for the two factor analyses. Given the binary structure of item responses for the schizotypy questionnaire (SSMS) (2), we created a heterogeneous covariance matrix accounting for both continuous and binary correlations in line with other studies <ref type="bibr">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4)</ref>. Using Cattell's criterion, we also determined the number of factors to retain by visually inspecting the scree plot and identifying the part where the plot captured a sharp bend <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 2</ref> in main manuscript and S3). We confirmed this 3-factor solution using the Cattell-Nelson-Gorsuch Test (5) (nFactors package (6)), which mathematically determines the exact position where the slope maximally changes, as an objective estimate of the number of factors to be extracted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical relevance of the sample</head><p>To assess the clinical relevance of our findings we also estimated the number and percentage of our participant pool who, according to official clinical cut-off scores or scores derived from patient studies, would be likely to suffer from clinically relevant symptoms in the respective symptom range. When no such cut-off was available, we determined the percentage of participants who either scored above the mean value of a clinical reference group or more than 3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean value reported for a normative healthy group, depending on which data was available <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>).</p><p>Our assessment indicated that we sampled subjects up into a clinically relevant range (see table S1). 10.4 -29.5 % of our sample reported questionnaire scores in the upper range of the clinical spectrum potentially indicative of mental health problems. This is in line with previous studies reporting prevalence of mental problems such as depression and general anxiety to be either comparable or even higher in online samples compared to the general population (7).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>: Overview of clinical questionnaires and number of people above the cut-off for clinically relevant psychopathology based on official, clinical cut-off scores or in case those did not exist for certain questionnaires, defined based on average scores achieved in clinical samples or divergence of three standard deviation (SD) from the mean scores based on a sample of healthy subjects. a Cut-off score for detecting hazardous and harmful alcohol use b Cut-off for maximum discrimination of alcohol related hospitalizations. c Average taken from two community samples. d Average taken from original sample (men, women).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data quality control and exclusion</head><p>Several performance-based exclusion criteria were applied to this dataset to ensure high data quality for data analysis in line with previous studies <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. First, all participants who did not pass the two catch items integrated in the questionnaire section were omitted from analyses, as it was assumed that they had not read the questions properly. Second, we excluded participants based on overly deterministic responding, here indicated by participants who nearly always (&gt;95%) or nearly never (&lt;5%) made a go response. This response pattern was expected when participants either did not understand the task or could be resulting from random choice selection potentially due to a lack of motivation or task engagement. We also excluded participants if more than 10% of task trials were missing, for instance due to technical issues.</p><p>Consequently, we excluded n = 12 participants based on failed attention checks (Criterion 1). Five participants exhibited an overly deterministic response pattern during the task showing more than 95% of Go or NoGo responses (Criterion 2). Data from two more participants (n = 2) was discarded, due to missing data (&gt; 10%). In one case, this was due to technical issues to save the data. The other participant had disproportionately many trials for which RT &lt; 200 ms were recorded. This left a final sample of n=481 for mixed-models analysis. For computational modelling, additional participants were excluded due to missing trials resulting from technical issues during online data acquisition such as temporary loss of internet connection during testing (n = 6). While participants likely experienced those trials, thus impacting learning and reward history, we did not have data saved for those trials and hence could not include this data in trial-by-trial modelling. Consequently, a final sample of 476 participants was available for computational modelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary questionnaire and dimension score effects</head><p>In addition to analysing effects of factor scores in separate mixed logistic regressions, we also analysed composite regression models that included all three factor scores. Results were consistent across analyses. One difference was the 3-way interaction for ReqAct x Valence x Factor. While in the separate regression models both interaction terms including Anxiety Depression (AD) and Social Withdrawal (SW) were significant, those interactions fell just short of significance in the composite model (for details see table S2). These changes in statistical significance are likely due to the covariance of the AD and SW dimension (see also <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure S2C</ref>), and do not change the interpretation of the main finding. The action weights are now a function of the relative weight of the instrumental action and the changing weight of the Pavlovian bias (equation 9) Parameter overview and transformations</p><p>The following transformations were applied for all models: Feedback sensitivity parameters ρ were constrained to positive values through an exponential transform. The learning rate ε and the control parameter gamma γ were constrained between 0 and 1 (using an inverse logit transform). The 'go' bias b and motivational bias were unconstrained. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table S6</ref> presents a brief overview of all parameters in each model. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model validation and parameter recovery</head><p>While model comparison metrics can provide a good estimate of the best model within the tested model space, it does not address whether the best model qualitatively reproduces the observed data <ref type="bibr">(36)</ref>. Thus, we next tested whether the winning model could qualitatively capture key patterns of the data using a post-hoc absolute-fit approach <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref>. Here, we used the estimated parameter values from winning model M6 in combination with individuals' actual choices and experienced outcomes to update action values, to generate choice probabilities for every trial. The predicted choice probabilities captured the observed data well (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4D</ref> in main manuscript).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generative model performance: Parameter recovery</head><p>We evaluated whether model parameter estimates for the winning model M6 could be successfully recovered using data simulations (n = 100) as an additional quality check <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref>. Action probabilities were computed based on the individual parameter estimates extracted for the observed data and used to simulate new choice sequences. We then refitted model M6 for each simulated dataset and the resulting parameter estimates were averaged across simulations and correlated with the parameter estimates used to simulate the data. Correlation of simulated and recovered parameters indicated a fairly good to excellent recovery for all six parameters (Spearman correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 0.97; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S1A</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transdiagnostic symptom dimensions</head><p>As mentioned in the main manuscript, we explored whether individuals across different symptom levels substantially differed in terms of which model best explained their individual behaviour. For this, we split the sample into high, medium and low scoring individuals based on a tertial split of the respective dimension scores. Using a Pearson's chi squared test in R, we compared model frequency counts capturing which model is expressed best in each individual (M1-M6) for high, medium and low scoring individuals on the respective dimension. If it was indicated that the χ 2 approximation may be incorrect due to non-normally distributed counts and small expected count number, we additionally estimated the χ 2 statistic with simulated p-values based on n=2000 replicates, as implemented in R.</p><p>As reported in the main manuscript, higher scores on the AD factor were linked to a more frequent expression of the value-of-control model M6. This led us to assess whether specific parameters from the winning model explained variability in symptom dimensions. To this end, we ran separate linear regression models with parameter estimates from the winning model as dependent variable (DV) and individual factor scores as IV. We specifically hypothesized that an increased bias learning rate gamma would explain variability in the Anxiety-Depression dimension (and potentially to a lesser degree for the Social Withdrawal dimension). However, neither the AD nor SW dimension were significantly associated with any computational model parameter (all p &gt; .1, see table S8). One putative explanation for this discrepancy between the model frequency and parameter estimate findings is that effects on the increase/decrease of Pavlovian biases may be expressed through different combinations of parameter estimates, as the effective weight of the Pavlovian bias is influenced by both the Pavlovian bias and bias learning rate parameters, and this bias itself is then traded off against the learned action values which themselves are influenced by the learning rate and reinforcement sensitivities. Thus, it may be the case that the model as a whole will consistently capture dynamics that differ between individuals, which individual parameter estimates just cannot capture on their own.</p><p>In contrast, the performance associated with higher CIT scores was related to both a reduced learning rate and reduced sensitivity for learning from Avoid cues, likely resulting in too little adaptation following negative outcomes, leading to detrimental performance.

When comparing these to the established symptom domains reported in the main manuscript, however, this factor solution presents a number of notable shifts. We had hoped to create a factor solution for which the CIT dimension would split up into compulsions and obsessive thoughts respectively, thereby allowing the investigation of their distinct impact on motivational biases. However, this was not the case, and the addition of this large number of items led to so-called bloated specifics factors, which can emerge when a specific facet is over-represented, in our case the OCD domain <ref type="bibr">(41)</ref>. Briefly, this factor analysis distinguished compulsive from impulsive features, while 'polluting' the anxiety-depression factor (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure S2</ref>, S3, table S9). To summarise these changes, we labelled these three factors as follows Anxiety-Depression, Compulsivity, and Impulsivity, where importantly the AD factor is now 'diluted'.</p><p>Figure S2 Clinical questionnaire scores and factor solutions A) Distribution of clinical questionnaire scores for additional questionnaires PI (Padua Inventory) and APS (almost perfect score), indicating median and clinical cut-off scores.

D) Questionnaire loadings across the clinical symptom dimensions for the extended factor analysis including the PI and APS, and for comparison the factor solution reported in the main manuscript. Comparing factor loadings shows that by adding the 62 items in the EFA, a number of questionnaires now load more strongly on F1, including SSMS (schizotypy), LSAS (social anxiety), as well as the novel APS (perfectionism), thus broadening and diluting this domain from just anxiety/depression. In contrast, the previous second CIT factor now has largely 'reduced' to purely compulsivity/OCD, as intrusive thought/schizotypy items moved to factor 1, while impulsivity characterizes factor 3 (e.g. items from the impulsivity questionnaire BIS11, together with items from the alcoholism and eating disorder questionnaires).</p></div>

The total time to complete the experimental procedure was approximately 75 minutes, but depended on the self-paced questionnaires. B) Go NoGo task trial sequence for each of the four cue types: The Go2Win and NoGo2Avoid cues are bias congruent, as their instrumental action requirement is in line with the stimulus-response coupling dictated by the motivational bias. Go2Avoid and NoGo2Win are bias-incongruent and usually harder for participants to learn. On each trial, a cue is presented for 1300 ms. During this window, subjects can decide to make a Go response by pressing a button or make a NoGo response by withholding a response. After a 200 ms. blank screen, subjects are presented with the outcome (reward, neutral, punishment). The intertrial-interval (ITI) varied within the range of 750-1250 ms. in steps of 250ms.

Recent theorising proposes that control should only be exerted if this confers a net benefit(27)(28)(29) where, importantly, the value of exerting control can be learned based on the net benefit of past experiences exerting control(27,30). Here, we propose a model that learns the value of control by evaluating the outcome in combination with whether control was exerted (i.e., a response executed in conflict with the Pavlovian bias, thus having required suppression of the bias), through a simple reinforcement learning mechanism. Note that this is an exploratory analysis, as our task design was not explicitly designed to investigate mechanism subserving learning the value of exerting control.In M6, the value of exerting control is learned and updated for each cue through a control prediction error (cPE), governed by the control learning rate, gamma (γ). The cPE is computed by comparing the received outcome as a function of whether control was exerted ('control encoded outcome', CEO), with the current value of control (equation 8, table S5).( , ) = ( −1 , − 1) + γ * (CEO − ( −1 , − 1))(8)</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary reaction time results</head><p>Main effects of valence and requires response on RT were modulated by global cognitive ability, which positively predicted the difference in speed for correct versus incorrect responses (ReqAct x CognAb: b = -13.88, SE = 1.92, χ 2 (1) = 50.3; p &lt; .001) and the strength of the bias in RT (Valence x CognAb: b = 4.30, SE = 1.64, χ 2 (1) = 6.9; p &lt; .001) in line with the analysis of choice data, where individuals showed less bias and stronger learning with increasing cognitive abilities. RTs also increased with age (Age: χ 2 (1) = 13.8; p &lt; .001), but this slowing did not interact with task factors. Remaining effects were nonsignificant (p-values &gt; .1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Modelling</head><p>Computational modelling accounts for dynamics of the learning process thereby allowing a more sensitive estimation of the motivational biases. Prior to data collection, we pre-registered the hypothesis (c.f. Preregistration at OSF: https://osf.io/nht4u/) that psychiatric dimensions would be selectively associated with either an appetitive or an aversive motivational bias. Thus, our computational models for this dataset were initially described and operationalized to contain two bias parameters characterizing an avoid and approach component of the bias. However, as we did not find any support for this initial hypothesis in the generalized linear mixed model, we did not pursue motivational bias parametrization further in our computational modelling of the effects. We report our approach below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model space</head><p>We estimated the impact of motivational biases on action learning using a selection of previously applied computational RL models <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref> and an additional, novel model. Action weights (w) for all models were estimated for both possible actions (a, Go; NoGo) separately for each trial (t) and cue (s). Subsequently, the respective choice probabilities were derived using integrating these action weights using a softmax function:</p><p>In the first Model (M1) the action weights for the Go and NoGo response were based solely on unbiased learned action values. Action values are learnt using a standard delta-learning rule encompassing two free parameters, the learning rate (ε) and feedback sensitivity (ρ).</p><p>The second model (M2) comprised an additional free parameter operationalizing a 'go' bias (b) that is added to the action weight of the Go response. This parameter captures an overall tendency to make a Go response, regardless of cue valence, which likely differs across individuals:</p><p>We then extended M2 to characterize the biasing effect of valenced cues on decision making by allowing the cue valence (V) to affect the action weights, either by increasing or decreasing the weight of the Go responses by Win or Avoid cues, respectively (M3). Here, V is positive (+½) for Win cues, and negative for Avoid cues (+½). The strength of this motivational bias is determined by the free bias parameter π:</p><p>In line with previous literature showing improved model fits for models with further differentiated learning rate and sensitivity parameters as a function of valence <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>, as well as previous evidence for disorder specific alterations in learning from or sensitivity to positive or negative information <ref type="formula">22</ref>, we tested two further model variations. In M4, we implemented separate learning rates for Win and Avoid cues based on previous work indicating this improved the model <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. </p><p>In M5, we split up the sensitivity parameter ( ) into separate parameters for Win ( ) and Avoid cues ( ):</p><p>In M6 we then augmented the winning model from this established set of models ('base model space'), with a novel feature designed to capture how individuals might learn to selectively suppress Pavlovian responses for bias-incongruent cues, while releasing these for congruent cues. With this new model, we aimed to capture the between-individual variability in the ability to adaptively suppress Pavlovian biases. We and others have proposed <ref type="bibr">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr">(26)</ref> that motivational biases represent a behavioral</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EFA replicates main findings</head><p>As outlined above and in the main manuscript, the FA on the extended set of questionnaires resulted in a 'bloating' of the compulsivity domain, and 'dilution' of the anxiety-depression dimension. Nonetheless, for completion we repeated all analyses from the main manuscript also for this changed FA. Results are largely consistent if a little weaker for the AD factor, compared to the main findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accuracy</head><p>Anxiety-Depression factor (EF1) As for the AD dimension from the main factor solution, there was a significant 3-way interaction of the AD dimension with required action and valence (ReqAct x Valence x EF1; χ 2 (1) = 9.8, p = .002). The nature of this effect was subtly different from the main factor analysis, as it appeared primarily driven by performance on NoGo2Win cues. Breaking down the 3-way interaction into simple effects showed that this interaction appears primarily driven by a positive association of symptom severity with performance on the (incongruent) NoGo2Win cues (NoGo2Win: χ 2 (1) = 5.7, p = .017; NoGo2Avoid: χ 2 (1) = 0.8, p = 0.4; Go2Win: χ 2 (1) = 1.5, p=0.2; Go2Avoid: χ 2 (1) = 1.1, p=0.3). In contrast, when assessing accuracy as DV and congruency and symptom factors as IV to determine an overall improvement of performance on incongruent (relative to congruent) trials as a function of symptoms, this was not significant (congruency x EF1: χ 2 (1) = 2.43, p= 0.12). Finally, given the presence of a significant 3-way interaction, the main effect of dimension or the two-way interactions should not be interpreted in isolation but we will repeat these for completeness (EF1: χ 2 (1) = 0.04, p = 0.9; Valence x EF1 (χ 2 (1) = 2.0, p = 0.2; ReqAct x EF1χ 2 (1) = 2.8, p = .09).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compulsivity factor (EF2)</head><p>As for the CIT factor in the main FA, higher symptom scores on the compulsivity factor were associated with worse task performance overall (ReqAct x EF2: χ 2 (1) = 18.9, p &lt; .001, <ref type="figure">Fig. S3B</ref>). Compulsivity symptom severity was not associated with the overall degree of Go responding (EF2: χ 2 (1) = 0.4, p = .5) nor with motivational bias (Valence x EF2: χ 2 (1) = 0.13, p = 0.7). There was also no significant 3-way interaction (ReqAct x Valence x EF2: χ 2 (1) = 1.3, p = .3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impulsivity factor (EF3)</head><p>Effects for the impulsivity factor were in the same direction as the compulsivity factor though not significant (ReqAct x EF3: χ 2 (1) = 2.3, p = 0.12, <ref type="figure">figure S3B</ref>). Impulsivity symptom severity was also not associated with the overall degree of Go responding (EF3: χ 2 (1) = 0.6, p = .4), motivational bias (Valence x EF3: χ 2 (1) = 0.7, p = .4), nor was there a significant 3-way interaction (ReqAct x Valence x EF3χ 2 (1) = 0.03, p = .9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Composite models</head><p>Again, we repeated the regression analyses for the EFA using mixed effects models including the three psychiatric symptom dimensions either entered into three separate models (Msep), or together in one composite model (Mcomp), and results were broadly consistent across these approaches (  <ref type="table">Table S10</ref>: Factor covariance effects -Extended factor analysis. <ref type="figure">Figure S3</ref>. EFA Dimension and questionnaire effects A) Transdiagnostic factors predict congruency-dependent performance. Separate visualization of ß estimates from mixed-effects models with p(correct) as dependent variable and z-standardized questionnaire scores, age and cognitive score as independent variables for congruent and incongruent cues. Increased AD symptoms were linked to better task performance specifically on bias-incongruent cues. In contrast, more compulsive symptoms were associated with poorer performance across bias-congruent and incongruent cues.</p></div>			</div>
