				<p>The attraction effect refers to the impact of an asymmetrically dominated irrelevant option (decoy) in shifting preferences towards its dominant option (target), with respect to another, non-dominant alternative (competitor). This context effect has been observed in multiple studies, yet its practical relevance in real-life situations has recently been questioned, since various factors can modulate, nullify, or even reverse the attraction effect. In this study, we investigate the impact of presentation order and presentation modality (simultaneous or sequential) on the elicitation of the effect in a valuebased choice task. Previous studies documented the relevance of these variables in modulating the effect, yet they used perceptual discrimination tasks, raising the question of whether these factors would have the same impact on value-based choice. Our findings confirm that spatial proximity between target and decoy is necessary for eliciting attraction effects in value-based choice (as it is in perceptual discrimination) when options are presented simultaneously; however, when options are presented sequentially, temporal proximity is showed to be irrelevant for the attraction effect, which is observed across all presentation orders (contrary to what was reported in previous studies using perceptual discrimination tasks). These results provide further insight on the importance of both visual arrangement, task demands, and cognitive processing in modulating context effects in decisionmaking. 1 Introduction Value-based choices are decisions where individuals evaluate alternatives based on subjective preferences, with no objectively correct option (Busemeyer et al., 2019), unlike perceptual tasks where a clear right answer is always present (Dutilh &amp; Rieskamp, 2016). Classical economic models assume rational decision-making aimed at maximizing utility (Von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1947), but realworld behavior often deviates due to cognitive biases and contextual factors (</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article structure of options can shape preferences, challenging the assumption of stable, context-independent choices <ref type="bibr">(Gluth et al., 2017)</ref>. This paper focuses on the attraction effect (AE), arguably one of the most extensively studied context effects. Also known as the asymmetric dominance effect or decoy effect, AE is a choice bias that occurs in multialternative, multi-attribute decision-making scenarios, where individuals choose among multiple alternatives characterized by multiple attributes. It refers to the fact that, in a choice between two options, the introduction of a third irrelevant, asymmetrically dominated option (the decoy) can change the original preferences in favor of a specific option (target) while decreasing preferences for the alternative (competitor). This happens because the decoy is intentionally designed to be clearly inferior to the target (but not to the competitor) on at least one aspect, and this highlights the advantages of the target over the decoy, making it more appealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Turner et al., 2018)</ref>. Meanwhile, being a dominated option, the decoy usually does not constitute an interesting alternative by itself. The existence and recognition of the dominance relation between target and decoy is necessary for the effect to appear <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Huber et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Król, &amp; Król, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marini et al., 2020)</ref>. Consider a consumer choosing between two phones: model A is priced at $500 and has a good camera setting, while model B costs $700 and features an excellent camera. In this scenario, introducing a third option, C, can illustrate the attraction effect. For example, if option C is intentionally designed to be both similar (Bhatia, 2013; Bordalo et al., 2013) and inferior (Kròl &amp; Kròl, 2019) to option B (i.e., C costs $800 and has the same camera of option B), its inclusion will increase preferences for the target option B. Although the attraction effect (AE) has been consistently observed in a wide range of contexts in humans (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Milberg et al., 2014)</ref> and even in animal behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Marini et al., 2024)</ref>, its practical relevance in real-life situations has recently been questioned <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Frederick et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang &amp; Lee, 2014)</ref>. The main challenge arises from its fragility. Essentially, despite its ubiquity, researchers have found that numerous factors and experimental manipulations have the potential to either enhance, diminish, or even reverse the effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Frederick et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang &amp; Lee, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Marini et al., 2025)</ref>. For example, aspects of the decoy-target relationship such as similarity (Bhatia, 2013; Bordalo et al, 2013; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tversky, 1972)</ref> and inferiority (Kròl &amp; Kròl, 2019; Marini et al., 2020) play a relevant role in the appearance of AE. Similarity-salience explanations suggest that the perceptual salience of the similarity between the target and the decoy attracts decision makers' attention, making it easier to identify the dominant relationship between the two options <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hu &amp; Yu, 2014)</ref>. Concerning inferiority, Kròl &amp; Kròl (2019), investigated its significance in prompting AE, as opposed to similarity. They propose that inferiority, rather than similarity, is more effective in shifting preferences toward the target option by facilitating the recognition of the dominance structure (target -decoy) within the choice set. However, manipulating the distance in the attribute space between the target and the decoy leads to different preference changes in preferential and perceptual decisions <ref type="bibr">(Liao et al., 2020)</ref>. To understand why these effects appear it is important to recognize the inherent complexity of multialternative, multi-attribute decision problems. Complexity arises from the fact that, in such tasks, people are exposed to an overwhelming amount of information: this requires them to sequentially compare and evaluate options, shifting attention over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 2013)</ref>. Years of research on sequential sampling models (SSMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2004)</ref> and eye-tracking paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Glaholt &amp; Reingold, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Shimojo et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marini et al., 2020)</ref> have shown the same happens in value-based decision-making and AE-related context. Sequential sampling models (SSMs), built on the foundation of sequential sampling and evidence accumulation, suggest that individuals gather evidence for each option until one alternative's preference surpasses a specific threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Diederich &amp; Trueblood, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Trueblood et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roe et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marini et al., 2020)</ref>. At this point, a decision is made in favor of the option that first crossed this threshold. Preference for options evolves over time, as deliberation progresses, driven by the subjective value attributed to each alternative. This subjective value is, in turn, shaped through a dynamic comparative process. Some models propose that these pairwise comparisons occur between the different alternatives offered <ref type="bibr">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1972)</ref>, while others suggest they occur between option attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Roe et al., 2001</ref>). In both cases, it is the comparative process that influences the subjective attribution of values and gives rise to context effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Choplin &amp; Hummel, 2005)</ref>. Recently, eye-tracking methodology has been employed to investigate AE and how individuals perceive and process information, as well as how they allocate attention and make decisions. In this specific context, it has been confirmed that attention is influenced by the presence of a decoy option, and individuals tend to directly compare alternatives on a single attribute, two alternatives at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Noguchi &amp; Stewart, 2014)</ref>. Moreover, the introduction of a decoy in the choice set results in an increase in both the number and duration of fixations, as well as revisits to the target dominant option, compared to the competitor alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Marini et al., 2020)</ref>. Collectively, the presented evidence suggests that context effects primarily arise from the process of making comparisons. Consequently, it becomes possible to influence how options are evaluated by controlling which comparisons are encouraged, leading individuals to consider specific subsets over others. This manipulation can be achieved by managing variables like presentation order and modality. For instance, the decision to display one option before another or in proximity to another can impact how easily individuals compare the options. Previous research has indicated that options placed near each other are more readily compared to those placed further apart <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Noguchi &amp; Stewart, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marini et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Evans et al., 2021)</ref>. This effect may be attributed to the impact of memory on decisions, or, alternatively , it may be associated with perceptual factors such as salience and the ease of recognizing similarities and differences, potentially leading to a different perception of the dominance structure. To date, the only study that has specifically investigated the impact of both option presentation order and presentation modality (temporal or spatial) on AE is a perceptual task <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Evans et al., 2021)</ref>. Traditionally, previous AE studies focused on simultaneous options presentation. However, this study marked the first attempt to compare both simultaneous and sequential presentations. Given the practical relevance and applicability of AE in the domains of consumer behavior, a sequential presentation of options more accurately mirrors real-world consumer decision-making. In real-world scenarios, individuals often need to compare options and their attributes at different times and across different websites or pages. This novel approach offers valuable insights into decision-making processes in more realistic settings. Evans and colleagues' results indicated that presentation order strongly influences choices in both sequential and simultaneous conditions. In particular, some orders were found to be associated to AE, while others led to a repulsion effect (the opposite of AE, in which the introduction of a decoy favors the competitor option instead of the target), and still others showed no significant effect at all. To explain these results, the authors developed an extension of the multi-attribute linear ballistic accumulation model, a SSM developed by <ref type="bibr">Trueblood and colleagues (2014)</ref>. They used this model to provide evidence that memory plays a crucial role in AE-related decision-making. More specifically, they posit that both the comparison process and forgetting (i.e., memory decay) are responsible for the observed results. Crucially, they found that in the sequential condition, the orders Competitor-Decoy-Target (CDT) and Competitor-Target-Decoy (CTD) were associated with the AE. This was because the competitor's early appearance in the comparative process provides it with an initial advantage that ultimately becomes detrimental in the long term. The first comparisons (and the options they contain) are subject to an increased forgetting rate compared to the last options evaluated. This results in different weights in the decision process, favoring the most recent and well-remembered comparisons (and options). Consequently, in the cases of orders CDT and CTD, the competitor is more easily forgotten, facilitating choice for the target and thus resulting in AE. On the other hand, in the case of orders TCD and TDC, the opposite happens: comparisons favoring the target have less impact on the decision, again due to memory decay. This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article However, a second study in the same paper (Evans et al., 2021) using symmetrically dominated decoys which are dominated by both of the other options, unlike asymmetrically dominated decoys which are dominated only by the targetreported the same results, suggesting that the effect of the presentation order of options (and thus memory decay) is general rather than specifically affecting the perception of the dominance relation and AE-related mechanism. Conversely, in the case of simultaneous presentation of all alternatives, authors attribute AE elicitation (or absence) to spatial proximity. In particular, they suggest that spatial proximity of the target-decoy options favors the appearance of AE because it facilitates both comparison and evaluation of options near one another. This is the reason why orders CTD, DTC, and TDC are associated to AE, when proximity is modulated spatially rather than temporally. As mentioned, these results are in line with explanations based on similarity and inferiority, in which in both cases, the dominance structure is more easily identifiable when target and decoy options are near each other. These findings, albeit interesting, are not yet sufficient to elucidate how presentation order and memory might affect the elicitation of AE. What is known is that the order of presentation can influence the ability to retrieve information from memory. For example, options presented first may have a higher likelihood of being remembered, a phenomenon known as the primacy effect. However, options presented last can also be more salient in subjects' memory due to a recency effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hockey &amp; Hamilton, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Murphy et al., 2006)</ref>. Additionally, the order and mode of presenting choice options can also influence short-term memory and its retrieval capacity affecting the availability of information in working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ronayne &amp; Brown, 2017)</ref>. Finally, evidence of such effects in AE studies is limited to perceptual tasks, especially regarding temporal proximity, whereas the influence of presentation order needs to be systematically studied also in value-based tasks. Our study aimed to address this issue by assessing the impact of presentation modality and order on the AE elicitation in a value-based task. This constitutes an underexplored topic in previous research for different reasons. First, most studies focused on simultaneous rather than sequential presentation of options. Secondly, those that did assess the effect of sequential presentation did not use value-based decisions, but instead focused on perceptual discrimination tasks (e.g. rectangle areas; Evans et al., 2021). Typically, these decisions are made swiftly with minimal deliberation, which appears to be a relevant factor in AE elicitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Padamwar et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Marini et al., 2023)</ref>. Finally, studies manipulating options' presentation order failed to observe a clear pattern of decoy influence. In the present experimental paradigm, participants were assigned to either simultaneous or sequential choice conditions. They were asked to make 30 binary and 30 ternary incentivized probabilistic choices, with ternary choices involving an asymmetrically dominated decoy option. The order of the options, the magnitude of the reward and the level of risk were manipulated. This experiment was aimed to test the following hypothesis.</p><p>1. We expected the AE to manifest both in simultaneous and sequential condition (H1). 2. In the simultaneous condition we hypothesized that the spatial proximity of the dominance structure (target-decoy) would affect the AE elicitation (H2). Consistent with evidence from eyetracking studies and considering the inferiority and similarity hypothesis, we expected that when the target and the decoy were presented close to each other, facilitating pairwise comparisons and recognition of the dominance structure, there would be an increase in target preferences. Consequently, we anticipated the attraction effect to be weaker when the target and the decoy were separated by the competitor option (e.g., DCT and TCD orders). 3. In the sequential condition, we hypothesized that the sequence in which the options appeared would affect the elicitation of the attraction effect (H3). In particular, in contrast with previous results by Evans and colleagues (2021) with perceptual tasks, we assumed that temporal proximity of target and decoy would maximize likelihood of comparison in a value-based task, thus eliciting a stronger AE when the target and the decoy appeared one after another (e.g., CDT; CTD; DTC; TDC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods 2.1 Participants</head><p>For the purposes of this study, an initial sample of 120 participants was recruited. Participants were recruited using a snowball sampling technique. To reach potential participants, researchers utilized their personal networks, various social media platforms, email, and private messages. Additionally, university mailing lists available to the authors were used. This research was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined by the American Psychological Association (APA) and the guidelines of the Italian Association of Psychology (AIP) for behavioral research. The study was reviewed and approved by the Director of the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC) at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Rome. All procedures adhered strictly to international ethical standards for research in behavioral science, ensuring informed consent, voluntary participation, and participant anonymity. After the data collection process, a total of 23 participants were excluded based on the following exclusion criteria: a) providing incorrect responses to at least three of the six control questions (9 participants); b) exhibiting an excessively high selection rate for the decoy option (more than 20% of choices; 8 participants); c) displaying an average response time of less than 0.5 seconds per choice (6 participants). All remaining participants (N = 97, 61 Females [62.2%]; Mean age: 33.03) were considered valid subjects. Prior to commencing the experiment, informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants were initially provided with information about the study, including its objectives and primary purposes. The experimental paradigm lasted approximately 13 minutes (M = 13.38; SD = 2.68) and consisted of a single session: for each choice, presentation order of the options (target, competitor, decoy) was manipulated within-subjects, whereas presentation modality (simultaneous vs sequential) was manipulated between-subjects. Ethical approval for this research was granted by the Ethics Committee of the University of Rome Tre. In the present experiment, choices were incentivized to ensure that participants were motivated to make their selections as close as possible to their actual preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Voslinsky et al., 2021)</ref>. Participants were informed that one of their choices would be randomly selected at the end of the experiment, and they would receive the outcome chosen in that specific case. Upon completing the task, participants were rewarded with Amazon.com gift certificates corresponding to their chosen options. Furthermore, when a decision involving a risky outcome was selected, a real lottery was conducted based on the real odds to determine whether the participant received the prize or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Design and procedure</head><p>The experiment was conducted using Qualtrics.com. At the beginning of the experiment, participants provided basic demographic information, completed an attention check, and underwent a main taskfamiliarization session. Subsequently, participants were randomly assigned to one of two distinct conditions: simultaneous or sequential choice conditions. In both conditions, participants were required to make a total of 30 binary and 30 ternary probabilistic choices between sure smaller options (i.e., 8€) and risky larger ones (i,e., 50% of receiving 16€). Binary and Ternary choices were identical, but ternary choices included an additional decoy option that was dominated by the risky alternative of the choice set. To avoid any carryover bias, the choices were divided into three separate blocks, each consisting of 20 items. This paradigm ensured that no decoy trial occurred near to its corresponding baseline choice set. Each block was balanced for the magnitude of the rewards, the level of risk and the presentation order of the alternatives. While the order of the This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article blocks remained fixed, the starting block and the sequence of trials within each block were fully randomized to eliminate any positional, learning, or carryover effects. The positioning of options on the screen was manipulated, with six different presentation orders: TDC, DTC, CTD, CDT, DCT, and TCD. Each presentation order included a low-risk low-reward item, a high-risk low-reward item, a low-risk high-reward, and a high-risk high-reward item. In the simultaneous condition, each choice was displayed for six seconds for binary choices and nine seconds for ternary choices. After this time, the options disappeared, and participants were asked to select their preferred option using three buttons placed in the same locations as the options on the screen (figure 1). Conversely, in the sequential condition, options were presented one at a time and remained on the screen for three seconds each. The next option appeared immediately after the previous one disappeared. When the final option disappeared, participants were required to make their selection in the same manner as the simultaneous condition. To determine the optimal presentation time for each choice, a pilot study was conducted with 10 participants. This pilot study verified whether the allotted response times of 3 seconds per option were adequate for participants to process and recall the available alternative. The data collected from this pilot study fully support this methodology. Participants were able to recall all the options and their spatial placement with an accuracy rate of 91%. At the end of the task, participants were informed about the randomly selected choice and were told that they could claim the reward by providing a valid email address. the options were obscured by an overlay panel, and participants were required to choose their preferred option. In the sequential condition, the options were displayed one after another, with each option remaining visible on the screen for three seconds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Materials</head><p>The probabilistic binary stimuli were designed using 2 magnitudes of the reward (small [sure 2€-14€ / risky 10-20€]; large [sure 8€-128€ / risky 80-160€]) and two level of risk (low [60%-96%]; high [12%-48%]). Consistently with previous studies, to elicit risk preferences closer to indifference and to reduce participants' loss aversion, we increased the expected value for risky rewards by 20% by manipulating the risk percentage <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Marini &amp; Paglieri, 2019)</ref>. All 30 binary items were reused in the ternary condition with the addition of an asymmetrically dominated decoy, which always targeted the risky alternative. Decoy options were built so that their expected value would be roughly equivalent to the amount offered by the sure reward, which led to an approximate 20% reduction in the amount of the decoy option compared to the dominant alternative, keeping constant the risk level: e.g., "Would you rather have a guaranteed €56 (competitor), take an 84% chance of receiving €80 (target), or opt for an 84% chance of receiving €67?" (decoy). Ternary items were balanced across six presentation orders, in which we varied the position of the Target (T), Decoy (D), and Competitor (C) options: CDT; CTD; DCT; DTC; TCD; TDC. For both binary and ternary trials we realized both a simultaneous and a sequential stimulus for a total of choices. Moreover, we added 6 control questions in which the sure reward was greater than the risky one. For the complete list of stimuli, see the supplementary materials <ref type="table">(Table 1S</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Statistical notes</head><p>Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp, 2020) and R on Jamovi (The Jamovi project, 2022), with a significance level of α = .05. Considering the multilevel hierarchical within-subjects design for the manipulation of option presentation order, generalized mixed effects models were employed (Stroup, 2013) using the GAMLj module <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gallucci, 2022</ref>). Within each model, random effects were incorporated for both participants and stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Judd et al., 2012)</ref>. This allowed us to consider variations in participants' baseline levels (i.e., random intercept) and the possibility of differing patterns or slopes of change in target preferences based on the choice set (i.e., random slope; binary vs ternary). The unstandardized estimate (β) along with its 95% Confidence Intervals and the standard error of the estimate (SE) were reported. Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for pairwise comparisons that were conducted after observing a significant main effect or interaction. The normality of variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and homoscedasticity was checked using the Levene test. In cases where these assumptions were violated, data normal distribution for parametric analysis was evaluated using skewness and kurtosis measures for medium-sized samples (Kim, 2013; George &amp; Mallery, 2010).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>As a preliminary control analysis, we examined the initial baseline differences in binary choices between the simultaneous and sequential conditions using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The fixed effects included Condition (Simultaneous -Sequential), Presentation Order (CT -TC), and their interaction, with participant ID and Stimulus included as random effects to account for individual and item-level variability. This step was crucial to validate that any observed effects in the main analysis were attributable to the experimental manipulations rather than pre-existing differences in choice behaviour between the simultaneous and sequential conditions. The logistic regression model indicated no significant effect of Condition (p =.781) or Presentation Order (p =.289), nor their interaction (p = .391). These results suggest that the number of target choices was comparable across the two experimental conditions, regardless of the order in which the options were presented or the presentation modality (simultaneous or sequential). Moreover, we conducted a second preliminary analysis to determine whether the two experimental conditions and the presentation orders differed in terms of the number of decoys selections. Choosing a high number of decoys would indicate either a lack of attention or excessively high cognitive load during decision-making, as there is no apparent reason for participants to choose an obviously dominated option in the choice context. Using a GLMM, we tested for differences in decoy selections between the experimental conditions and presentation orders. The fixed effects did not reveal any significant effect of Condition (p = .174) or Presentation Order (p = .316), suggesting that neither the experimental conditions nor the presentation orders significantly influenced the number of decoy selections. The incidence of decoy selections was very low in both conditions (Simultaneous = 3.04%; Sequential = 4.18%). To evaluate attraction effect elicitation, we estimated the probability of selecting the target option as a function of the Choice Set (Binary -Ternary), the Presentation Order (CDT; CTD; DCT; DTC; TCD; TDC), and the Condition (Simultaneous -Sequential). A Generalized logistic mixed effect model was run to analyze the impact of the Choice Set (Binary -Ternary) on the probability of selecting the target option. We included the Presentation Order and the Condition as fixed factors. Additionally, to control for participants and stimuli variability, the subject This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article ID and stimuli intercepts and slopes were modeled as random factors. The choice set (β = .66, df = 1, SE = .06, p &lt; .001, OR = 1.93 95%CI [1.71, 2.18]) reached statistical significance. More specifically, in the Ternary contexts there was a significant increase in the probability of selecting the Target option over the Competitor, with participants having about double the odds of choosing the Target when a decoy option was included. Contrarily, the main effects of the Condition (p = .282) and Presentation order (p = .608) failed to show significant results. Subsequently, we did not find a significant interaction between the Choice Set and the Condition (p = .087), indicating that the decoy effect did not differ between the Sequential and Simultaneous condition. More importantly, we found a threeway interaction Choice Set × Presentation Order × Condition (χ² = 13.56, df = 5, p = .010). This implies that the combined effect of the choice set and presentation order differed depending on whether participants were in the Sequential or Simultaneous condition. Subsequent post-hoc comparisons (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) revealed that all presentation orders in the sequential condition elicited an attraction effect showing an increase in the choices for the target option in the ternary condition compared to the binary one (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2;</ref> all ps &lt; .05). Conversely, in the simultaneous conditions, DCT and TCD orders failed to show any significant difference (ps &gt; .99). This suggests that the spatial proximity of the TD (targetdecoy) options played an essential role in eliciting the attraction effect in simultaneous choices, whereas the impact of temporal proximity of target and decoy in sequential choices was much less pronounced ( <ref type="figure">Figure.</ref> 2; all other ps &lt; .05). For the choice percentage of each stimulus, please see the supplementary materials <ref type="table">(Table 1S</ref>). DTC; TCD; TDC) × Condition (Simultaneous -Sequential) interaction. Secondly, to directly compare attraction effect elicitation across different presentation orders, we used the relative choice share of the target option (RST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ratneshwar et al., 1987)</ref>. RST was calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ( ) ( ) + ( 1 )</formula><p>Pr(T) specifies the proportion of target preferences and Pr(C) indicates the proportion of competitor choices. The presence of AE was confirmed when a significant positive change was observed in the relative share of the target option (T) in the ternary conditions, as compared to the binary choice sets. We calculated the RST change by subtracting the RST of binary choices from the RST of ternary choices. A two-way mixed ANOVA was run on RST Change with the Presentation order (CDT; CTD; DCT; DTC; TCD; TDC) being the within-s independent variable and the Condition as the betweensubjects factor (Sequential; Simultaneous). The ANOVA did not reveal a main effect of Presentation order (p = .109) and Condition (p = .118). However, we found a significant Presentation order × Condition interaction (F (5, 475) = 33.00, p = .009, ηp² = .031, (1 -β) &gt; .99]. As expected, the posthoc analysis highlighted that there were no significant differences between conditions in most of the presentation orders (ps &gt; .43). Unsurprisingly, only the DCT and TCD orders, that failed to elicit AE in the simultaneous condition, reported a significant difference (DCT: p = .007; TCD: p = .002). This analysis suggested that, when present, AE did not significantly vary between sequential and simultaneous choice environments and across different presentation orders (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3)</ref>. Lastly, a Generalized logistic mixed effect model was employed to investigate the influence of Target Position within the choice set (Target as last option; Target as first or second option), Target -Decoy order (Target first, Decoy First), and Target -Decoy proximity (Near or Distant) on the probability of selecting the target option in the ternary choice contexts. The condition (Simultaneous -Sequential) was also included as a fixed factor. As expected, the GLMM analysis revealed statistical significance for the interaction between Condition and Target-Decoy Proximity (β = .54, df = 1, SE = .20, p = .007, OR = This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article on target selection was significantly influenced by the condition. Post-hoc tests showed that this effect was significant only in the Simultaneous condition (p = .021), whereas no significant differences were observed in the Sequential condition (p = .93). In contrast, no significant effects were found for Target Position (p = .112), Target-Decoy Order (p = 0.104), or their interactions with Condition (all p &gt; 0.05). In summary, our findings indicate that the likelihood of selecting the target option significantly increases when it is in spatial proximity to the decoy in the simultaneous condition, whereas temporal proximity in the sequential condition is not needed to elicit an attraction effect (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4)</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ORDERED TO ATTRACT General discussion</head><p>This study confirms that the attraction effect emerges in ternary choices when a decoy option is added to a binary context, significantly increasing the likelihood of selecting the target option. This effect was evident across both simultaneous and sequential presentation conditions. However, the way options were presented influenced the effect of the decoy. When the options were presented all together on the screen (Simultaneous condition), the spatial arrangement of the target and decoy options significantly impacted participants' preferences, with some orders failing to show a significant attraction effect (DCT; TCD). These findings highlight, that while the attraction effect is robust, its strength can vary depending on the visual presentation of the options. In particular, our results suggest that spatial proximity of the target and decoy options is a crucial factor in eliciting the attraction effect. When these options are positioned close to each other (e.g., CDT, CTD, TDC, DTC), their similarity becomes more salient, enhancing the subjective value of the target option in two main ways. First, the close proximity makes the decoy's inferiority more apparent, thereby highlighting the target's superiority. This recognition of the internal dominance structure, where the target clearly outperforms the decoy, increases the perceived value of the target option <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Król &amp; Król, 2019)</ref>. Second, the close visual proximity facilitates immediate and direct comparison between the options, making the target and decoy more salient within the choice set (Bhatia, 2013; Bordalo et al., 2013). Our findings are consistent with this interpretation, demonstrating that the spatial arrangement of options can significantly influence decision-making processes. Conversely, we failed to observe the attraction effect when the target and decoy were positioned farther apart (e.g., DCT, TCD). In these arrangements, the target's relative superiority might have been less apparent, not eliciting salient and dominant processing. Research shows that participants often compare options pairwise <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Noguchi &amp; Stewart, 2014)</ref>, focusing on attributes from left to right on the screen. When the competitor is positioned between the target and the decoy, it tends to attract more comparisons. These comparisons do not directly address the target's superiority over the decoy, reducing the likelihood of the attraction effect to emerge. The visual separation lessens the immediate recognition of the target's dominance, making the attraction effect less likely to occur, consistently with the multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator (MLBA; Trueblood et al., 2014) model of context effects in multialternative choice, according to which preferences emerge from a weighted aggregation of pairwise comparisons between options. Our findings regarding simultaneous choices are also consistent with those of Evans and colleagues (2021) on perceptual choices, obtained by reanalyzing data collected by Trueblood and collaborators (2015) based on spatial presentation order. In both datasets, failing to position target and decoy next to each other (in the DCT and TCD orders) suppresses the attraction effect, with a null effect in our study, and even a contrary effect (repulsion) in the data analyzed by Evans and colleagues. This supports the conclusion that spatial proximity between the target and decoy is crucial for the attraction effect to manifest, and this remains true both for perceptual tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Evans et al., 2021)</ref> and value-based tasks (this study). On the other hand, when the options were presented one at a time (Sequential condition), the attraction effect emerged consistently, regardless of the order in which the options appeared and without any effect of target-decoy temporal proximity. This finding is in contrast with previous literature, which posited that temporal separation between options would weaken or eliminate the attraction effect, similarly to how spatial separation affects it in simultaneous presentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Evans et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hasan et al, 2023)</ref>. Although these past findings refer to perceptual discrimination tasks, we initially hypothesized that, like spatial separation, temporal separation would have diminished the comparative process needed for the attraction effect to emerge also in value-based choice tasks. Specifically, we expected that, when options were presented sequentially, the lack of immediate visual juxtaposition of target and decoy would impair participants' ability to perceive the decoy's inferiority and the target's This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article superiority, thereby reducing or nullifying the attraction effect, similarly to what happens with spatial placement in simultaneous presentation of the choice options. However, the consistent attraction effect observed in the Sequential condition across all presentation orders suggests that, in value-based choice tasks, the mental comparison process operates differently than in perceptual discrimination tasks. Indeed, the discrepancy between our findings and those of Evans and colleagues (2021) regarding the attraction effect in sequential presentations can be attributed to the nature of the stimuli used in each study. Evans and colleagues investigated the attraction effect using perceptual stimuli, where participants were asked to choose rectangles based on their area. Their paradigm involved comparing geometric attributes, which require complex mental visualization and spatial reasoning, and a degree of precision in comparing perceptual features of the options (in order to detect dominance relations) that is hard to process without simultaneous visual access to them. Their empirical results showed a mixed and unclear pattern of both attraction and repulsion effects across different sequences, with no clear heuristic pattern of responding. In contrast, our study utilized probabilistic choices involving monetary values, with participants making binary and ternary decisions between sure smaller amounts (e.g., €8) and risky larger amounts (e.g., 50% chance of receiving €16). The numerical nature of these choices likely simplified the mental comparison process. Numerical stimuli, as opposed to perceptual stimuli, are generally easier to quantify and compare directly. Previous literature, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Frederick et al. (2014)</ref>, already suggested that the attraction effect is more pronounced with numerical stimuli, which support more straightforward cognitive processing compared to perceptual attributes. The simpler cognitive and mental processing associated with numerical stimuli and comparisons may explain why we observed a consistent attraction effect across all orders in the sequential condition, regardless of the presentation sequence. In contrast, the complex mental reconstruction required for perceptual stimuli may lead to more variable responses, as indicated by Evans and colleagues.</p><p>Additionally, previous studies using process-tracking methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Marini et al., 2023)</ref> have demonstrated that in simultaneous presentations, participants tend to give minimal attention to the decoy option. Once they recognize the dominance structure and the superiority of the target, participants typically ignore the decoy and focus their comparisons on the other available options. In contrast, a sequential presentation forces subjects to thoroughly examine the decoy, as it is the only one visible option on the screen for a certain period. According to sequential sampling models <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Roe et al. 2001)</ref>, processing the decoy can lead to a negative preference state for this option while simultaneously boosting the perceived value of the target. The logic is that the more time and cognitive resources are spent evaluating the decoy, the clearer its inferiority becomes, thereby enhancing the relative attractiveness of the target.</p><p>Our findings suggest that sequential presentation conditions might result in a stronger attraction effect because they compel decision-makers to allocate equal attention and processing time to each option, including the decoy. This extended processing of the decoy amplifies its perceived inferiority, which in turn, increases the subjective value of the target. This contrasts with simultaneous presentation, where the decoy is often quickly dismissed, leading to a less pronounced attraction effect. The forced, thorough evaluation in sequential conditions ensures that the decoy's weaknesses are fully appreciated, thereby enhancing the target's appeal.</p><p>In conclusion, our study confirms that the attraction effect is robust in ternary choices, significantly influencing the likelihood of selecting the target option. This effect was evident in both simultaneous and sequential presentations, though its strength varied with presentation style. Spatial proximity between the target and decoy in simultaneous presentations was essential to elicit the attraction effect, by making the decoy's inferiority apparent. In contrast, when options were presented sequentially, the effect persisted despite the lack of visual proximity, suggesting that cognitive comparisons can compensate for spatial separation, in the absence of visual distractions. These findings highlight the importance of both visual arrangement and cognitive processing in shaping decision-making, with numerical stimuli facilitating a more consistent attraction effect compared to perceptual stimuli.</p></div>
