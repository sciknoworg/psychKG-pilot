			<abstract>
				<p>Habits pose a fundamental puzzle for those aiming to understand human behavior. They pervade our everyday lives and dominate some forms of psychopathology but are extremely hard to elicit in the lab. In this Registered Report, we develop novel experimental paradigms grounded in computational models, which suggest that habit strength should be proportional to the frequency of behavior and, in contrast to previous research, independent of value. Specifically, we manipulate how often participants perform responses in two tasks varying action repetition without, or separately from, variations in value. Moreover, we ask how this frequency-based habitization relates to value-based operationalizations of habit and selfreported propensities for habitual behavior in real life.</p>

Yet, research suggests that a large part of our everyday behavior is habitual rather than goal-directed <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Verplanken &amp; Orbell, 2003)</ref>. Habits are slowly and incrementally learned stimulus-response associations.</p><p>Due to this slow learning process, they are inflexible and insensitive to sudden changes in the environment like the devaluation of reinforcers or the degradation of response-outcome contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dickinson &amp; Pérez, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Seger &amp; Spiering, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Verplanken, 2018)</ref>. Of course, most habits can eventually be modified after changing the contingencies between actions and their outcomes or the values of these outcomes, but these adaptations again need time to evolve (De Houwer, 2019; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kruglanski &amp; Szumowska, 2020)</ref>. Capitalizing on the slow adaptation of learned habits and their automatic triggering by contextual factors, previous research has associated habitual control with a wide range of health-relevant processes and behaviors that are repeated frequently, such as dietary decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carels et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Gardner et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lally et al., 2008)</ref>, physical exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fleig et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kaushal &amp; Rhodes, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Verplanken &amp; Melkevik, 2008)</ref>, and social network website use <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Lindström et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Turel &amp; Bechara, 2016)</ref>. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that pathologically habitual decision making characterizes substance use and obsessive-compulsive disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Gillan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Lüscher et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Voon et al., 2015)</ref>, although there is also conflicting evidence regarding this relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gillan, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Nebe et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sebold et al., 2017)</ref>. However, habits are not maladaptive as such. They free cognitive resources for other tasks because stimuli trigger behavior in a computationally simple and effortless manner. Moreover, habitization can also be used to gradually shape advantageous human behavior over time, for example brushing teeth after a meal, recycling waste, or quitting smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baldwin et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gardner et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Marteau et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Rothman et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, it is crucial to know how habits develop and to obtain a handle on how to promote the evolution of beneficial habits and change detrimental ones.</p><p>Unfortunately, it has proven surprisingly difficult to study habits in the lab, at least with humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(de Wit et al., 2018)</ref>. Given their definition as stimulus-response associations, habits are blind to changes in the value of the outcomes they produce. Therefore, classical examinations of habitual control used experimental paradigms that extensively trained an instrumental response in stable conditions. Such (over)training leads to a shift from goaldirected (flexible but cognitively demanding) to habitual control and reduced sensitivity to reductions in the outcome's value or the contingency between action and outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams &amp; Dickinson, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Dickinson, 1985)</ref>. Over the last decades, animal research used satiation on specific food rewards, paired the rewards with illness-inducing injections after learning, or provided additional outcomes without requiring an action and showed a reduced capacity of these outcome devaluation or contingency degradation tests to change habitual responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams &amp; Dickinson, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dickinson &amp; de Wit, 2003)</ref>. In contrast, only one study was able to show habitization of behavior via overtraining in a human laboratory paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Tricomi et al., 2009)</ref>. However, this finding could not be replicated in two studies with larger sample sizes, questioning the validity of the original findings and arguing that the classic paradigms with human participants show at best a moderate role of habits in behavioral control <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(de Wit et al., 2018</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Pool et al., 2021)</ref>. In fact, when these classic paradigms and their variants are used to investigate habits in humans they arguably tap primarily into goal-directed control as the test procedures are too salient and the training is usually not extensive enough to form habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(de Wit et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Watson &amp; de Wit, 2018)</ref>. These issues raise the question whether we can induce habits in the lab at all.</p><p>In recent years, some lines of research have increasingly focused on an alternative approach to studying habits in humans that circumvents the difficulties of inducing habits experimentally and instead relies on computational modelling of choices in sequential Markov decision tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Decker et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Gläscher et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Kool et al., 2016)</ref>. In this approach, habitual and goal-directed behavioral control are operationalized as model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Daw et al., 2005)</ref>. In essence, model-free reinforcement learning works by summing up previously received rewards and increasing the probability of selecting actions that have led to (more) reward, with the aim of maximizing rewards in the long run <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dolan &amp; Dayan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998)</ref>. Model-free learning can capture behavior change well. For example, giving a dog a treat every time it obeys an order increases the probability that it will follow the order in the future, even when the treats will be withheld at some point. However, as can be seen from this example, model-free reinforcement learning is entirely driven by the incentive value of outcomes associated with behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Kruglanski &amp; Szumowska, 2020)</ref>. Thus, although this approach aims to operationalize habitual behavior, model-free learning concerns reinforcement and therefore fails to capture the outcome-independent nature of habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Miller et al., 2019)</ref>. By extension, although model-free reinforcement learning might constitute one candidate process to develop habits, habitual behavior has little in common with model-free reinforcement learning once habits are established.</p><p>It is worth noting that the sequential Markov decision tasks used to assess modelbased and model-free learning feature a permanently changing task environment (because reinforcement probabilities follow random walks over the course of the task), which is thought to counter the development of habits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Gardner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Ouellette &amp; Wood, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Verplanken &amp; Wood, 2006)</ref>. Indeed, previous studies investigating the overlap of model-free reinforcement learning and insensitivity to reinforcer devaluation after training found only statistically non-significant small to very small associations, which refutes the notion that they both operationalize habitual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Friedel et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gillan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Sjoerds et al., 2016</ref>). Yet, model-free reinforcement learning is still portrayed as a valid approximation of habitual behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Drummond &amp; Niv, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Patzelt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Wyckmans et al., 2019)</ref> calling for an adequately powered empirical test of the validity of this task for measuring habits.</p><p>Using computational simulations, <ref type="bibr">Miller and colleagues (2019)</ref> recently proposed that a frequency-based habitization process could reproduce hallmark findings of choice and perseveration in the experimental literature on habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Guthrie, 1959</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Schwöbel et al., 2021</ref>, for a Bayesian implementation of repetition-based habit learning). This view converges with evidence for frequency-related processes playing a role in various psychological processes. Examples include the Hebb effect in working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Oberauer et al., 2015)</ref>, choice history bias in perceptual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abrahamyan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Braun et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Urai et al., 2019)</ref>, the mere-(repeated-)exposure effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Zajonc, 2001)</ref>, and choiceinduced preference changes in value-based decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brehm, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Izuma &amp; Murayama, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Sharot et al., 2009)</ref>. Some studies on choice-induced preference change <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Izuma et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Izuma &amp; Murayama, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Sharot et al., 2010)</ref> suggest that selecting a stimulus may change its value even if decision makers did not perceive the outcome of their choice. This raises the question whether the experience of an outcome following an action is indeed necessary to induce habits or whether habits can arise simply from frequently performing an action. More generally, independent lines of research substantiate the hypothesis that there is a basic learning process based on the frequency of behavior, which can mechanistically change psychological variables (e.g., memory representations, subjective values) and that such a frequency-based process might be independent of reinforcement. By consequence it is conceivable that processes induced by frequently repeated choice contribute to habitual behavior.</p><p>Mounting evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Hardwick et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Luque et al., 2020)</ref> suggests that with fast response times (up to about 600ms) habitual response tendencies cannot be overruled by goaldirected processes and by extension that time pressure is important to unmask habits. However, it remains an open empirical question whether a frequency-based learning process changes an underlying psychological variable driving behavior (such as the subjective value of the stimuli which trigger responses) and whether the process is completely independent of reinforcement. Here, we aim to investigate frequency-based habitization both with explicit reinforcement of behavior and without because it is unclear whether external reinforcement is necessary for habits to form. Furthermore, we examine the validity of various experimental approaches to habits using six different behavioral paradigms -two newly developed and piloted as well as four previously used tasks including traditionally used outcome devaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Tricomi et al., 2009)</ref> and contingency degradation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Vaghi et al., 2019)</ref> as well as a modified version of the sequential Markov decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kool et al., 2016)</ref>. Our study addresses the issue that most previous research neglected to train participants extensively enough to induce habits, as habits are supposed to grow stronger with repetition. Specifically, we extend training to four or five days for all tasks except the sequential Markov decision task, which has been shown to lead to stronger model-based choice tendencies with extended training <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Economides et al., 2015)</ref> and one of the outcome devaluation paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Tricomi et al., 2009)</ref>, in which there seems to be no increase of habitual behavior with extended training <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Pool et al., 2021)</ref>. Our two tasks apply design features thought to favor the development of habitual behavior, that is, stability of the task environment, responding under time pressure, and extended training over several days <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(de Wit et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Luque et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Watson &amp; de Wit, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Wood &amp; Neal, 2009)</ref>. Finally, to externally validate the previously established tasks we collect reports of habitual behavior in real-life. This aspect of our study will advance the field independently of the question whether frequency-based habit formation exists. Specifically, our study strives to answer the following Research Questions (RQ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ1: Does a frequency-based habitization process exist?</head><p>As outlined, the mere frequency of behavior might be the driving force of habitization, leading to a gradual change of subjective value proportional to choice frequency. However, current experimental paradigms do not allow separating the influence of behavioral frequency from subjective value. In these tasks, choice frequency typically correlates with outcome value, impeding differentiation of their respective effects. Thus, we have designed a reinforcement learning paradigm that manipulates the value of options and their choice frequency during training independently (Reward Pairs task). This feature of the task allows us to disentangle the influence of value-based and frequency-based processes during learning and decision making in the reinforced training sessions and a subsequent non-reinforced test phase.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Higher frequency of choosing stimuli during the training of the Reward Pairs task is associated with more strongly habitual behavior during the test phase <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1 for</ref> the operational specifications of all hypotheses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ2: Is external reinforcement of behavior necessary for frequency-based habitization or can the process arise also in a context without external reinforcement?</head><p>According to the notion that the frequency-based habitization process is not dependent on reinforcement, we should be able to elicit habits in an experimental task without any external reinforcement of behavior. This would constitute a proof of concept that choice frequency alone can drive habitization of behavior. Conversely, if frequency-based habits develop only in externally reinforced contexts, their underlying function might be to enhance reinforcement value learning instead of being a process completely divorced from reinforcement. To address this issue, we designed a novel paradigm that manipulates instructed choice frequency but is completely free from external reinforcement (Unrewarded Habit task).</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Higher frequency of choosing stimuli during the training of the Unrewarded Habit task is associated with more strongly habitual behavior during the test phase.</p><p>RQ3: Is there a universal (i.e., paradigm independent) habitization process? As pointed out previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Friedel et al., 2014)</ref>, different paradigms to study habits are considered equivalent, but there is almost no empirical evidence for this assumption. If anything, the few studies that have addressed the topic suggested that findings are rather dependent on the operationalizations used <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Friedel et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gillan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Sjoerds et al., 2016)</ref>, which makes it impossible to generalize to other paradigms or to draw generally valid conclusions regarding the habitization process (construct validity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955)</ref>. Therefore, we investigate the association of frequency-based habitization as measured in our two tasks with previously used paradigms of habitual behavior, that is, devaluation insensitivity in two outcome devaluation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Tricomi et al., 2009</ref>) and insensitivity to changes in the action-outcome contingency in a contingency degradation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Vaghi et al., 2019)</ref>. We also asses model-free reinforcement learning in a sequential Markov decision task (2-Step; <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Kool et al., 2016)</ref>. Investigating the relations between six different paradigms, we will be able to draw conclusions about the generality of the habitization processes (i.e., the extent to which the paradigms measure a similar form of habit formation).</p><p>As outlined above, insensitivity to outcome devaluation and model-free reinforcement learning in sequential decision tasks might rely too heavily on goal-directed control and representation of reinforcement values, respectively, to be a pure measure of habitual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(de Wit et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Miller et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Watson &amp; de Wit, 2018)</ref>. It is yet unclear whether contingency degradation tasks have the same drawback. One may argue that delivering unexpected outcomes independent from actions to degrade the contingency between action and outcome might be a similarly salient manipulation as the devaluation of outcomes in other experimental paradigms. We test the assumption that the different operationalizations of habits in the different paradigms capture the same habitization process, which is what the current literature implies by using all experimental tasks interchangeably to examine habit formation. Additionally, we will test the discriminant validity of the habitization process by exploring its association with working memory capacity. Working memory is an executive function, which may play a fundamental role for employing goaldirected behavior. Because habitual behavioral control has been opposed to goal-directed behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dolan &amp; Dayan, 2013)</ref> and has low cognitive demand, we expect a relatively weak association between working memory capacity and habitual behavior.</p><p>Using the modified version of the Markov decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kool et al., 2016)</ref> instead of the original 2-Step task for this Research Question will also enable us to conceptually replicate previous studies of the overlap between devaluation insensitivity and model-free reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Friedel et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gillan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Sjoerds et al., 2016)</ref> and extend it to a wider range of experimental operationalizations.</p><p>Hypothesis 3.1: The measures of habitual behavior in all six habit paradigms (i.e., Reward Pairs, Unrewarded Habit, outcome devaluation <ref type="bibr">(Tricomi and Luque)</ref>, contingency degradation, and 2-Step task) are positively associated with each other (i.e., convergent validity) and, thus, the corresponding data will fit a one-dimensional measurement model. Hypothesis 3.2: The measures of habitual behavior in the habit paradigms are more strongly correlated with each other than with working memory (i.e., discriminant validity) and, thus, the data will fit a two-dimensional measurement model significantly better than a one-dimensional measurement model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ4: How does the habitization process measured with the experimental paradigms relate to real-life habitual behavior?</head><p>The concordance between experimentally induced and real-life habits is often overlooked but essential to provide practical meaning to laboratory findings (criterion validity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two studies that have empirically investigated the relation between habits measured in experimental paradigms in the laboratory and those from everyday life. One study showed an association between action slips after outcome devaluation and decreased attention during (but no association with mistakes made, time or effort spent in) real-life habitual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Linnebank et al., 2018)</ref>. Another study recently reported a negative association between sensitivity to contingency degradation and self-reported automaticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ersche et al., 2020)</ref>. To add to this, we will test the associations of all six habit paradigms with self-reported real-life habitual behavior as measured with validated self-report questionnaires of real-life habits. For this purpose, we use the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Verplanken &amp; Orbell, 2003)</ref>, the Creature of Habit Scale (COHS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ersche et al., 2017)</ref>, and the Habitual Tendencies Questionnaire (HTQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ramakrishnan et al., 2021)</ref>. Responses to the SHRI revealed relations with actual observations of real-life habits in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Gardner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lally et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, we will investigate to what extent a universal habitization process is related to real-life habitual behavior. In addition, we will explore and compare the criterion validity of each employed experimental paradigm. Our analyses will enable us to quantify the degree of criterion validity of each paradigm. Comparing them to each other will allow us to make an empirically grounded recommendation for future studies aiming to use the most appropriate experimental operationalization of habits. In case of conflicting results regarding the associations of experimental measures with the three questionnaires, the association with the SHRI will be regarded most valid, as this questionnaire has the most extensive empirical evidence for its validity of the three.</p><p>Hypothesis 4: The habitization process measured in the experimental paradigms is positively associated with self-reported real-life habitual behavior.</p><p>Research Questions 3 and 4 focus on the generalizability and construct validity of different habit paradigms, that is, whether the habitization process is independent of specific paradigms used in laboratory research as well as the significance of this process for everyday behavior. Hence, these findings will provide a complete picture of the validity of our approaches to measure human habits in the lab. However, the use of several newly developed as well as previously used paradigms provides the possibility to tackle another exploratory Research Question, which is concerned with the most appropriate operationalization of habits in laboratory research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ5: Is there a difference in validity with regard to various behavioral measures of</head><p>habitual behavior? From a clinical perspective, overt choices constitute the most relevant measure of task performance. We also analyze response times (RTs), stimulus ratings, and computational model parameters as potential expressions of habits. We expect the habitization process to be reflected to some extent in all of these behavioral measures. Recent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., 2020)</ref> suggested RTs to be a more sensitive measure of habits than overt choices in an outcome devaluation paradigm. Our final Research Question thus intersects all previous hypotheses insofar as we will examine possible differences in the results for each Research Question depending on different behavioral measures of habitization (i.e., choices, RTs, ratings, and parameters of computational models). Therefore, all the analyses of the previously mentioned hypotheses will be performed separately for each applicable behavioral measure (see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref> for an overview of available behavioral measures per paradigm). For example, as all four behavioral measures are available for the Reward Pairs task, the analysis of Hypothesis 1 will be done four times, each time with a different behavioral measure. While we consider positive evidence for one of the hypotheses nested in RQ1 and RQ2 sufficient to support it, we will examine systematic patterns in the findings in RQ5. As previous findings do not provide a consistent picture regarding the validity of the behavioral measures, we have no explicit expectations, but consider this Research Question to be purely exploratory. The results will be used to provide best practice recommendations for the operationalization of habits in the laboratory for future research. Main effect of difference in previous choice frequency statistically significant with higher choice probability for previously frequently chosen stimuli in the same location interpreted as evidence for frequency-based habit independent from reinforcement. Otherwise: No evidence for a frequency-based habitization process independent from reinforcement in this task based on this specific behavioral measure of habitization.</p><p>H2b: Unrewarded Habit task: Stimuli chosen more frequently in training elicit faster responses in choice tests after training than stimuli less frequently chosen in training.</p><p>LMM regressing RT on stimulus presentation location, difference in choice frequency during training of chosen and unchosen options, their interaction, and the EHI score.</p><p>Interaction effect of difference in previous choice frequency and stimulus location statistically significant with faster RTs for previously frequently chosen stimuli interpreted as evidence for frequency-based habit independent from reinforcement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The study includes one week of data collection. It starts with an invitation email with a sign-up link, followed by participants receiving a study description and giving informed consent. They then fill in a sociodemographic questionnaire, the German versions of the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Stöber, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Stöber, , 2001</ref>). In addition, they will complete a version of a sequential</p><p>Markov decision paradigm assessing model-free and model-based behavior (2-Step; <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Kool et al., 2016)</ref>. Within one week before the training of the habit tasks begins, participants will have to fill in these questionnaires and perform the 2-Step task online to reduce the amount of time spent in the lab. The COHS, SRHI, and HTQ are used as real-life habit measures to validate the experimental measures of habitual behavior. The handedness score of the EHI will be used in analyses of RTs to control for generally faster responses with the preferred hand. The SDS-17 will be used to control for tendencies to respond in a socially desirable manner in the test phase of the Unrewarded Habit task if necessary. The sociodemographic information will only be used to characterize our sample.</p><p>As the study procedure is quite extensive, we will apply a planned-missing design <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Graham et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Little et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Rhemtulla &amp; Hancock, 2016)</ref>. In these designs, the complete sample is randomly split into several subgroups. Each subgroup performs one set of experimental tasks and questionnaires, which is common to all participants, and leaves out one task. For each participant, the left-out task is random. Hence, the missing data is missing completely at random (MCAR) and can be imputed for analyses across tasks on the basis of the data acquired from each participant (see Analysis plan). In our case, we will randomly assign participants to one of two subgroups. Each subgroup performs all questionnaires and tasks except for one (either the outcome devaluation taskLuque <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., 2020)</ref> or the contingency degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Vaghi et al., 2019)</ref> task). Therefore, the required assessment time for each participant is reduced, decreasing their individual workload.</p><p>The first on-site assessment will start with three working memory tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Lewandowsky et al., 2010)</ref>, which take approximately 25min to perform, followed by the first outcome devaluation task (45min; <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Pool et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Tricomi et al., 2009)</ref>. Next, all participants will perform the Unrewarded Habit task (21min) and Reward Pairs task (18min) in random order. These two tasks will be repeated daily until and including the fifth day (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref> for an overview of the study procedure). In addition, each participant will perform one of the two remaining tasks, that is, either the contingency degradation task (35min; <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Vaghi et al., 2019)</ref> or the second outcome devaluation paradigm (35min; <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Luque et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Luque et al., , 2020</ref>.</p><p>Training of the contingency degradation or the second outcome devaluation task will start on the second day of on-site assessment and will proceed daily until and including the fifth day.</p><p>A short break of 1-3 min is included between the tasks.

The fifth day closes with a debriefing questionnaire asking for choice strategies during the test phases of the habit paradigms and paying out the participants. The first session will last around 110min, the second to fourth session around 65min, the fifth session around 85min, and the online assessment prior to the first assessment around 90min.</p><p>The tasks will be trained over several days <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>) with order randomized across participants but constant within participants to control for effects of motivation changes within a training session.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tasks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of stimuli for Reward Pairs and Unrewarded Habit Task</head><p>Change in subjective value ratings is an outcome variable of interest for the Reward Pairs and the Unrewarded Habits tasks. We use pre-training ratings also to select stimuli for these tasks. Specifically, participants rate a set of 15 geometric shapes (Reward Pairs task) and 15 abstract figures (Unrewarded Habit task) twice before the first training session. They are asked "How do you like the symbol on this box?" and use a slider to respond on a continuous visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100 with the verbal anchor points of "not at all" (0), "neutral" (50), and "extremely well" (100). The eight (Reward Pairs task) or four (Unrewarded Habit task) individually most neutrally rated stimuli (averaged over the two ratings per stimulus) are used for the experiment. Using an individual set of stimuli for the tasks serves two purposes. First, it controls for pre-experiment preferences between the given stimuli. Second, it limits stimulus-specific effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clark, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Judd et al., 2012)</ref>. We control for remaining stimulus-specific variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baayen et al., 2008)</ref> by using a random-effects model (see Analysis plan).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reward Pairs Task</head><p>The first task is an instrumental learning paradigm, in which we manipulate the reward value of stimuli and their choice frequency during training independently from each other.</p><p>Each trial shows one stimulus on the left side of the screen and one on the right side ( <ref type="figure">Figure    1A</ref>). Crucially, the task comprises pairs of stimuli, not presented together during training,</p><p>where both stimuli have the same objective value but one of them is presented often with a less valuable stimulus and therefore chosen more often during training. Conversely, the other stimulus of the pair is presented primarily with a more valuable stimulus and therefore chosen less often during training. When the two same-reward stimuli are presented together during test, we examine whether the difference in choice frequency during training has an effect on choice during test. Participants have a response window of 800ms to choose one of them by pressing either "X" or "M" on the keyboard. A purple frame indicates the chosen stimulus for 500ms, before both stimuli with their respective outcomes appear for 1000ms. A purple frame indicates the chosen stimulus and the reward associated with it. The subsequent inter-trial interval (ITI; 1000-3000ms) is exponentially jittered and the remainder of the response window is added to it to hold the length of each trial constant. Training takes place on each of five consecutive days with 160 trials per session.</p><p>There are eight stimuli in the Reward Pairs task. Each stimulus deterministically yields a reward of 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 points ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. Participants learn the contingencies between stimuli and rewards through trial-and-error. To facilitate learning and reduce uncertainty about the rewards associated with rarely chosen stimuli, participants receive feedback about the outcomes of both the chosen and unchosen stimulus after each decision in the training phase (but not in the test phase, see below). Delivering rewards deterministically instead of stochastically should increase the stability of the task environment and thereby facilitate the development of habits.</p><p>For three stimulus pairs, the stimuli yield the same amount of reward (3, 5, or 7 points), and these same-reward pairs never appear together during training. For each samereward pair, reward maximizing decision makers will choose one stimulus more often than the other because during training, one stimulus is frequently paired with a stimulus providing two points less or a stimulus providing two points more. Specifically, each stimulus is shown 40 times in one training session -either 10 times with a less valuable stimulus and 30 times with a more valuable stimulus or vice versa (see <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> for a list of all stimulus pairings during one training session). In consequence, stimuli within pairs are chosen either more or less frequently as long as participants adhere to the instruction to maximize points earned. For example, within say the 5 points pair, one stimulus is paired 30 times with a stimulus worth 3 points and 10 times with a stimulus worth 7 points and the other way around for the other stimulus ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. Hence, for the three intermediate reward levels (i.e., 3, 5, and 7 points), there is one stimulus chosen frequently during training and the other chosen rarely, which disentangles stimulus value and choice frequency. Stimulus-to-position assignments will be matched for left and right positions across stimuli, such that the number of choices at each position is similar. In total, participants can earn between 640 and 960 points in one training session, and they are instructed that one trial will be randomly selected each day and the reward associated with their choice added to the final pay-out with 1 point being worth CHF 0.5. Participants are instructed to keep on maximizing the points earned and that two trials of the test phase will be chosen randomly at the end and paid out, with 1 point worth CHF 0.5.</p><p>After the first rating, participants complete a free-choice phase without outcome presentation for both tasks. Participants are instructed to choose the stimuli they like better, and that their choices in this phase have no consequences but serve to familiarize them with the test situation and to experience the short decision time windows that will be used in the real experiments. Choices in this phase reveal pre-experiment preferences between the stimuli, which can be existent even if the stimuli have been rated similarly before <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen &amp; Risen, 2010)</ref>. Note that we use the most neutrally rated stimuli per participant, but these do not have to be exactly neutral. Participants are not excluded from the study for not rating enough stimuli in the neutral middle region of the rating scale, but the analyses of choice data will be corrected for pre-experiment stimulus preferences including both the rating and the choice in the free-choice phase. A second rating of all (i.e., used and unused) stimuli (also twice per stimulus) after the test phase on the last day allows us to test whether choice frequency during training changed the subjective value of stimuli. Furthermore, participants will rate 10 additional abstract stimuli at the beginning and end of the study, which will not be used in any task for any participant. We will use these to estimate of how reliable stimulus ratings are in general.</p><p>After the test phase and the second stimulus rating, participants complete debriefing questions. These questions concern the reward value of each stimulus and how confident participants are about their answers. Most participants of the pilot study revealed perfect knowledge about the reward value for each stimulus (see Supplementary Information for a more detailed analysis of pilot data). This finding is a prerequisite to interpret differences in choice frequency of stimuli within the same reward level as resulting from different previous choice proportions during training rather than from larger uncertainty about the value of less frequently chosen stimuli. Therefore, we will exclude participants from our analyses with less than 50% accuracy in the debriefing question about stimulus-reward associations. To associate behavior in the Reward Pairs task to behavior in other tasks and answer</p><p>RQs 3 and 4, we will compute an individual score of frequency-based habitual choice from the test phase (Reward Pairs choice score). This procedure is similar to scores computed from choices in sequential decision and outcome devaluation paradigms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Linnebank et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Luque et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Nebe et al., 2018)</ref>. The score captures the propensity of participants to choose stimuli during test which they chose more (rather than less) frequently during training, for each of the same-reward pairs. Reward Pairs choice scores closer to the maximum value of 1 reflect stronger preference for the more frequently chosen stimuli, scores around zero correspond to no preference, and scores closer to the minimum value of -1 represent a preference for more rarely chosen stimuli.</p><p>Reward Pairs choice score =</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∑ ( ℎ | , )− ( ℎ | , )</formula><p>Similar to the choice data, we will compute an individual score of frequency-based habit-related RT acceleration (Reward Pairs RT score), corresponding to the decrease in median RTs when choosing a previously frequently chosen stimulus relative to a previously less frequently chosen stimulus, for each same-reward pair. Reward Pairs RT scores closer to the maximum value of 0.8 represent relative RT acceleration for stimuli that participants chose more frequently in training, scores around zero correspond to little effect of choice frequency during training, and scores closer to the minimum value of -0.8 represent faster responses for stimuli that participants chose more rarely in training.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Reward Pairs RT score = ∑ ( | , )− ( | , ) 3</formula><p>We will compute an individual score of frequency-based rating changes (Reward Pairs rating score) corresponding to the average increase in liking ratings for previously more frequently chosen stimuli relative to previously less frequently chosen stimuli. Reward Pairs rating scores closer to the maximum value of represent stronger increases in liking ratings for previously more frequently chosen stimuli, scores around zero signify no differential rating changes between more and less frequently chosen stimuli, and scores closer to the minimum value of -100 represent greater increases in ratings for previously more rarely chosen stimuli.</p><p>Reward Pairs rating score =</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∑ ( − | , ) − ( ( − | , ) 6</formula><p>In addition to these three measures and the learning rate parameter of the choice kernel in the computational model, we will calculate the magnitude of the effect of training for the choices and RTs. To do so, we calculate the Reward Pairs choice score and Reward Pairs RT score for the first test phase on Day 1 and subtract this from the respective scores of the test phase on the last day and divide the result by two. Therefore, there are six scores of participants' behavior potentially reflecting habitization, which will enter the factor analyses and structural equation models of Research Questions 3 and 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unrewarded Habit Task</head><p>This task studies the effect of differences in behavioral frequency in the absence of external reinforcement during training on unrewarded free choice during test. At the beginning of each training trial of this instructed-choice paradigm ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>), two stimuli appear on the screen. After a uniformly jittered interval of 150-300ms, one of the stimuli receives a blue frame indicating that participants should select this stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing either "F" or "J" on the keyboard. Participants have 500ms</p><p>to respond. Time pressure supposedly facilitates habit development <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., 2020)</ref>. If they press a button before the onset of the blue frame, the phrase "Pushed too early" appears for 1300ms, no further response in this trial is recorded, and the trial counts as missing. If participants fail to respond within 500ms, the words "Too slow" appear for 800ms and the trial counts as missing. If participants respond within the given time window, a brown frame appears around both the chosen and unchosen stimulus for 800ms. Thus, all stimuli are presented with the same duration and participants receive feedback that their response was recorded, but the feedback is the same for either action, limiting outcome-related learning to a minimum. The ITI is exponentially jittered between 1000 and 3000ms and includes also the remainder of the response time window.</p><p>There are two stimulus pairs in the Unrewarded Habit task, which differ in the instructed choice proportions. In one pair, one stimulus is indicated to be chosen in 80% of the training trials, the other stimulus in the remaining 20% of training trials. In the other pair, In addition, we will compute an individual score of frequency-based habit-related RT acceleration (Unrewarded Habit RT scores) corresponding to a decrease in median RTs when choosing the previously more frequently chosen stimulus relative to the less frequently chosen stimulus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Devaluation Task Tricomi</head><p>As a benchmark paradigm of habit induction, the first outcome devaluation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Tricomi et al., 2009)</ref> uses actual snack foods as outcomes and a specific satiation procedure for devaluation (for a multi-lab replication study: <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Pool et al., 2021)</ref>; for the MATLAB code:</p><p>https://github.com/evapool/MULTILAB_HABIT.) We will closely follow the procedure described by <ref type="bibr">Pool and colleagues (2021)</ref>. In this paradigm, participants first rate their level of hunger on a 10-point Likert scale from "very full" (1) to "very hungry" (10), then taste and rate the pleasantness of six different snacks (three salty and three savory) on an 11-point Likert scale from "very unpleasant" (-5) to "very pleasant" (5). The favorite snack in each of the two categories is selected as outcomes in the task. A free-operant training phase follows, consisting of two sessions. This amount of training is equivalent to the moderate training group of <ref type="bibr">Pool and colleagues (2021)</ref>, who have shown no statistically significant difference in devaluation sensitivity between a participant group with two sessions in one day and a group with twelve training sessions equally distributed over three consecutive days. They concluded that most participants developed habitual responding within two training sessions and found no evidence to support the hypothesis that longer training makes participants more habitual in this task. Thus, we include this task with two training sessions only on the first day of the study.</p><p>Each of the two free-operant training sessions consists of twelve task and eight rest blocks. One of three fractal images and a schematic indicating the response button appears on the screen for the whole duration of a block (20 or 40s). Participants can press the response button self-paced. If they press the button, they may receive a reward (either the sweet or savory snack, which is presented on the screen for 1000ms) or nothing, in which case a grey circle is presented for 50ms on the screen. Reward delivery follows a variable-interval schedule with a mean of 10s (VI-10s). The VI-10s is implemented such that in each second there is a 10% chance that a button press within this second would deliver a reward. Thus, a reward becomes available on average every ten seconds and delivery is triggered by the first response after it becomes available. Each of the three fractals is associated with one of the two selected snacks or the rest block, in which participants are instructed not to respond. The order of blocks is pseudo-randomized within each participant so that no block type (sweet snack, savory snack, rest) occurs more than twice in a row.</p><p>After the second training session on the first day of assessment, one of the snacks is devalued by satiation (sweet or savory, balanced across participants). To induce satiation, the participants are presented with a bowl of the respective snack, which has been weighed beforehand. Participants can then eat as much as they want (and the amount will serve as a control variable). Next, participants again rate their level of hunger and the pleasantness of the two snacks used in the training sessions.</p><p>The devaluation procedure is followed by the test phase, which consists of six task blocks (three for each of the two snacks) and three rest blocks, presented in pseudorandomized order. Exactly as in the training sessions, the previously trained fractals and response schematic are presented but no reward is delivered. However, participants are instructed that they are nevertheless accumulating the respective snack outcomes associated with the presented fractal. Each block has a duration of 20s. Each response is followed by presentation of a grey circle for 50ms, but without food (i.e., in extinction).</p><p>To compute the behavioral measure of interest for this task, we calculate the average number of button presses per second in the second training session (i.e., six blocks per snack, pre devaluation) and in the test phase (i.e., three blocks per snack; post devaluation). If participants do not adapt their level of responding in the test session compared to the training for the devalued snack outcome, behavior is defined to be habitual for this task. Thus, we calculate a "behavioral adaptation index" (BAI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Pool et al., 2021)</ref>  We relate this index to behavior in the other tasks (RQ3) and to real-life habitual behavior (RQ4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Devaluation Task Luque</head><p>A second previously published outcome devaluation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Luque et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., , 2020</ref> will provide another benchmark measure of habit. This paradigm (available at https://github.com/DavLuke/MATLAB-Habits-Overtraining-Exp3) operationalizes habits as RT switch costs without affecting choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., 2020)</ref>. Participants learn to associate different visual stimuli and button presses with different outcomes. The task includes four types of stimuli in the form of cookies, two responses in the form of selecting one of two aliens, and three outcomes in the form of diamonds. In each trial, one of the cookies appears and participants give it to one of the two aliens by button presses in order to receive one of three diamonds, which are worth five, ten, or 100 points, respectively. Aliens differ in which type of diamond they trade for the different cookies. Thus, participants learn which cookiealien combination (i.e., stimulus-response association) leads to the best outcomes. Interleaved consumption trials, in which participants choose between different diamonds, test whether participants have learned the different outcome values.</p><p>Participants will perform eight training blocks with 52 trials each (12 trials with each of four cookie stimuli and four consumption trials) each day on four consecutive days starting on the second day of the study <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>). In test phases on the first and last training day, specific outcome types will be devalued. Specifically, at the beginning of each test block, one type of diamond is announced to yield no points in this block and participants have to react by switching their responses to a diamond that was worth fewer points during training but is now the only valuable outcome. These response switches supposedly lead to a conflict between perseverative habitual and flexible goal-directed behavioral control. Such conflict is not necessarily evident in the choices (even though the animal literature clearly shows that habitization affects choices; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balleine &amp; O'Doherty, 2010)</ref> but associated with an increase in RTs in switch trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., 2020)</ref>. Hence, the RT switch cost is the outcome measure of interest in this task. As an increase in habit strength occurred only under time pressure in previous studies, we will use the time-constrained task versions of Experiments 2a and 2b of <ref type="bibr">Luque and colleagues (2020)</ref> and expand the training from three to four days to increase the probability of inducing habits not only in RT but also in choice.</p><p>For the analyses regarding RQs 3 and 4, we will calculate two scores similar to the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Luque et al., 2020)</ref>. First, the difference of the proportion of responses leading to the devalued outcome in the test phase minus the same responses during the last training block before devaluation separately for the high and low valued outcome.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">DVAL choice score = ( ℎ | , ℎ ) − ( ℎ | , ℎ )</formula><p>This results in the DVAL choice score, which ranges from -1 to 1, with -1 reflecting perfect goal-directed switching after devaluation, 0 corresponding to habitual perseveration of the now-devalued response, and (the very unlikely score of) 1 indicating that participants did not choose the valued outcome during training but did so after devaluation. We will include the choice score to test whether additional training facilitates habitual behavior not only with regard to RT but also choice in this task.</p><p>Second, the DVAL RT switch costs in test trials will be calculated as the median RTs in switch trials after devaluation (separately for previously high and low valued outcome trials) minus the median RTs in the respective trials in the last training block before devaluation.</p><p>Switch trials refer to the trials in which participants successfully switched away from the devalued to the non-devalued stimulus during the test phase. RTs in switch trials are contrasted with the RTs for choosing the same stimulus before its devaluation. For example, in trials comparing a stimulus worth five points to a stimulus worth 100 points, the median RT of choosing the 100-point stimulus before devaluation would be subtracted from the median RT of switching to the five-point stimulus after devaluating the 100-point stimulus.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">DVAL RT switch cost = ( | ℎ − , ℎ ) − ( | , ℎ )</formula><p>The DVAL RT switch costs are stronger if responses to devalued stimuli are slower during test than training. These costs presumably arise from the cognitive conflict of having to overcome habitual choice tendencies and switch to the previously less valued choice.</p><p>As with the Reward Pairs and Unrewarded Habit tasks, we will compute the magnitude of the effect of training for choices and RT switch costs to use them in the analyses of Research Questions 3 and 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contingency Degradation Task</head><p>We will use a modified version of the contingency degradation task designed by <ref type="bibr">Vaghi and colleagues (2019)</ref> to capture the second criterion of the traditional habit definition. This free-operant task is presented in several 120s blocks. In each block, participants view a white triangle on the screen and are free to press the response key as often as they wish.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, each 1s-bin is associated with a probability of monetary reward if the participant responded and a probability of reward if the participant did not respond during the bin. The contingency, i.e., the relation between the two probabilities varies between blocks but stays constant within each block. At the end of each block, participants are asked to rate on a visual analogue scale how causal they think their responses were for the reward to materialize. The scale ranges from -100 to 100 indicating the continuum from "Responses always prevented rewards" to "Responses always caused rewards".</p><p>In blocks with positive contingency, the probability of receiving a reward in each 1sbin if at least one response has been made (P(O|A)) is positive (e.g., constantly 60%), while the probability of receiving a reward without having made a response (P(O|~A)) is zero. In negative contingency blocks, the probability of receiving a reward upon having produced a response is zero and the probability of receiving it without having made a response is positive.</p><p>In blocks with degraded contingency, both the probability of receiving reward contingent on having produced a response and the probability of reward in the absence of a response are positive (but not necessarily of the same magnitude), that is, rewards can be caused by a response but might also appear without it. Behavior is deemed habitual in this task if participants with prior training on the positive contingency schedule do not adapt their response rates in blocks with degraded or negative contingency.</p><p>We use a modified version of the task that includes blocks with positive contingency of P(O|A)=0.6 and P(O|A)=0.3 (both block types having P(O|~A)=0; <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> for an overview of all block types and how often they will be presented on each assessment day).</p><p>The positive contingencies are varied between blocks to keep participants engaged in the task.</p><p>In addition, blocks with degraded contingencies will be interspersed. Training on this task will be done on each of four consecutive days from the second day of the study <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>).</p><p>The outcome measure of interest in this task is a ratio score of the number of responses in the (fully and partially) degraded blocks relative to the sum of responses in both the (fully and partially) degraded and contingent (non-degraded) blocks of the last day <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ersche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Vaghi et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, this variable is close to 0.5 if participants respond to a similar degree in both contingent and degraded blocks, reflecting habitual behavior, i.e., an insensitivity to changes in contingencies. The score is close to zero the more participants respond during the contingent blocks and the less they respond during degraded blocks, that is, if participants are highly sensitive to changes in action-outcome contingencies. Values between 0.5 and one correspond to more responses during degraded than contingent blocks, which may reflect misunderstanding of task instructions or lack of attention or motivation. In addition, the causal judgements at the end of each block will be used as an outcome measure of interest.</p><p>We will further compute the magnitude of the effect of training for the ratio score as with the previous tasks by subtracting the score of the first day of training from the score of last to use them in the analyses of Research Questions and 4.</p></div>

This task version is freely available (https://github.com/wkool/tradeoffs) and takes into account several limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akam et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Kool et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kool et al., , 2017</ref> of the original task <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Participants start each trial in one of two possible states ( <ref type="figure">Figure S4</ref>). Each of these two initial states has the same representation of planet earth in the background but contains two different stimuli in the form of spaceships (i.e., spaceships A vs B in one initial state and spaceships C vs D in the other). Participants need to choose one of the two spaceships. This choice leads to a second state, in which participants face one of two aliens. The second state does not require a choice but only a press of the space bar in response to seeing the alien, which yields space treasure (if positive), antimatter (if negative), or nothing. These outcomes, representing points, vary according to a Gaussian random walk with a mean of zero points, a standard deviation of two points, and reflecting boundaries at the minimum of minus four and maximum of five points. Crucially, in each of the two initial states, one spaceship deterministically flies to one alien and the other spaceship to the other alien (i.e., spaceships A and C fly to alien 1 and spaceships B and D to alien 2). Thus, the two states are essentially equivalent. This feature is important to dissociate model-free from model-based control.</p><p>Model-based control "knows" about the equivalence because it represents the full state space including the transitions between states and can use the outcome in a specific second state to make inferences about the other initial state. In contrast, model-free control has no state representation and can guide choice only by the value of outcomes. Hence, model-free and model-based control make qualitatively different predictions about decisions when the initial state of the trial differs from the one on the previous trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of 2-</head><p>Step data is based on the computational model provided by Wouter Kool (https://github.com/wkool/tradeoffs) and the mfit toolbox for Matlab provided by Sam Gershman (https://github.com/sjgershm/mfit). This model combines model-free and modelbased reinforcement learning. The behavioral data of each participant is fit to this hybrid model, yielding an individual best-fitting estimate of all free parameters <ref type="bibr">(α, β, λ, π, ρ, ω;</ref> Supplementary Information section 2.3 for details). For the present study, the ω parameter is the outcome measure of interest as it captures the relative weight of model-based and modelfree reinforcement learning in computing the subjective value of options to guide behavior.</p><p>For our analyses, we will invert this parameter so that larger values (closer to the maximum of 1) correspond to more model-free (i.e., presumed habitual) control and smaller values (closer to the minimum of 0) to more model-based control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Working Memory Capacity Tasks</head><p>We will use three tasks of a working memory test battery <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Lewandowsky et al., 2010)</ref> to control for the effects of cognitive abilities in our analyses of habitual behavior: numeric memory updating (NMU), spatial short-term memory (SSTM), and sentence span (SS). By using three different tasks assessing the two processes entailed in working memory (storage in the context of processing and relational integration) with two different content types (verbal, including numeric, and spatial) we aim to achieve a more construct-representative measure of working memory capacity. These three tasks have been shown to correlate highly with a construct-representative measure of working memory capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Lewandowsky et al., 2010)</ref> and, thus, can be considered as working memory marker tasks.</p><p>In the NMU task, participants have to memorize numbers and update them according to mathematical operations. Each trial starts with the presentation of a set of three, four or five frames. A number from one to nine then appears in each frame, one by one, for one second.</p><p>Next, arithmetic operations ranging from -7 to +7, excluding 0, can appear randomly in any frame. Participants have to memorize the result of the operation for each frame. After two to six updating operations, the trial ends, a question mark appears consecutively in each frame and participants have to type in the respective current digit for that particular frame. The outcome measure is the participant-specific total proportion of items recalled correctly, ranging from 0 to 1.</p><p>In the SSTM, participants have to memorize the position of several dots in a 10x10</p><p>grid. In each trial, two to six dots appear one by one for 900ms each with 100ms interstimulus interval. After presentation of the last dot, a cue prompts the participants to reproduce the relative pattern of dots, that is, the location relative to each other. Neither the exact absolute position of the individual dots in the grid nor the sequence of the dots matters.</p><p>Participants receive 2 points for an exact match, one point for recalling a dot with a deviation of one cell and zero points for higher deviations. The participant-specific total sum of points is divided by the maximum possible score to yield a proportion of correct answers ranging from 0 to 1 similar to the NMU task (see <ref type="bibr">Lewandowsky et al., 2010, pp. 573f)</ref>.</p><p>The SS task is a complex-span paradigm comprising a memory component and a secondary processing task <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Lewandowsky et al., 2010)</ref>. The present version of the task uses verbal material for both components. For the secondary processing component, participants read a sentence consisting of three to six words for 5s and have to judge and indicate within this time window whether this sentence is meaningful or not. Examples for a meaningful and meaningless sentence are "All bumblebees can fly." and "All birds live in the city.". After indicating the meaningfulness of a sentence, a consonant is presented on the screen for 1s before a 100ms inter-trial interval and the beginning of the next trial. Participants have to memorize the consonants shown in the order they have been presented and report them back after the end of the current list. Each list has a length of three to seven sentences and consonants. The task begins with three practice trials containing two, three, and four sentences and consonants, respectively. The outcome measure is the participant-specific total proportion of correctly recalled consonants (including the correct position in the list) ranging from 0 to 1 similar to the other working memory capacity tasks. Participants are instructed to categorize the meaningfulness of the sentences and report the memorized consonants as accurately as possible. Thus, they are not aware that only the correct reporting of consonants is used as a measure of their working memory capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaires</head><p>All questionnaires will be performed by the participants online before the first training session.

These behaviors are freely definable (e.g., "Taking the car to go to work is something …" or "Drinking alcohol is something …") and participants complete twelve items (e.g., "I do frequently", "that makes me feel weird if I do not do it", or "I would find hard not to do") for each of them. We will assess the habit strength of eleven different real-life behaviors: brushing teeth, eating meat, having breakfast, drinking coffee, drinking alcohol, smoking, going to school/university/work by bike, going to school/university/work by bus/tram/train, doing sport/exercises, eating snacks/candy, and watching TV/online streaming services (items partly taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gardner et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Gardner et al., , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rees et al., 2018)</ref>. In line with previous research, we will use a 7-point Likert scale (i.e., from 0="disagree" to 6="agree").</p><p>The response for each item will be recoded so that higher numbers correspond to stronger habits. All twelve responses regarding a particular behavior will be summed up and divided by the maximum possible points (i.e., 72) to obtain a value between zero (lowest possible habit strength) and one (highest possible habit strength). These maximally eleven behaviorspecific scores are then averaged to a final habit strength score. Because we focus on habits as frequently expressed behavioral routines, we will consider only those of the eleven behaviorspecific scores for the calculation of the final mean habit score for which participants have indicated that they show the behavior frequently (i.e., response category three or higher in response to the item "I do frequently"). If not at least three of the eleven behaviors are performed frequently, then the final habit strength score is coded as missing to ensure that the final score represents general habitual behavior.</p></div>

Example items are "I like to park my car or bike always in the same place", "I tend to do things in the same order every morning (e.g., get up, go to the toilet, have a coffee…)", and "I tend to like routine". The final scores for the two distinct subscales of automaticity (11 items) and routine (16 items) are calculated by averaging the respective item scores. Correlation between these subscales is rather low (r=.154; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ersche et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, they are not combined to an overall score but used as separate measures of habitual behavior.</p></div>

Example items are "The same thoughts often keep going through my mind over and over again", "There is comfort in regularity", and "I look forward to new experiences" (reverse scored). Answers are given on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0="strongly disagree" to 7="strongly agree". The final score in this questionnaire is the result of summing up the values of all eleven items.

Example items are "I have too many tasks to perform.", "Although I try, I do not fulfill my duties as I should.", and "I have unnecessary conflicts with others."

The answers are indicated on a 5-point Likert scale with verbal anchors of "always left", "usually left", "both equally", "usually right", and "always right". Answers are coded on an integer scale from 0 (corresponding to "always left") to 5 (corresponding to "always right").

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Desirability Scale (SDS-17)</head><p>Social desirability is an answer tendency, which might influence choices during the test phase of the Unrewarded Habit task. In the test phase of this task, there is no obvious stimulus feature guiding choices, because the stimuli are not associated with reward and no information tells participants what to choose. Therefore, we could expect random choices or simple choice strategies like always choosing the left stimulus or alternating between stimuli in a pattern. Alternatively, participants could deduce for the test phase that the experimenters expect them to prefer the stimulus previously instructed to be selected more often. If a participant is likely to respond in a socially desirable manner, they might prefer this stimulus to supposedly satisfy the experimenter. For this reason, we include the Social Desirability Scale <ref type="bibr">(SDS-17;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Stöber, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Stöber, , 2001</ref>) in our assessment. This is a 16-item self-report questionnaire to measure social desirability in general. Answers are forced binary decisions between "yes" or "no". Example items are "I always stay friendly and courteous with other people, even when I am stressed out", "I occasionally speak badly of others behind their back", and "I take out my bad moods on others now and then". A mean score of all items with "yes" responses coded as 1 and "no" responses as 0 (and reversed for six items) is the outcome measure of this questionnaire. Higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to answer in a socially desirable manner. If this mean score will show a statistically significant correlation with the choices in the Unrewarded Pairs task, we will use it as a covariate in the analyses of hypothesis H2a to control for tendencies to answer in a socially desirable manner.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling plan</head><p>There are no previously published studies that examined related research questions, leaving us with no base for an estimation of the expected effect sizes and of the required sample size. Furthermore, the generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) used to analyze the pilot data (see Supplementary Information) did not converge with the full random effects structure, because of the insufficient sample size, preventing us from using these analyses as basis for our power analyses. Therefore, we simulated data with an assumed effect size that would be of interest (Cohen's d=0.2 as a typical effect according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Gignac &amp; Szodorai, 2016)</ref> and calculated an appropriate sample size to achieve 95% power for this effect size given our analytical approach. We simulated data based on the GLMMs used for the pilot data with the simr package (version 1.0.5; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016)</ref> in R (R Core Team, 2019). We added simulated participants to our pilot sample to reach a sample size of 200, then used subsamples of different size to calculate the observed power with the given sample size, resulting in a power curve for one fixed effect of the GLMM over a range of sample sizes. These analyses showed the strength of our mixed-effects within-subject design:</p><p>we need relatively small sample sizes to achieve adequate statistical power, because we model individual choices and RTs on a trial-by-trial level using more information than when using aggregated measures of behavior. For example, the simulation approach yielded a minimum sample size of 20 to achieve 98.20% (CI: 97.17%, 98.93%) power for the small effect of previous choice frequency in the Reward Pairs task. The same procedure for the GLMM of the choice frequencies during the test phase of the Unrewarded Habit task with a small effect of previous choice frequency yielded a minimum sample size of to achieve 96.10% (CI:</p><p>94.71%, 97.21%) power for this effect.</p><p>In the contingency degradation task, habitual behavior corresponds classically to the absence of an effect of the degradation on response rates. Thus, there is no effect size for this effect to base a power calculation on. However, <ref type="bibr">Vaghi and colleagues (2019)</ref> found the hypothesized stronger habitual behavior in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder compared to control participants, with Cohen's d=0.912. If we were to replicate their effect, we would need a sample size of 66 to reach 95% power (t test, independent groups, α=.05, two-tailed; G*Power 3.1.9.2; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Faul et al., 2009)</ref>. A similar issue holds for outcome devaluation taskLuque, in which the absence of an effect of the devaluation indicates habitual choices.</p><p>Following the rationale for the contingency degradation task, if we were to replicate Luque and colleagues' (2019) effect (Cohen's d=0.789) of the amount of training on responding with 95% power, we would require a sample of 86 participants (t test, independent groups, α=.05, two-tailed; G*Power 3.1.9.2; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Faul et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, a bigger concern for the required sample size is the correlational approach used in Research Questions 3 and 4.</p><p>Regarding the correlational analyses between different tasks measuring habitual behavior (Research Questions 3), we consider a correlation of r≥.5 and a well-fitting unidimensional measurement model as the criterion for a common habit process involved in all six tasks. Our reasoning is based on previous findings with regard to typical associations of different cognitive and behavioral tasks in individual differences research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kretzschmar et al., 2016)</ref> as well as research on habitual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Friedel et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gillan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Sjoerds et al., 2016)</ref>. As there are no studies reporting correlations between self-reported habits in questionnaires and experimental data (Research Question 4), we ground our expectation of such a relation in previous research on the associations between test performance in cognitive tasks and the self-estimate of these cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr">(r=.34-.55;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">von Stumm, 2014)</ref>, and relations between SRHI scores and real-life behavior in a meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">(r=.46;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gardner et al., 2011)</ref>. However, in order to have a more conservative estimate of the required sample size, we decreased the expected size of the correlation to r=.3 (corresponding to a large effect according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Gignac &amp; Szodorai, 2016)</ref> between experimental and real-life habitual behavior. Thus, to achieve 95% power, we require a sample size between 190 (RQ3) and 200 (RQ4) participants based on Monte Carlos simulations and the theorized measurement und structural equation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2002</ref>; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>To account for possible dropout during the successive training sessions, we will increase the necessary sample size to 220 participants to be able to compensate up to 10% dropout (pilot study: 5.6%). As we will use a planned missing design (see the Design section), 110 participants will enter the analyses of outcome devaluation taskLuque and the contingency degradation task, respectively. For the analyses across tasks (Research Questions 3 and 4), we will use multiple imputation of the missing data of each participant (van Buuren, 2018).</p><p>Hence, the sample size for these analyses will be 220. In addition, this sample size gives us sufficient statistical power (i.e., &gt;99%) to identify a small effect (Cohen's d=0.2) in all (G)LMMs used in RQs 1 and 2.</p><p>Participants will be sampled from the database of the [masked for blinded peer review]. The behavioral lab allows for the testing of 36 participants simultaneously, but there might be a substantially lower cap of the number of participants allowed to be in the lab at the same time due to Covid-19-related hygiene and safety plans. If on-site testing will not be efficient, the experimental paradigms will be re-programmed for online testing (e.g., with</p><p>Prolific: www.prolific.co). Exclusion criteria are not having performed the online questionnaires and 2-Step at the beginning of the first training session. To be included in the study, participants must not have partaken in the pilot study, be capable of understanding the German language for task instructions, and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision.</p><p>Furthermore, we only include participants aged 18 to 40 years to avoid age effects and exclude participants with prior diagnosis of neurological or psychiatric disorders.

That is, each fixed effect (main effects and interactions) will be included as a random effect with random intercept and slope nested in individual participants. In addition, the stimulus identity (i.e., the specific stimulus irrespective of the condition in which it is used) will be included as a random effect (intercept only) controlling for the used subset of the 15 stimuli rated at the beginning of the study. In case of convergence failures or singular model solutions with all appropriate optimizers allowed by the lmercontrol function (package lme4, version1.1-21; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bates et al., 2015)</ref>, the random effects structure will be iteratively reduced starting with the random effect accounting for the smallest share of variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baayen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barr et al., 2013)</ref>. For this and all following tasks, analyses of binary outcome measures (i.e., choice in Reward Pairs and Unrewarded Habit tasks) will be conducted as binomial GLMMs. Where the dependent variable is continuous (i.e., ratings, log-transformed RTs), we will fit an LMM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ1: Does a frequency-based habitization process exist?</head><p>Choices. For the Reward Pairs task data, we will use a GLMM to analyze trial-wise left vs. right choice. Included predictors of choices are the difference in the values of the left and right stimuli (fixed effect, continuous) and the difference in previous choice frequency (fixed effect, continuous). We do not expect these effects to interact but will explore their interaction because it may be relevant for future research on addiction. In analogy to value, we assume that not the absolute choice frequency during training drives choice during test, but the relative frequency compared to the alternative option. We hypothesize that relative previous choice frequency predicts choice during test in addition to relative reward values.</p><p>Such a predictive relation would support a frequency-based habit process.</p><p>Response times. An LMM will be fit to RTs in the test phase. Specifically, logtransformed RTs are regressed on the value difference between the chosen and unchosen option (fixed effect, continuous), their difference in choice frequency during training (fixed effect, continuous), and the interaction of these effects. We use the difference between chosen and unchosen stimulus in RT analyses (in contrast to left vs. right in analyses of choices) to reduce the number of required regressors and simplify the analysis. If higher frequency of choice during training gives rise to stronger habits during test, then larger differences in choice frequency should be associated with faster responses as well. Hence, we hypothesize to find main effects of value and choice frequency difference, with faster responses for larger, positive differences. The main effect of previous choice frequency would again indicate frequency-based habitual behavior. In addition, we will include the score of the EHI as a covariate (fixed effect, continuous) in this analysis to control for generally faster responses with the preferred hand.</p><p>Stimulus ratings. An additional LMM will regress the ratings of the stimuli used in the Reward Pairs task after the test phase on the ratings before the training (fixed effect, continuous), the reward levels associated with the stimuli (fixed effect, ordinal), the relative choice frequency during training (fixed effect, continuous), and the interactions between these effects. If choice repetition enhances the subjective value of chosen stimuli, then post-study ratings should be higher for stimuli the participants chose more frequently during training than for stimuli they chose less frequently while controlling for pre-study ratings and reward value, that is, we hypothesize a statistically significant main effect of choice frequency during training.</p><p>Computational model parameters. We will fit the choice data with computational models, aiming to obtain a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms that underlie choices. The computational model consists of temporal difference reinforcement learning and a kernel capturing choice frequency (see Supplementary Information for details about the computational models) thus combining value-based reinforcement learning and frequencybased habit learning. To investigate whether frequency-based learning has a significant role for choices during training and test sessions, we will compare models including either reinforcement learning, a choice kernel, or both (or random choices independent of all kinds of stimulus values) with regard to their fit to the data. We hypothesize that model comparison and selection over the whole group based on the exceedance probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Daunizeau et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Rigoux et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Stephan et al., 2009)</ref> will favor a model including the choice kernel for the training and test choice data over models without a choice kernel, which would support the assumption that a frequency-based habit process contributes to behavioral control in our task. In addition, we will explore model selection for individual participants based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Schwarz, 1978)</ref>. For this, we use the criteria described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Raftery (1995)</ref> interpreting BIC differences of 6-10 as strong, and &gt;10 as very strong evidence for the model with the smaller BIC. Thus, we do not assume that all participants necessarily adopt the same strategies in performing the task but might show interindividual differences. Moreover, we will explore the fit of additional models (e.g., rate correlation theory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Perez &amp; Dickinson, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Participants with more than 50% missing trials in any training or test session will be excluded from these analyses. They will also be excluded from the analyses of the Reward Pairs task if they choose the worse of two stimuli during one training or the test session in at least 50% of trials. In addition, trials with RTs less than 50ms will be discarded, because such fast responses cannot be induced by perceived stimulus features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ2: Is external reinforcement of behavior necessary for a frequency-based habitization or can the process arise also in a context without external reinforcement?</head><p>Choices. All choices made during the test phase will be modelled with a GLMM.</p><p>Specifically, left versus right choice is regressed on the relative frequency of making these choices during training (fixed effect, continuous) in a hierarchical binomial model. We hypothesize that relative choice frequency during training significantly predicts relative choice frequency in the test phase. Given that behavior in the Unrewarded Habit task is not reinforced, it may be more susceptible to researcher demand effects than the Reward Pairs task. To control for such effects, we include the mean score of the Social Desirability Scale <ref type="bibr">(SDS-17;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Stöber, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Stöber, , 2001</ref>; see Questionnaires) in the model as covariate of no interest (fixed effect, continuous) if the SDS-17 score will show a statistically significant correlation with choices. The covariate will be z-transformed (i.e., standardized) aiding convergence of the GLMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Harrison et al., 2018)</ref> and making the corresponding regression coefficients interpretable as a standardized effect size <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Schielzeth, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Response times. The log-transformed RTs in the test phase will be analyzed in an LMM as a function of previous choice frequency and stimulus presentation location. Thus, RTs are regressed on the stimulus presentation location of the chosen stimulus in relation to training (fixed effect, dichotomous, same vs. reversed location) and the difference in previous choice frequencies of the chosen and unchosen option (fixed effect, continuous). If a frequency-based habit has emerged, participants should respond faster in trials with the same stimulus presentation locations as in the training sessions compared to switched locations when choosing the stimulus with a higher choice frequency. Thus, we hypothesize that we observe an interaction between stimulus presentation location and previous choice frequency with fastest (slowest) RTs for presentations at the same (reversed) locations and high (low) previous choice frequency. Again, we will include the EHI score (fixed effect, continuous) in this analysis to control for effects of handedness on RTs.</p><p>Stimulus ratings. Another LMM will regress the ratings of the used stimuli after the test session on the ratings before trainings (fixed effect, continuous) and the relative choice frequency during training (fixed effect, continuous). Again, we hypothesize that the relative choice frequency affects post-training ratings, with higher ratings of the stimulus chosen more frequently during training compared to those stimuli chosen less frequently, while controlling for pre-training ratings.</p><p>Participants will be excluded from analyses with the Unrewarded Habits task if they fail to respond in more than 50% of trials in any training or test session or if they choose the wrong stimulus during one of the training sessions in 50% or more of the trials. In addition and similar to the Reward Pairs task, trials with RTs less than 50ms will be discarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ3: Is there a universal (i.e., paradigm independent) habitization process?</head><p>To analyze associations between experimental paradigms assessing habitual behavior, we will use the previously described scores of choices, RTs, stimulus ratings, and free parameters of computational models. The associations between the different paradigms will be investigated based on bootstrapped Pearson correlations and their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. In case of more than two scores (i.e., choices and RTs, <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>), we will apply confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test whether a measurement model with one (Hypothesis 3.1) or two (Hypothesis 3.2) latent factors will fit the data. Model fit will be evaluated according to the criteria proposed by <ref type="bibr">Schermelleh-Engel and colleagues (2003)</ref>. In detail, we investigate the χ 2 goodness-of-fit statistic, Comparative Fit Index (CFI ≥ .95), Root</p><p>Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA ≤ .08), and Standardized Root Mean Square</p><p>Residual (SRMR ≤ .10). Comparison of different measurement models (Hypothesis 3.2) will be based on Satorra-Bentler-scaled χ 2 difference tests (i.e., non-significance indicates equal model fit).</p><p>For the analyses of Research Question 3 and the following Research Questions, we will impute missing data of the one task not performed by each participant (see Sampling plan) based on multivariate imputation by chained equations (van Buuren &amp; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). The imputation procedure takes advantage of the correlational patterns in the dataset, estimating the values of missing data for each participant several times. Since the proportion of missing values in one variable is maximally 50%, 50 imputed data sets will be created <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(White et al., 2011)</ref>. The resulting statistical parameters of each data set (e.g., correlation coefficients) are pooled based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Rubin's (1987)</ref> rules to answer the Research Question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ4: How does the habitization process relate to real-life habitual behavior?</head><p>Based on the measurement model investigated in Research Question 3, we will examine the association between the latent habitization process and self-reported habitual behavior according to the COHS, SHRI, and HTQ questionnaires. In case of just two available scores (i.e., stimulus ratings; computational parameters, see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>), the measurement model will be empirically under-identified and, therefore, we examine the association based on bootstrapped Pearson correlations and their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for each paradigm. In case of conflicting results regarding the association with the three questionnaires, the association with the SHRI will be regarded most valid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ5: Is there a difference in validity with regard to various behavioral measures of habitual behavior?</head><p>To evaluate the hypotheses of the previous four Research Questions, it is sufficient if the results for at least one behavioral measure provide evidence for an effect of frequencybased behavior for each Research Question. However, to evaluate the validity of the different behavioral measures, we will examine the result pattern across all Research Questions with a focus on criterion validity (i.e., real-life habitual behavior; RQ4). If, for example, the results for RQ3 based on RTs and choices provide evidence for a universal habitization process but the results for RQ4 provide evidence for criterion validity only for RTs but not for choices, then RTs should be considered a more valid behavioral measure of habitual behavior than choices. As outlined above, we consider this Research Question as exploratory (and future research may want to revisit this question from a clinical perspective).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the instructed choice proportion of both stimuli is 50%. Stimuli are shown left and right of the center of the screen. To reduce cognitive demand and maximize the stability of the task environment, the presentation location of each stimulus remains fixed within but varies across participants. Participants complete one training session on each day. Each training session consists of six blocks of 20 trials for each of the two stimulus pairs, amounting to 600 training trials per pair.The test phase (Figure 1D) follows immediately after the fifth training session. During the test phase, we first present ten trials of each of the two trained stimulus pairs in the same presentation locations as during training. Then each of the four stimuli is presented with each other stimulus four times with balanced presentation locations of stimuli. These trials are randomly interspersed with an additional ten trials of each of the trained stimulus pairs where stimuli appear in switched locations compared to training. Starting with the same stimulus pairs and presentation locations aims at postponing the cognitive conflict participants might experience when stimuli are paired with other stimuli than during training or when locations are switched, which might in turn lead them to invest cognitive control masking habitual responding. The instructions inform participants to choose one of the two presented stimuli intuitively. Neither should they think much about the choice nor should they decide which button to press before the stimuli appear. They have to decide within a response time window of 500ms to limit the elaboration of decision strategies and facilitate the expression of potential habitual responses. With no obvious values guiding choice, we could expect random choices or simple choice strategies like alternating response sides irrespective of the presented stimuli. Alternatively, participants could have developed a preference for previously more frequently chosen stimuli over less frequently chosen stimuli, which would reflect the development of a habit induced by choice frequency. Similar to the procedure in the Rewarded Pairs task, participants perform the same test phase before the very first training session as simple check for pre-existing sensory preferences and to allow investigating training-induced changes in choices. The test phase is followed by a second stimulus rating. The outcome measures of interest are the observed choice frequencies and RTs during the test phase and the change of liking of the stimuli from the rating before training to the rating after the test phase as a function of the previous choice frequency during training. A frequency-based habit would decrease RTs and increase preferences and liking ratings for more frequently chosen stimuli. Similar to the Reward Pairs task, we will compute an individual score of frequencybased habitual choices during test (Unrewarded Habit choice score) capturing the relative preference for the more frequently chosen stimulus during training over the less frequently chosen stimulus. Positive Unrewarded Habit choice scores correspond to a preference for the previously more frequently chosen stimulus, scores around zero reflect no preference, and negative scores represent a preference for the less frequently chosen stimulus. Unrewarded Habit choice score = ( ℎ | ) − ( ℎ | )</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The trial sequence of the test phase immediately after the fifth training session is similar to the training phase: each trial starts with the presentation of two stimuli, giving participants 800ms to make a selection via button press. Left and right presentation is balanced for each stimulus within participants. The chosen stimulus is framed for 500ms. The reward is not shown to prevent further learning. Each stimulus is presented with each other stimulus four times. Together with an additional eight trials for each of the three same-reward pairs, the test phase comprises 136 trials. The remainder of the response window is again added to the ITI to keep the duration of each trial constant. During the initial stimulus assessment phase before the first training session, i.e., before any stimulus is associated with any value information, participants perform the same session. Participants are just instructed to intuitively select the stimulus more appealing to them and to get used to the brief RT window without their choices having any consequences. With this procedure, we can test whether value and frequency differences experienced in training affect choices.Note that the test phase presents the stimuli of the same-reward pairs together for the first time since participants associated them with reward. Both stimuli of the same-reward pairs should have identical cached values after the prolonged training and based on value participants should be indifferent between them. However, if habitual behavior can develop from repeating one action more often, then stimuli chosen more frequently during training should be preferred during test. Between 248 and 424 points can be earned in the test phase.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

A frequency-based habit supposedly acquired during training would decrease RTs and increase preferences for, and ratings of, more frequently chosen stimuli. In addition, computational models of choices during the training and test phases including a choice kernel (see Analysis plan) should be favored over models based solely on the reinforcement value of stimuli or random choices. With this, we deviate from the traditional approach of using these direct tests might be too salient for many human participants. Instead, we test the potential effect of choice frequency during training on behavior during test. The circle is presented with the square in ten trials and with the triangle in 30 trials during training.Thus, stimuli of the same reward level (e.g., 5 points) will be chosen with different frequencies (e.g., 30 times for the pentagon and ten times for the circle ) for reward maximizing decision makers.
