			<abstract>
				<p>Reinforcement learning models are broadly classified as model-based algorithms, which use an internal model of the environment to plan and carry out goal-directed behaviour, or model-free algorithms, which lack such a model and behave in a more habitual manner. Humans differ in the extent to which their decision making resembles that of modelbased or model-free algorithms; the degree of this resemblance is related to individual differences in compulsivity, and is also argued to be related to the ability to imagine and make decisions about the future. Here, we demonstrate that individuals who exhibit more model-based decision making tend to more frequently choose larger rewards later over smaller rewards sooner in an intertemporal choice task. However, surprisingly, model-free decision making was correlated with the specificity of personal future event narratives in an episodic future thinking task. Participants who provided more specific narratives had slower response times across all tasks, and may therefore have been more affected by time pressure in the reinforcement learning task, resulting in increased model-free decision making. We comment on the role of time pressure in behavioural tasks of the type used here. Future self-continuity, a construct conceptually related to imagining and making decisions about the future, was not found to be related to temporal discounting, model-based or model-free decision making, or episodic future thinking.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The reinforcement learning literature distinguishes between two classes of algorithms: model-based algorithms, which plan decisions on the basis of an internal model of the environment, and model-free algorithms, which use no such internal model and thus have no explicit representation of the long-term consequences of present actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sutton and Barto, 2018)</ref>. These classes of algorithms are used as models of planning and habit, respectively, in humans and other animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Daw et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dolan and Dayan, 2013)</ref>. The behaviour of model-based and model-free algorithms markedly diverges in tasks requiring an internal representation of the environment. One such task, the two-step task <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref>, has been used to explore the correlates of model-based and model-free decisions in humans. Using tasks such as this, model-free decision making is found to relate to disorders of compulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Voon et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, model-based decision making is found to rely on working memory <ref type="bibr">(Otto et al., 2013a,b)</ref>. However, many other variables have been implicated in human decision making and future-oriented cognition, and their relationship to reinforcement learning strategies is not always clear.</p><p>Reinforcement learning strategies, given that they involve explicit computation (or lack thereof) of future contingencies, have been argued to be related to temporal discounting, or the tendency to devalue future rewards as a function of their delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Odum, 2011)</ref>. Steep temporal discounting, in which the subjective value of a future reward drops rapidly with its delay, is implicated in a range of psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amlung et al., 2019)</ref>, particularly substance use disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amlung et al., 2017)</ref>. Various authors have argued the fast, habit-like response style characteristic of model-free decision making resembles the shortsighted, impulsive decision making characteristic of steep temporal discounting; likewise, that the slow, deliberative planning characteristic of model-based decision making resembles the forethought that characterizes shallow temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kinley et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Story et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McClure and Bickel, 2014)</ref>. However, the two are not synonymous. In principle, model-free algorithms aim to maximize long-run reward according to the same optimality criterion as model-based algorithms, and so are not definitionally more shortsighted <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sutton and Barto, 2018)</ref>. Indeed, empirical findings on the relationship between reinforcement learning strategies and temporal discounting have been mixed. Some work finds a correlation between model-based decision making and shallow temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>, whereas other work finds none <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Solway et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hunter et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>It has also been argued <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kinley et al., 2022;</ref>) that model-based reinforcement learning may be related to our ability to imagine events in the personal future. This ability, called episodic future thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Atance and O'Neill, 2001)</ref>, relies on a network of brain structures including the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addis et al., 2007)</ref>, which is also implicated in model-based learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Vikbladh et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Redish (2016)</ref> argues that a model-based deliberative process is manifest in both episodic future thinking in humans and the "vicarious trial and error" behaviour of rodents at decision points; at these locations, hippocampal place cells encode possible forward trajectories, suggestive of the simulation of possible action sequences via an internal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Johnson and Redish, 2007)</ref>. The specificity of episodic future thinking can be characterized quantitatively by the number of "internal" (event-specific) versus "external" (general) details in written or spoken narratives of future events (a method called "autobiographical interview" scoring; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Levine et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Renoult et al., 2020)</ref>; fewer "internal" details tend to be given by those with compromised hippocampal/medial temporal lobe integrity, as shown in comparisons between amnesics and controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rosenbaum et al., 2009)</ref> and between older and younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Levine et al., 2002)</ref>. Using such measures of episodic future thinking, and given its close connection to model-based reinforcement learning, we might expect to find a correlation between these two abilities.</p><p>Another construct related to both episodic future thinking and temporal discounting, but rarely studied alongside reinforcement learning strategies, is "future self-continuity", or the sense of connection to one's future self <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sedikides et al., 2023)</ref>. A number of studies (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hershfield, 2011)</ref> have found that greater future self-continuity is predictive of shallower temporal discounting. In adolescents, future self-continuity is correlated with specificity of episodic future thinking, and both independently predict shallow discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McCue et al., 2019)</ref>. It is unclear whether similar results would hold for adults. However, the process of episodic future thinking (as opposed to the trait-like tendency to generate specific and detailed future narratives) has been shown to reduce temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rösch et al., 2022)</ref> and increase future self-continuity (D'Argembeau and Jimenez, 2023) in adults.</p><p>Thus, model-based reinforcement learning, episodic future thinking, intertemporal choice, and future self-continuity are conceptually overlapping constructs in that they are all broadly related to the process of envisioning, considering, and assigning value to future outcomes. By examining the relationships between these variables empirically, we will be better able to understand the extent to which they either represent different expressions of the same basic processes or represent distinct facets of future-oriented cognition. The goal of the present study was to examine, for the first time to our knowledge, the four aforementioned constructs simultaneously and as trait variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>Data were collected from 456 McMaster University students who completed the study for credit in an undergraduate psychology course. The study was approved by the McMaster University Research Ethics Board. The experiment was programmed using jsPsych (De Leeuw, 2015; de Leeuw et al., 2023) and hosted on a web server that participants accessed from browsers on their own computers. Each task (described below) was administered on a different webpage with data saved separately. Given that tasks were presented in a random order and participants could withdraw from the experiment at any time, variable numbers of participants completed each task (final sample sizes for each task and each pair of tasks are summarized in the text below and in table 2). Analysis was performed using R v4.2.3 (R Core Team, 2023) and graphics were produced using ggplot2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Wickham, 2016)</ref>. Data and analysis code are available at https://osf.io/b9z8d/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Two-step task</head><p>We used a version of the two-step task ( <ref type="figure">fig. 1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daw et al., 2011)</ref> implemented for the web, the source code of which is openly available and described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kinley (2023)</ref>. In the task, the participant takes actions to move between abstract "states" in search of a reward. Each action is represented by a different visual token, and each state is recognizable by the combination of tokens displayed. In each state, the participants presses the "z" key to take the action corresponding to the left token and the "m" key to take the action corresponding to the right token (the order of tokens was randomized on each trial). In the first "step" of the task, the participants begins in state 1 and is presented with two actions. Each action leads preferentially (with a 70% chance) to a different state in the second "step", either state 2a or state 2b. That is, one action in state 1 will lead to state 2a with 70% probability and to state 2b with 30%; for the other action, these probabilities are reversed. Each of these two actions in states 2a and 2b (four possible actions in total) has a separate probability of leading to the reward state that drifts randomly and independently of each other action's probability. This means that continuous learning is required to perform well on the task, given that different second-step actions, available at different secondstep states, will be more desirable at different times.</p><p>To quantify model-based and model-free strategies, this method examines an individual's probability of repeating a first-step choice as a function of reward received on the previous trial and whether the previous transition was common or rare. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daw et al. (2011)</ref>, for a purely model-free agent, there is a simple main effect of previous reward: first-step actions that were rewarded are more likely to be repeated than those that were not rewarded. However, for a purely model-based agent, there is an interaction between reward and transition probability. If a first-step action led, via the less likely (30% probability) transition, to a second-step state where a reward was obtained, that action is, surprisingly, unlikely to be repeated; instead, a model-based agent uses its knowledge of the transition probabilities to take the opposite action in the first step, which will be more likely (with 70% probability) to lead to the same second-step state where reward was previously obtained. Empirically, humans on average display both a main effect of reward and an interaction between reward and transition on the probability of repeating the same firststep action, suggestive of a combination of model-based and model-free decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>To quantify the contributions of model-based and model-free decision making, we used logistic regression following <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Solway et al. (2017)</ref>, modelling the action repetition probability as a function of reward (coded 1 for reward and 0 for no reward), transition type (coded 1 for 70% probability and -1 for 30% probability), and their interaction. The regression coefficient for the main effect of reward was taken as a measure of model-free decision making, while <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Schematic representation of the two-step task <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref>. Rectangles represent states and circles represent actions. Each action in the first state leads to one of the second-step states with probability 70% and the other with probability 30%. Each of the four possible actions that can be taken from step 2 has a probability of leading to a reward (represented by a gold coin) that drifts independently of each other action's probability.</p><p>the regression coefficient for the interaction between reward and transition was taken as a measure of model-based decision making. The distributions of these participant-level statistics contained clear outliers, which were removed on the basis of the boxplot criteria. Namely, inliers were identified as lying between the 25th percentile minus 150 percent of the interquartile range, and the 75th percentile plus 150 percent of the interquartile range. This reduced the sample size for the two-step task from 415 participants to 358.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Test of episodic future thinking</head><p>To obtain written narratives of personal future events, we used the Test of Episodic Future Thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hallford et al., 2019</ref>). Briefly, this task involves presenting participants with a series of cue words (5 positive, 5 negative, 5 neutral) and asking them to construct and describe in writing a future event in response to each. 394 participants completed the task, but removing from the data participants who left any event blank reduced the sample size to 318. Scoring of this task usually begins with human raters assigning a binary label of specific or non-specific to each event. A participant's score on the test is their total number of specific events, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 15. Manual scoring was deemed infeasible in the current study given the large number of narratives (4770). To address the scale of the data, we used the automated method introduced by van Genugten and Schacter (2022), based on the DistilBERT transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sanh et al., 2019)</ref>, to estimate the number of internal and external details in each event. To determine whether these estimates were suitable for the current task, they were compared against 318 manual ratings (one event from each participant, rated by author IK). Receiver operating characteristic analysis as implemented by the pROC package for R <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Robin et al., 2011)</ref> was used to determine how well ratings of specific vs nonspecific could be differentiated using automated scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Temporal discounting task</head><p>To measure temporal discounting, we used a monetary choice task in which participants made a series of hypothetical choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed rewards (our particular implementation of this task has been described in detail elsewhere . The value of the delayed reward was drawn on each trial from a uniform distribution between $180 and $220, and its delay could be 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 2 years, or 10 years. The value of the immediate reward, as a proportion of the delayed reward, could be 1 15 , 2 15 , etc., up to 14 15 . Each possible combination of delay and proportional immediate reward value was used, resulting in 70 trials for each participant.</p><p>For each participant, a range of 6 possible discount functions was fit to the data, as summarized in table 1 (columns 1 and 2), following the method introduced in . Maximum likelihood estimation, via the Nelder-Mead method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nelder and Mead, 1965)</ref> as implemented in R's optim() function, was used to fit the following model to each participant's decisions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (I) = σ γ σ −1 v I v D − σ −1 [f (t)]</formula><p>where P (I) is the probability of selecting the immediate reward, v I is the value of the immediate reward, v D is the value of the delayed reward, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f (t) is the discount function (see table 1, column 2). σ[x] = (1 + exp[−x]) −1 is the logistic function and σ −1 [x] = ln x 1−</formula><p>x is its inverse, the logit function. Using the logit function results in improved model fit compared to conventional nonlinear logistic regression . For each participant, we used the discount function f (t) that provided the best model fit (per the Akaike information criterion; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akaike, 1974)</ref>.</p><p>To compare discounting between different discount functions, we computed the delay at which a delayed reward loses 50% of its subjective value (ED50; Origin f (t) ED50</p><p>Samuelson <ref type="formula">(</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Candidate discount functions tested for each participant, along with formulae for computing ED50, the delay at which a reward's value is discounted by 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Yoon and Higgins, 2008)</ref>. For the dual exponential discount function of Van den Bos and McClure (2013), there is no closed-form equation for ED50. Instead, ED50 was computed numerically, by finding the integer value of t for which f (t) was closest to 0.5. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Yoon and Higgins, 2008)</ref>, rounded to the nearest day and log-transformed. Formulae for computing ED50 are listed in table 1 (column 3). ED50 values were restricted to be greater than 1 and less than 36500 (the latter being the approximate number of days in a lifetime of 100 years, to ensure that data were consistent with the timescale of the human lifespan). This reduced the sample size for the delay discounting task from from 421 to 364. ED50 values are plotted in figure 2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 (1+kt) s 2 1 s −1 k Mazur (1987) 1 1+kt 1 k Rachlin (2006) 1 1+kt s 1 k 1 s</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Future self-continuity questionnaire</head><p>To measure self-continuity, we used a web-based implementation of the Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sokol and Serper, 2019)</ref>. The initial sample size for this questionnaire was 424; removing any participant's data if they did not respond to all 10 questions resulted in a sample size of 405. The questionnaire consists of 10 questions querying 3 dimensions of future self-continuity: the vividness with which the future self can be imagined, felt similarity to the future self, and positive feelings toward the future self. Scores on these factors were computed via confirmatory factor analysis using the lavaan package for R <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>. We also computed a total self-continuity score by averaging responses to all questions, given that this total score has been found to correlate more strongly with temporal discounting than any subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sokol and Serper, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Distribution of ED50 scores. Values were constrained to be greater than 1 and less than 36500.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>For the discriminability of specific vs non-specific manual ratings using automated autobiographical interview scores, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.7 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3)</ref>, indicating acceptable discrimination (Mandrekar, 2010). To obtain a future thinking specificity score for each participant, we simply took their average log-plus-one-transformed score from the automated method. The distribution of specificity scores for the final dataset is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 4</ref>.</p><p>Following the validation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sokol and Serper (2019)</ref>, our confirmatory factor analysis allowed error covariance among items 1, 3, and 4 and between items 5 and 7 due to conceptual overlaps between these groups of questions. As in the original validation, adding these 4 residual covariance terms increased model fit from barely adequate (CFI = 0.93; SRMR = 0.052) to good (CFI = 0.975; SRMR = 0.035). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> summarizes the variance-covariance structure of the latent variables in the final confirmatory factor analysis.</p><p>There was a negative correlation between measures of model-based and model-free strategies (r(356) = −0.226, p &lt; 0.001). Model-free scores were significantly correlated with median response times for both steps of the twostep task (r(356) = 0.246 for step 1; r(356) = 0.201 for step 2; p &lt; 0.001 in both cases). No similar correlations occurred between model-based scores and response times (p &gt; 0.1 for both steps). In a multivariate linear model, step 2 response time was not a significant predictor of model-free scores (p = 0.583) 1.</p></div>

Thus, participants who responded more slowly in the first step of the two-step task tended to exhibit more model-free decision making. Model-based decision making was correlated with log ED50 scores (r(301) = 0.186, p = 0.001; figure 5). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between model-free decision making and ED50 scores (r(301) = 0.02, p = 0.67). Thus, participants who exhibited a greater degree of goal-directed behaviour also exhibited shallower temporal discounting.</p><p>Unexpectedly, model-based scores were not correlated with future thinking specificity scores (r(260) = −0.058, p = 0.35). However, model-free scores showed a significant correlation with future thinking specificity (r(260) = 0.188, p = 0.002; figure 6). To explore this result further (given the correlation between model-free scores and response times on the two-step task), a multivariate linear model was constructed in which mean internal details were predicted by model-free scores and median response times on step 1 of the two-step task. In this model, response times were a significant predictor (p &lt; 0.001) while model-free scores were not (p = 0.08). Interestingly, internal details were also correlated with median response times on both the temporal discounting task (r(265) = 0.293, p &lt; 0.001) as well as the future self-continuity questionnaire (r(294) = 0.216, p &lt; 0.001). Thus, participants that produced more specific future narratives tended to give slower responses across all other experimental tasks. In contrast, future thinking specificity scores were uncorrelated with ED50 (r(265) = 0.07, p = 0.261). Similarly, neither the total self-continuity score nor any of the subscales was correlated with future thinking specificity scores (all p &gt; 0.1). Moreover, neither the total self-continuity score nor any of the subscales was correlated with ED50 (all p &gt; 0.6, uncorrected).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>As expected, we found that participants who adopted a more model-based reinforcement learning strategy also tended to exhibit shallower temporal discounting, lending support to the notion of a relationship between these two constructs. To our knowledge, only one other study has found such a correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>, while two others have not <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hunter et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Solway et al., 2017)</ref>. The reason for this may simply be that the effect is quite small. Remarkably, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Shenhav et al. (2017)</ref> found a correlation of −0.183, identical but opposite in sign to the correlation observed in the current study, between model-based scores and steepness of temporal discounting (computed as the logarithm of the best-fitting k value from the hyperbolic discount function; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mazur, 1987)</ref>. A correlation of 0.183 implies a minimum sample size of 232 to obtain statistical power of 0.8 at α = 0.05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kohn et al., 2021)</ref>. While the current sample size of 303 and the sample size of 265 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Shenhav et al. (2017)</ref> are adequate, those of Solway et al. (2017) and Hunter et al. (2018) (168 and 32, respectively) are not. Thus, the magnitude of the relationship between model-based reinforcement learning and temporal discounting appears to be quite small.</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, model-based decision making and shallow temporal discounting are conceptually related but not synonymous. Both model-based and model-free algorithms attempt to satisfy an optimality criterion in which a discount factor γ determines the relative importance of more immediate rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sutton and Barto, 2018)</ref>. In principle, we could create a model-based agent for which γ is low (resulting in steep discounting) and a model-free agent for which γ is high (resulting in shallow discounting). Nonetheless, in practice, differences in temporal discounting can emerge between simulated model-based and model-free agents with the same optimality criterion . This may be because model-free reinforcement occurs over a relatively short chain of actions preceding a reward. If an agent must choose a "wait" action over many successive time steps to receive a delayed reward, the learning signal from this reward may not propagate back far enough to significantly reinforce the earliest "wait" actions, resulting in steep discounting.</p><p>While a relationship between model-based decision making and intertemporal patience has some basis in existing theory, there is, to our knowledge, nothing in the literature to suggest a relationship between model-free decision making and specificity of future thinking. To explain this surprising result, we can first note that participants with higher future thinking specificity scores <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Correlation between model-based scores from the two-step task and ED50 scores from the temporal discounting task.</p><p>exhibited longer response times on every other experimental task. Thus, these participants seemed to have a generally unhurried response style that lent itself to both slower responses and the production of more detailed narratives. Moreover, participants with longer response times in the two-step task tended to have higher model-free scores. Multivariate regression suggested that the correlation between model-free scores and future thinking specificity was in fact spurious, an artefact of the confounding correlation of both variables with response times. Thus, it seems that the true explanandum is the fact that longer response times on the two-step task were associated with higher model-free scores.</p><p>Previous research has found that time pressure reduces the depth of modelbased planning (where a depth of 0 corresponds to simple model-free responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Keramati et al., 2016)</ref>). The 2-second limit to make a response in the two-step task <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref> may have constituted time pressure for participants predisposed to responding more slowly. These participants may, in response to this time pressure, have relied on a more model-free strategy. This possibility raises interesting questions about the importance of time pressure in tasks such as the ones used here: what is the relationship between an individual's ability to perform some behaviour (e.g., describing a specific future event or making a model-based decision) under time pressure and their tendency to do so in the absence of time pressure? It may be that introducing time pressure can reveal the component processes underlying behaviours, e.g., showing that individuals with slower processing speed or poorer executive function are less able to perform them under time pressure (similar to the approach taken by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Otto et al., 2013b)</ref>. In contrast, time pressure may be less relevant when an <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Correlation between model-free scores from the two-step task and specificity scores from the episodic future thinking task.</p><p>individual's tendency to spontaneously engage in a behaviour is of interestfor example, an individual who struggles to imagine future events under time pressure may nonetheless tend do so in the absence of time pressure. This tendency may, in turn, be related to other variables-for example, future-oriented mind-wandering is associated with more positive mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ruby et al., 2013</ref>). An interesting direction for future research may be to determine whether a correlation appears between model-based reinforcement learning and episodic future thinking when both abilities are measured under time pressure (e.g., using a future fluency task in which participants generate as many future events as possible within a short time; D'Argembeau et al., 2010). Similarly, it seems possible that removing the 2-second response time ceiling from the two-step task might reveal a correlation between the tendency to engage in model-based decision making and the tendency to imagine more specific future episodes, when both are measured in the absence of time pressure.</p><p>Our lack of findings with respect to the future self-continuity scale diverges from the literature, where this construct is found to relate closely to temporal discounting (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hershfield, 2011)</ref>. Existing research has largely used an adapted version of the Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aron et al., 1992)</ref>, in which participants select a degree of overlap between two circles that best represents their relationship to their future self. The FSCQ instead uses a series of conventional Likert scales, and its subscales and total score are at most only moderately correlated (r = 0.46) with measures of future selfcontinuity based on the IOS scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sokol and Serper, 2019)</ref>. Thus, it may be that the visual metaphor employed by IOS-type scales is particularly effective at measuring a form of self-continuity that relates more closely to temporal discounting. Recently-developed web-based implementations of measures like this <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kinley and van Vugt, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beranek and Castillo, 2022)</ref> could enable future research to explore this possibility.</p><p>The goal of the present work was to examine relationships between a range of constructs related to future-oriented cognition in order to explore the basic factors that are shared across these. Overall, our findings affirm some of our initial predictions but raise interesting questions in disconfirming others. It appears that there is indeed a straightforward relationship between model-based decision making and temporal discounting, albeit a rather weak one. This suggests that a more deliberative, less habitual style of decision making lends itself to intertemporal patience. On the other hand, the unexpected correlation between model-free decision making and episodic future thinking was, on closer inspection, an artefact of time pressure in the reinforcement learning task. Thus, the relationship between model-based decision making and episodic future thinking remains an open question; their shared reliance on the ability or perhaps the tendency to mentally simulate future contingencies may yet be revealed if both constructs are measured with time pressure or both without. Such work will bring us closer to understanding the basic processes underlying seemingly disparate measures of future-oriented cognition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Receiver operating characteristic curve showing the ability of the episodic specificity scores from the automated method to discriminate between cases manually rated as specific vs general.
