    "justification": "After viewing the six sources, \"participants placed a bid corresponding to the maximum cost they would be willing to pay in order to see the extra information (BDM auction \u2014 between 0 cents and 5 cents)\". The authors repeatedly analyse how this bid size indexes \"participants' desire for more information\", treating bid magnitude as the measure of information-seeking."
