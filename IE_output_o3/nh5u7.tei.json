    ],
    "justification": "The paper explains that \"we had younger and older adults complete a modified two-stage Markov decision task\" in order \"to determine if reducing the demands on representing a mental model of the state transitions may lead older adults to engage in greater model-based decision-making,\" showing the task is used to measure model-based control."

      "Modified two-stage Markov decision task"
    ],
    "justification": "Throughout the introduction the authors contrast model-based and model-free strategies and note that the same modified two-stage Markov task \"involves learning associations between choice actions and rewards\" typical of model-free behavior, indicating the task also indexes model-free decision-making."

    "justification": "They note that \"the FRN has been suggested to be sensitive to negative prediction errors during reinforcement learning tasks (signed prediction errors; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2002; Walsh & Anderson, 2012),\" directly connecting FRN amplitudes to RPEs."
