    "justification": "The authors state that they \"fit [the model] to data from the sustained attention to response task (SART \u2026) whose repetitive nature produces a mixture of more strongly evidence-based decisions and rhythmic, time-based responses,\" indicating the task is used to capture lapses of sustained attention / mind-wandering."
