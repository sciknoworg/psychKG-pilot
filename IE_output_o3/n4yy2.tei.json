    "justification": "The article notes that activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex \"correlates with the overall subjective value of an option\" (Clithero & Rangel, 2014), indicating that vmPFC activation is used to index or measure the construct of subjective value."

    "justification": "It states that \"The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)... seems to calculate the return-on-investment of the effort required by a task,\" showing that dACC activation is treated as a neural measure of perceived effort costs."
