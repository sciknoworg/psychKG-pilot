			<abstract>
				<p>Humans hold beliefs about others&apos; preferences, which can inform a range of decisions including those involving risk. However, the accuracy of these beliefs, and the weight placed on our own preferences versus someone else&apos;s for a decision that impacts both individuals, remains poorly understood. It is particularly relevant to characterize the role of beliefs about peer preferences in decision making during adolescence, a phase of the lifespan where peers take on a heightened importance and have an outsize impact on risky decisions. Using a sample of typically developing friend dyads (N=128, 12.0-22.8 years), we collected fully mutual data on decision preferences in an economic risky decision making task with safe (certain) and risky (more variable outcomes) options that varied in their expected value. We modeled the adjudication between one&apos;s own and friend&apos;s outcome with a modified expected utility model and characterized age-related changes with Generalized Additive Models. On average, participants overestimated their friend&apos;s preference for risky choices across the full span of ages that were tested. In addition, we analyzed age-related changes in decision making for risky choice scenarios in which one of the two individuals must receive a nonpreferred option, both when following their genuine preferences and when taking the perspective of their friend. Participants aged 16-22 years weighed their friend&apos;s outcome more, and earned less, when taking their friend&apos;s perspective compared to their own. Young adults were willing to shield their friends from unwanted risks even when no monetary incentive was on the line. Together, these findings highlight late adolescence to early adulthood as a heightened period for prosocial considerations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The manner in which peers shape risky decision making has long been a topic of interest in developmental science and psychology more generally (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreoni &amp; Miller, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gardner &amp; Steinberg, 2005)</ref>. After all, making a risky decision often has consequences not only for oneself, but also for the peers one surrounds oneself with.</p><p>While peers could influence risky decisions in an overt manner through active encouragement <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Powers et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Simons-Morton et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wagemaker et al., 2020)</ref>, they could also shape decisions in more subtle ways. A multitude of motives may drive an individual to modify their expressed preferences when peers are involved, such as concerns of peer evaluation and social reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Braams et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rodman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Somerville, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">van Hoorn et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Layered beneath the overt ways that peers could shape decisions about risk are a set of beliefs about the preferences and desires of one's peer. Beliefs about peers' risk preferences could shape risky choices involving the peer, even when those assumptions are miscalibrated relative to their actual preferences. The present study measures the degree of (mis)calibration of beliefs about peer preferences and characterizes how they are utilized in computations surrounding decision contexts where self-and friend-preferences might be at odds with each other (e.g., when a choice option is scarce and believed to be desired by both parties, and one must decide between keeping it or giving it to their peer). Understanding how beliefs about peer preference gets incorporated into the risky choice computation process can help shed light on the higher-level question of motives behind why peers influence decision making differentially across development.</p><p>The dynamic social landscape during adolescence, a developmental period beginning around the onset of physical puberty and ending around the assumption of adult roles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Spear, 2000)</ref>, paired with ongoing cognitive development, makes it a phase uniquely suited to study how beliefs about peer preferences are incorporated in these decisions. One cognitive mechanism required in weighing the pros and cons of prosocial decisions is perspective taking, which continues to develop through late adolescence <ref type="bibr">(Dumontheil et al., 2010)</ref>. Another is the incorporation of intentionality and social contexts in strategic fairness decisions (e.g., preferring fairness in order to maximize payoff, in case unfair offers get rejected), which increases with age in adolescence as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Güroğlu et al., 2009)</ref>. Making choices that maximize a peer's outcome at the expense of one's own may require cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Steinbeis et al., 2012)</ref>, which also increases with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Somerville &amp; Casey, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Thus, various</ref> processes that lay the foundation of the computations involved in these decisions develop well into adolescence, making it an opportune period to study risky decisions involving differing outcomes for self and peers, as information on age-related changes would contribute to a more thorough account of how beliefs about peer preferences shape individuals' decisions.</p><p>We predict that during adolescence, individuals will weigh potential outcomes of one's choice for their peer more heavily relative to their own. Specific age-related patterns characterizing the development of prosocial behaviors (voluntary acts intended to benefit others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eisenberg et al., 2005)</ref>) have not been consistent in work to date (see <ref type="bibr">Do et al., 2017 for a review)</ref>. Some have argued this is due to discrepancies in the social contexts evoked by varying experimental paradigms, as prosocial behavior is increasingly sensitive to social contexts with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Güroğlu et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this variability, consequences for peers are likely to encourage adolescents' prosocial risk taking on several grounds. Peers become the dominant social group that adolescents spend most of their time with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown, 2004)</ref>. Adolescents are also especially sensitive to peer rejection and value peer acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Masten et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rodman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Silk et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, in addition to the developmental patterns of the aforementioned cognitive processes, the importance of peer relationships during adolescence also renders this age window particularly rich with age-dependent variances in individual's beliefs about peer's preferences in risky decisions.</p><p>The present study examines how implicit assumptions about peers' preferences impact risky choice in a sample that spans from early adolescence to early adulthood.</p><p>We collected mutual data from real-life friend dyads about their own wishes, and their predictions of their peers' preferences. These predictions were used as input in a computational model developed specifically for contexts that induce conflicting self-and friend-interests, permitting analyses on how one chooses differently from their own versus their peer's perspective. Peer dyads in this study were age-and gender-matched friends in real life rather than strangers to evoke the possibility of genuine relational motives. The study aims to characterize three specific facets of how implicit beliefs on peer preferences change across age:</p><p>1) The accuracy of beliefs about risk preferences of the peer.</p><p>2) Whether participants would like their peer to prioritize themselves or the participant's own wishes.</p><p>3) When participants are explicitly told that their peer's preference conflicts with their own, whether participants were willing to relinquish their original preferred option so their friend could receive it.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited in same-sex peer dyads who identified one another as friends (N=128, age range: 11.98-22.82 years, N=37 adolescent pairs, ages 11.98-17.46 years; 18 pairs female and 19 pairs male; N=27 young adult pairs; ages 18.16-22.82 years, 14 pairs female, 13 pairs male). One participant from the adolescent group identified as gender non-conforming and was the peer partner of a male-identifying participant, and one participant from the adult group identified as transgender male and was the peer partner of a male participant. Male and female pairs were distributed evenly across the age range (logistic regression with age predicting gender, <ref type="bibr">B=-0.014, p=.789)</ref> and pairs had an average age difference of 0.46 years (min=0.01, max=1.39, SD=0.33). The race/ethnicity composition was 15.6% Asian, 6.3% Black or African American, 10.2% two or more races, 0.8% other, 0.8% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 66.4% White. The distribution of average parental education level as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES) was not related to age <ref type="bibr">(linear regression, B=-0.016, p=.439)</ref>, indicating SES is balanced across age. Participants were excluded if they did not have access to a computer with a camera, and if they were diagnosed with learning disability or received special services at school. Participants provided informed written consent/assent, and parents/caregivers of minors gave written permission for their participation. The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Harvard University approved this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risky Decision Making Task</head><p>Participants completed an economic decision making task consisting of different choice options varying in monetary payout and odds of winning, which has been used in previous studies to quantify individuals' risk preferences in adult <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chung et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sip et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tymula et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Powers et al., 2018</ref> and adolescent samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Tymula et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Powers et al., 2018</ref>. On each trial, participants selected between two choice options displayed on the left and right sides of the screen <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) varying in risk: a) a safe option "100% chance of winning $5" and b) a risky lottery option (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 90% probability of winning <ref type="bibr">[$5, $10, $20, $30, $40, $50, $100]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tymula et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Powers et al., 2018</ref> depicted with a pie chart indicating the odds of earning the amount displayed or earning $0. The safe and risky options were counterbalanced to appear on the left and right sides of the screen at equal frequency. Each probability was paired with each amount totaling 35 trials per condition, with the order of trials randomized. There were 5 conditions in total (for details, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and section "Condition" below). Participants indicated their choice in self-paced timing by pressing one of two keyboard buttons, at which point the trial ended; there was no immediate feedback on the outcome of the decision.</p><p>Participants were instructed that they and their friend would receive a fixed percentage of the cumulative amount of money they earned through their choices as a bonus in all conditions except for the Friend Predicted condition, with a computer simulating the chosen lotteries to determine earnings. Participants in the "friend" role were paid the same percentage in all conditions except for the Friend Predicted and Desired Opposite conditions (i.e., conditions where participants' choices were conjecture) based on choices made for them by the participant in the primary decision The questions they were asked are displayed below. The safe option is always 100% chance of winning $5, and the risky option is the pie chart. In this example trial, the risky option is 75% chance of winning $10 and 25% chance of winning $0. In the A) Baseline condition, participants indicated their own risk preferences. In the B) Friend Predicted condition, participants predicted what their friend will choose. In the C) Opposite condition, participants view "opposing" choice options and select whether they or their friend will receive their preferred option, and in the (C) Desired Opposite condition, participants indicate what they would like their friend to choose. Finally, in the D) Preference Revealed condition, participants first were shown friend's actual preference in the yellow box, and then were asked to choose whether they or their friend will receive the friend's preferred option. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditions</head><p>Baseline: Participants saw the graphics in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref> while they answered the question: "What do YOU choose?" ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). The Baseline condition is meant to capture participants' baseline risk preferences.</p><p>Friend Predicted: Participants saw the same graphics as Baseline but instead answered the question: "What do you think your FRIEND will choose?" ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>). The Friend Predicted condition is meant to capture participants' beliefs about their friend's risk preferences.</p><p>As both members in a dyad took on the role of decision maker and friend, contrasting these two conditions permits analysis on the accuracy of predicted risk preferences for friends.</p><p>Opposite: Participants selected an outcome for themselves with the knowledge that the unselected option would apply to their friend ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>), answering the question: "What do YOU choose?" ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>). The Opposite condition required participants to choose between keeping their preferred option or assigning their preferred option to their friend.</p><p>Desired Opposite: Participants saw the same graphics as in the Opposite condition but instead were asked to imagine the screen from the friend's perspective and answered the question: "What do you want your friend to choose?" ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>).</p><p>This condition served two purposes. First, participants are shown these responses in the next condition (Preference Revealed) as an explicit indicator of their friend's preference. Second, contrasting participants choices in this condition with the Opposite Condition permitted analysis of whether participants preferred that their friend be generous to them (i.e., give the participant their preferred option) or whether participants thought their friend should be generous to themselves (i.e., assign the participant's preferred option to themself). Participants were told "later on in the study, <ref type="bibr">[FRIEND NAME]</ref> will see what you wanted her to choose."</p><p>Preference Revealed: Participants saw the same choices as in the Opposite condition (twice due to the observation manipulation, which gives us two opportunities to see whether the original preferences were relinquished) over Zoom. On each trial, they saw the text "your friend wants you to choose: " and a yellow box indicating their friend's actual preference (which they indicated in the Opposite condition with themselves as the decision maker). Then they made their choices, answering the question: "What do YOU choose?" ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment of Age</head><p>Because risk attitudes have been found to follow a nonlinear pattern of agerelated change from childhood to adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Casey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cauffman et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Figner et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Galvan et al., 2007)</ref>, we adopted an exploratory data driven approach with analyses that are sensitive to nonlinear age related changes. Specifically, we fit generalized additive models (GAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hastie &amp; Tibshirani, 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, 1990</ref>) using the gam function from the mgcv package (v1.8.38, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wood, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Wood, , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wood, , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wood, , 2017</ref> to examine the effect of age as a continuous predictor on the dependent measures.</p><p>To compare the age pattern for different levels of a categorical variable, GAM fits a nonlinear function for each level of a categorical variable (factor smooth interaction)</p><p>without providing a direct statistical test for the interaction between the smoothed variable and the categorical predictor of interest. Therefore, we used the plot_diff function from the itsadug package <ref type="bibr">(v 2.4, van Rij et al., 2022)</ref> to inspect the relative difference between fit estimates of each pair of conditions (i.e. Friend Predicted vs.</p><p>Baseline, Desired Opposite vs. Opposite, odds of relinquishing safe options vs. risky options for trials with conflicting preferences and for a subset of these trials with equal EV for safe and risky options) and compute 95% simultaneous CIs around it. Age bands where the simultaneous confidence interval (CI) did not contain zero are interpreted as periods of significant differences between the conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Fitting</head><p>We fit a probabilistic choice model with two free parameters to each participant's choices for Baseline and Friend Predicted conditions to quantify individual risk attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gilaie-Dotan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Levy &amp; Glimcher, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Levy et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levy et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>As in Powers et al. <ref type="formula">2018</ref>, we modeled the expected utility of each option with a power utility function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ! (1)</formula><p>Where v is the amount of money on a given choice and p the probability associated with winning that dollar amount. a (Alpha) is the estimated parameter of interest for risk attitude, where risk is defined as outcome variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Weber et al., 2004)</ref>, i.e., the choice with a wider range of potential outcomes is the riskier outcome. In the present task, the choice depicted with a pie chart (i.e., two possible outcomes with varying potential financial impact) is the risky choice. Alpha &lt; 1 indicates an agent is risk averse with a concave utility function, preferring the safe option to a risky option with equal expected value, calculated as the dollar amount multiplied by the probability of winning that option.</p><p>The Opposite and Desired Opposite conditions required an adaptation of the expected utility model to incorporate the utility of the unchosen option assigned to the friend relative to that of the chosen option for oneself. This adjudication was reflected in the parameter w (Weightfriend): With both the original and revised model, we fit each trial within a condition to a logistic function that computes the probability of the participant choosing the risky option on that trial given the expected utility of the safe and the risky option, with a maximum likelihood procedure:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= (1 − ) "#$% "#$% ! + 7 %&amp;'#() %&amp;'#() ! !"#$%&amp; 8<label>(</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">( ℎ ) = 1 1 + exp C 7 "*%# − &amp;'"+, 8E</formula><p>(3)</p><p>Where EUsafe is the expected utility of the safe option and EUrisky is the expected utility of the risky option. Beta is the inverse decision noise.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>). An example of conflicting preferences would be I assign the safe option to myself in the Opposite condition while my friend assigned the safe option to themselves in their Desired Opposite condition (i.e., they wanted me to assign the safe option to them and the risky option to myself, contrary to my preference). Then, we evaluated in Preference Revealed condition, when they encounter these trials again and were made aware of their friend's wishes, whether they would relinquish their original preference to accommodate their friend's preference (coded as 1) or not (coded as 0). In contrast to all other analyses that started with N=128 participants, the Preference Revealed condition started with usable data from N=123 participants (3 participants failed the comprehension checks and did not call the experimenter, and 1 additional pair that had technical issues resulting in data loss, were excluded).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2A)</ref>. Next, we examined the directionality of participants' relinquishing their preferred options to accommodate their friend's preferences. Are individuals more likely to accommodate their friends when it entails switching from an originally preferred risky option to a non-preferred safe option, or from an originally preferred safe option to a non-preferred risky option? Overall, people were more likely to relinquish their original preference if it entailed giving up their originally preferred safe option than if it required relinquishing their originally preferred risky option (Mean probability of relinquishing when originally preferred safe vs. risky option: 0.32 vs. 0.28, <ref type="bibr">SE=0.09,</ref><ref type="bibr">p&lt;.001)</ref>. There was a significant age-related difference between 19.9-22.8 years old, where people were more likely to relinquish their originally preferred safe option and receive friends' undesired risky option, compared to switching in the opposite direction ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).  We found a significant age window between 19.8 and 21.6 years where individuals were more likely to relinquish their preferred safe option to their friend and receive the equal-EV risky option themselves instead than switching in the opposite direction ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4)</ref>. We infer that when the potential for monetary gain is held equal, participants from this age range adjusted away from their preferred level of risk aversion because they wanted to shield their friends from unwanted risks. Odds of relinquishing preferred option More when originally preferred "safe"</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Simulated Earnings</head><p>More when originally preferred "risky"</p><p>quantify the degree to which these beliefs influence risky choice, we position ourselves to identify how these beliefs shape risky choice across adolescence. We found that participants --regardless of age --slightly overestimated their friend's risk preference. In a social context that entailed adjudicating one's own outcome against one's friend's, people on average, and mid-late adolescents and young adults in particular, altered their own risky choice behavior when taking their peer's perspective in a direction that downweighed their own utility relative to the peer's and earned less than when taking their own perspective. When participants were explicitly made aware of their peer's conflicting preferences, young adults were more likely to relinquish their preferred safe option even when there were no potential monetary gains. Taken together, these findings reveal how, in addition to overt ways peers may shape adolescent risky choice, belief-based mechanisms are differentially important across adolescence in shaping risky decisions. Prosocial strategies that reflect utilization of more sources of information and more complex underlying motives emerge through the transition from adolescence to early adulthood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Miscalibrated beliefs about peers' risk preferences</head><p>The current study collected mutual data on risk preferences, which permitted quantification of the degree of calibration between the actual vs. believed risk preferences of each member of a dyad. Results showed that participants overestimated their friends' risk preferences. This was consistent across the age range from early adolescence to early adulthood. Overestimating peers' risk preference could amplify risk taking by creating a miscalibrated target. Given the special value adolescents place on social acceptance and avoiding rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Masten et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rodman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Silk et al., 2012)</ref>, their desire to assimilate to higher status peers (homophily, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brechwald &amp; Prinstein, 2011)</ref> combined with the tendency to overestimate how risk seeking their friends are could motivate them to "overshoot" on their own risky behavior. Indeed, it has been argued that adolescents' heightened risk taking does not stem from their judging risky scenarios as less risky than other age groups, but rather their propensity to align their assessment of riskiness with their peer's <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Knoll et al., 2015)</ref>. This potential mechanism could explain many real-life cases of homophily in adolescent health risk behavior. For instance, perceived peer substance use, in adolescents aged 10-15 years, predicted with the extent and onset of their own consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(D'Amico &amp; McCarthy, 2006)</ref>, and having friends that smoke or drink strongly predicts these behaviors in oneself in 11-18 year olds <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Loke &amp; Mak, 2013)</ref>. Our result extends this line of work by highlighting how the target of homophily may deviate from reality and thereby inflate levels of risk seeking.</p><p>The lack of age-related differences in the degree of miscalibration was somewhat unexpected, as we had imagined adolescence to be a time of heightened susceptibility to miscalibration based on prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brechwald &amp; Prinstein, 2011</ref>) more so than young adults. However, there are hints from the intervention literature suggesting similar miscalibrations could influence engagement of health risk behaviors in young adulthood.</p><p>In college students, who have been shown to overestimate peer heavy alcohol consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Perkins &amp; Berkowitz, 1986)</ref>, normative feedback --explicitly showing individuals the base rates for drinking behavior (the actual norm on campus) in conjunction with one's own actual and perceived drinking level to facilitate comparison of one's own behavior relative to norms --is an effective strategy to curb heavy drinking behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lewis &amp; Neighbors, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Neighbors et al., 2004)</ref>. This implies that health risk behavior in young adults may also arise from a miscalibrated belief that "everyone is doing it." The present study extends our understanding of peer influence by highlighting how miscalibrated beliefs about others' risk preferences could be a covert route of peer influence in adolescents and young adults alike. Additionally, it indicates the potential of normative approaches in helping them refrain from excessive risk taking by informing them what the actual "typical" behavior is in their social group.</p><p>Wanting your friend to prioritize their own wishes</p><p>The present study constructed "opposite" decision contexts in which participants made risky choices that assigned risky and safe options to themselves and their peer.</p><p>Moreover, participants made these choices from their own perspective and from their friend's ("What do you want your friend to choose?"). These scenarios set up a potential conflict needing adjudication, between wishing one's friend would assign themselves the option they prefer (i.e., prioritizing their own wishes when they are the decision maker) and hoping the friend would assign oneself one's favored option. To evaluate the strategies employed across our developmental sample, we created and validated a computational model that quantified the weight placed on the friend's outcomes relative to one's own. Comparing trials in which participants decided "as themselves" versus the decisions they would like their friend to make (henceforth, decisions from friend's perspective), permitted evaluation of how individuals wish their friend to behave if it were the friend's turn to allocate the options.</p><p>We found that mid-late adolescents and young adults, when deciding from their friend's perspective, assigned more weight to the friend's outcome, consistent with a strategy of letting the friend choose what is best for themselves, even though this entails decreased earnings for oneself. By contrast, individuals of younger ages showed similar choices across the two decision frames, indicating consistency in wanting to keep one's preferred option, regardless of deciding from whose perspective. This age-related shift in strategy, shown by the age-related decrease in earnings and increased weights participants placed on their friend's utility relative to their own, suggests a dynamic period of developing prosocial considerations from mid-late adolescence to early adulthood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Güroğlu et al. (2014)</ref> has shown that social context information takes on an increasingly important role in shaping prosocial behavior in four age groups (9-, 12-, 15-, 18-year-olds). Additionally, strategic prosocial behaviors (in which being prosocial is at least partly motivated by maximizing one's own gains) has been shown to increase with age during adolescence, supported through development in perspective taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Crone &amp; Achterberg, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Güroğlu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Overgaauw et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Steinbeis et al., 2012)</ref>. We extend this body of work by suggesting one of the mechanisms behind this behavioral shift in older adolescents and young adults may arise from increased weighing of peer outcome relative to one's own.</p><p>Since our choice set makes it, on average, advantageous in terms of EV to pick the risky option for oneself, the fact that participants, on average, earned less but were not differentially risk seeking when deciding from their friend's perspective compared to their own could signal more "irrational" choices were made, such that the risk seeking level stayed constant, but the risks taken were disadvantageous, causing decreased earnings. However, maximizing one's utility necessitated considerations on both monetary and social fronts so this shift could be strategic in gaining social benefits. As participants knew the decisions in this condition would be seen by their friend later, we hesitate to attribute the motive behind age-related increase in weighing the friend's outcome to be purely selfless (i.e., wanting to maximize friends' outcome at their own expense). Rather, reputational concerns could also be motivating this shift in behavior.</p><p>Fairness concerns could also be at play; from the decision maker's point of view, fairness could look like: "I prioritize myself when I am the decision maker, and I want my friend to prioritize themselves when they are the decision maker. It's fair we both prioritize ourselves." This could happen in parallel with reputational motivations as well, as being fair can be strategic in gaining reputational benefits, and strategic fairness in decisions increases with age in adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Güroğlu et al., 2009)</ref>. Overall, these findings suggest increasingly refined decision strategies, potentially motivated by multiple social considerations, resulting in "wanting the best" for one's friends.</p><p>Young adults were more likely to relinquish preferred safe options if their friend also wanted them</p><p>The third goal of the study was to observe shifts in individuals' choice patterns, across age, when one faces conflicting preferences between oneself and one's friend.</p><p>To address this question, we explicitly showed participants their friend's preferred options in the Preference Revealed condition. We found that participants were willing to relinquish their preferred option and let their friend receive it about 30% of the time, and there were no age-related changes to this rate. However, young adults were more likely to accommodate their friend's wishes when it required them to adopt nonpreferred risky option (and give up a preferred safe option) than to give up a preferred risky option.</p><p>There was a natural confound here, because the risky options tended to have a higher EV. Examining trials in which the expected values of the risky and safe options were equal, results that young adult participants shielded friends from their undesired risks held, absent any potential monetary gains. These findings show a later emerging prosocial tendency to prioritize friends' preferences in face of an overt conflict within the dyad's preferences.</p><p>The finding that young adults shielded friends from unwanted risks even when there were no potential monetary gains could suggest that costly prosocial behaviors follow a more protracted developmental trajectory. The significant age window for this pattern of relinquishing original selection appeared later in the age range compared to the age window for wanting friends to choose what is best for themselves. We speculate this could be due to differential willingness to actually give up one's preference relative to responding hypothetically. Perhaps actually relinquishing one's preference required more a more deliberate decision strategy to override the desire to maximize one's own payout. This costly prosocial behavior may require still-developing executive functioning or cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Güroğlu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Luengo Kanacri et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Steinbeis et al., 2012)</ref>. Flexible and sophisticated decision strategies increase with age with experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jacobs &amp; Klaczynski, 2002)</ref>; integrating across multiple sources of utility and simulating self-and friend-outcome requires late-developing brain areas that support complex cost-benefit analyses, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hartley &amp; Somerville, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, older participants might be at a developmental stage more positioned for complex prosocial considerations and suppressing self-interest for social gains. Future work may test this proposal with a targeted design and a longitudinal sample.</p><p>At first glance, this late emerging window for prosocial concerns is surprising as our previous <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., under review)</ref> results showed early adolescence to be a particular age window where individuals take on self-sacrificing choices to benefit their friends. However, the decision contexts and the contrast therein are different in these two studies: early adolescents were most impacted by the decision context changing from one that only concerned themselves to one that required adjudicating between self-and friend-interest. In the present study, the trials being contrasted to probe whether individuals were willing to relinquish their initial preference upon learning their friend wanted them all happened in the latter decision context. Young adults were more pliant to this "ask" compared to adolescents, whereas they were least impacted by the social context shift in our previous study. We conjecture this could signal either different priorities and consequent strategizing, or increasing deftness navigating complex social contexts and decisions to sustain one's relationships, as adolescents age into adulthood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>The conclusions of this research should be contextualized relative to its limitations. First, we used a cross-sectional sample to evaluate age-related changes, which limits our ability to examine developmental trajectories. Future studies should explore these questions in a longitudinal sample. Our analyses used data-driven and exploratory modeling approaches, aiming to capture fine-grained age-related changes without presupposing any shape for the trajectory. Our results would benefit from replications using similar approaches that treat age continuously. We also did not explore the degree of intimacy or stability of the pairwise friendships, which could influence the quality or strength of prosocial motives. Future research with a much larger sample size may have the statistical power to examine how the strength or durability of friendships influence risky choices in addition to the effects of age, which were the focus here. Our choice set made risky options on average more advantageous in terms of EV, in order to encourage participants to overcome natural risk aversion.</p><p>However, this choice may have limited our ability to dissociate payout maximization and prosocial motives in certain analyses. Future work could use a different set of choices varying the level of advantageousness of the risky options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Beliefs and desires about peers' risk preferences may factor into individuals' risky decisions. However, as a covert route to peer influence, it has been underexplored in past research. By collecting fully mutual dyadic data on predicted and actual risky choices and using a computational account of weighing one's own and one's friend's utility, we were able to bring to the surface the intricate interplay between the beliefs, desires and choices of the dyads. We found that through the transition from adolescence into adulthood, several complex changes unfold, which add nuance to how our beliefs and others' preferences are incorporated into our choices. Although even young adults are susceptible to biased beliefs about their friend's risk preferences, a wider array of angles and strategies that factor in prosocial considerations emerge through the adolescent transition. Building on this work, future studies could characterize the social-cognitive processes that are co-developing with risky decision making to reveal the developmental mechanisms of these relatively late emerging prosocial strategies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Example trials from different conditions in the experiment.

For the Baseline and Friend Predicted conditions, we excluded participants with Alpha exceeding 3.32, which is the maximum theoretical recoverable value based on our choice set. For the Opposite and Desired Opposite condition, we excluded participants whose Alpha exceeded 2 or Weightfriend lower than 0.000001. This threshold was set based on two considerations. First, both the revised model and the original model showed the best parameter recovery for Alpha in the range of 0 to 2 (correlation between simulated and fitted alpha in the range of [0,2]: original model: r=.94, revised model: r=0.78, Weightfriend: r=0.73). Second, the simulated choice behavior generated by Alpha values ranging from 2 through 3.32 was indistinguishable (see Supplemental Materials for more details). We also excluded participants whose AIC from the computational model was equal to or exceeded the AIC value for someone with chance choice behavior from that condition. Model based exclusion resulted in exclusion rate of less than 8% (see Supplemental Material). Note, these exclusions only apply to analyses of Alpha and Weightfriend as dependent variables, i.e., all data were included in analyses of other dependent variables. Proportion of Risky Choices is not subject to model-based exclusions described above, and thus presents a comprehensive sketch of risky choice behavior.3. Measure of simulated earnings: Simulated earnings were computed for each participant for each condition by calculating the sum of the expected value (EV) of each selected choice option. Simulated earnings were modeled as proportions of the total possible earnings (calculated as the sum of all highest-EV choices) using a beta distribution to better reflect the distribution of the data and improve the accuracy of the model fit and generalizability. Therefore, the test statistic is expressed in z-values and the resulting plots with y-axis on a logit scale.4.

This measure is not as sensitive to changes in risk attitudes as Alpha, as the computational model takes into account the relative utility of the options on each trial, which Proportion of Risky Choices cannot capture.

The rationale for this analysis is that relinquishing a preferred option on equal-EV trials would not be driven by a motive to maximize earnings.
