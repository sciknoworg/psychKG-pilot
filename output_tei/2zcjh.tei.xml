			<abstract>
				<p>Failing to make decisions that would actively avoid negative outcomes is central to helplessness. In a Bayesian framework, deciding whether to act is informed by beliefs about the world that can be characterised as priors. However, these priors have not been previously quantified. Here we administered two tasks in which participants decided whether to attempt active avoidance actions. The tasks differed in framing and valence, allowing us to test whether the prior generating biases in behaviour is problem-specific or task-independent and general. We performed extensive comparisons of models offering different structural explanations of the data, finding that a Bayesian model with a task-invariant prior for active avoidance provided the best fit to participants&apos; trial-by-trial behaviour. The parameters of this prior were reliable, and participants with an optimistic prior also reported higher levels of positive affect. These results show that individual differences in prior beliefs can explain decisions to engage in active avoidance of negative outcomes, providing evidence for a Bayesian conceptualization of helplessness.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Getting out of bed this morning was a choice to be active. It may even have been a difficult one if you are suffering from depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Initially, staying in bed might sound attractive, but if you did, you would incur a range of negative consequences. However, getting up also has real costs, and even if you do so, the negative consequences that you tried to avoid may still occur. These types of decisions of active avoidance in which a choice not to do something -to be passive -results in a negative consequence, while an active action may, or may not, result in escaping that consequence, are central to conceptualisations of helplessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> . As such, characterising how people engage in these decisions is key to understanding helplessness, and in the long run, depression.</p><p>When deciding whether to get up or not, your beliefs and expectations about the consequences of your actions inform your decision. Generally, people hold optimistic beliefs about themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . However, several lines of research have indicated that this optimism is diminished in people suffering from depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . According to Bayesian theories of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> , such beliefs are determined by two quantities: the initial prior, and previous experience with the consequences of the actions, formalised as the likelihood. The updating of prior beliefs based on this experience can then be computed as the Bayesian combination of prior and likelihood, giving rise to the posterior. The prior plays a particularly critical role in beliefs about action outcomes as the decision-maker will only opt for active choices and thus obtain experience about their outcomes at all if the initial prior is adequately optimistic in the first place <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . Many behaviours in humans can usefully be described in this Bayesian framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p><p>Such a Bayesian analysis suggests that decreased optimism can arise from issues with either or both priors or updating. Some research suggests that it results from how information is asymmetrically updated <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> while other studies have shown that it can instead be accounted for by differences in prior beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Recent findings have further indicated that prior beliefs about the outcomes of actions in a visuomotor task may be correlated with measures of behavioural activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . However, these studies only employed single behavioural tasks, and so they were not suitable to test the existence of the sorts of priors typically assumed in theoretical work that generalise broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> . The current study aims to characterise how individual differences in prior beliefs may make people less or more prone to choose to be passive across different contexts.</p><p>Learned helplessness has been a particular target for such Bayesian analyses. In this phenomenon, a person or an animal first experiences uncontrollable aversive outcomes in one setting, and later does not attempt to avoid aversive outcomes in another setting or context in which those outcomes could actually be avoided <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . This paradigm of reduced active avoidance has long been utilised as an animal model of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . An important notion for learned helplessness is that of the controllability of the environment, i.e., the extent to which an agent believes that their actions have a causal influence over the outcomes they receive <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . In a Bayesian framework, learned helplessness has been conceptualised as resulting from a pessimistic prior (acquired from initial outcomes) that generalises across different contexts and implies the expectation of failure when performing an action <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Here we seek to test the hypothesis that helpless behaviour is underpinned by such a pessimistic prior by estimating it from trial-by-trial behaviour independently across different tasks.</p><p>Priors in sensory domains have been successfully measured using various perceptual decision making tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . In a key study, Houlsby and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> developed a method to extract complex multidimensional priors that generalise across tasks. They used this method in two different faceperception tasks to extract a task-invariant prior for this domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . Building on this method, in the current study, we employed two different tasks with the aim of quantifying priors and testing whether they generalise. In the tasks, participants made repeated binary decisions between a sure negative consequence and a costly active choice affording a non-zero probability of avoiding the negative consequence. This choice structure is similar to that outlined in simulations of learned helplessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p><p>In both tasks, the values associated with the negative consequence and the action cost are varied on each trial and are shown to the participants. The probability of avoiding the negative consequence is signalled by different stimuli that are encountered for a few consecutive trials (4 to 8 trials, see methods and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), but this probability is not disclosed explicitly to the participants. This structure enables us to satisfy two requirements: having sufficient trials in which an initial prior established outside the experimental circumstance will exert substantial influence, and revealing how this prior is updated from observed outcomes. To test generalizability, the two tasks differ in several important ways. First, they are framed differently: In one of the tasks, referred to as the robber task, participants are asked to imagine they are encountering a robber and must decide whether to relinquish their money or try to fight. In the other task, referred to as the factory task, participants decide between trying to repair a machine or letting it break. Second, the values in the two tasks have the opposite valence: In the robber task, the negative consequence is missing out on a win, whereas in the factory task, the negative consequence is incurring a loss. This structure enables us to test whether participants construct a common generalised prior for action outcome contingencies, as assumed by simulations of learned helplessness 3 , or if these types of priors are specific to each task.</p><p>To test for convergent validity we collected data on participants' self-rated positive affect, as assessed by the Positive and Negative affect schedule <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and trait anxiety, as assessed by State-Trait Anxiety Index -Trait (STAI-T) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Reduced positive affect has been specifically linked to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> thereby providing measure with high variability in a general population sample that is related to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</p><p>Trait anxiety scores correlate with depression in non-clinical samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> and more generally correlate both with depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . Furthermore, based on our pilot data (see Supplementary material, pilot data) we have previously observed a correlation between the variance of the taskinvariant prior and trait anxiety.</p><p>In line with our hypotheses and preregistration (https://osf.io/rej74) the results confirmed that participants' behaviours are affected by some of the manipulated variables in the experiment (H1) and can be best described by a Bayesian choice model (H2) with a shared prior across the tasks (H3 and H4). Furthermore, this prior is reliable within the session and two weeks later (H5) and correlates with participants' self-rated positive affect (H6) but, counter to our hypothesis, not trait anxiety (H7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We follow the analysis plan stated in the preregistration (https://osf.io/rej74) unless otherwise stated.</p><p>The results reported here replicate in large part the results of a pilot study with 54 participants (see Supplementary results, pilot data). 279 participants completed two blocks each of the two choice tasks described above. Each block consisted of 60 trials. Participants started randomly with one task and thereafter the tasks strictly alternated between blocks. In both tasks, the values of the choices were manipulated by varying the cost of the active choice (cost), the value of the negative outcome that could be avoided by choosing the active choice (offer) and the probability of success when making the active choice.</p><p>In the robber task, participants were asked to imagine they were encountering a robber on the way home from a shift at the bar. The offer was described as the amount of tip from each night's work, and the active choice amounted to fighting the robber. As such, the offer was the amount participants missed out on if they chose the passive choice (i.e. not to fight). In the factory task, participants decided whether to repair a machine which was breaking down, and the offer was described as the amount of debt the participant would incur if the machine broke.</p><p>The choice structures are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a</ref> and b. On each trial, t, the offer was sampled from the following 20-element array (with a negative sign in the factory task):</p><p>(1) offer t ∈ 50 [0.10, 0.15, …,0.95, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and then rounded to the nearest whole number. In each task, all offers were presented in a randomised order 3 times within a block. The cost in each task was constructed as a sum of two terms, a relative cost expressed as a percentage of the offer, and a set cost. In the robber task, the set costs were 10, 40 or 75 points and the corresponding relative costs were 15%, 5% and 0% of the offer. In the factory task, the corresponding set and relative costs were 0, 50 or 100 points and 10%, 5% and 0% of the offer. This resulted in 60 unique offer-cost combinations in each task (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1d</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model agnostic results</head><p>We anticipated that participants would use the values associated with the choices and the outcomes in their decisions to guide their decisions. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we fitted two hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models to each task and block. The models included subject and stimulus as grouping variables with group level intercepts and slopes. Below we report the results for the population-level effect; for full results see Supplementary results, Tables 1 to 8. The first model tested the effect of the values presented to the participants (value of the negative outcome and cost of action) and the effect of successes on the previous trial, finding that for both tasks, participants were more likely to make an active choice if the difference between value of the negative outcome (offer) and cost of action (cost; offer-cost) was high (Robber, Block 1: b = 0.048, BF10 = 7.972e+19, Block 2: b = 0.043, BF10 = 3.856e+15; Factory, Block 1: b = 0.038, BF10 = 1.204e+19, Block 2: b = 0.038, BF10 = 2.218e+17). As expected, these results indicate that participants took the values into account when making their choices. We did, however, not see conclusive evidence in favour or against the effect of the outcome of the previous trial on the probability to choose to act on the current trial (Robber, Block  g, Example stimuli that the participants could encounter in the first block of either task along with the success probabilities that were assigned to each stimulus. The order of the stimulus presentation and the association of stimuli to success probabilities was randomised for each participant. Participants encountered each stimulus in 4 to 8 consecutive trials. 6 of the stimuli were encountered 4 times, 3 stimuli 5 times and 1 stimulus 6, 7 and 8 times. The number of encounters for each stimulus was balanced over the block by splitting the number of encounters into two counterbalanced lists and shuffling the number of encounters within the lists.</p><p>However, this conceptualisation of learning does not consider the possibility that learning may only occur with repeated encounters with the same stimulus, and not between stimuli. Within each block of the tasks, participants encountered 12 different stimuli (48 unique stimuli in total for the whole experiment). Each of the stimuli in each block was associated with a unique probability of success if the active choice was chosen. The success probabilities ranged from 7.69% to 92.31% in equidistant steps (for the full range of success probabilities and an example of some of the robbers see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c</ref>).</p><p>Critically, which specific stimulus was associated with which success probability was not known to the participant and was randomised for each participant within blocks and tasks. Participants experienced each stimulus in 4 to 8 consecutive trials. Because participants were explicitly told that the probability of success changes with each stimulus, the outcome of the last trial before a change in stimulus should not impact their choices with the next stimulus. As such, to further test if participants learned from the outcomes of their choices, we constructed a regression model to test whether the probability of making an active choice changed over trials with the same stimulus and how that interacted with the underlying probability of success.</p><p>We found clear evidence in favour of an effect of the interaction between the number of trials with the same stimuli and the success probability associated with that stimulus in the robber task (Block 1: b = 0.138, BF10 = 24.167; Block 2: b = 0.211, BF10 = 1.344e+15) whereby the more trials the participants played with the low probability stimuli the less they made the active choice. This effect was however inconclusive in the factory task with more evidence in favour in block 2 (b = 0.117, BF10 = 7.846) than block 1 (b = 0.078, BF10 = 0.349). We also found a main effect of trial in the robber task (Block 1: b = -0.107, BF10 = 1.359e+5; Block 2: b = -0.16, BF10 = 2.174e+30) whereby participants had a higher probability to choose to act in early choices with a stimulus compared to the later ones, this effect was also inconclusive in the factory task in block 1 (b = -0.065, BF10 = 2.997) but not in block 2 (b = -0.082, BF10 = 1.096e+6; for full results see Supplementary results, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 8 to 16</ref>). These results show that participants learned from the outcomes of their active choice in the robber task but the results for the factory task are inconclusive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice behaviours are well captured by a Bayesian model</head><p>To further analyse participants' choice behaviour, and to test if participants' choice behaviour could be described by a model including a Bayesian prior, we constructed four different types of choice model. Two models, the SoftMax only and the Win-stay lose-shift model, assumed a 100% probability of success when participants chose the active choice. On top of the invT parameter, the Win-stay loseshift model included two more parameters than the SoftMax only model. These parameters provided a positive or negative additive bonus to the utility of the active choice depending on the outcome of the previous trial, if an active choice had been taken on that trial. This implemented a simplified, stimulusindependent, heuristic learning rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . In contrast, the Bayesian learner model and the Static probability model did not assume 100 % probability of success and instead assumed that participants maintain or derive a subjective probability of success (subjP in the Static probability model, and E[subjP] in the case of the Bayesian learner) when choosing the active choice. This subjective probability affected the expected utilities as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(2)</formula><p>Robber task Q active, t = -cost t + subjP • offer t Q passive, t = 0 Participants' choice behaviour in the robber task was robustly best fitted by the Bayesian learner model in both blocks (Block 1: PXP = 0.996; Block 2: PXP = 1). This was only the case in the second block of the factory task (Block 1: PXP = 0.094; Block 2: PXP = 0.998). The best fitting model in the first block of the factory task was the Static probability model (PXP = 0.906; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). These results are consistent with those from the regression models indicating that learning was not as robust in the factory task as in the robber task (for how models differ in predictions of choices over trials see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1e</ref> and 1f). Altogether, these results indicate that the Bayesian model provides the best overall account of participant's behaviour when modelling the tasks separately. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The parameters of the prior correlate across tasks</head><p>As an initial test of task invariance, we tested whether the mean of the expected probability of success given action correlated between tasks when estimated using the best fitting models from the stepwise model-comparisons of the augmented models. For each task and block, we extracted each participant's parameters of the prior or the static subjective probability for block 1 of the factory task.</p><p>In the first block, we found a strong correlation between the µ0 parameter of the prior in the robber task and the non-Bayesian counterpart, subjP, in the factory task (rs(277) = 0.363, R 2 = -0.455, p &lt; 10e-4; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2a</ref>). Similarly, we found strong correlations between the parameters of the priors in each task in the second block (µ0: rs(277) = 0.563, R 2 = -0.175, p &lt; 10e-4;  To test the question of task invariance formally, we next constructed two different models that could capture the participants' behaviours in both tasks. Both models were constructed with separate SoftMax functions for each task, allowing for different levels of randomness in choice across tasks, and included an action bias parameter only in the factory task, as informed by the stepwise model comparisons performed separately for the two tasks (see Supplementary results, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 17</ref>). Critically, the difference between the two models was that one assumed that participants shared the parameters of the prior across the tasks (1-prior model) while the other assumed separate priors in each task (2-prior model). As hypothesised and preregistered, participants choice data was best fit by a model with a single prior for both task (  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The measured prior is reliable</head><p>We next investigated if the parameters of the prior were stable within the session and over time. For this, we invited a random sample of participants who had completed the experiment to redo the tasks.</p><p>participants participated in the follow-up session. The mean number of days between the two sessions was 16.02 days (SD = 3.09 days, range = 12 to 27 days). This session consisted of only one block of each task with new stimuli, and choice data were modelled using the one prior model. For model comparison between the one and two prior models in the follow-up session see Supplementary results, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 18</ref>.</p><p>We quantified the stability of the prior by calculating interclass correlations (ICC) between the two blocks of the first session (N = 279) and between the blocks on the first day and the follow-up (N = 101).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire analysis</head><p>We next investigated if the parameters of the prior were correlated with positive affect and nonspecific negative affect. Because the overall best fitting model was the 1-prior model, the parameters of each participant's prior were estimated with this model. Participants' estimated 0 and 0 2 were then correlated with their total PANAS-P and STAI-T scores using Spearman's correlation (rs).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We developed two different aversively-framed decision-making tasks in which executing costly actions might lead to the avoidance of potentially negative outcomes. In line with our preregistered hypotheses, the tasks were amenable to be modelled using an augmented Bayesian observer model that includes a prior belief about the probability of success of executing such actions. As hypothesised and preregistered, our results demonstrate that this prior belief is rather task-invariant and reliable when measured on two different occasions and is positively correlated with positive affect, providing convergent validity of the measured prior, and supporting the interpretation that a generalising pessimistic prior about active avoidance may play an important role in depression.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that we can quantify a task-invariant prior belief about the probability of success when performing an action to avoid potentially negative outcomes. Task invariance is a key property of the measured prior and a prerequisite for it to be relevant for behaviour observed outside of the laboratory. To achieve task invariance, we followed the strategy previously used by Houlsby et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and designed two decision-making tasks which admit a potential prior belief about the controllability of the environment, that is the probability of success when performing an action to avoid a potential negative outcome. The two tasks differ in two important ways: the framing of the decisions and the valence of the outcomes. These differences ensured that the measured prior does not merely reflect task-specific behavioural strategies.</p><p>That the prior was task invariant supports a key assumption of the Bayesian account of helplessness, namely generalisation of expectations about controllability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Previous theoretical work has suggested that learned helplessness results from learning a pessimistic prior about the success of one's actions when performing them in an uncontrollable environment. This prior then instils the expectation of failure when performing an action, and as the prior generalises the lack of controllability across different contexts helplessness ensues <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Although this theoretical account is very suggestive, empirical evidence for the proposal has been scarce. Recent studies have found evidence that prior beliefs, as conceptualised in Bayesian theories, relate to traits such as optimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , behavioural activation or expressions of symptoms of depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . However, these studies only employed single behavioural tasks, and so could not test the existence of priors that generalise broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . By demonstrating task invariance, our data fill a missing knowledge gap and provide support for the Bayesian account of helplessness.</p><p>We operationalized the estimate of controllability as a prior belief about the probability of success when performing an action to avoid negative outcomes. Ligneul and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref>  When modelling the tasks separately, we found very strong evidence for a full Bayesian model using a prior belief about the probability of success when performing an action to avoid potentially negative outcomes for both blocks of the robber task and the second block of the factory task. Although this full Bayesian model was outperformed by the simpler Static probability model in the first block of the factory task, this model can be seen as a heuristic implementation of the full Bayesian model without updating. We did not augment the Static probability model with learning as in a stimulus-specific or continuous Q-learning model because simulations showed that this model was not identifiable against the basic Bayesian learner and the Static probability model in our tasks. While there are key differences between the Bayesian learner and a Q-learning model, notably fixed versus changing learning rates, in some cases a Bayesian learner can come to implement a near-fixed learning rate if the underlying generative characterization of the environment allows the latent variable that needs to be estimated (in our case: success probability) to change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . As such, more specific manipulations may be needed to distinguish these models and until such time, "priors shared across tasks" is equivalent to "initial estimates and learning rates are shared across tasks".</p><p>A crucial aspect of our results is that we found this prior to be reliable, both across blocks on the same test occasion and on separate testing occasions. Here we find that the degree of reliability of the prior mirrors that of the PANAS questionnaire. Previous research investigating the reliability of parameters from computational models have generally found low test-retest reliability of these parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> .</p><p>The reliability of cognitive measures can be increased by constructing latent variables using factor analysis that capture the shared variance across multiple measures of the same construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> . In this sense, the use of two different tasks that could depend on the same prior may boost the reliability of the measured prior. While low reliability has been attributed to dynamic characteristics changing over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , the reliability of the parameters of our priors indicate that these might be related to more stable traits. However, dynamic characteristics of the constructs are not sufficient to explain low reliability in all cases, as it can be boosted by experimental design <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> . Furthermore, while the prior does not shift substantially between the sessions or tasks, we would not expect that the observed prior is static; rather it should evolve over time to reflect one's life experiences. However, if the prior reflects some key experiences with roots in childhood, we should not expect it to change much over the course of days. One possibility that we have not tested here is that the prior is informed by what amounts to a higher order prior that shifts more slowly or is not affected by the tasks employed, much like the hierarchical structure employed in volatility learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</p><p>While the correlation between positive affect and the mean of the prior is significant and adds credence to the link between the prior and depressive symptoms, the correlation was rather weak.</p><p>Reduced positive affect is central in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . A decrease in positive affect has been specifically linked to symptoms and diagnosis of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Furthermore, diminished positive affect shows less improvement in traditional treatments of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> . Indeed, cognitive behavioural treatment focused on improving positive affect demonstrated better treatment outcomes in a transdiagnostic group than a treatment focused on reducing elevated threat response <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> . These data suggest that positive affect is not only important and specific to depression, but it may also be a better measure in healthy populations and a promising target for treatment. However, reduced positive affect is only one way of describing the multifaceted concept of anhedonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> , which has been suggested be more closely related to expectation of controllability of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> . Furthermore, low self-reported positive affect is likely a very peripheral measure of anhedonia. We hypothesise that anhedonia would be more closely linked to the measured prior. However, the variance of anhedonia in a non-clinical sample as the one of this study is expected to be low as compared to clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> . Future studies should examine the relationship between our prior and anhedonia in a clinical sample of depressed patients.</p><p>To conclude, our data show that individual differences in the tendency to act to avoid a negative outcome can be conceptualised as a generalised prior belief in a Bayesian framework providing support to theoretical accounts of learned helplessness and depression. Future research should explore how this prior is related to apathy, experimental manipulation of controllability and patient groups and treatment outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The research plan for this study was preregistered before the start of the data collection on 2024-01-09 at OSF: https://osf.io/rej74 Participants 368 participants were recruited from the online participant pool Prolific (www.prolific.co). 302 of these participants completed the experiment. Out of these participants, 22 participants' data were lost due to technical issues, giving a sample of 280 cases of complete data. 1 participant was rejected due to failing more than two clearly telegraphed attention checks where participants were asked at two times in each block to press the arrow-key up before a timer of 10 seconds ran out. This provided a The study consisted of a within-subjects design in which each participant performed the two decisionmaking tasks outlined above (see detailed descriptions of each task below).</p><p>Participants performed the tasks multiple times with different stimuli. After providing informed consent, participants performed two blocks of both tasks on the first day ((60 + 60) + (60 + 60) trials).</p><p>Which task participants began each day with was randomly selected. After that, the tasks strictly alternated between blocks. Before starting the first block of each task, participants performed 18</p><p>practice trials with 4 different stimuli and 3 different probabilities of success when choosing the active choice (number of trials and success probability with each stimulus in a randomised order = 4 trials with 80%, 4 trials with 20 % and 4 and 6 trials with 50%) to familiarise them with the structure of the task. The stimuli in the practice trials were not repeated in the real task. After both blocks of the decision tasks were completed, participants ended the first day by completing a selection of questionnaires (see below and in Supplementary methods, Questionnaires) and a short memory task <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> that was unrelated to the hypotheses of the current study. After completing this part of the study, a subset of random participants was invited back for a follow-up session. This time participants performed one block of each task (60 + 60 trials). As on the first occasion, participants completed practice trials before each block. Participants also completed the same questionnaires after the tasks as on the first day. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.</p><p>Robber Task. This task was described as an encounter with a robber. Participants were asked to imagine being a server at a bar. They were told that at the end of the night, they were on their way home with their tips from the night in hand (the offer) when they encountered a robber. Participants could choose to relinquish their money (passive) or try to fight the robber (active). If they handed over the money, they would be missing out on their potential reward. If they tried to fight the robber, they incurred the cost of fighting. If successful, they kept the offer minus the cost, but if unsuccessful, they missed out on the reward associated with the offer and incurred an additional loss amounting to the cost of fighting. On each trial, t, the offer was sampled from the 20-element array presented in equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> and then rounded to the nearest whole number. Each offer was presented 3 times within a block in a randomised order. In this task, the action cost was described as the cost of fighting.</p><p>Crucially, this cost was related to the size of the tip by constructing the cost as a sum of a percentage of the offer and a set cost. In the robber task, the set costs were 10, 40 or 75 points and the concomitant percentages of the offers were 15 %, 5 % and 0 %. This resulted in 60 unique offer-cost combinations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c</ref>). The order of the combination of offers and costs was shuffled across trials.</p><p>Participants were told that they were supposed to try to get as many points as possible and that one of their trials would be randomly selected and they would gain a bonus based on their performance on that trial.</p><p>across the first day and follow-up). Each robber was signalled with a cartoon drawing of a robber. Each of these stimuli was associated with a unique probability of successfully winning the fight if the active choice was chosen. The success probabilities ranged from 7.69% to 92.31% in equidistant steps (for the full range of success probabilities and some of the robbers see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1g</ref>). This setup resulted in each stimulus signalling a unique success probability. Crucially, this success probability was not known by the participants. Participants encountered each stimulus in 4 to 8 consecutive trials. 6 of the stimuli were encountered 4 times, 3 stimuli 5 times and 1 stimulus 6, 7 and 8 times. The number of encounters for each stimulus was balanced over the block by splitting the number of encounters into two counterbalanced lists and shuffling the number of encounters within the lists. This ensured a spread of few and many encounters with the stimuli across the task. This design allowed us to capture Bayesian updating, as it encouraged some learning between repetitions of the same stimulus without making the task too simple.</p><p>Factory Task. This task was described in terms of decisions related to maintenance work. Participants were asked to imagine being the foreperson of a factory in which a machine was breaking down.</p><p>Participants decided whether to let the machine break down (passive) or to try to repair the machine (active). The costs within the factory task were described as the repair cost of the machine, while the offer was the money they lost if the machine broke down. This setup means that, unlike the robber task, the values in the factory task were exclusively negative. If they let the machine break down, participants incurred a sure loss. If they tried to repair the machine and were successful, they only incurred the cost of repairing, but if unsuccessful, they lost the value of the machine and the cost of repairing. To make the ranges of values comparable across the tasks, the offers in the factory task were the same as the robber task but in the negative domain. However, to distinguish the tasks in values of the actions while keeping the same range of values, the factory task had a different set of costs associated with the action. Much like the robber task, the action cost shown to the participants was constructed with a set cost and a cost associated with a percentage of the offer. The corresponding set and percentage costs for the factory task were 0, 50 or 100 points and 10 %, 5 % and 0 % (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1d</ref>). Participants were told that they were supposed to try to lose as few points as possible and that one of their trials would be randomly selected and they would gain a bonus based on their performance on this trial.</p><p>As in the robber task, participants encountered 12 different types of machines in each block (36 unique stimuli across the first day and follow-up). Each machine was signalled with a different drawing of a machine. The drawings were bought from a website for royalty-free vector images (https://www.vectorstock.com/) and were chosen from four different sets of machine drawings drawn by four different artists (vikivektor, WinWin_artlab, Tarlia and MicroOne). The images feature different factory machines and were chosen to have a similar style of drawing but with distinct features (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.   1g</ref>). Like the robbers of the robber task, each machine type signalled a unique probability of being successful in repairing the machine, with the range of success probabilities being the same across tasks. Likewise, the number of trials in which each stimulus was encountered mirrors those in the robber task. However, the order of the trials and success probabilities were randomised separately for each task. Questionnaires</p><p>To establish convergent validity participants completed two questionnaires, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and the State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Beyond these two preregistered questionnaires, we collected data from a range of questionnaires that is not a part of this study. These questionnaires are presented in the Supplementary material (Supplementary methods, Questionnaires). The order in which the questionnaires are presented was randomised for each participant.</p><p>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). To measure participants' degree of positive affect, we used the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) . The PANAS is a 20-item scale consisting of two subscales measuring positive affect and negative affect, respectively. The items consist of words that describe different feelings or emotions and respondents are asked to rate to what extent they have felt the specific feeling over a specific time period. For the current study, we choose over the past</p><p>week. Participants rated the items on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 "very slightly or not at all" to 5 "extremely". For the focus of this study, we only considered the positive affect subscale, but both scales were administered. The positive affect scale has good internal consistency in non-clinical samples (α = 0.89 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> ). In the current study we find good internal consistency (α = 0.912) and moderate test-retest reliability (ICC(2,1) = 0.733, 95% CI = [0.628, 0.811]). Low positive affect, as measured with the positive affect subscale, correlates with symptoms of depression in clinical <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> and nonclinical <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> samples, in particular symptoms of hopelessness, anhedonia, lack of energy and worthlessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</p><p>Furthermore, the positive affect scale, as compared with the negative affect scale, has been found to be more strongly correlated with symptoms of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> . Furthermore, the positive affect subscale has also been shown to be more correlated with symptoms of depression than symptoms of anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . In the current study we used the summed score of the full PANAS-P subscale.</p><p>State-Trait Anxiety Index. To measure the participants' degree of non-specific negative affectivity we used the State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (STAI Y-form 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> ). The STAI-Y 2 is a 40-item scale consisting of two subscales, each comprised of 20 items, and is the most cited trait anxiety scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . The state subscale measures how anxious a person is right now, at this moment. The trait subscale measures how anxious a person generally feels. For the focus of this study, we only considered the trait subscale STAI-T, but both scales were administered. Participants rated the items on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always), with 9 reverse-coded items. Despite the initial aim of the scale being to measure anxiety, a recent meta-analysis has shown that, across studies, individuals with diagnosed depression show higher STAI-T scores than persons with anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . As such, we will follow these authors' proposal that the scores should be interpreted as non-specific negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . Considering this, the scale has good convergent validity with both scales measuring depression (mean r = 0.61) and anxiety (mean r = 0.59) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . The STAI-T has also shown good test-retest reliability (mean r = 0.88 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> ) and internal consistency (mean Cronbach's alpha = 0.89 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> ). In the current study we find good internal consistency (α = 0.916) and moderate test-retest reliability (ICC(2,1) = 0.857, 95% CI = [0.795, 0.901]). In the current study we used the summed score of the full STAI-T subscale with the appropriate items reverse coded. Analysis</p><p>To test the study's hypotheses, we used computational models and model comparison, Bayesian hierarchical regressions and Spearman's correlations. In the sections below, we will first introduce the computational models that we used, then we will show how these, and other methods, were used to test our hypotheses. Lastly, we will present our inference criteria. 1 + e -invT • (Q active, t -Q passive,t ) (4) Robber task Q active, t = offer t -cost t Q passive, t = 0</p><p>Factory Task Q active, t = -cost t Q passive, t = -offer t Beside using equation <ref type="formula">3</ref>as a choice function (thus including the invT parameter) and assuming a 100% probability of success, the Win-stay lose-shift model includes two more parameters. These provide a positive (posBonus) or negative bonus (-negBonus) to the utility of the active choice depending on the outcome of the previous trial if an active choice was taken. The support of these parameters is also 0 to +infinity and so they are also reparametrized with their logarithms. Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> shows the utility functions of the Win-stay lose-shift model. The Static probability model also uses equation <ref type="formula">3</ref>as a choice function (and thus includes the invT parameter). However, in contrast to the two previous models, this model does not assume a 100% probability of success. Instead, the model includes a free parameter for the participant's subjective probability (subjP) of success, which is assumed to apply across all robbers and machines. This parameter's support is 0 to 1 and it is reparametrized with its logit. Equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">• (1-µ0)</ref>). As such, the support for both µ0 and σ0 2 is 0 to 1 and they are thus reparametrized with their logits. These parameters are then transformed into the α and β parameters of the beta distribution in equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(6) prior α 0 = μ 0 1 σ 0 2 -1 β 0 = (1 -μ 0 ) 1 σ 0 2 -1</formula><p>This transformation is used to simplify the Bayesian updating of this prior based on the outcomes of the active choices. In particular, due to the conjugacy of a beta prior with Bernoulli (binary) observations, the Bayesian posterior for the success probability of stimulus j after trial t is also a beta distribution with alpha and beta parameters simply given as the sum of the number of successes and losses incurred up until trial t and the alpha and beta parameters of the initial beta prior distribution, respectively. Thus, the parameters of the posterior for stimulus j up until trial t are computed recursively as in equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p></div>

One augmentation was a model that did not revert to the prior with each new stimulus but instead continues to update upon the posterior of the last trial regardless of stimulus identity. In the second augmentation, we assumed that participants might have an action bias either towards action or inaction (passivity). This is implemented by adding a parameter (bias) to the choice function as follows: When fitting the tasks together, we utilised two different versions of the best-fitting version of the models for each task separately. One version assumed different priors (µ0 and σ 2 0) for the different tasks, and the other assumed a single, shared prior across tasks. Both models allowed different inverse temperature parameters (invTrobber and invTfactory) across tasks. This ensures that task-specific noise does not affect the estimate of the parameters.</p><p>Statistical Analyses. We performed both model-agnostic and model-based analyses of the participants' choice data.</p><p>To perform a model-agnostic analysis of participants' choice behaviour (Hypothesis 1) we used Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression. These models were used to analyse if participants' choice behaviour is affected by the outcomes of the previous trial with the same stimulus and the offers and costs of a specific trial. Both models were fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Models were fit using the package brms v.2.19.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> in R v. 4.3.0 and Stan. The models were fitted with weakly regularising Gaussian priors with M = 0 and varying standard deviations for the intercept (SD = 1.5), population (SD = 1) and group-level effects (SD = 1). The prior for the group-level effects correlation matrix was set with a Lewandowski-Kurowicka-Joe (LKJ) distribution with the parameter set at 3 thereby favouring somewhat weaker correlations between group-level effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . The models were sampled with 4500 iterations in 6 chains with 1000 samples as a warmup. The sampling was done with the default treedepth of 10 and a delta of 0.8.</p><p>We fitted two different Bayesian hierarchical logistic regressions specified as stated below in the tasks and blocks separately. Regression model 1 was specified as follows:</p><p>Choice ~ Intercept + (offer-cost) * last trial success + (Intercept + (offer-cost) * last trial success| subject) + (Intercept + (offer-cost) * last trial success| stimulus)</p><p>Regression model 2 was specified as follows:</p><p>Choice ~ Intercept + trial number with same stimuli * Success probability of the stimuli + (Intercept + trial number with same stimuli * Success probability of the stimuli| subject)</p><p>When correlating parameters across tasks we used Spearman's (rs) correlations and performed a permutation test with 10,000 random permutations to test the true correlation. We also reported the parameters' explained variance (R 2 ) from one task to the other.</p><p>The reliability of the parameters was tested with a two-way mixed effects, absolute agreement, single measure, interclass correlations (ICC(2,1)).

Participants' parameter values were then correlated with each participant's sum score in positive affect and STAI-T using Spearman's correlations.</p><p>Inference Criteria. For frequentist statistical analysis the α-level was set at 0.05 meaning that p-values below this threshold were considered statistically significant. For Bayesian analysis, the Bayes factor (BF) was used to determine evidence in favour of or against a hypothesis. A Bayes factor of BF10 &gt; 10 was considered enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and a BF10 &lt; 0.1 was considered enough evidence to reject the alternative hypothesis, values in between were considered inconclusive. For computational model comparison, the best-fitting model at the group level was selected based on protected-exceedance probability (PXP). PXP provides a continuous measure of the probability that a specific model is the most prevalent in the population. A PXP above 0.95 was considered strong evidence for a given model. However, values bigger than chance (1/number of models concerned)</p><p>were also considered evidence supporting the model. For each model comparison, we also reported the model frequency (M.freq) of each model. M.freq is an estimate of the frequency of participants that is best explained by the model. For test-retest analysis parameters we considered the parameter to be moderately reliable if they had an ICC(2,1) between 0.5 and 0.75 and had good reliability if it was above 0.75.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>b = 0.032, BF10 = 0.112, Block 2: b = 0.202, BF10 = 0.651; Factory, Block 1: b = 0.196, BF10 = 1.188, Block 2: b = 0.038, BF10 = 1.365).

All the models, including the Bayesian learner, used a SoftMax choice function and took the value of action and cost of action into consideration in the utility function. The SoftMax function only includes one free parameter, invT, which describes the sensitivity of the participant's choices to the value difference between the active and the passive choices. The key difference between the models was therefore how the value of the active choice was constructed across successive trials.</figDesc></figure>

The Bayesian learner model treats subjP as a beta distributed (latent) random variable whose distribution is initialised to a prior each time a new stimulus is encountered, and it learns from experience with a stimulus by iteratively updating this distribution to a new posterior after each active choice. For the Bayesian model, the parameters we estimated for each participant were the mean (µ0) and relative variance (σ0 2 ) of the initial prior. The relative variance is simply the variance of the beta distribution divided by the upper bound of the variance for a given value of µ0 (which is µ0 • (1-µ0)) (for description of updating and the full model see Methods). The parameters of these and all other models were estimated with Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) from the computational and behavioral modeling (CBM) toolbox 40 in MATLAB. This method was also used for model comparison. Below, we report the observed model frequencies (M.freq) and protected exceedance probability (PXP) from the model comparisons, the latter indicating the probability that the model is the most frequent in the population. Model recovery was performed for each model comparison (see Supplementary results, Fig. 3 to 7) and parameter recovery was performed for the best fitting models (see Supplementary results, Table 21 and 22).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>have recently suggested an alternative, which assesses controllability by comparing the predictive accuracy of two internal models of the environment: an "actor" that includes the effects of the agent's actions, and a "spectator" that considers the environment as evolving independently of those actions. By thresholding this dynamic estimate, the model can arbitrate between the two models when making choices in a prediction task that depend on the level of inferred controllability. Akin to learned helplessness, they showed that humans, after experiencing uncontrollable shocks in a separate environment, increase the threshold parameter in the model. In turn, this results in greater reliance on the spectator model in subsequent settings. One important feature of Ligneul's model and experimental paradigm is that it disambiguates controllability and uncertainty, two quantities normally conflated in previous paradigms studying the impact of controllability in decision-making<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Although this is an important feature of the experimental paradigm for which we did not control, this does not impact our estimate of the prior that ultimately reflects an expectation of controllability of the environment. This is because we do not compare two different conditions differing in controllability but the estimated level of expected controllability of the environment in general. In fact, we would expect a positive correlation between the threshold in Ligneul's model and the prior beliefs measured here.</figDesc></figure>

Because the participants who encountered technical issues were still compensated for their participation,budgetary constraints precluded us from reaching our preregistered target sample size of 300 participants. The participant age ranged from 18 to 40 (M = 27.12, SD = 5.06) with participants with 36 different nationalities.Participants were paid 10 £ if they agreed to participate and completed the experiment on the first day. Participants had a chance to earn up to an additional 4 £ if they gained more points in the tasks than the mean of all participants in a randomly selected trial. A random subset of 101 participants was then invited back to participate in the follow-up experiment about two weeks later (the time between sessions was M = 16.02 days, SD = 3.09 days, range = 12 to 27 days). The time between sessions differed from the preregistered 1-week follow-up because of limitations in the recruitment process, whereby we were unable to specify a follow-up time. In this session, participants were paid a further £ if they agreed to participate and completed the experiment, as well as another 2 £ based on their performance, as on the first day. Before participating both on the first day and the follow-up, participants were required to provide informed consent for their participation in the study. The study complies with all the relevant ethical regulations for research with human participants. The study protocol was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (ref.no.: 2021-04906) before the start of the study. Design</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_14"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Method of Parameter Estimation and model comparison. Parameters in all computational modelswere estimated with the Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) algorithm that is part of the computational and behavioral modeling (CBM) toolbox v. from 04/2019 40 in MATLAB v. 9.13.0.2105380 (R2022) . This method was also used for model comparison. In HBI, parameter estimation is carried out in two steps, first by performing an initial Laplace approximation of the parameters at the individual level using a predefined non-informative prior, followed by iteratively regularising and re-estimating the parameter across the full group of individuals taking into account how likely each individual is to be best fitted by a specific model. It further represents all uncertainties at both individual and group levels as probability distributions. Taken together, these steps result in HBI having smaller errors in estimation compared with other Bayesian hierarchical and nonhierarchical inference methods<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . In model comparison, HBI applies a form of what is known as an automatic Occam factor in which more complex models are directly penalised by spreading probability mass more broadly. This stems from the extra level of the Bayesian hierarchy that it includes compared with the iBIC method employed by Huys et al<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> . Each parameter in all models had a prior that was a zero-centred normal distribution with a variance of 6.25 as recommended by the authors of the toolbox<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . The parameters were transformed to their respective parameterizations within the models. Parameters with support ranging from 0 to +infinity were exponentiated (implying a lognormal prior) while parameters with support restricted from 0 to 1 were transformed with a standard logistic transformation.Cognitive Models. A full description of all models is given here; thus some information from the results section is repeated for convenience. The parameters of four different types of choice model were estimated when fitting the tasks and blocks separately. The four models are: a SoftMax-only model (1 parameter), a win-stay lose-shift model (3 parameters), a Static probability model (2 parameters) and a Bayesian learner model with a beta distributed prior (3 parameters). The SoftMax-only model has only one parameter, the inverse temperature (invT), and employs a utility function that assumes a 100% probability of success if the active choice is taken. The support of the invT parameter in this and all other models is 0 to +infinity so we reparametrize it with its logarithm (which is unbounded). Equation (3) shows the SoftMax choice function: this choice function is the same across all models, and equation (4) shows the utility functions in the robber and factory tasks in the SoftMax-only model, which implicitly assumes a 100% probability of success for active choices. (3) p(active, t) = 1</figDesc></figure>

Similarly, losst-1 is 1 if the last choice was an active choice and the participant was unsuccessful and if they chose the passive choice or were successful in their active choice.</figDesc></figure>

The Bayesian learner model uses the same utility functions but instead of having a single set value for the subjective probability of success, this model assumes Bayesian updating of stimulus (i.e., robber/machine)-specific success probabilities. According to this model, participants start with a beta distributed prior over success probabilities before encountering a stimulus, and then compute a new posterior over subjective probabilities of success after each active choice. These posteriors (and, on the first occasion, the initial prior) are the predictive distributions this model uses to compute the probability of success on any given trial. Specifically, the parameters estimated in this model are the mean (µ0) and relative variance (σ0 2 ) of the initial prior. The relative variance is simply the variance of the beta distribution divided by the upper bound of the variance for a given value of µ0 (which is µ0</figDesc></figure>

As such, the support for the bias parameter in this model is -1 to 1. Values of bias &lt; 0 implement a passivity bias, whereas bias &gt; 0 implements an action bias. To ensure that we could estimate the likelihood as a function of bias using gradient-based optimization, we replaced the rectified linear (whose gradient is undefined at bias=0) with a SoftPlus function with the parameter alpha set at 100. This method is described in detail in the Supplementary methods.</figDesc></figure>
