			<abstract>
				<p>A parent has immense control over the experiences of their offspring. Given that personality is associated with important life outcomesmediated through decision-making processesit is likely that parental personality impacts their child&apos;s life outcomes. While &quot;compensatory&quot; influences from another person have been identified in romantic partners, the impact of parent&apos;s personality on their child&apos;s outcomes has not been thoroughly examined. Using a response surface analysis approach, we will look at the associations of adolescent personality with the personality of their parents for the prediction of adolescent outcomes (Ndyads = 9,395). Parent personality predicted outcomes for their child, above and beyond their child&apos;s traits. There were few instances of child-parent personality interactions, suggesting the mechanisms linking child and parent traits to child outcomes are largely independent. Findings suggest parents&apos; personalities offer a unique influence on the outcomes for children while they develop and navigate through adolescence.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Is parent personality associated with adolescent outcomes for their child? A response surface analysis approach</head><p>Parents understandably have an outsized role in shaping the life outcomes of their children. The greater levels of autonomy that parents have relative to their offspring position them to have a role of great influence in their children's lives (e.g., through dietary choices, choosing playmates or schools, setting expectations for how to behave). While there are wellestablished effects of parental influence through parenting styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Sahithya &amp; Raman, 2021)</ref>, general parenting behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achtergarde et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Becht et al., 2016)</ref>, and basic demographic characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gölcük &amp; Berument, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Sahithya &amp; Raman, 2021)</ref>, fewer studies have examined whether parental personality influences childhood outcomes.</p><p>In general, those close to you can influence your behavior in many ways, such as through decision-making or modeling of behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Donnellan et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dyrenforth et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Neyer &amp; Voigt, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Roberts et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Solomon &amp; Jackson, 2014ab)</ref>. While the influence of close others has primarily been examined in romantic relationships, parents and their children share similar dyadic dynamics. Although children reasonably have some influence on their own future outcomes, their lack of independence at younger ages suggests parents are highly influential in shaping children's behavior, such as through well-studied parenting behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Achtergarde et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Becht et al., 2016)</ref> or styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gölcük &amp; Berument, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Sahithya &amp; Raman, 2021)</ref>. However, parent's personalities are also a likely source of individual differences that shape choices for their children. Both adult and child/adolescent personality traits are prospective predictors of many important outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Beck &amp; Jackson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Soto, 2021;</ref>). Yet, not only is it unclear whether the personality of a child's parents influence the child's life outcomes, but it is also unknown to what extent parents' personality can interact with their child's personality to further predict outcomes.</p><p>In this paper, we examine these dyadic effects amongst children and their parents for the prediction of adolescent outcomes in a large-scale longitudinal dataset by examining both child and parent personality. Three primary aims will be addressed. First, how well does adolescent personality prospectively predict life outcomes? Second, does parents' personality influence life outcomes for their child, above and beyond the child's own traits? Third, do adolescent-or parent-ratings interact, such that some child effects of personality may be mitigated or exacerbated by parental personality?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parental Personality Predicts Outcomes for Their Offspring</head><p>Although literature is still relatively sparse, there are some indications that parents' personality can impact their children's life outcomes. For instance, psychopathology-related outcomes for the child are associated with parents' personality. Similarity in personality between adolescents and their parents is negatively related to internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Van Tuijl et al., 2005)</ref>. Moreover, parent's levels of neuroticism or qualities related to neuroticism (e.g., emotionality; <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Orri et al., 2019)</ref> are positively related to both internalizing and externalizing problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bates et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dora &amp; Baydar, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Orri et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prinzie et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Prinzie et al., , 2005</ref>. Furthermore, low parental levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness predict self-harm in their adolescent offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gromatsky et al., 2017)</ref>. Another study found that adolescent substance use is predicted by higher maternal levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hojjat et al., 2016)</ref>. Maternal conscientiousness and neuroticism predict child levels of impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Xing et al., 2018)</ref>, which itself is related to future externalizing behavior in adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Leve et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>However, few studies examine the parent-child outcome association beyond psychopathology outcomes. Maternal warmth, which is a component of agreeableness, is positively associated with cognitive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Smith et al., 2000)</ref>. Children's socioemotional development is positively related to maternal expressiveness, a component of extraversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Laible, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Morrongiello &amp; House, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Davidson et al., 1987)</ref>. Some studies have examined health effects as well. One study found that lower levels of maternal conscientiousness predict higher rates of minor injuries in toddlers <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(van Aken et al., 2007)</ref> whereas another study found that diabetic children who had more agreeable mothers had better glycemic control (i.e., control of blood sugar levels; <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Vollrath et al., 2007)</ref>, even after controlling for child traits.</p><p>While some evidence exists establishing a link between parent personality and some child outcomes, many life outcomes have not been examined. Additional associations are expected as many of the mechanisms proposed that relate a child's personality to their outcomes are directly influenced by parental choices. For example, educational achievement is associated with studying <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Farkas et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Keith, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Nonis &amp; Hudson, 2010)</ref>, which is associated with conscientiousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Corker et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kappe &amp; Van Der Flier, 2012)</ref>, and homework time is influenced by parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fan &amp; Chen 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Keith et al., 1986)</ref>. Importantly, characteristics of the parents influence how they proceed to parent their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Prinzie et al., 2009)</ref>. Personality traits or other similar individual differences are one source of indicators that are consistently used to predict parenting outcomes. For example, parental personality traits can predict which type of parenting style or parenting behaviors someone is more likely to exhibit <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Sahithya &amp; Raman, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson &amp; Durbin, 2012ab)</ref>. Parental positive emotionality, negative emotionality, and levels of constraint are related to parental responsiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wilson &amp; Durbin, 2012a)</ref>, whereas conscientious mothers are more likely to exhibit an overcontrolling parenting style <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Neitzel &amp; Dopkins, 2004)</ref>. As for another example, maternal levels of negative affect are related to abusive parenting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gölcük &amp; Berument, 2019)</ref>. Together, this suggests that factors like parental personality traits could be associated with outcomes for their child(ren).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Child Personality Predicts Future Life Outcomes</head><p>Qualities of children and adolescents can influence their own future outcomes through how they interact with other people, engage in certain activities, select into particular situations, and perceive themselves and their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Roberts et al., 2008)</ref>. One set of these qualities, personality, defined as relatively enduring, individual differences in how people feel, think, and behave <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Shiner &amp; Caspi, 2003)</ref>, is an especially important predictor of life outcomes. While personality prediction findings are primarily investigated in adults (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Beck &amp; Jackson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2006)</ref>, these associations are also found in childhood and adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Soto &amp; Tackett, 2015;</ref>.</p><p>A large portion of research using childhood and adolescent personality focuses on psychopathology-related and health outcomes. For instance, higher levels of conscientiousness are associated with fewer externalizing problem behaviors, whereas higher levels of extraversion are positively associated with externalizing behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Prinzie et al., 2004)</ref>. Similarly, neuroticism and low extraversion are associated with social inhibition, and low agreeableness and low conscientiousness are associated with aggressiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asendorpf &amp; van Aken, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Overall poor global functioning in adolescence is predicted by higher levels of extraversion and neuroticism and by lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness in preschool <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gilbert et al., 2019)</ref>. Additionally, childhood conscientiousness predicts self-rated health and objective indicators of health in middle adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hampson et al., 2015)</ref>. For non-health outcomes, childhood conscientiousness and neuroticism are positively and negatively related to future career success in adulthood, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Judge et al., 1999)</ref>. The Big Five in adolescence are also related to relationship outcomes such as development of friendships, social aggression, and parenting quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Smack et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Tackett et al., 2014)</ref>. Notably, these personality-outcome associations continue to stretch into adulthood. For example, conscientiousness and openness are associated with later school achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asendorpf &amp; van Aken, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brandt et al., 2019)</ref> as well as occupational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Woods &amp; Hampson, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential Interactions Between Parent to Child</head><p>It is likely that the relationship between child and parent depends on one another, and that the nature of this relationship is further associated with outcomes. Through a process of mutual reinforcement, characteristics of the child and behaviors of the parent become parent-child reciprocities that further develop during childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Scaramella &amp; Leve, 2004)</ref>. For example, highly reactive children are expected to have greater difficulty learning to regulate emotions and this evokes harsher parenting <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Scaramella &amp; Leve, 2004)</ref>. Furthermore, harsh parenting, negative emotional reactivity, and poor emotion regulation reinforce each other and lead to a cycle of coercive parent-child relationships across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Scaramella &amp; Leve, 2004)</ref>. Then, this cycle of coercive parent-child interactions further diminishes the child's emotional regulatory capacities and affects their ability to form peer relationships in school. As for another example, children with higher levels of impulsivity seem to evoke poorer parental monitoring behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Elam et al., 2017)</ref>, which themselves are associated with parental personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Crouter &amp; Head, 2002)</ref>. This poorer parenting monitoring then in turn increases the chance of impulsive behaviors by the child <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Elam et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kiesner et al., 2010)</ref>. Together, these example findings suggest that the influence of parent personality may, at least in part, depend on child personality and its subsequent effects on parenting behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Achtergarde et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to evocative mechanisms occurring that have effects through paths such as parenting behaviors, mutually reinforcing processes among child and parent personality may take place, too. Indeed, some studies have shown a longitudinal relationship between qualities of the child and parent over time such that they develop in tandem. For example, having infants with higher levels of positive affectivity predicted increases in parental extraversion and having infants with higher levels of activity predicted a decrease in parental neuroticism across a period of five years <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Komsi et al., 2008)</ref>. Conversely, parent personalities can predict changes in child qualities. For instance, higher levels of parental extraversion predict increases in children's level of effortful control and higher parental neuroticism predicts increases in child's negative affect levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Komsi et al., 2008)</ref>. These reciprocal associations between qualities of the children and the parents support that not only could there be direct relationships predicting child outcomes, but also that the associations may depend on one another.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study</head><p>Using a large, longitudinal representative sample of families, the current study has three primary aims. For Aim 1, we will examine how well adolescent personality prospectively predicts outcomes. For Aim 2, we will examine if parent personality influences adolescent outcomes, even above and beyond their child's own traits. We will examine a number of life outcomes that have not previously been examined with child and parent personality across several life domains, such as education, relationships, and civic engagement. For Aim 3, we will investigate if child-or parent-ratings interact, such that some adolescent effects of personality may be mitigated or exacerbated by parental personality. We will use Response Surface Analyses (RSAs) to better examine the influence of parent personality, as well as examine the interaction between them. Past studies examining the influence of personality in dyads have revealed interactive effects such as these for important outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bleidorn et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Roberts et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>For the adolescents' traits, we expect that all traits will be associated with the outcomes and the associations will align with what past literature on personality prediction has found. For instance, we expect conscientiousness and neuroticism to be associated with the health outcomes, extraversion and agreeableness to be associated with the civic engagement outcomes, and conscientiousness and openness to be associated with grades <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asendorpf &amp; van Aken, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Smack et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Soto &amp; Tackett, 2015)</ref>. For the parent traits, we will borrow from both the parent and relationships literature by expecting that parent conscientiousness will have a compensatory effect and be related to the same outcomes that adolescent conscientiousness is related to (i.e., health outcomes; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Roberts et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">van Aken et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Vollrath et al., 2007)</ref>. Parental neuroticism has previously predicted externalizing behaviors in their offspring (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hojjat et al., 2016)</ref>, thus we expect similar associations with outcomes such as substance use. Additionally, we expect that parent extraversion and agreeableness will also be related to civic engagement outcomes, as parents are likely to bring their children to their social outings since adolescents still somewhat lack the autonomy to always do separate things from their parents. Ultimately, we expect that similar traits matter for both adolescents and their parents, and the impact of their joint effects will more strongly link adolescents to these outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>In this paper, we will use data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) study.</p><p>The GSOEP study (Socio-Economic Panel, 2018) is an ongoing longitudinal study conducted by the German Institute of Economic Research (DIW Berlin) collecting data on individuals in more than 11,000 German households. The data to be used in this study are freely available by application at https://www.diw.de/soep and study materials (including all R code) are available at https://osf.io/j8y4x/. Data collection began in 1984 and continues annually, with the latest release in 2019. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at [blinded institution name] deemed this project exempt from IRB approval because it involves accessing a publicly available dataset and thus does not meet federal definitions under the jurisdiction of an IRB (IRB ID#: 202205176). The total sample size will consist of 19,799 individuals that a) are part of a child-parent dyad and b) have personality and outcome data (Nchildren = 9,395, Nadults = 10,404).</p><p>The children in this study will consist of those aged 11-12, 13-14, and 16-17. Each age group is assessed with their own age-specific, self-report questionnaires, but they are all part of the same overall GSOEP study (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref> for further information regarding participant sample size and number of responses per questionnaire). Across all waves, the average age among the children is M = 14.94 (SD = 2.25) and they are 49% female. Across all waves, the average age among the parents is M = 45.58 (SD = 8.18) and they are 56% female. The number of waves completed by adolescents for personality measures ranged from one to three (M = 1.22, SD = 0.47). The number of adolescents with only one wave was 7,633; two waves was 1,499; and three waves was 263. If an adolescent had multiple waves of personality data, their scores for each trait were aggregated across all available waves. The number of waves completed by parents for their own personality ratings ranged from 1 to 5 (M = 2.63, SD = 1.31). The number of parents with one wave was 2,517; two waves was 2,385; three waves was 3,339; four waves was 657; and five waves was 1,506. Similar to the adolescents, if a parent had multiple waves of personality data, scores for each trait were averaged across their available waves of data. The average age at the wave of the child outcomes was 15.55 (SD = 0.75).</p><p>Out of the 9,395 children, 6,958 had personality data from both parents; 2,025 had personality data just from the mother; and 415 had personality data just from the father. To maximize the available amount of data, in instances where a child had personality data from both parents, personality measures were averaged across the parents. This final aggregation resulted in there being 9,395 child-parent dyads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Big Five</head><p>Children. For the groups of youths ages 11-12, 13-14, and 16-17, the youths completed self-report questions about the Big Five traits in the Pre-Teen Questionnaire, Early Youth Questionnaire, and Youth Questionnaire, respectively. The same Big Five measure was administered in each questionnaire and items were selected from the Big Five Inventory (BFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">John &amp; Srivastava, 1999)</ref>. Extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism all had three items while openness had four items. An example item for extraversion is, "is outgoing, sociable"; for agreeableness, "is sometimes somewhat rude to others" (reverse-scored); for conscientiousness, "does a thorough job"; for neuroticism, "worries a lot"; and for openness, "is original, comes up with new ideas." All items were scored on a seven-point Likert scale (1 = does not apply to me at all, 7 = applies to me perfectly). Parents. The Big Five items were scored on a 1 to 7 Likert scale (1 = "does not apply" to 7 = "applies fully"). An example item for extraversion, translated to English, is, "I am sociable"; for agreeableness, "I am able to forgive"; for conscientiousness, "I tend to be lazy" (reversescored); for neuroticism, "I deal well with stress" (reverse-scored); and for openness, "I have a lively imagination." Cronbach's alpha estimates are .67 for extraversion, .49 for agreeableness, .58 for conscientiousness, .63 for neuroticism, and .61 for openness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p>Only outcomes for the adolescent will be included in this study. These will include nine outcomes in multiple life domains, such as health, education, family, and civic engagement. For health outcomes, we will look at BMI (calculated from height and weight variables), selfreported health status (1 = very good, 5 = bad), and if the youth ever reported use of alcohol or cigarettes (referred to as "substance use" from hereafter; 0 = no, 1 = yes). For education, grades in school (averaged across grades for math and German; possible scores of 1-6) will be the outcome. For family-related variables, a composite of frequency of arguing with family (i.e., siblings, mother, and/or father) will be the outcome (0 = never, 4 = very often). For civic engagement-related variables, number of close friends, an average of frequency of engagement in leisure activities (0 = never, 4 = daily), frequency of church attendance (0 = never, 4 = daily), and frequency of volunteering (0 = never, 4 = daily) will be the outcomes. Possible leisure activities were those that existed in all questionnaires and involved some active activity (i.e., activities such as relaxing, watching TV, or surfing the internet were not included). These consisted of playing music; sports; dancing or acting; painting or doing arts and crafts; doing technical work; reading; spending time with a partner, friends, or family; participating in a social commitment; or engaging with a youth group (e.g., pathfinders, environmental groups).</p><p>Outcomes are measured in the same survey that the personality traits are measured for each age group. To be included in an analysis, an outcome needed to be measured, at minimum, at the same wave of the last personality measure for a participant (i.e., outcomes measured after the final wave were also included). We used the latest outcome measure for all participants in our analyses. The sample size per outcome varies. The sample size for BMI is 9,098; health status is 7,736; substance use is 2,387; grades in school is 7,790; number of close friends is 5,416; frequency of engagement in leisure activities is 9,390; frequency of church attendance is 9,332; and frequency of volunteering is 5,262.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic Plan</head><p>Ultimately, we will construct RSAs using a structural equation modeling framework.</p><p>This consists of running polynomial regression analyses and then visualizing results with response surface plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Edwards, 2002)</ref>. RSAs allow us to examine actor effects, partner effects, and their interaction for all levels of each predictor (i.e., high versus low and low versus low levels of each predictor as opposed to the traditional  one standard deviation of each predictor that an interaction typically tests; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Edwards, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Edwards &amp; Parry, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Nestler et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Shanock et al., 2010)</ref>. Overall, this analysis provides more information about the complex relationship between all possible combinations of predictors compared to other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barranti et al., 2017)</ref>. Following a recommendation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aiken and West (1991)</ref> regarding power for detecting higher-order terms in an RSA, it is advisable to have two to three times as many participants as is needed to detect linear effects. Using the pwr package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Champely et al., 2018)</ref>, for a significance level of  = .01, power of 80%, and a small effect of r = .01, we would need a sample size of 1,163. Thus, for any given outcome, we have over two to eight times the recommended sample size and should have sufficient power to detect effects, even at our more conservative  = .01 threshold. All analyses will be conducted in R statistical software (R Core Team, 2021) using the RSA package <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Schönbrodt, 2015)</ref> and the lavaan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rosseel, 2012</ref>). All R code for cleaning/compositing the variables and example code for analyses (File S1) are available at https://osf.io/j8y4x/.</p><p>First, all data were downloaded from the data repository (https://www.diw.de/soep). For the Big Five variables, all items were cleaned, reverse-coded, and composited. The trait scores across all waves for each participant were composited and these composite personality traits will be the final variables used in all models. For the outcome variables, they were similarly cleaned as necessary.</p><p>Then, for Aim 1, we will predict each outcome using only the composite adolescent personality traits. We will use the lavaan package for these analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>. These analyses will allow us to have a simple direct test of if each adolescent personality trait is related to outcomes, and further serve as a point of comparison for results in Aims 2 and 3 as the models get more complex. A separate model for each personality trait and outcome will be run, for a total of 45 models (5 traits for each of the 9 outcomes). Due to the large number of models, the significance threshold will be set at a more conservative  = .01 threshold. An example equation for the models can be demonstrated with the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= 0 + 1 ℎ . +</formula><p>Where 0 represents the overall intercept; 1 represents the effect of each adolescent personality trait; and represents the error term. Since these models serve as a foundation for the RSA models, the variables will be scaled equivalently. As the average level of a trait is typically more meaningful than the default midpoint of the response scale, and using standardized variables enhances interpretability and is in line with traditional interaction interpretations (i.e.,  one standard deviation), each adolescent trait will be standardized.</p><p>Next, for Aim 2, we will predict each adolescent outcome using both the composite adolescent and parent personality traits. In total, 225 regression analyses will be run (25 models per outcome (combinations of each 5 child traits x 5 adult traits), 9 outcomes in total). Similar to Aim 1, due to the large number of models, the significance threshold will be set at  = .01. An example equation for the models can be demonstrated with the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= 0 + 1 ℎ . + 2 . +</formula><p>Where 0 represents the overall intercept; 1 represents the effect of each adolescent personality trait, above and beyond the parent trait; 2 represents the effect of each adolescent personality trait, above and beyond the adolescent trait; and represents the error term for each dyad. Each adolescent and parent trait will again be standardized. For Aim 2, 2 , which captures the effect of parent personality above and beyond child traits, is of primary interest.</p><p>Lastly, for Aim 3, separate RSAs for each outcome, adolescent trait, and parent combination will be constructed. The RSA package will be used for these analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Schönbrodt, 2015</ref>). We will again use the composite personality traits across available waves for a participant. The self-report adolescent traits will be used alongside the traits from parent selfreport to predict adolescent outcomes in various life domains. In total, 225 polynomial regression analyses will be run (25 models per outcome (combinations of each 5 child traits x 5 adult traits), 9 outcomes in total). Similar to the previous models, the significance threshold will be set at  = .</p><p>01. An example equation for the models can be demonstrated with the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= 0 + 1 ℎ . + 2 . + 3 ℎ . 2 + 4 ℎ . * . + 5 . 2 +</formula><p>Where 0 represents the overall intercept; 1 represents the effect of each adolescent personality trait, above and beyond the parent trait; 2 represents the effect of each adolescent personality trait, above and beyond the adolescent trait; 3 represents the quadratic effect of each adolescent personality trait; 4 represents the interaction effect of each adolescent and parent personality trait; 5 represents the quadratic effect of each parent personality trait; and represents the error term for each dyad. Adolescent and parent personality traits will again both be standardized. For Aim 3, 4 , the interaction of adolescent personality and parent personality traits, is of primary interest. We will then use the coefficients from the polynomial regressions with significant interaction effects to test for congruence effects and construct response surface plots.</p><p>Congruence effects will inform us if it is the similarity or a matching between child and parent personalities that predict optimal values of the outcome variables. These will be tested by determining if the first principal axis significantly differs from the line of congruence (LOC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Edwards, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Humberg et al., 2019)</ref>. Then, the plots will allow us to visualize the results in a three-dimensional space and more comprehensively examine the meaning and magnitude of the effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does adolescent personality predict outcomes?</head><p>First, for Aim 1, we examined if the self-reported Big Five traits predicted outcomes for the adolescents. Only the adolescent outcomes and traits were included in these models. In line with past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Soto &amp; Tackett, 2015;</ref>, many associations emerged <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1; Table S2</ref>). Health status, average grades, frequency of leisure activities, and frequency of attending church were all positively predicted by extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness and negatively predicted by neuroticism. BMI and frequency of arguing with family members were negatively predicted by agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness and positively predicted by neuroticism. Substance use was positively predicted by extraversion and negatively predicted by agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness.</p><p>Number of close friends was positively predicted by extraversion and negatively predicted by neuroticism. Lastly, frequency of volunteering was positively predicted by extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness and negatively predicted by neuroticism.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref> for unstandardized estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals for each model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does parent personality predict outcomes for their adolescent child?</head><p>Next, for Aim 2, we examined if parent personality predicted outcomes for their children, above and beyond the child's own traits. Parent personality predicted numerous child outcomes <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2; Tables S3-S11</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figures 1A-G)</ref>. In this section, we primarily report the parent effects that predicted an outcome after controlling for all five child's traits. Thus, it is implied that all parent effects listed in this section predicted an outcome above and beyond all children's traits unless noted otherwise.</p><p>Adolescent BMI was positively predicted by parent neuroticism ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>) and</p><p>negatively by parent openness. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>, parent neuroticism is plotted against child neuroticism to predict adolescent BMI, showing predicted BMI values for all combinations of child and parent neuroticism values. As both child and parent neuroticism increase along their respective axes, adolescent BMI increases as well. The maximum predicted BMI value occurs when child and parent neuroticism values are both at their highest. It can also be seen from the plot, as well as the estimates themselves <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2; Table S3</ref>), that the child's own neuroticism has a larger impact on their BMI such that changes along the child's level of neuroticism more greatly affects the predicted BMI value, holding parent neuroticism constant.</p><p>Adolescent health status was positively predicted by parent agreeableness and conscientiousness ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>) and negatively by parent neuroticism. As both child and parent conscientiousness increase along their respective axes, adolescent health status increases as well.</p><p>The maximum predicted health status value can be seen at the values for which child and parent conscientiousness values are both at their highest. Additionally, and similar to BMI, the child's own trait levels have a larger impact on their health status.</p><p>Next, parent neuroticism negatively predicted grades in school. As seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>, higher levels of neuroticism for both child and parent were associated with lower grades. Those adolescents with the highest predicted GPA are those who have low levels of neuroticism and have parents who are low in neuroticism. Additionally, parent extraversion negatively predicted adolescent grades above and beyond all child traits except for agreeableness (p = .011).</p><p>For frequency of arguing with family members, parental levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness negatively predicted this outcome. In comparison, parental neuroticism positively predicted adolescent reporting of arguing with family members. As seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1D</ref>, high levels of child and parent agreeableness are associated with fewer arguments with family members. In contrast with other effects, parent agreeableness has a descriptively stronger impact for frequency of arguing with family compared to adolescent agreeableness.</p><p>For frequency of engagement in leisure activities, this outcome was negatively predicted by parent neuroticism and positively by parent openness ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1E</ref>). Among the adolescent Big Five traits, openness was the trait with the associations of the largest magnitude, and it can be seen that the highest frequency of engagement in leisure activities occurs for adolescents with high levels of openness that have parents also with high levels of openness. Adolescent church attendance was negatively predicted by parent extraversion ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1F</ref>) and conscientiousness. In contrast with parent extraversion and conscientiousness, the adolescents' reports of these traits were both positively associated with church attendance. Lastly, parent neuroticism negatively predicted frequency of volunteering ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1G</ref>), whereas adolescent neuroticism was not significantly associated with volunteering.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do child-and parent-ratings of personality interact to predict outcomes for the adolescent?</head><p>Lastly, for Aim 3, we investigated if child-and parent-ratings of personality interacted to predict outcomes for the adolescent. Furthermore, among those models with significant childparent trait interactions, we also tested for congruence effects to indicate if it was the similarity or a matching between the adolescent and parent traits that predicted optimal values of the outcome variables. Across all models, 20 (out of 225 possible) child-parent trait interactions emerged for the prediction of four outcomes <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3)</ref>. Estimates for all models are available in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables S12a-S20e</ref>. Figures for every model with a significant child-parent interaction effect are available in supplementary materials ( <ref type="figure">Figures S1-S20</ref>). Below, we describe general findings and highlight informative examples that also had main effects for the child and parent traits. Overall, most of the interactions were the result of plateauing of parental effectsthat is, once the parent and child personality reached a certain level, additional gains were not predictive.</p><p>By far, the most interaction effects emerged for the outcome of adolescent-reported frequency of arguing with family members (15/20 of the significant interactions). In general, all parent and child traits except for neuroticism had a negative association with adolescent-reported frequency of arguing <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>; Tables S16a-e). Accordingly, the interactions that emerged among these traits predicted even less frequency of arguing, such that child-parent dyads where both scored higher resulted in less reported arguing with family members by the teen. For example, both child and parent agreeableness predict a lower frequency of arguing as main effects, and their interaction indicates that child-parent dyads in which both individuals are high in this trait are predicted to argue even less <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3</ref>; <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S16b</ref>). The opposite was true for interactions involving neuroticism. For example, as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>, the predicted frequency of arguing increases curvilinearly as parent conscientiousness and child neuroticism increase, with the highest predicted frequency of arguing occurring for parent-child dyads in which the child is very high on neuroticism and parents have average levels of conscientiousness. Parent conscientiousness itself is protective, however, as it has a significant quadratic effect and the predicted frequency of arguing decrease at very high levels of parent conscientiousness.</p><p>As for an example of an interaction for an outcome other than frequency of arguing with family members, for frequency of engagement in leisure activities, an interaction emerged between parent conscientiousness and child openness <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>; Tables S18a-e).</p><p>Parent conscientiousness had a small negative association with adolescent leisure engagement whereas the child's openness had a larger and positive association. The interaction amongst these two indicated that child-parent dyads that scored higher than average on their respective traits resulted in even less engagement in leisure activities by the youth.</p><p>Another example of an interaction that emerged was between parent neuroticism and child openness for frequency of church attendance <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>; Tables S19a-e). Parent neuroticism had a negative association with adolescent church attendance whereas the youth's levels of openness were positively associated with it. The interaction between the two indicated that child-parent dyads that scored higher than average on their respective traits predicted an increase in church attendance by the youth. The highest level of church attendance was predicted by very high levels of child openness and above average levels of parent neuroticism. Note. Standardized estimates are presented in the above table. Only interactions that were significant at p &lt; .01 are shown. See Tables S16a-e, S18e, S19a, S19e, and S20a for unstandardized estimates and their associated 95% confidence intervals for each model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2 Example Plots from RSA Models with Child and Parent Main Effects and Interaction</head><p>Note. Three plots from the RSA models with significant child and parent main effects and an interaction effect are shown above. Panel A is for the interaction between child neuroticism and parent conscientiousness for arguing with family members. Panel B is for the interaction between child openness and parent conscientiousness for engagement in leisure activities. Panel C is for the interaction between child openness and parent neuroticism for church attendance.</p><p>Taken together, the results of these interaction analyses indicate that, generally, adolescent and parent personality traits do not often interact with one another to predict outcomes for the adolescent child. The only outcome with a robust pattern of interaction effects across multiple traits (15/20 possible being significant) was that of frequency of arguing with family members. However, a few other trait-by-trait interactions did emerge for some outcomes, particularly those involving the adolescents' extraversion and openness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we examined the joint influence of adolescent and parent personality on outcomes for the adolescents. First, we found that adolescent Big Five traits predicted every single one of our outcomes, replicating past work that has also shown adolescent personality has high predictive utility across a range of outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Soto &amp; Tackett, 2015;</ref>. Second, parent personality predicted many outcomes for their teens as well, even above and beyond the adolescent's own personality traits. These associations were numerous and of comparable magnitude to those of the adolescent personality trait associations. Third, child and parent personality did not often interact to predict outcomes, suggesting that, in general, child and parent effects operate mostly independent of one another when predicting outcomes for the child. Below, we discuss potential reasons for the plethora of parent effects and possible implications for the overall lack of interaction effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parent Personality is Important for Child Outcomes</head><p>In our study, parent personality traits predicted adolescent outcomes including BMI, selfreported health status, substance use, average grades, frequency of arguing with family members, frequency of engaging in leisure activities, church attendance, and frequency of volunteering.</p><p>That is, parent personality predicted all adolescent outcomes except their number of close friends. In general, these findings parallel the study of adult relationships, where partner personality has an impact on their spouse's life outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barelds, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dyrenforth et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Roberts et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Robins et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Solomon &amp; Jackson, 2014b)</ref>. These findings reinforce the importance of the parent-child relationship, demonstrating that individual differences of the parent impact their child's outcomes.</p><p>Parent traits previously linked to health outcomes were associated with adolescent health markers. For example, conscientiousness was positively related to their child's self-reported health status. Conscientiousness is the Big Five trait most routinely linked to health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brummett et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hill et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jackson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jokela et al., 2018;</ref> and is one of the main traits found to have compensatory effects on health in child-mother dyads <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(van Aken et al., 2007)</ref> and other interpersonal dyads such as romantic partners . Thus, the association of parent's conscientiousness with their child's health status,</p><p>even when controlling for their child's level of conscientiousness, further underscores the utility of having conscientious people in one's social sphere.</p><p>The association between parent conscientiousness and childhood health likely arises due to the parent's impact on health behaviors for their child, given the association between conscientiousness and health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bogg &amp; Roberts, 2004)</ref>. For example, if the family eats healthy meals together, is active together, or the importance of health is prioritized, the child may directly benefit in their health. Similar findings are found for spousal levels of conscientiousness on partner health, as a spouse has a similar influence on meal and activity choice that a parent does <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Roberts et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In comparison, the child levels of personality were independently associated with their own health. Here, the child's own conscientiousness is perhaps most important in daily life routines that do not involve their parents such as peer involvement. Or, there could be some "scaling" effect, such that relative to a less conscientious child, the conscientious child may better recognize the importance of and follow through with their parents' care for health and incorporate their healthy habits as their own, which ensures the child not only benefits from their parents' conscientiousness but also continues to independently reap the rewards of their own as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hill &amp; Jackson, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Parent neuroticism was also associated with adolescent health outcomes. In past work, neuroticism has been linked to numerous health outcomes, such as higher BMI, poorer subjective health status, and less engagement in positive health behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brummett et al., 2006;</ref>. While neuroticism is associated with health behaviors, the health effects of neuroticism are typically viewed as operating through stress pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kern &amp; Friedman, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Health behaviors as such are thus a way to decrease these higher levels of stress. This pattern suggests that the influence of parent neuroticism may be through a "second hand" stress pathway, whereby being around someone who tends to have high levels of anxiety may be detrimental to one's health. Interestingly, these findings are not seen in the adult literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Roberts et al., 2009)</ref>, suggesting that parents may play an especially important role for their child's health.</p><p>Although conscientiousness and neuroticism are often the traits most linked to health outcomes, additional associations for other parent traits also emerged. Parent agreeableness was positively related to the adolescent's self-report health status. Higher levels of agreeableness are sometimes associated with better physical and subjective health <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Turiano et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">c.f., Wright et al., 2022)</ref>, though this is reasoned to occur through physiological pathways as opposed to health behavior pathways, making it unlikely that the parent's agreeableness would then impact their child's health in a similar way to parent conscientiousness. One study that found better glycemic control in diabetic children that had more agreeable mothers suggested that it was the high level of care and involvement of the mother in the child's care that led to the association <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Vollrath et al., 2007)</ref>. Thus, a similar mechanism could be at play here, such that these parents are focused on the health of their children and prioritized their needs first.</p><p>Most past research examining the associations between parent personality and outcomes for their child(ren) has primarily focused on psychopathology-related outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dora &amp; Baydar, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Orri et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prinzie et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Prinzie et al., , 2005</ref>. In our study, adolescent substance was sometimes negatively predicted by parental levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, which is very similar to findings of a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hojjat et al., 2016)</ref>. However, these parent associations only emerged above and beyond models including child extraversion.</p><p>This suggests these parent associations are not extremely robust as they do not emerge when the other child Big Five traits are accounted for, whereas all child traits but neuroticism consistently predicted substance use. Our lack of findings for parent neuroticism is somewhat surprising as past work has found that parent's levels of neuroticism are positively related to externalizing problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dora &amp; Baydar, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Orri et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prinzie et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Prinzie et al., , 2005</ref>. However, it is likely that child traits are more strongly related to adolescent substance use than parent neuroticism is, and thus this association became null once child traits were accounted for.</p><p>Alternatively, parent neuroticism might be predictive of more serious substance use (i.e., "harder" drugs) or other forms of externalizing behaviors (e.g., criminal behavior), and associations with our substance use variable composed solely of alcohol and cigarette use accordingly did not emerge.</p><p>Additionally, parent extraversion and neuroticism were negatively associated with average child grades. For parent extraversion, this association is somewhat surprising, as extraversion is associated with an authoritative parenting style <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Huver et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Krupić et al., 2020)</ref> which itself is positively related to child's academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Steinberg et al., 1992)</ref>.</p><p>However, it could be the case that the highly extraverted parent is always out socializing, and brings their child along with them, or often has people over at the house. In either case, that is less time the teen has to spend on homework and studying, and their grades could understandably suffer because of that. This lack of parental concern for ensuring their teen has adequate time and space to focus on schoolwork could be reflective of neglectful or permissive parenting styles, or a general lack of parental values for school achievement, all of which are associated with worse academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pinquart, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Steinberg et al., 1992)</ref>. For parent neuroticism, the highly neurotic parent could be a source of stress for their teen, and whether it be due to their emotional volatility or own worries and stresses they take out on their family, this could negatively impact their child. These behaviors on behalf of the parent can contribute to a negative home environment which has been found to negatively impact child's school performance <ref type="bibr">(Star &amp; Riemann, 2022)</ref>. It might be difficult to focus on schoolwork in those conditions, and thus the negative association with grades emerges. Alternatively, it could be that the neurotic parent is overly concerned with their child's academic performance, and this leads to increased pressure on the teen. Past work as found a negative relationship with high levels of parental control and expectations for grades with academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pinquart, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Silinskas &amp; Kikas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Starr &amp; Riemann, 2022)</ref>, as well as a positive association between neuroticism and strict parental control <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Huver et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prinzie et al., 2004)</ref>, so if the neurotic parent restricts what the teen can do in their free time to ensure they are finishing schoolwork and studying, this association could also emerge.</p><p>Findings for the influence of parental personality and school are especially noteworthy in that there were limited effects of parental levels of conscientiousness. Conscientiousness is robustly associated with grades and school achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brandt et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Noftle &amp; Robins, 2007)</ref>, due in part to the ability to devote time to study, be organized, and stay attuned in class <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hofer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">MacCann et al., 2009)</ref>. However, our results suggest that the organizational aspects of parental conscientiousness do not appear to shape adolescent educational outcomes.</p><p>Moreover, our findings do not match with the adult equivalent domain, occupational success,</p><p>where conscientious partners impact occupational income and promotions in their spouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Solomon &amp; Jackson, 2014a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Child and Parent Personality Effects Are (Mostly) Independent</head><p>We found that for majority of our trait-outcome combinations, child and parent personality traits did not interact to predict the outcome above and beyond each trait's own main effects. In other words, some special combination of child and parent trait-levels is not necessary for associations with adolescent outcomes to emerge. This is similar to other dyadic work, particularly that of romantic partners (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barelds, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dyrenforth et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Roberts et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Robins et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Solomon &amp; Jackson, 2014b)</ref>, and other research examining trait-bytrait interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Vize et al., 2022)</ref>. This pattern of results suggests that child and parent personality trait effects operate mostly independently, such that both adolescent and parent traits matter, but the influence of one person's trait is not contingent upon the other person also having a particular level of a trait. This observation has many implications, including how parent personality can perhaps independently negate some undesirable associations of the child's own traits with outcomes -or counteract positive effects of the child's traits. Below, we describe three of the possible implications from this finding of child and parent traits operating independently.</p><p>First, the impact of parent's traits can particularly shine when parent traits have an effect and child traits do not. This pattern of results emerged for frequency of arguing with family members. In particular, even though the adolescent's extraversion had no association with their reported frequency of arguing with their family members, their parents' extraversion was negatively associated with it. This situation is an interesting contrast to the idea of "compensatory" effects applied to personality traits, such that an individual lacking in a certain quality is able to benefit from a close other having that quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bäckman &amp; Dixon, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baltes, 1997)</ref>. In this situation, it appears that lacking in a quality is not the issue, as adolescent extraversion is just simply unrelated to their self-reported frequency of arguing with family members. Instead, it could be that the way in which behavioral manifestations of extraversion differ between adolescents and their parents, and these differential behaviors are what lead to the unique associations.</p><p>Second, the impact of the parent traits can counteract the influence of the child's traits when the child and parent traits have associations with outcomes in the opposite direction of one another. This pattern of results emerged a few times. The only outcome where there was a clear disadvantage to the parent traits' associations was that of average grades in school. Child extraversion was positively associated with higher grades whereas parent extraversion had a negative association. The conflicting association could arise from different behaviors that extraversion drives children and their parents to do. For children, the high extraversion could motivate them to seek out studying with others, instigate a meeting with their teachers if and when they are struggling, or participate more in class, which might lead to enhanced learning and/or inform their teachers if they are not understanding the material <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mello, 2010)</ref>. In comparison, the parents' extraversion might result in social behaviors that are a detriment to their teen, such that they are always out socializing and bring their teen with them or that they often have people over at the house, resulting in less time the teen has to spend on schoolwork.</p><p>Third, the impact of the parent's traits can make it more likely their children exhibit a certain outcome, thereby offering another pathway for this association to arise, independent of the mechanisms linking the child's traits with the outcome. This pattern of results emerged quite often, such that child and parent traits had the same direction of association with an outcome.</p><p>The preponderance of these effects suggests that the mechanisms linking child and parent traits with outcomes for the adolescent are unique, such that difference variance is being captured through these trait-outcome combinations.</p><p>Identifying these independent pathways can be valuable and potentially useful for a couple reasons. First, adolescence is generally a period of great change, including changes in self-concept, identity, and personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Klimstra, 2013)</ref>. A teen could experience many instances of brief or long-lasting changes to how they view themselves and their behavior, which could have implications for their continued successful development and attainment of beneficial outcomes. While personality development is an ongoing process for their parents as well, as this is a lifelong process <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lucas &amp; Donnellan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Roberts et al., 2008)</ref>, the changes are likely to be less pronounced and abrupt as what their adolescents may show. Due to this, the relative greater stability of their parents' personalities can offer a source of constancy for the teens. This could help ensure that teens can still reap the benefits from associations of particular traits with certain outcomes, even if their own personalities might be less solidified during that time. Second, and on a somewhat similar note, in addition to changes in internal states and self-concepts, changes in external circumstances can arise as well. If the pathways linking child and parent traits with adolescent outcomes differ, then there is a greater chance that some of these mechanisms may be more resilient or less affected by environmental upheavals.</p><p>Despite mostly independent effects of child and parent personality, a number of interactions did emerge. By far, the most interaction effects were found for the outcome of arguing with family members, which is the only outcome that involves both the parent and the child. As this is a dyadic behavior, actions by one party likely signal how the other person should</p><p>react, suggesting that one party's behavior may depend on the behavioral "guide" of the other.</p><p>Importantly, these guides for how to react appear to transcend trait-boundary lines. For instance, the highly open parent and highly agreeable teen, on their own, are less likely to argue a lot according to the adolescent's reports. However, just because someone is open-minded, this does not necessarily mean they can always discuss a divisive topic amicably or empathize with the other person's point of view. Similarly, just because someone is highly agreeable, this does not mean they are willing to see beyond their own perspectives or consider new viewpoints. In the case of the open parent and agreeable teen, though, the behaviors by each individual may lead the other to act in a similar fashionthus even further decreasing the frequency of arguing than would be attributable to either's trait levels alone. This example demonstrates how the behaviors associated with the personalities of the teen and parent can possibly elicit somewhat out-ofcharacter behaviors in the other personleading to interactive effects that uniquely predict outcomes. However, even in the presence of these interactions, each individual's own traits are still consequential. For instance, in the interactions involving child neuroticism, the parents having high levels of all traits except neuroticism was protective such that the parents' high levels of these other traits counteracted the interactive effect to some degree, rendering those parents with average levels of traits being most susceptible to high levels of arguing reported by their teen. This example of a nuanced relationship between child and parent traits highlights the benefit offered by examining the entire response parameter space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our study had a few limitations to note. First, we did not look at these associations across specific age periods but rather just examined the period of adolescence as a whole. As adolescence is often a period of significant change <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Klimstra, 2013)</ref> and represents the start of a shift in autonomy from one's parents, future research would benefit from considering how age may impact these findings. Second, we did not examine the mechanisms linking the associations between child and parent traits in our study. Given the many independent effects, it could be and likely is the case that the mechanisms linking these traits with outcomes differ between outcomes for adolescents and parents. Discovering if this is the case could offer more insight into precisely how these pathways emerge for child and parent trait-outcome associations. Third, all outcomes were self-reported by the adolescent, which might introduce some bias. That is, a different pattern of results might have emerged if parent-reported outcomes were also included or used instead. Ideally, having both would enable researchers to detect and control for any unique method-variance that emerged for child-reported traits and outcomes or parent-reported traits and outcomes, thus being able to get closer to a "true" effect. Lastly, to maximize our available amount of data, we often averaged personality ratings across both parents. It could be the case that some parent associations or child-parent interactions are contingent upon the gender of the parent. Future studies in which these gender-specific effects may be of theoretical interest may want to isolate the effects of mothers and fathers to ensure the results are comparable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we investigated if parent personality predicts outcomes for their adolescent and if parent and child personality traits interact to further exacerbate or mitigate these traitoutcome associations for the adolescent. We found considerable evidence of parent personality being independently linked to outcomes for their child, above and beyond the associations of their child's own traits. In contrast, we found many fewer instances of child and parent traits interacting to predict adolescent outcomes. Our results suggest that the mechanisms linking child and parent traits to outcomes for the child operate mostly independently of one another, offering many opportunities for the personality of parents to offer a source of stability and links to beneficial outcomes for the teen while they continue developing and navigate through the period of adolescence.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The ranges of the standardized estimates for each parent trait per outcome are presented in the above table.
