			<abstract>
				<p>Adolescents aspire for independence. Successful independence means knowing when to rely on one&apos;s own knowledge and when to listen to others. A critical prerequisite thus is a welldeveloped metacognitive ability to accurately assess the quality of one&apos;s own knowledge. Little is known about whether the strive to become an independent decision-maker in adolescence is underpinned by the necessary metacognitive skills. Here, we demonstrate that metacognition matures from childhood to adolescence (N=107) and that this process coincides with greater independent decision making. We show that adolescents, in contrast to children, take on others&apos; advice less often, but only when the advice is misleading. Finally, we demonstrate that adolescents&apos; reduced reliance on others&apos; feedback is fully explained by their increased metacognitive skills, suggesting that a developing ability to introspect may support independent decision making in adolescence.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Adolescents strive for independence, and are often accused of not listening to their parents' advice. According to Socrates, "they have bad manners, contempt for authority; […] they contradict their parents <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> and tyrannize their teachers" <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Patty &amp; Johnson, 1953)</ref>. Today's stereotypes about teenagers often echo this sentiment that teenagers are indignant towards the wishes of their parents or teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Stern, 2005)</ref>. Known as the 'separation-individuation' arbitration <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Koepke &amp; Denissen, 2012)</ref>, adolescence is a time when becoming independent from one's parents is particularly pronounced, as adolescents heed increasing control over their own decisions.</p><p>Becoming an independent decision maker is an important step towards full adult autonomy.</p><p>However, resistance to authority <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kuhn &amp; Laird, 2011)</ref> and increased risk-taking behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Duell et al., 2018)</ref> during this period has led to the assumption that adolescents still lack the necessary abilities for making good independent decisions. This stands, at least in part, in contrast to legal and constitutional rights that allow adolescents to make independent decisions without consulting others first (e.g. medical treatment decisions, online privacy consenting, driving, voting). What are the cognitive processes that enable us to become independent and good decision makers, and when do they develop?</p><p>A critical part of being an independent decision-maker is the ability to accurately judge one's previous decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Batha &amp; Carroll, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. Placing too much trust in previously poor decisions will likely result in subsequent decisions that are similarly poor. Thus, metacognitive ability -the ability to accurately introspect on one's own decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Flavell, 1979)</ref> is critical when deciding how much to rely on our own decisions or on the advice of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fiedler, Hütter, Schott, &amp; Kutzner, 2019)</ref>. This degree of confidence that accompanies every decision has been shown to be particularly important when the outcome is uncertain or the decision must be made with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bahrami et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kepecs &amp; Mainen, 2012</ref>).</p><p>In adults, an individual's metacognitive efficiency, a measure of how well a participants' confidence ratings are calibrated to their true performance while accounting for the level of true performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014)</ref>, influences the accuracy of their subsequent decisions and the readiness with which they take social inputs into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bahrami et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hauser et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Koriat, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. Thus, it may well be the case that developing metacognitive efficiency in adolescence influences how well youths can arbitrate between helpful and misleading advice on their route to becoming entirely independent agents. Relatively little is known about the development of metacognitive abilities. Whilst non-verbal aspects of metacognition are thought to emerge as early as infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Goupil &amp; Kouider, 2016)</ref>, explicit metacognition is thought to only emerge later and change throughout the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(O'Leary &amp; Sloutsky, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Palmer, David, &amp; Fleming, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weil et al., 2013)</ref>. Critically, little is known about how metacognition develops during childhood and adolescence and how this contributes to the ability to incorporate advice from others.</p><p>In this study, we examined how metacognitive abilities mature from childhood to adolescence and how this relates to advice taking at this crucial developmental period. If metacognitive efficiency improves from childhood to adolescence and adolescents become more equipped to determine the trustworthiness of their own judgements, do they become better able to make those judgements independently and thus ignore misleading advice from others? To answer this question, we developed a novel perceptual decision making task with adaptive difficulty and assessed how participants reacted to subsequent advice. We show that the emergence of metacognitive abilities during early adolescence drives independent decision making, in that it allows adolescents to ignore misleading advice but take on helpful advice from others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited participants from multiple schools across London, UK. For participants under the age of 16, we gained parental and participant consent. Participants over the age of 16 consented to take part themselves. Participants were given a voucher valued at £7.00 for their participation. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of University College London (study number: 14261/001).</p><p>We tested 109 participants and analysed the data from 107 participants. Two participants were excluded for medical reasons. Out of 107 participants, 45 were male and 62 were female. We recruited participants in three age groups: age 8-9 (mean age: 9.34, n=30, male/female n=11/19), age 12-13 (mean age: 13.13, n=41, m/f n=19/22) and age <ref type="bibr">16-17 (mean age: 17.19, n=36</ref>, m/f n=15/21). This age range was selected to span pre-, early-and mid-adolescence. The age groups did not differ in IQ (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Our power calculations based on previous related studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Decker, Lourenco, Doll, &amp; Hartley, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lourenc et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Selmeczy &amp; Ghetti, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weil et al., 2013)</ref> suggested a sample size of ~30 per group would be sufficient to detect medium size effects with 80% power. To counteract the currently dominant recruitment bias towards WEIRD participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Henrich, Heine, &amp; Norenzayan, 2010)</ref>, we deliberately selected schools in socially diverse and disadvantaged areas. In participating schools, the proportion of pupils eligible for pupil premium (additional funding for children in local authority care or those known to be eligible for free school meals), with English as an additional language and from minority ethnic backgrounds was above or well above the national average according to Ofsted reports (Office for Standards in Education, 2013-15).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of procedure</head><p>Participants were introduced to the Space Explorers task and given both verbal and written instructions. Participants also completed three other tasks (reported elsewhere), a battery of questionnaires and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence verbal and abstract reasoning tests <ref type="bibr">(Wechsler, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">WISC)</ref>. The order in which participants completed the tasks, questionnaires and WISC was pseudo-randomised across participants. In total, the adolescent participants (12-13 years, 16-17 years) spent ~1.5 hours completing the experiment. The youngest participants (8-9 years) completed the experiment over two sessions to reduce fatigue, and spent ~2 hours completing the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Space explorer task</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>The Space Explorers task was programmed in Cogent 2000 (MATLAB toolbox, http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent_2000.php). Participants viewed a spaceship cockpit, within which were two display screens (one central for displaying choice, one to the side for displaying social advice) and a confidence slider (displayed only during confidence reports; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>).</p><p>Stimuli for the perceptual decision consisted of a planet, presented briefly in the center of the screen with 68 aliens displayed in a circle formation over the top of the planet. There were 8 possible alien colours (selected to be easily discriminated between, even by participants with colour blindness) but on each trial aliens could be only one of two randomly selected colours.</p><p>Aliens were identical apart from colour differences. There was always more of one colour alien than the other, the exact difference in number was calibrated to individual participants based on a staircase procedure to ensure equal performance (see below). After stimulus presentation, an example of the two aliens were displayed on the left and right of the central display screen for participants to make their choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task procedure</head><p>In the space explorer task, participants were first asked to make a perceptual decision based on an array of two different colour aliens presented for 750ms. Participants had to decide, as quickly as possible, which of the two aliens there was more of and log their response by key press. This was followed by a confidence rating. Participants rated their confidence on a sliding scale from 'total guess' to 'totally certain', labels that were chosen to ensure the youngest participants would comprehend the scale. Participants were instructed to use the entire length of the scale.</p><p>In half of the trials, this was then followed by advice from a space advisor. The advised answer</p><p>(an image of one alien) was displayed to participants for 1500ms in a small 'messenger screen'.</p><p>Participants were then given the option to revise their initial choice and rerated their confidence (see Supplementary Materials for analysis of second confidence rating). The advice was correct on 70% of trials, thus matching the participants' performance. Participants were instructed that the 'space advisor should be correct most of the time but can also make mistakes just like you and I' but were not given any indication of any other characteristics of the advisor.</p><p>For the practice trials (first 30 trials), participants simply made the perceptual decision and were given feedback ('correct' vs 'incorrect'). These trials were included to allow the staircase to settle before starting the task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1D</ref>). In the remaining trials (80 trials), participants were no longer given feedback but instead rated their confidence in their response. For half of these trials, participants received advice, revised their initial choice and rerated their confidence.</p><p>For task procedure see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>, for task interface see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration</head><p>A staircase procedure was used throughout the task in order to match participants' performance. To this end, we used a 2-down-1-up staircase procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fleming, Weil, Nagy, Dolan, &amp; Rees, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">García-Pérez, 1998</ref>; see Supplementary Materials). This was used to identify the difference in aliens needed to elicit approximately 71% accuracy for individual participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model comparison approach to analysis</head><p>As many of the cognitive functions studied here may not follow a simple linear trajectory with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nook et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Somerville et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Somerville et al., , 2017</ref>, we used a model comparison approach to compare between linear, quadratic and adolescent-emergent (appears in early adolescence and then plateaus) patterns of developmental differences. Linear age was computed using zscored raw age; quadratic age was computed using the square of linear age; adolescentemergent age was calculated using quadratic age but replacing values above 12 with the same value <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Somerville et al., 2013</ref>; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S4</ref> for age curves). For each analysis, we compared the model fit of these three models of age and their interactions (7 models in total) using BIC to determine the best fitting model (BIC tables and full results reported in Supplementary</p><p>Materials; See <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>).</p><p>We report the winning model for each analysis and subsequent independent t-tests to compare between groups. To compare performance, we use ANOVA. We report effect sizes using Cohen's d and partial eta-squared where applicable. All data was z-scored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metacognitive bias and sensitivity</head><p>We calculated metacognitive bias by taking the mean confidence rating across all trials in which confidence ratings were given.</p><p>We calculated metacognitive efficiency (meta-d'/d') using signal detection theory approach and maximum likelihood estimation using Matlab <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2014</ref>; function provided by http://www.columbia.edu/~bsm2105/type2sdt/). Meta-d' quantifies type 2 metacognitive sensitivity (the degree to which participants' confidence ratings discriminate between correct and incorrect trials) and is expressed in the same units as type 1 perceptual sensitivity or d' (the degree to which participants can distinguish between different coloured aliens). Metacognitive</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">efficiency (meta-d'/d')</formula><p>is a relative measure that eliminates performance and response bias confounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barrett, Dienes, &amp; Seth, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Galvin, Podd, Drga, &amp; Whitmore, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Masson &amp; Rotello, 2009)</ref>. Perfect metacognition occurs when meta-d' and d' are matched and thus meta-d'/d' is 1.</p><p>Meta-d' is theoretically bounded at the lower end by zero, but when fit using an unbounded maximum likelihood procedure estimation error may lead to negative values in practice. This estimation error, of course, applies to all values but becomes evident when values fall outside the theoretical range <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fleming, Ryu, Golfinos, &amp; Blackmon, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>On this grounds, we did not see sufficient reason to remove or adjust negative values and report analyses including negative values. For completeness, however, we did repeat analyses in which we set negative meta-d' values to zero and report the same pattern of results (See Supplementary Materials; <ref type="figure">Fig. S5</ref>). Three participants gave mostly extreme confidence ratings and thus their metacognitive sensitivity (and subsequently metacognitive efficiency) could not be estimated, these participants were thus not included in subsequent analyses that included metacognitive efficiency. We also performed all analyses using metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d') and found the same pattern of results (data not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advice taking and resistance to false advice</head><p>Overall propensity to follow advice was calculated by taking the proportion of trials that participants switched their choice when the advisor disagreed with them (over total number of trials where advisor disagreed) minus the proportion of trials that participants switched their choice when the advisor agreed with them (over total number of trials where the advisor agreed). This was done to account for changes of mind that were not advice related.</p><p>Resistance to false advice was calculated by taking the proportion of trials in which participants followed helpful advice i.e. were incorrect and switched to the advised correct choice (over total number of trials where participants were incorrect and the advisor disagreed) minus the proportion of trials in which participants followed false advice i.e. were correct and switched to the advised incorrect choice (over the total number of trials where participants were correct and the advisor disagreed).</p><p>Both propensity to take advice and resistance to advice were standardized (z-scored).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation analysis</head><p>We used mediation analysis to assess whether the effect of age on resistance to false advice was mediated by metacognitive efficiency. We use standard notation to report mediation paths,</p><p>where a represents the relationship between the predictor variable X (age) and the mediator M</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(meta-d'/d'), b</formula><p>represents the relationship between M and the outcome Y (resistance to false advice), c represents the relationship between X and Y, ab is the indirect relationship between X and Y mediated by M, i.e. the extent to which Y changes when X is held fixed and M changes by the amount it would have changed had X increased by one unit, and c' represents the direct relationship between X and Y, i.e. the extent to which Y changes when X increases by one unit and M remains unaltered.</p><p>We used Mediation Toolbox in Matlab (https://github.com/canlab/MediationToolbox; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wager, Davidson, Hughes, Lindquist, &amp; Ochsner, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wager et al., 2009)</ref> to perform the analysis.</p><p>This toolbox is used to calculate mediation analysis based on a standard 3-variable path model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</ref>) with a bootstrap test for the statistical significance of the product ab (adjusted indirect effect of age on resistance to false advice; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002)</ref>. We entered adolescent-emergent age as predictor variable, resistance to false advice (standardized) as the outcome variable, metacognitive efficiency (meta-d'/d', standardized) as mediator and sex was entered as a covariate (as in all previous analyses). This toolbox tests the significance of ab using the accelerated, bias-corrected bootstrap test <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002)</ref> with 10,000 bootstrap samples to test each of the a, b and ab path coefficients. We required that all three paths (a, b and ab) were significant in order to satisfy the conclusion that the covariance between adolescent-emergent age and resistance to false advice was explained by metacognitive efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To test the hypothesis that advice taking during adolescent development is linked to an</p><p>improved metacognitive efficiency, we tested three age groups of participants, 8-9 years, 12-13 years and 16-17 years (selected to span pre-, early-and late-adolescence). Participants completed the space explorer task, in which they made perceptual decisions, rated their confidence in those decisions and, on some trials, were able to revise initial decisions after receiving advice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceptual decision making performance was matched across age groups</head><p>Importantly, to assess participants' metacognitive abilities without bias due to differences in decision making performance, we used a staircase procedure that enabled participants in each age group to achieve the same level of accuracy in their perceptual judgements. The staircase procedure was successful, as participants did not differ in their overall task performance ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.   1C</ref>; F(2) = .36, ηp 2 = .01, p = .700), nor at any point during the task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1D)</ref>. Further details on the groups' perceptual performance, the staircase procedure and evidence differences required to achieve matched performance are reported in the Supplementary Materials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.   S1</ref>, S2, S3). , were asked to indicate which colour was more plentiful and rated their confidence in their decision (both self-paced). Subsequently, participants received advice from a 'space advisor' for 1500ms, and revised their choice (self-paced). B) Participants' view of the task interface. C) Mean decision accuracy did not differ between age groups and was well calibrated to ~70% accuracy. Participants' mean accuracy was very similar (NSnon-significant, all age curves) across age groups (8-9 years M = 70.42; 12-13 years M = 70.30, 16-17 years M = 70.00). D) Decision accuracy by blocks of 10 trials (colours represent age groups as in C). Shaded area indicates initial practice trials without confidence ratings that were excluded from any analysis. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. *p&lt;.05 uncorrected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Young adolescents and males are overconfident</head><p>To assess participants' confidence ratings, we assessed their metacognitive bias, the mean confidence score across all trials. Interestingly, we found that metacognitive bias peaked in the 12-13 years group, showing that this age group was more confident than the other groups ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.   2A</ref>; quadratic age: β = .26, SE = .12, p = .029, controlling for sex) despite performing at the same level on the perceptual judgements <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C)</ref>. Subsequent comparisons show significant difference in mean confidence between 8-9 years and 12-13 years (t(69) = -2.23, d = .54, p =</p><p>.029) and between 12-13 years and 16-17 years (t(75) = 2.08, d = .48, p = .041) but not between 8-9 years and 16-17 years (t(64) = -.28, d = .07, p = .779). In addition, males were also more confident than females ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>; β = .25, SE = .09, p = .009, controlling for age; despite matched performance: t(105) = .30, d = .52, p = .764). Sex was also included as a predictor variable in all further analyses in order to assess both effects of age group and sex on the outcome variables of interest. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adolescents have better metacognitive ability</head><p>Whilst metacognitive bias provides information about overall confidence, it does not provide any information about how well confidence ratings were calibrated to participants' actual performance. Metacognitive efficiency, on the other hand, measures how well participants' confidence ratings aligned with their performance.</p><p>We found an improvement in metacognitive efficiency in an adolescent-emergent pattern across age groups. Both adolescent groups (12-13 year olds and 16-17 year olds) had better metacognitive efficiency than the pre-adolescent group (8-9 year olds; adolescent-emergent: β = .23, SE = .10, p = .023; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3A</ref>). Subsequent comparisons showed the effect was primarily driven by different metacognitive efficiency between 8-9 years and 16-17 years (t(61) = -2.48, d = .63, p = .016), 12-13 years showed somewhat better metacognitive efficiency than 8-9 years (t(66) = -1.99, d = .50, p = .051) and the adolescent groups showed very similar metacognitive efficiency (12-13 years vs 16-17 years: t(75) = -.26, d = .06, p = .795). This means the confidence reports given by the adolescent groups were better calibrated to their actual performance than the confidence reports given by the pre-adolescent group. The youngest group were the most likely to follow advice. C) Both adolescent groups were more sensible in their advice taking decisions, resisting following false advice but taking on more helpful advice than pre-adolescents. D) The relationship between age (adolescent-emergent) and resistance to false advice was fully mediated by metacognitive efficiency. Mean beta values are shown. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. *p&lt;.05 **p&lt;.01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adolescents are less willing to take (misleading) advice from others</head><p>Next, we assessed how children and adolescents incorporate advice from others into their perceptual judgements. Using a post-decision paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Meshi, Biele, Korn, &amp; Heekeren, 2012)</ref>, we could assess how advice was weighted against participants' own initial performance and how this was related to their confidence.</p><p>To assess participants' overall propensity to follow advice, we first calculated the difference between the proportion of trials that participants changed their minds when the advisor disagreed vs when the advisor agreed with them (accounting for task-irrelevant switching behaviour). We found an (inverse) adolescent-emergent pattern, showing that the adolescent participants generally followed advice less than the youngest participants ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3B</ref>; adolescentemergent: β = -.26, SE = .09, p = .005), supporting the idea that adolescents are generally resistant to others' opinions. Subsequent comparisons showed propensity to follow advice was significantly higher in the 8-9 years compared with 12-13 years (t(69) = 2.04, d = .48, p = .044) and compared with 16-17 years (t(69) = 2.35, d = .57, p = .022) but propensity to take advice was not different between the two adolescent groups (t(75) = .50, d = .12, p = .615).</p><p>Given that advice is reliable in this task, following advice overall is sensible. However, a good decision maker will also take into account their own performance, weighing up the advice against their own decisions. Does this mean that the youngest participants, in contrast, are simply following advice blindly? To investigate resistance to false advice, we looked only at trials on which the advice was conflicting and calculated a difference score between the proportion of trials that participants were correct but followed the misleading advice (out of total number of trials where participants were correct and received misleading advice) and the proportion of trials that participants were incorrect and followed the helpful advice (out of total number of trials participants were incorrect and received conflicting advice).</p><p>We found that the adolescent groups, compared with the youngest group, were more resistant to false advice and more willing to follow helpful advice ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3C</ref>; adolescent-emergent: β = .20, SE = .10, p = .037). This shows that adolescents took their own performance into account when deciding whether to follow advice or not and because of this were better able to ignore misleading advice. Contrarily, children tended to follow conflicting advice equally when it was helpful and when it was misleading. Subsequent comparisons showed the effect was mainly driven by a difference in resisting false advice between 8-9 years and 12-13 years (t(69) = -2.03, d = .48, p = .046) rather than between the other groups (8-9 years vs 16-17 years t(64) = -1.55, d = .38, p = .127; 12-13 years vs 16-17 years t(75) = .68, d = .16, p = .496). This suggests that adolescents do not just ignore advice from others, but instead carefully examine their own knowledge and follow advice when they distrust their own decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Better metacognitive ability promotes adolescents' ability to ignore misleading advice</head><p>So far, we observed two parallel age-related effects. Adolescents had better metacognition i.e.</p><p>were better able to take account of their own performance when deciding whether to follow advice. In addition, we showed that adolescents were better at arbitrating between their own decision and others' advice. We were thus interested in whether emerging metacognition was the driving factor behind improved advice taking. Simply speaking, the better our insight into our own performance, the more our confidence signals reflect our actual performance and the more we can utilize these confidence signals to resist misleading advice from others. To assess whether the adolescents' increased metacognitive efficiency allowed them to resist false advice but still take on helpful advice, we conducted a mediation analysis assessing whether metacognition mediated the observed association between age and advice taking (see Statistical</p><p>Analysis for details).</p><p>Our mediation analysis confirmed the significant associations between (adolescent-emergent) age and metacognitive efficiency (path a: mean β = .23, SE = .09, z = 2.74, p = .006) and between age and resistance to false advice (path c: mean β = .21, SE = .10, z = 2.26, p = .024).</p><p>Moreover, we found a significant association between metacognitive efficiency and resistance to false advice (path b: mean β = .27, SE = .11, z = 2.33, p = .020). We found that the association between age and resistance to false advice was fully mediated by metacognitive efficiency (ab: mean β = .06, SE = .04, z = 2.61, p = .009), and the association between age and resistance to false advice was no longer significant when accounting for metacognitive efficiency (c': mean β = .15, SE = .09, z = 1.65, p = .098). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3D</ref>; More details on path notation can be found in 'Statistical analysis'.</p><p>This pattern of results shows that adolescents' ability to more accurately identify when they were correct and when they were incorrect allowed them to ignore advice more often when it was misleading but incorporate advice when it was helpful. In contrast, children were less able to identify when they were correct or incorrect and so tended to follow conflicting advice independent of their own performance and whether the advice was helpful or misleading. This suggests that adolescents do not simply ignore advice from others but use their confidence signals to guide their advice taking behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>To understand when successful independent decision making emerges, we studied the development of metacognition and advice taking. Our findings provide novel evidence that metacognitive efficiency matures from childhood to adolescence. Further, we show that this process supports more intelligent advice taking behaviour. In this way, adolescents were able to use their confidence signals successfully to ignore misleading advice but take on helpful advice from others. Adolescents followed conflicting advice less often when they were correct, but took it when they were incorrect. As adolescents' confidence signals better discriminated between correct and incorrect trials, they were thus better able to use these confidence signals to determine when to follow advice. 'I know better! And I know I know better!'.</p><p>The development of metacognition, i.e. gaining better insight into our own behaviour, in adolescence may be an important driver for independent decision making. Our results suggest metacognitive efficiency increases in the transition to adolescence, with the adolescent groups exhibiting better metacognitive insight than children. This interesting shift from late childhood to early adolescence clearly extends and provides a much more fine-grained picture on the previous finding that youths' metacognitive ability differs from adults' <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Weil et al., 2013)</ref>. Our findings provide a developmental period of substantial change and suggest that there are some key developmental advances happening during this period of transition. One possible driver promoting this metacognitive development could be the onset of puberty.</p><p>The neighbouring field of metamemory research <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Morales, Lau, &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref> has shown that metacognitive insight into memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Nelson, 1990)</ref>, and the ability to use this knowledge to integrate retrieval cues or allocate more time for difficult items, develops over mid-to-late childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Destan, Hembacher, Ghetti, &amp; Roebers, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schneider &amp; Sodian, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Selmeczy &amp; Ghetti, 2019)</ref>. However, relatively fewer studies sampled across adolescence, some with conflicting results <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Butterfield, Nelson, &amp; Peck, 1988)</ref>. Furthermore, age-related differences in metamemory are generally challenging to interpret as they are directly influenced by developmental memory performance differences. Here, we examined a sample that spanned across the transition from childhood to adolescence and addressed the confound of task performance by using a perceptual decision making paradigm where it was possible to match task performance across age groups.</p><p>This is, to our knowledge, the first investigation into the impact of metacognitive development across childhood and adolescence on advice taking behaviour. Our results show that when adolescents received conflicting advice, they changed their mind more when they were incorrect than when they were correct (i.e. they change their mind in a more sensible way than children). This means that the difference in advice taking behaviour between children and adolescents was explained by more mature metacognitive efficiency in the adolescent groups and suggests that older participants were better able to incorporate advice from others into (their more accurate) judgements of their own performance to come to a final decision. In adults, metacognitive efficiency, recognition of errors and integration of advice have been tightly linked to the ability to process post-decision evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Moran, Teodorescu, &amp; Usher, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moreira, Rollwage, Kaduk, Wilke, &amp; Kagan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">van den Berg et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. Our results provide further evidence for this, showing that the development of metacognitive efficiency underlies the ability to sensibly incorporate postdecision evidence (i.e. advice).</p><p>Previous research has assessed advice taking primarily in probabilistic learning contexts.</p><p>Typically, a participant is given a single instance of false advice at the beginning of the task before learning for themselves the value of a set of options <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Decker et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lourenc et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rodriguez Buritica, Heekeren, &amp; van den Bos, 2019)</ref>. Adults have been shown to bias their learning towards the recommended option whereas children and adolescents seem better able to reject the advice in light of conflicting experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Decker et al., 2015</ref>). In the current study, we were able to contrast conflicting and confirmatory advice at the trial level to extend these findings, showing that adolescents selectively ignore false advice when they themselves were correct but still incorporate helpful advice when they were incorrect. We further provide the mechanism for this improved advice taking, suggesting that adolescents are better able to do this compared with children because of increased metacognitive insight into their own performance. Extending the current research beyond adolescence would provide a better understanding of how the continued maturation of metacognition affects advice taking behaviour into adulthood.</p><p>This research makes an important contribution to a wider literature on age of mental (decision making) capacity, the age at which a person is able to make autonomous decisions, for example, about their own welfare (e.g. deciding between medications) or whether to enter into contractual agreements (e.g. buying property). There are multiple criteria that determine an individual's decision-making capacity (Department of Health, Department for constitutional <ref type="bibr">Affairs, &amp; Welsh Assembly Government, 2007)</ref>. The current study may be particularly relevant for the criterion of 'use or weight', the ability to utilize multiple sources of information and weigh up their importance as part of the process of making a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Case, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grootens-Wiegers, Hein, van den Broek, &amp; de Vries, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ruck Keene, Kane, Kim, &amp; Owen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">van der Plas, David, &amp; Fleming, 2019)</ref>. Thus, a person's ability to weigh the advice of others against their own confidence in their decision is an important of aspect of capacity-related decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(van der Plas et al., 2019)</ref>. We have shown here that adolescents' maturing metacognition contributes to their ability to weigh up advice from others in a more sensible way, not just following advice whenever someone disagrees. A further understanding of the mechanisms that drive advice taking behaviour and adolescent decision making will improve our understanding of the development of these important requirements for decision making capacity.</p><p>Interestingly, we additionally found that early adolescents (12-13 years), and male participants, showed heightened confidence, in spite of the same level of performance across all age groups and in both sexes. Although this did not relate to advice taking behaviour, overall confidence has been found to be associated with self-esteem and psychiatric symptoms dimensions such as anxious-depression, compulsivity and intrusive thoughts (Moses-Payne, Rollwage, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fleming, &amp; Roiser, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rouault, Seow, Gillan, &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>. Further, integration of evidence post-decision, a similar process to advice-taking, has been shown to be associated with depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Moses-Payne et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>It would thus be particularly interesting to map the individual developmental trajectories of metacognition and advice taking behaviour in longitudinal studies. Previous research has shown important individual differences in metacognition in adults and their associations with mental health symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rouault et al., 2018)</ref>. Since adolescence is a period of heightened risk for the onset of mental health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kessler et al., 2005)</ref>, it would be interesting to look at how trajectories of metacognitive development are associated with the onset of mental health conditions. Longitudinal studies could also help to overcome some of the caveats that arise in mediation analysis of cross-sectional data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lindenberger, von Oertzen, Ghisletta, &amp; Hertzog, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The transition from childhood to adolescence is associated with major physical and psychological changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blakemore, Burnett, &amp; Dahl, 2010)</ref>. Adolescents may be particularly driven to seek independence and gain more responsibility, and may spend more time thinking about their identity and place in the world and developing their own sense of values and morals <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sebastian, Burnett, &amp; Blakemore, 2008)</ref>. Thus, adolescence may be a particularly important time for self-reflection. In this study, we have shown that the ability to accurately introspect about our own behaviour improves from childhood to adolescence. Further, we showed that this ability is being harnessed to inform when to take advice from others, and thus enables adolescents to take on helpful advice but ignore misleading advice. As Socrates implied, teenagers can sometimes appear ignorant towards others' advice. However, what we have shown here, is that teenagers may actually be making quite sensible decisions to ignore the advice of others when they know that they are correct. Metacognition may thus be a driving force, supporting adolescent decision making and the transition towards full independence.</p></div>

As this estimation error applies to all values, we did not adjust negative values in the main analysis (in the manuscript). However, for completeness we provide this analysis where negative meta-d' values are set to zero.</p><p>We repeated our linear regression analysis, assessing the effect of age on metacognitive efficiency (meta-d'/d') with sex as a covariate. As in the unbounded analysis, there was a significant effect of age (adolescent-emergent: β = .20, SE = .10, p = .044).</p><p>Mediation showed the same pattern of results as in the unbounded analysis (a: mean β = .20, SE = .08, z = 2.50, p = .012; b: mean β = .29, SE = .11, z = 2.42, p = .016; c': mean β = .15, SE = .09, z = 1.71, p = .088; c: mean β = .21, SE = .10, z = 2.24, p = .025; ab: mean β = .06, SE = .03, z = 2.54, p = .011). Again, showing that metacognitive efficiency fully mediated the effect of age on resistance to false advice. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metacognitive efficiency</head><p>Post-advice confidence There was no difference in post-advice metacognitive bias (recoded to reflect confidence in initial choice) across age groups (F(2) = 2.19, p = .117) or across sex (t(105) = 1.24, p = .220).</p><p>There was no evidence to suggest participants' metacognitive efficiency improved after advice. We calculated the difference between meta-cognitive efficiency post-advice minus pre-advice and performed a one-sample t-test for each group to show there was no significant improvement (8-9yo: t(26) = -.20, p = .846; 12-13yo: t(38) = .84, p = .404; 16-17yo: t(35) = 1.90, p = .065).</p></div>			</div>
