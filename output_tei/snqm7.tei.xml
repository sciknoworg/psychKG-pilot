				<p>Conflict of interests: No potential conflicts of interest to disclose. Running head: Discussing organ donation wishes Discussing organ donation wishes 2 Do cognitive-affective and family communication variables impact individual decisions to discuss organ donation wishes? ABSTRACT Family discussion of donation wishes is a critical driver of family authorisation of organ donation. However, few people discuss their wishes or feel certain of family member&apos;s donation preferences. Empirically, individual determinants of discussing donation wishes with family have been examined using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). The impact of cognitive-affective (e.g., disgust) and family (e.g., family communication) variables are less well studied, and not integrated together in decision-making frameworks. To address this gap, the role of family communication and &apos;cognitive-affective&apos; variables, integrated within the TPB, were examined as predictors of intended and actual discussion of donation wishes with family. Participants (N=201) completed baseline measures of family communication, cognitive-affective (disgust, bodily integrity, medical mistrust, fear of not being dead, anxiety about discussing), and TPB (attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy, intention) variables. Two-weeks later, participants (N=111) self-reported their discussion behaviour (n=42, 38% discussed). A revised structural equation model provided a good fit to these data. In this model, less anxiety about discussion and positive attitudes toward discussion predicted selfefficacy (R 2 =0.67). Positive attitudes, greater self-efficacy and perceived approval/support from important others (subjective norm) predicted discussion intentions (R 2 =0.70). Intention predicted discussion behaviour (R 2 =0.22). Cognitive-affective variables (except discussion anxiety) and family communication did not have a prominent role. Interventions which emphasise that family expect and approve of donation discussions, portray donation discussions as positively valued, and bolster self-efficacy are needed to increase discussion of organ donation wishes. Bolstering self-efficacy could be achieved by providing tangible strategies to assist individuals to reduce their anxiety about discussing their wishes, and Discussing organ donation wishes 3 encouraging positive attitudes towards discussion and its importance in family authorisation for donation.</p>

Thus, the degree to Discussing organ donation wishes 6 which family communicate effectively, may impact individual decisions to discuss donation wishes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific Aim and Research Questions</head><p>Research has explored separately the relationship of cognitive-affective and family communication to donation-related decisions. As such, the contribution of these cognitiveaffective and family communication variables when included within the dominant framework used to understand organ donation decisions (TPB) has not been determined, and targets for intervention based on these variables not identified. Our objective was to examine the contribution of cognitive-affective (disgust, bodily integrity, medical mistrust, fear of not being dead, anxiety about discussing) and family communication variables within a broader TPB framework (attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy), in predicting intended and actual discussion of donation wishes with family. We propose a model derived from prior donation discussion research and TPB model specifications ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). We hypothesised (H) the following: H1) Concerns about not really being dead and body integrity (as components of death anxiety scales) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> will negatively predict self-efficacy. The contribution of past discussion behaviour to intended and actual discussion of donation wishes was also explored consistent with Rocheleau's findings, 8 and given that prior performance of behaviour is associated with increased intended and actual future behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> Past behaviour is known to attenuate model effects, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> and, as such, we explored its effect in a separate test of the proposed model. H6) Past discussion of donation wishes with family will positively predict intended and actual discussion behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>This study comprised a prospective survey design. TPB, cognitive-affective and family communication variables, and past behaviour were measured at baseline (T1), and selfreported discussion behaviour was measured two weeks after baseline survey completion (T2). A two-week follow-up was used in order to give participants ample time to have a discussion whilst maximising participant availability for survey completion. After ethical approval (University #PSY7614HREC), participants received an information sheet describing the study, and were advised prior to commencing T1 and T2 surveys that completion of each survey would indicate informed consent to participate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting</head><p>Participants were invited to the study via the Student Experiment Participation Scheme on two University campuses in one Australian state. This scheme gave first-year psychology students the opportunity to volunteer for research and receive course credit for their time. We used social media and professional and personal networks throughout Australia to distribute the survey invitation to community members who were not compensated for participating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling</head><p>Eligible participants were those aged 16 years or older residing in Australia. We used convenience sampling to recruit participants from the psychology student cohort, and snowball sampling to recruit community members. Participants self-selected into the study by registering their interest (students only) and/or accessing the main and follow-up survey links provided within the study invitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>We collected data using an online survey platform (SurveyMonkey). After ethical approval, participants who met eligibility criteria took part in a study about communicating organ donation wishes with family. Participation comprised completing an online survey including measures of TPB, cognitive-affective, and family communication variables, past behaviour, donation-related experience and personal characteristics. Once participants completed the first survey, they provided their contact details if they were willing to complete a follow-up survey two-weeks later. In this follow-up they self-reported their discussion behaviour. Responses at each time-point were matched using a participant-generated identifier to maintain anonymity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time 1</head><p>Experience with organ donation. Self-rated knowledge about donation ("Overall, how would you rate your knowledge of organ donation", excellent to very poor), donation preference (yes, no, unsure), and donor registration status (yes, no, unsure) were assessed using 1-item measures.</p><p>Participant characteristics. Participants self-reported their age in years, gender, country of birth, university/college-level education, relationship status, and living arrangement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Past behaviour. Prior family discussion about donation wishes was measured with</head><p>"have you told your partner or a family member about your preference for organ donation?" (yes, no, unsure). Participants then indicated using free-response who they had told. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> TPB variables. TPB constructs were assessed with 2-item measures of attitude ("It would be valuable for me to…"), self-efficacy ("It would be easy for me to …"), and subjective norm ("People who are important to me think I should …"), and a 3-item measure of intention ("I intend to…"). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> Items ended with "…tell my family my donation preference in the next fortnight", scored 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree.</p><p>Cognitive-affective variables. Disgust ("the idea of organ donation disgusts me"), bodily integrity ("my body should be kept whole for burial"), medical mistrust ("I trust that doctors and hospitals use donated organs as they are intended to be used"), and fear of not being dead ("I am scared that I would not really be dead if I am a donor and my organs are taken for transplantation") were each measured with one item. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> We adapted the 8-item Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> to measure anxiety about discussing donation wishes with family ("I generally avoid telling my family my donation preference because I know I will find the experience unpleasant or distressing"). All items were scored 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree.</p><p>Family communication. The 10-item FACESIV Family Communication scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref> was used to measure whether participants perceived they had healthy communication about information, ideas, thoughts, and feelings with family members ("family members can calmly discuss problems with each other"). Items were scored 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time 2</head><p>Behaviour. Discussion behaviour was measured with the item, "In the past fortnight, did you tell your family your donation preference" (yes, no). Participants indicated who they told (partner/spouse, mother, father, sibling, child/ren, another relative/guardian, other), and how satisfied they were with their conversation (1 very dissatisfied to 5 extremely satisfied). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>We used descriptive statistics to analyse donation-related experiences and participant characteristics, and compared responses at T1 only with both time-points using chi-square analysis or ANOVA <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Scale reliability was determined with Cronbach's alpha ≥0.70 or Pearson's r (p&lt;0.05) ( <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Pearson's or Spearman's Rho correlations (for dichotomous variables) were examined between T1 predictors and T2 behaviour for participants completing both time-points ( <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>We performed structural equation modelling in Mplus 8.4 24 and used a robust weighted least-squares estimator to test the proposed model given the categorical discussion behaviour outcome ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> There is no universally accepted guideline regarding sample size requirements for structural equation modelling or for models that use a robust weighted least-squares estimator and have categorical outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> For these latter models, requirements depend on the model estimated and data from 50 or more participants can be sufficient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> We calculated goodness-of-fit indices for each model tested and evaluated these using recommended guidelines: <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> chi-square (non-significant), comparative fit index (CFI; ≥0.95),</p><p>Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; ≥0.95), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; &lt;0.06). The predictive power of the proposed model was evaluated with path coefficients and R 2 values, with significance determined by p&lt;0.05. We ran the proposed model with and without past discussion behaviour, given it is known to reduce model effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> [Insert <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant characteristics</head><p>201 participants completed the Time 1 (T1) survey (49.8% students), of which 178 consented to contact for the follow-up survey (Time 2; T2). 111 (50.5% students) participants completed the T2 survey (62.4% response). Although the response at follow-up was lower than expected, it is consistent with other studies measuring discussion behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> Participant characteristics at T1 only and both time-points are compared in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The only significant difference was that fewer participants who completed both time-points (vs. T1 only completers) had joined the donor register or discussed their donation wishes prior to T1.</p><p>[Insert <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptives for organ donation discussion behaviour</head><p>At T1, 51 participants (45.9%) had previously discussed their donation preference, most commonly with their mother (64.7%), partner (47.1%), or father (45.1%). At T2, 42 participants (37.8%) had discussed their donation preference since the T1 survey, most often with their mother (52.4%), partner (42.9%), father (31.0%), or sibling (26.2%). Over half were satisfied with their conversation (M=3.55, SD=1.06). Most were generally (31.0%), very (35.7%), or extremely (19.0%) satisfied (9.5% somewhat, and 4.8% very dissatisfied).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations between predictor and outcome variables</head><p>As expected, cognitive-affective variables were significantly and negatively associated with self-efficacy. TPB and family communication were significantly and positively correlated with intention, and cognitive-affective variables significantly and negatively correlated with intention (except medical mistrust which was not significantly correlated; <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Intention and self-efficacy significantly and positively correlated with behaviour.</p><p>Family communication and anxiety were not correlated with behaviour. Collinearity statistics showed that all variables were within parameters for inclusion as predictor variables in the model (VIF 1.118-3.664, Tolerance 0.273-0.895).</p><p>[Insert <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing the model of intended and actual discussion of organ donation wishes</head><p>The model proposed ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) was a poor fit for these data, χ 2 (14) = 114.13, p &lt; 0.001, CFI = 0.269, TLI = 0.000, RMSEA = 0.254 (90% CI = 0.212, 0.298). Modification indices suggested two revisions. The first included a pathway for self-efficacy on discussion anxiety. This modification aligns broadly with the finding that anxiety about others' views regarding donation was a driver of self-efficacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> The second modification included a pathway for self-efficacy on attitude. Although inconsistent with TPB specifications, an association between attitude and self-efficacy has been reported previously amongst blood donors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> The addition of these pathways substantially improved model fit, χ 2 (12) = 13.64, p = 0.324, CFI = 0.988, TLI = 0.973, RMSEA = 0.035 (90% CI = 0.00, 0.106). In this revised model <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>), discussion anxiety negatively predicted, and attitude positively predicted, self-efficacy for discussing donation wishes; attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy positively predicted intention to discuss donation wishes; and intention positively predicted actual discussion behaviour at follow-up ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>). The revised model explained 67% variance in self-efficacy, 70% variance in intentions to discuss, and 22% variance in discussion behaviour.</p><p>[Insert <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> <ref type="bibr">]</ref> The proposed model including past discussion behaviour was also a poor fit, χ 2 (15) = 106.33, p &lt;0.001, CFI = 0.268, TLI = 0.000, RMSEA = 0.234 (90% CI = 0.193, 0.277).</p><p>Modifications indices were identical to those described above, and their addition improved model fit, χ 2 (13) = 13.66, p = 0.398, CFI = 0.995, TLI = 0.988, RMSEA = 0.021 (90% CI = 0.00, 0.098). In this revised model, discussion anxiety negatively predicted, and attitude positively predicted, self-efficacy; past behaviour, attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy positively predicted intention to discuss donation wishes. Past behaviour and intention positively predicted actual discussion behaviour ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>). The revised model explained 67% variance in self-efficacy, 71% variance in intentions, and 39% variance in discussion behaviour.</p><p>[Insert <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study extends prior research suggesting a role for family and 'cognitive-affective' variables in individual decisions to discuss organ donation wishes. We provided a novel test of the contribution of these variables within the TPB framework commonly used to explain donation decisions, and found that family communication did not play a role in individual's choices to discuss their donation preference (H5 and H2 not supported). In contrast to H1 and H3, cognitive-affective variables often referred to as 'ick' (disgust) or 'jinx' (medical mistrust) factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> did not significantly predict people's intended or actual discussion, and death anxiety (not really being dead, body integrity) did not predict self-efficacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> However, one cognitive-affective variable, anxiety about discussing donation wishes, had an indirect effect on intentions via self-efficacy, but no direct effect on discussion behaviour (H5 and H3 unsupported).</p><p>Consistent with prior research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy directly predicted intentions (H4 supported). Attitude also had an indirect effect on intention via its contribution to self-efficacy. Moreover, intention (not self-efficacy) was a significant direct contributor to behaviour (partially supporting H5). As expected, adding past behaviour to the model attenuated the effect of intention on discussion behaviour, although the significant relationship between these variables still held (cf. Rocheleau). 8 Past behaviour also predicted discussion intentions (H6 supported).</p><p>Although we did not find support for the role of family communication in decisionmaking, there may be other family variables not assessed that have an impact (e.g., degree of closeness, contextual factors that may limit opportunity for discussion). Future experimental work in which conversations occur in the presence or absence of family, as well as in-situ studies may help to clarify relevant family variables and their impact on discussion. The methodology used by Afifi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> in which dyads were invited to a lab and given topic cards to facilitate discussion could be adapted to enable more naturalistic conversation that better reflects the difficulties some individuals have discussing donation and captures spontaneous elements of conversations (e.g., less detailed prompts to start discussion). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> Contrary to prior research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> the expected association of cognitive-affective variables such as disgust, bodily integrity, and fear of not being dead, with self-efficacy or intentions were initially supported in correlations but did not remain significant when tested in the model. Previously these associations emerged when African American 11 people or those from Chinese, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> or Japanese 14 backgrounds were surveyed, and it is possible that our findings may be due to sampling (i.e., most born in Australia, female, highly educated). Tests of the model with participants from culturally diverse backgrounds is needed. While traditional cognitive-affective variables did not have a direct role in decisions to discuss, having less anxiety about discussing donation wishes indirectly contributed to intention via self-efficacy. Thus, reducing discussion anxiety, as well as bolstering self-efficacy so that individuals feel more confident and capable to discuss, are key targets for future intervention to increase intended and actual discussion. Surprisingly few studies have used interventions or persuasive appeals to encourage family discussion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Interventions that equip individuals with coping plans to support positive family communication when discussing donation wishes (e.g., example scripts) may be effective in overcoming anxiety when having a discussion and increasing efficacy beforehand. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> Similarly, communication strategies (use an external prompt e.g., news story; ask someone their wishes) could be embedded in persuasive appeals to encourage discussion and build efficacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> Given the key contribution of subjective norm to intention in this study, it may also be critical to emphasise that important others, such as family, would want the individual to have a conversation and would likely approve of them doing so. This approach could be combined with asking participants to reflect on instances of successful communication with their family to bolster positive feelings about family communication, perceived normative support, and subsequent efficacy to improve discussion rates. Ensuring an immediate opportunity to discuss or notify family after such interventions is also critical. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>This study is one of few to examine both discussion intentions and behaviour, and provides a novel test of family communication and cognitive-affective factors within a broader social cognitive model. However, the results should be interpreted with study limitations in mind. Participants comprised a convenience sample of students and community participants. Although students are typically younger and are a key target group who are least likely to share their wishes, this recruitment approach produced a sample of mostly female, highly educated, Australian residents which limits the broader generalisability of results.</p><p>Greater focus on participants who are men, younger, or from different ethnic/cultural backgrounds is needed since these groups are less likely to discuss their wishes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> Participants indicated low levels of concern about body integrity or not really being dead, low levels of disgust, and low medical mistrust. As such, it is possible that only people comfortable with the topic of organ donation self-selected into the study. Single-item measures on cognitive-affective constructs are also a limitation. Future replication studies should include more diverse participants, and multi-item measures, to confirm the impact (or lack) of cognitive-affective variables on discussion. Self-report measures of behaviour were used in this study and objective measures should be incorporated in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>When tested within the dominant TPB framework, the degree to which family communication was perceived as 'healthy' did not contribute to intended or actual discussion about donation wishes. However, when people believed that important others, such as their family, were supportive of discussing donation wishes, they were more likely to share their wishes. Those who were less anxious felt more capable and confident to have a discussion with family. In turn, feeling more confident and capable, positively valuing donation discussion, and perceiving that important others would want them to share their wishes, contributed to intentions to discuss, with intention contributing to subsequent behaviour.</p><p>Continued examination of the role of family, discussion anxiety, attitudes, norms, and efficacy in decisions to communicate donation wishes, and development of theoreticallyinformed interventions to increase discussion are needed in order to facilitate the consent process for organ donation.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>According to the TPB, a person's attitude (positive or negative evaluation), subjective norm (perceived approval from others), and perceived behavioural control (PBC; belief in the level of control they have [perceived control], and personal capabilities [self-efficacy]), predicts their intention to act.
