			<abstract>
				<p>Many psychology researches are performed through &quot;psychology subject pools&quot; which give participants considerable flexibility in when they participate. This &quot;participant degree-of-freedom&quot; has led to concern that the characteristics of subject pool participants may change with time, with the most engaged students signing up at the start of the semester and the least engaged students leaving it all to the end. In this paper we performed an exploratory analysis to look for evidence of this &quot;good student effect&quot;. Consistent with previous work, we find support for the good student effect with earlier participants scoring higher on the Big-5 subscales of Achievement-Striving and Cooperation, as well as Grit and Empathic-Concern. In addition, we found a non-linear effect of time-of-semester on Sensation-Seeking, with this measure peaking in the middle of the semester as well as the end. However, the vast majority of the measures we tested, including measures of personality, cognition, decisionmaking and social interaction, did not correlate with time-of-semester or timeof-day at all. Thus, we conclude that, while some studies directly related to measures of Grit and Sensation-Seeking would do well to recruit throughout the semester, in most cases any bias introduced by the good student effect is likely to be small.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Unless the research is aimed at a specific population, the subjects of most psychology experiments, especially in the United States, are psychology students, mostly those taking introductory psychology classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Findley &amp; Cooper, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Higbee, Millard, &amp; Folkman, 1982)</ref>. In almost all of these subject pool systems, students are compensated by receiving course credit. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kangas and Hackenberg (2009)</ref> the use of course credit as an incentive was first reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Greene and Sutor (1971)</ref> in the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior. Then after a decade of infrequent use, it became common practice in the mid-1980s and 1990s when around 32% of undergraduate psychology departments <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Landrum &amp; Chastain, 1999)</ref> and 74% of psychology departments with a graduate program <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sieber &amp; Saks, 1989)</ref> used subject pools.</p><p>The most obvious benefit of such a system is convenience and access to lots of subjects at minimal cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cassidy &amp; Kangas, 2014)</ref>. It also has an educational benefit to the participants. The downside of such a system is that it may introduce several biases to the sample. First, college undergraduates represent only a tiny sliver of the total population differing along dimensions such as age, race/ethnicity, and social-economic status (SES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cooper, Baumgardner, &amp; Strathman, 1991)</ref>. Second is that subjects have considerable choice in the experimental process. For example <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Jackson, Procidano, and Cohen (1989)</ref> showed that subjects may choose specific types of experiments based on their personality traits.</p><p>Here we focus on a specific kind of subject choice, namely the choice of date and time of participation. Across all psychology studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Miller (1981)</ref> estimated in 81% of cases, subjects have freedom to choose the date and time of experiment. In a subject pool situation, this number is likely closer to 100%. Regardless of the actual number, a subject's freedom to choose may introduce bias as certain personality types may be more likely to participate early or late. This bias could be especially problematic if the experiment is running for just a brief period concentrated either early or late in the semester <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cooper et al., 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Anecdotally, we find that most of our colleagues (if they have the option between early and late subjects) prefer early subjects due to a belief that the quality of data is higher in early than late participants. The literature is in line with this implicit impression, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zelenski, Rusting, and Larsen (2003)</ref> call the "good student effect". For example, early participants have higher GPAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cooper et al., 1991)</ref>, more positive attitudes toward the experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adair, 1973)</ref>, more internal control beliefs and interest in academia <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Evans &amp; Donnerstein, 1974)</ref>, and are more motivated and better organized <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Jackson et al., 1989)</ref> than late participants who tend to be more playful, more exhibitionistic, less socially responsible, and less dominant <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Holden &amp; Reddon, 1987)</ref>. Interestingly procrastination does not seem to be correlated with time-of-semester <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wang &amp; Jentsch, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aviv, Zelenski, Rallo, and Larsen (2002)</ref> investigated the relations between time-of-semester and the Big Five personality traits <ref type="bibr">(NEO PI-R;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1997)</ref> and found weak but significant correlations between early participation and higher Conscientiousness, lower Extraversion and lower Openness to Experience. In addition to personality factors, demographic factors have also been found to vary across the semester. Most notably is the observation that females tend to participate earlier than males <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aviv et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ebersole et al., 2016)</ref>. Another related question concerns the possible relationship between the time of participation in the day (time-of-day) and the results of the study. There are fewer studies on the relationship between time-of-day and personality traits and it seems the relationships are fewer and weaker compared to the time-of-semester factor. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zelenski et al. (2003)</ref> found significant positive correlations be-tween participation later in the day and social desirability, need for achievement, extraversion, conscientiousness, activity level, and negative correlation with birth order. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zelenski et al. (2003)</ref> also reported an indirect correlation between time-of-semester and time-of-day through a self-report "morningness" questionnaire: participants higher in morningness tend to sign up earlier in the semester.</p><p>Several authors have proposed a solution whereby subjects are recruited over the entire course of semester instead of running an experiment in a short period of semester or the day <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cooper et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zelenski et al., 2003)</ref>. However, such a conservative solution could be demanding, and it is often more convenient to run experiments all at once over a period of one or two weeks. Given the widespread usage of short-period sampling, the question is does it meaningfully bias the results? While some authors highlight the importance of its consideration (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Evans &amp; Donnerstein, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Richter, Wilson, Milner,&amp; Senter, 1981)</ref>, others concluded the effect sizes were small and inconsistent and suggested researchers should not be worried about the time-of-semester effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cooper et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wang &amp; Jentsch, 1998)</ref>. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ebersole et al. (2016)</ref> investigated the time-of-semester variation in 2696 participants in 20 different subject pools and with 10 experimental or correlational effects (e.g. Stroop task, availability heuristic, metaphoric structuring) and reported very small or no differences in those effects between early and late participants.</p><p>In the current study we investigated the relationships between time-of-semester and time-of-day factors with a variety of demographic and personality traits we have used in our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sadeghiyeh, Wang &amp; Wilson, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sadeghiyeh, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sadeghiyeh et al., 2020)</ref>. In these studies, demographic and personality traits were not the main focus of the study but acquired as potential covariates and for exploratory analyses and included measures of demographic and different personality, cognitive, decision-making and social traits. Based on the previous literature we predicted weak to moderate correlations between time-of-semester and a variety of traits like gender, GPA, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Grit, and Sensation-seeking. Although because the experiments were not designed with this question in mind all analyses are corrected for multiple comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We collected data from a total of 485 participants (ages 18-29, average = 19.08; Females = 279, Males = 205, Transgender = 1) who took part in various experiments in our lab in 2015 and 2016 in which they responded to a bundle of questionnaires using Qualtrics. Not all of the measures were used in each experiment, so we have different sample numbers (from 146-485) for different measured traits. Participants were recruited through the Psychology subject pool at the University of Arizona and received course credit for their participation.</p><p>The experiments were advertised online through SONA system and usually provided participants with a wide range of choices regarding the date (from early to last days of semester; both weekdays and weekends) and time (from 7 am to 7 pm). All experiments were run in person on a computer in an experimental room with up to 3 other participants.</p><p>Before answering the questionnaires, participants played a specific computer task depending on the purpose of the experiment. The task usually took about 20-30 minutes and the whole experiment was designed either for a 1-hour or 2-hour slot. All participants gave informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Arizona.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>To aid exposition, we group the questionnaires used in our experiments in six categories based on the types of individual differences measured:</p><p>1.

We defined the time-of-semester by counting days from the opening of subject pool (when students could sign up for experiments). At the University f Arizona, the first day of experiments was 7 and 10 days after the first day of semester in Fall and Spring semesters, respectively. The range of days of experiment happened to be exactly 100 days for each semester. The median of time-of-semester in our 485 participants was 66 (Males = 67;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Females = 64) which shows most subjects signed up for the second half of the semester. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Landrum and Chastain (1995)</ref> also reported most of their subjects participated in the second half of semester. The average "days into semester" was 70.1 which seems very close to ours considering an approximately one-week difference in our way of counting the time-ofsemester and theirs.</p><p>Time-of-day was defined as the linear transformation of the time of experiment into 0-1 interval. For example, 12 am -&gt; 0.0, 12 pm -&gt; 0.5, 11:59 pm -&gt; 1.0. The average of time-ofday for our 485participants was 0.584 (∼2:01 pm) (Males = 0.60∼2:24 pm; Females = 0.57∼1:41 pm).</p><p>There was a significant correlation between time-of-semester and time-of-day of participation, (Pearson's r(483) = .10; p = 0.03), which shows those who tend to participate earlier in the semester also tend to participated earlier in the day. This finding is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zelenski et al. (2003)</ref> who found that people high in "morningness" tend to participate early in the semester, though their "morningness" trait was assessed by a self-report questionnaire while in ours it is the actual time subjects participated in the study.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Holm, 1979)</ref> implemented in MATLAB by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Groppe (2020)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref> (Supplementary Materials C) shows the calculated adjusted p by this method for the 20</p><p>highest p values in correlations between demographic/personality traits and time-ofsemester. Alternatively, we can implement the Bonferroni correction by setting a protected alpha level of 0.05/n in which n is the number of hypotheses. Here we tested correlations between 105 traits with two variables (time-of-semester and time-of-day) yielding 210 tests in total. Applying Bonferroni correction in this way yielded similar results except for A4-Cooperation which survived only the Bonferroni-Holm method. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows the results for the demographic traits. Gender and Age had a negative correlation with time-of-semester (i.e. younger and females participated earlier in the semester than older and males, respectively).

Lastly, international students tended to participate earlier than US born ones and the more they had lived in the US, the more similar they became to the US-born students in this regard.

After Bonferroni correction, only Sensation seeking and one of its subscales, Novelty, remained significantly correlated with time-of-semester (Pearson's r(389) = .26; p &lt; .001). One measure in this category, Tolerance of Ambiguity, showed a significant correlation with time-of-day (Pearson's r(389) = .11; p = .03), but it didn't remained significant after Bonferroni correction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Social</head><p>In the "Social" group, Horizontal Collectivism and all four subscales of Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (IRI) were significantly correlated with time-of-semester <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 7)</ref>.

Other IRI subscales (Fantasy, Perspective taking, and Empathic concern), as well as Horizontal Collectivism, showed the opposite direction: students with higher empathy/perspective-taking/fantasy/horizontal-collectivism tended to participate earlier in the semester. After Bonferroni correction, only IRI-Empathic Concern remained significantly correlated with time-of-semester (Pearson's r(389) = -.17; p &lt; .001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Variance</head><p>To test for possible non-monotonic relationships between time of semester and personality traits, we performed an ANOVA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Controlling for gender</head><p>Since females and males have different personality traits and they tend to participate in different time-of-semester, the correlations between time-of-semester and personality traits might be due to gender differences in personality. To take this notation into account, we calculated partial correlations between traits and time-of-semester, controlling for gender.</p><p>The results (Supplementary Materials E) are almost similar to the original results <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Tables   1-6</ref>), especially in the Grit Scale, Arnett Sensation seeking and IRI-Empathic concern.</p><p>Supplementary Materials E - <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S3</ref> shows the significant partial correlations (p &lt; 0.05, no multiple comparison correction).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we investigated time-of-semester and time-of-day effects on demographic and personality variables in the psychology subject pool at <ref type="bibr">[-]</ref>, a large public school in the US. Overall, we found a similar demographic/personality profile mentioned in previous studies with some differences and new findings.</p><p>Consistent with previous work we found that early participants were more likely to be female, more Conscientious, more Agreeable, more Open, and less Extroverted than those who participated late in the semester. Such a pattern is consistent with the Good Student</p><p>Effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Zelenski et al., 2003)</ref>, whereby early participants are better students, and lends weight to earlier studies.</p><p>In contrast to previous work, we found no correlation of time-of-semester with temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cassidy &amp; Kangas, 2014)</ref> and Personal Need for Structure (PNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Roman, Moskowitz, Stein, &amp; Eisenberg, 1995)</ref>. Indeed, even without correction for multiple comparisons, there was no relationship between time-of-semester and these variables. For temporal discounting, the discrepancy might be due to using a different measure. In our experiment, participants picked between "today" and "later" options in 27 scenarios with varying rewards and delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kirby, Petry, &amp; Bickel, 1999)</ref>. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cassidy and Kangas (2014)</ref> used a different procedure in which the future reward was always fixed at $100 and participants reported the delay (between 1 week and 8 years) at which they would be indifferent be-tween the two options. Also, while our task was presented in a short survey form, in their procedure are search assistant was heavily involved in verbal presentation of each scenario and finding the point of indifference on screen. These major differences hold us from drawing a straightforward speculation on the observed discrepancy. For the PNS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Roman et al. (1995)</ref> used the same measure as ours <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Neuberg &amp; Newsom, 1993)</ref>, but there are differences in time (more than 20 years distance between two experiments) and context (New York vs Tucson) that may contribute to the observed discrepancy.</p><p>We also found evidence that two novel traits are associated with time of semester, both of which stand after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The first is Grit, which is a measure of perseverance and resilience, and was developed to describe the personal qualities essential to high achievement. It is defined as the passion for long-term goals and persistence in working toward these goals despite adversity or failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Duckworth et al., 2007)</ref>. As such, the Grit concept fits very well with the "good student"</p><p>effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Zelenski et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with our finding for Grit, several overlapping constructs have also been shown correlated with time-of-semester. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Strube and Ota (1982)</ref> reported that type A personality trait (which is related to being more competitive, more ambitious and highly organized) are found higher in early than late participants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Richert and Ward (1976)</ref> reported a decline in participants' self-esteem over the course of semester. Also, it has been found that early participants spent more time on filling questionnaires than late participants which has been interpreted by some researchers as their greater seriousness of purpose <ref type="bibr">(Mulry &amp; Dunbar, n.d.;</ref><ref type="bibr">cited in Rosenthal &amp; Rosnow, 1975)</ref>. In the present study, we found that Conscientiousness (and more strongly its subscale Achievement Striving) also decreased over the course of the semester and, in line with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Duckworth et al., 2007)</ref> we found a significant correlation between Conscientiousness and Grit (r(78) = 0.29; p = 0.0089). In their metanalysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Credé, Tynan, &amp; Harms (2017)</ref> found a much stronger correlation between <ref type="bibr">Grit and Conscientiousness (k = 22,</ref><ref type="bibr">N = 18,</ref><ref type="bibr">826,</ref><ref type="bibr">ρ = .84,</ref><ref type="bibr">SDρ = .07)</ref>. This suggests that Grit may be just Conscientiousness in disguise and our finding that Grit correlates with time-of-semester is just a replication of previous findings that Conscientiousness correlates with time-of-semester.</p><p>The second trait that varies with time of semester, Arnett Sensation Seeking, does not fit so cleanly with the "good student" effect. In particular, rather than a monotonic decline in Sensation Seeking through the semester (as one might expect if 'good students'</p><p>were less sensation seeking), we found a non-monotonic relation with time-of-semester with Sensation Seeking peaking in the middle as well as the end of the semester <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>-E, F). One possible explanation for this is that sensation-seekers seek partying in college and the parties' schedules in colleges seem to distribute unevenly throughout the semester (more partying in the beginning of semester and after midterms). Another related parameter involved is short vacations in the middle of semester: fall and spring breaks.</p><p>The important note here is that for some traits like sensation seeking, a linear assumption might be misleading, and we need to consider the pattern of changes during semester to better detect any time-of-semester effects, if there is one.</p><p>So, after all, does any of this matter? Should we control for time-of-semester and timeof-day effects 14when running a study? On the one hand, most of the effects we measured were small and (statistically)insignificant even at the liberal thresholds without correcting for multiple comparisons. Thus, for many studies, acquisition over a short period of time in the semester is unlikely to lead to major bias. However, for other studies, where the focus is on constructs related to Grit, Sensation Seeking or the other measures we found above, more care may be required, especially when the anticipated effect sizes may be small <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Meyer et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Funding: The authors have no funding to disclose.</p><p>Compliance with Ethical Standards: All procedures performed in experiments were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</p></div>

The IPIP-NEO-120 is a scale used to measure a broad range of different personality traits using 300 questions. The traits correspond to the big five and include neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The scale offers a 5-point Likert response system asking participants how well different traits and characteristics describe their personality. The scale response options are 1-very inaccurate, 2-moderately inaccurate, 3-neither accurate nor inaccurate, 4-moderately accurate, 5-very accurate. The condensed 120 item version was used because it has similar validity to the full 300 item version (α=.66 versus .73) based on data collected from a large online and in person sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Johnson, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
