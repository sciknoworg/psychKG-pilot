				<p>Links between affective states and risk-taking are often characterised using summary statistics from serial decision-making tasks. However, our understanding of these links, and the utility of decision-making as a marker of affect, needs to accommodate the fact that ongoing (e.g. within-task) experience of rewarding and punishing decision outcomes may alter future decisions and affective states. To date, the interplay between affect, ongoing reward and punisher experience, and decision-making has received little detailed investigation. Here, we examined the relationships between reward and loss experience, affect, and decision-making in humans using a novel judgement bias task analysed with a novel computational model. We demonstrated the influence of within-task favourability on decision-making, with more risk-averse/&apos;pessimistic&apos; decisions following more positive previous outcomes and a greater current average earning rate. Additionally, individuals reporting more negative affect tended to exhibit 1/40 greater risk-seeking decision-making, and, based on our model, estimated time more poorly. We also found that individuals reported more positive affective valence during periods of the task when prediction errors and offered decision outcomes were more positive. Our results thus provide new evidence that (short-term) within-task rewarding and punishing experiences determine both future decision-making and subjectively experienced affective states.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>There is a traditional gulf in the field of decision-making between one-shot tasks, in which each trial is independent of the others (i.e. there is assumed to be no influence of previous outcomes or stimuli on current decisions), and ongoing tasks, in which individuals are supposed to apply what they learn from the consequences of their actions in earlier trials to later trials. Signal detection theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is the most well-established framework for investigating the former, and reward-(or punishment-) based reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for the latter. In reality, the distinction is blurredadaptation paradigms use repeated stimulus presentations to 'set' the state for one-shot psychophysical examinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>; participants perform exquisite Bayesian learning in 2/40 stop signal reaction time tasks, despite the instructed independence of the trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This distinction is particularly pertinent in research where decisions on serial trials yielding reward or loss/punishment are used to probe the influence of affective states and disorders on risk-taking and reward sensitivity. The resulting decision-making profiles are proposed as markers of these states (e.g. Iowa Gambling task <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; Balloon Analogue Risk Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>; Reward Responsiveness Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>; Judgement Bias Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). In most studies, decision-making data across test sessions are summarised into single statistics such as the number of cards selected from more favourable decks, the average number of 'balloon' pumps, the overall response bias as a marker of reward responsiveness, or the proportion of 'optimistic' responses. However, each trial within a task yields rewards or losses/punishments with the potential to influence the participants' performance on future trials. Moreover, an individual's ongoing experience of rewards and punishers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>) and their predictability (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>) are considered to be fundamental determinants of affective states. Therefore, within-task experience may alter local affective states and influence future decisions and, ultimately, summary statistics of task performance, with knock-on effects for our understanding of the relationship between affect and decision-making and the utility of decision-making markers of affective states or disorders.</p><p>Here we use a judgement bias task as an example paradigm in which to investigate what characteristics of past within-task decisions and outcomes influence affective state, and how they influence present choices, either directly, or indirectly, via changes in affective state. Answering these questions will provide new fundamental information about how rewarding and punishing experiences influence affect and decision-making across short timescales, from seconds to a number of minutes. It will also further inform use of the judgement bias task as a method for assessing both human and animal affective states.</p><p>The judgement bias task was originally designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and has since been widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, as a translational paradigm in which decision-making under ambiguity could be used as an indicator of an individual's affective state. In the task, participants are trained to discriminate between two stimuli and make different responses to each (typically 'go' or 'stay'/'no-go') in order to either obtain a reward or avoid a punisher.</p><p>Participants are then presented with probe stimuli that are ambiguous by lying 3/40 intermediate between the trained stimuli, and their responses are recorded. In typical go/no-go tasks, executing the response associated with the trained rewarded stimulus, which is deemed the 'optimistic' response in the judgement bias literature, is risky in that it could result in either a reward or punisher, while executing the response associated with the trained punished stimulus (deemed 'pessimistic') is 'safe' in that it guarantees avoidance of the punisher, but also removes the possibility of winning a reward.</p><p>Decision-making in the judgement bias task, particularly trials with perceptually ambiguous stimuli, is considered to be indicative of a longer timescale notion of affective state, or 'mood'. Specifically, more 'optimistic' decision-making, as indicated by an excess proportion of 'optimistic' as opposed to 'pessimistic' decisions made across a test session, is typically associated with more positively valenced affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>. This decision-making profile is hypothesised to reflect approximate sufficient statistics about the characteristics of the individual's interaction with and experience of the rewarding and punishing features of their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>. These statistics could encompass such things as past provision of rewards and punishers or the extent to which these were predicted, and could affect how the individual makes decisions by, for instance, changing their prior expectations, or their sensitivities to reward and punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>To illustrate, consider an individual in a chronically reward-barren environment. Such an environment has been proposed to induce a depression-like state which is sometimes associated with a reduced reward valuation (i.e. anhedonia -reduced sensitivity to the value of rewards; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>) and a reduced expectation of future rewards, and hence should result in more 'pessimistic' decision-making in the judgement bias task <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>While these statistics might reflect long-term experience prior to the task, they might also reflect short-term and ongoing experience within the task. That is, the judgement bias task is ostensibly a series of independent one-shot psychophysical choices, each open to influence from longer-term affective state as described above. However, during performance of the task, participants accrue rewarding or punishing outcomes as a result of their decisions. These outcomes might in turn alter the very affective state that the task is designed to measure. Clearly, the influence of the consequences of previous decisions in the task on subsequent affect and choices needs to be investigated.</p><p>In the present study, we examined this relationship between psychophysical 4/40 decision-making, decision-outcomes and self-reported affect in human participants using a novel 'go'/'stay' judgement bias task design in which either reward or loss magnitude was systematically varied across trials, so that there were epochs of high and low value potential outcomes. We investigated the impact of on-going reward and loss experience on decisions on each trial, and on self-reported affective state at intervals during the task. Choice and/or latency are the typical outcome measures in judgement bias tasks;</p><p>we further exploited these by constructing a computational model of the task that allowed us to model the course of decision-making in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> and thereby investigate the latent, and potentially more fundamental, variables underlying the relationship between reward and loss experience, affect, and decision-making in this task. This study hence provides a comprehensive investigation of the interplay between affect, outcomes, and decision-making by exploring the links between reward and loss experience and affective state, reward and loss experience and decision-making, and affective state and decision-making simultaneously.</p><p>The model considers the task as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In this, on each trial, participants transition through a two-dimensional state space, which bears some resemblance to a discretised version of a drift-diffusion model: one dimension represents accumulated information about the presented stimulus, as informed by their observations, and the other dimension represents the (discretised) time elapsed on the trial. The probability that a participant executes a 'go' action (associated with avoiding the punished stimulus), the alacrity with which they do so, and the probability of executing the 'stay' action (associated with obtaining the rewarded stimulus) will depend on their transitions through this state space and their subjective value of occupying each state. This is determined by two sets of parameters.</p><p>One set characterises task performance, and includes a slope, which represents the ability to discriminate the stimuli, and lapse parameters, which represent the propensity to make errors at either trained or ambiguous stimuli. These lead to the psychometric function <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. The second set of parameters quantify time estimation, decision stochasticity, and finally biases towards or away from 'optimistic' decision-making.</p><p>Because biases in decision-making may be influenced by experience prior to the task, but also by experience of decision outcomes during the task itself, we used additional parameters that mapped the influence of within-task experience to this bias parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5/40</head><p>These included the average earning rate (reflecting what a participant has learnt about their earnings from previous trial outcomes), prediction error (the difference between the actual and expected outcome on recent trials) and squared prediction error (magnitude of unpredictability of outcomes on recent trials). Various of these have been implicated in affect and decision-making and/or the relationship between the two in a variety of ways (prediction errors: <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>; average earning rate: <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>). Critically, the model precisely quantifies the various factors determining behaviour that can then answer our specific research questions.</p><p>Our main hypothesis was that a more favourable within-task experience would induce more positively-valenced affect and consequently riskier decision-making.</p><p>Specifically, we hypothesised that more positive prediction errors and a greater average earning rate (a weighted average of past outcomes) would reflect epochs in which the test environment is both relatively and absolutely favourable, thereby promoting more positively-valenced affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>, while greater unpredictability would be associated with more negatively-valenced affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>, as assessed by a self-reported affect measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40]</ref>. In turn, we predicted that the same factors predicted to induce positively-valenced affect (i.e. more positive prediction errors and a greater average earning rate) would be associated with riskier decision-making, and likewise, factors predicted to induce negatively-valenced affect (i.e. greater unpredictability) would be associated with more risk-averse decision-making. Although, the predicted influence of unpredictability on affect and decision-making may seem at odds with our hypothesis that more positive prediction errors are associated with more positive affect state and 'optimistic'/risk-seeking decision-making, it is possible that signed and unsigned prediction errors compete, and the modelling approach allows such competing influences to be disentangled. We further hypothesised that overall more positive affective valence would be associated with an overall greater 'optimistic' bias/greater risk-seeking, based on previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref>. Given that losses can be more salient than gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>, we investigated the possibility that all effects of past outcomes on affect might be stronger in the fluctuating loss condition than in the fluctuating reward condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6/40 1 Results</head><p>In order to examine the relationships between rewards and punishments, affective states and risky decision-making, we asked human participants to perform a novel version of a go/no-go judgement bias task, whilst also providing reports on their affective states.</p><p>The task involved participants choosing between a risky response ('stay'; in which they continued to hold a key on a keypad for the 2s duration of the trial, resulting in either a reward or loss) or a safe response ('go'; in which they released the key before the trial elapsed, resulting in neither a reward nor loss). Participants were informed about the reward or loss outcome of the risky response by the direction of motion of a random dot kinematogram (RDK) which varied in ambiguity. We analysed the choices/reaction times and affective reports using a new computational approach which is sensitive to subtle influences of past outcomes and predictions on present decisions and reports.</p><p>We start by laying out how our model captured trial-, subject-, and history-dependent choices in the task. This leads to a set of parameters that we then relate to the affect that the participants report during performance of the task.</p><p>The ultimate model involves a large number of parameters. We controlled the model complexity by adding only those that reduced the BIC score, which is a complexity-sensitive measure of the fit of the model to the subjects' performance. We then compared the resulting BIC scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> along with those of another complexity measure, the AIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, across a final set of models (see S1 Supplementary Material). To validate our procedure, we also checked that we could recover subjects' parameters from data generated by the model, compared the results to those obtained using a quasi model-agnostic approach, and compared the model fit to an alternate model of judgement bias (see S1 Supplementary Material).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Judgement bias</head><p>We first sought to identify the parameters which best accounted for variation in decision-making both across trials and between participants on the judgement bias task.</p><p>We paid particular attention to participants' (discretized) reaction times. Each model included various sets of parameters, the first of which characterised an individual's decision-making in the absence of baseline or experience-dependent biases. These 7/40 models are detailed in full in S1 Supplementary Material. Here, we describe the functional role of the parameters.</p><p>At the heart of the model is a simple psychometric function, which uses three participant-specific parameters: a slope (Ï); and two lapse rates (Î» amb and Î» ref ), which turn the objective rewards and punishments into a subjective probability of choice. The use of two lapse rates is justified by model parsimony (âAIC=316.650; âBIC=192.125); we consider that it may arise from the application of a different strategy on cases when there could be very little doubt about the direction of motion. As uncertainty in time estimation is fundamental to the task, given that the trial will 'timeout' and the risky choice made, de facto, if the participants do not make a decision prior to the end of the trial, two parameters were included to encompass errors in time estimation; Î¶ and Ï.</p><p>These are respectively the shape and scale parameters of a gamma distribution representing the uncertainty about the interval (with mean Î¶Ï and variance Î¶Ï 2 ).</p><p>Finally, a parameter characterising decision stochasticity (B) was included to capture the extent to which decisions executed within a model state depended on the value of that state.</p><p>Central to the decision-making component of the judgement bias task is that ambiguous choices may be biased, in a participant-specific manner, in the risk-seeking/'optimistic' ('stay') or risk-avoidant/'pessimistic' ('go') directions. We characterized this tendency in general using just such a participant-specific, constant, bias parameter; Î² Î´ 0 . We first assessed whether the parsimony of the model was improved by including this bias. inclusion of these parameters would improve the model fit.</p><p>The best-fitting model included nine parameters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ï, Î» ref , Î» amb , B, Î² Î´ 0 , Î² Î´ R , Î² Î´ O , Î¶,</formula><p>and Ï (see S1 Supplementary Material). This model was the AIC-best model, and the BIC-best model included all of these parameters except Î² Î´ O (see S1 <ref type="figure">Supplementary   Material</ref>). However, we conducted further analyses to assess whether this parameter should indeed be included in the model, which involved analysing whether the parameter estimate differed from zero using two separate approaches -these additional analyses justified inclusion of this parameter in the final model (see S1 Supplementary Material).</p><p>The model provides a good fit of discretised reaction time data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, assessment of parameter recovery and comparison with alternate models supports the reliability of the parameter estimates (see S1 Supplementary Material). Observed vs. generated reaction time data The mean discretised reaction time for each stimulus level for both the model-generated and observed judgement bias data. Error bars represent one standard error</p><p>Following model selection, permutation tests were used to examine whether and how the parameter estimates differed from zero. As Î¶ and Ï jointly determine the timeout probabilities, the mean timeout probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Î£ T 0 Pt;timeout t</formula><p>was analysed instead of Î¶ and Ï for a more intuitive interpretation of the results.</p><p>Estimates of the bias parameter were significantly greater than zero (Î² Î´ 0 : meanÂ±SE= 0.711 Â± 0.141, p&lt;0.001), while estimates of the influence of bothR n (the average earning rate) and O nâ1 (the previous outcome) were significantly lower than zero (Î² Î´ R : meanÂ±SE= â0.143 Â± 0.042, p&lt;0.001; Î² Î´ O : meanÂ±SE= â0.018 Â± 0.006, p&lt;0.001). Thus, participants were overall risk-seeking on the task, but were more risk-averse when they had experienced greater recent earnings and when the most recent outcome was more favourable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Correlation between parameter estimates and reported affect</head><p>As a next stage of analysis, we considered whether there was a relationship between the model parameters that were fitted to the participants' discretised reaction times and aspects of their reported affect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Influence of within-task experience on reported affect</head><p>Finally, we quantify model-agnostic effects of recent trial history on the reported affect.</p><p>Participants reported significantly more positive affective valence when the weighted prediction error (wPE nâ1 ; LRT=66.411, p&lt;0.001), and the potential outcome (O nâ1 ;</p><p>LRT=27.132, p&lt;0.001) were more positive <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The average earning rate was not a significant predictor of reported affective valence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>;R nâ1 ; LRT=2.616, p=0.106).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Discussion</head><p>Performance in decision-making tasks can be influenced by predispositions and biases that participants bring with them to the task, but also by experiences that occur during the task. Previous research has typically focused on just one aspect of reward and loss experience and affect or decision-making (e.g., solely looking at the effect of prediction error on affect; or solely looking at the relationship between affect and decision-making).</p><p>Here we provide the first in-depth analysis of how within-task experience may influence behaviour in the judgement bias test which is designed to assess the relationship between affective state and decision-making under ambiguity. Our study provides new 11/40 information on the interplay between affect, decisions, and reward and punishment experience during short (within-task) timescales. The approach taken has the potential to reveal variables and constructs that underlie decision-making which in turn could be used as new markers of affective state. This has implications for a range of other tasks that investigate links between affective state and decision-making using serial trials that provide rewarding or punishing outcomes.</p><p>We focused on how the most recent decision outcome, recent prediction errors (difference between actual and expected decision outcomes), recent squared prediction errors (magnitude of unpredictability of outcomes) and the average earning rate during a task influence both decision-making and self-reported affective state. To achieve this, we used a judgement bias task in which we manipulated reward and loss experience by systematically varying either the threatened loss or offered reward on a trial-by-trial basis. We recorded the decisions made to probe stimuli and regularly asked participants to report their affective state using an affect grid. Decision-making data were analysed using a model-dependent analysis which interpreted decision-making in the judgement bias task through the lens of a POMDP. This novel model of data from a judgement bias task allowed insight into the influence of reward and punisher experience on decision-making and reported affect.</p><p>We made a number of predictions about the relationship between reward and loss experience, affect, and decision-making, specifically that; an overall more positively-valenced affective state would be associated with riskier decision-making, both a higher average earning rate and more positive prediction errors would be associated with more positively-valenced affect and consequently riskier decision-making, and greater unpredictability would be associated with more negative affect and consequently more risk-averse decision-making. Although we found that more positive prediction errors were associated with more positively-valenced affect, we found no evidence that affective valence was associated with unpredictability or the average earning rate, or that unpredictability or prediction errors influenced decision-making.</p><p>Contrary to our predictions, we found that more positive affect tended to be associated with more risk-averse decision-making, and that a greater average earning rate was associated with more risk-averse decision-making. We also obtained several findings unrelated to our initial set of predictions.</p><p>12/40</p><p>Here we discuss our findings focusing first on within-task experience of reward and losses on decision-making. We then consider how these variables underlying decision-making relate to self-reported affect before discussing the links between within-task reward / loss experience and affect. We end by considering dissociations between effects of recent reward and loss experience on decision-making and self-reported affect. We found that baseline biases were related to self-reported affective valence; individuals who were more risk-averse (according to the model bias parameter) tended to overall report more positive affect. This result is reminiscent of cautious optimism: the finding that positive affect can induce greater caution, despite a more optimistic belief about the outcome of decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>. Cautious optimism has been explained as a self-protecting mechanism which leads individuals to make decisions that allow them to maintain their positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>. Therefore, this finding may reflect that individuals in more positive affective states were more averse to losing money because it might have threatened their positive affective state.

Alternatively, this result could reflect the possibility that negative affect induces poorer time estimation.

Greater affective arousal was reported when the offered reward was higher in the fluctuating reward condition, suggesting that high stakes trials required greater alertness. Participants also reported lower arousal as the number of trials completed increased, likely indicative of a degree of boredom. These possibilities should be explored in future studies, especially as the general relationship between affect and 'optimistic' or 'pessimistic' decision-making is supported by a recent meta-analysis of animal judgement bias studies. Pharmacological and environmental manipulations of animal affect alter judgement bias as predicted <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> but there is considerable heterogeneity of study findings and variation in task characteristics and within-task experience may be one reason for this.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">The POMDP model</head><p>The POMDP model provided greater insight into decision-making, and the relationship between affect and decision-making, than simpler, statistical, analyses. The model predicted the discretised reaction times very well, and the choices predicted by the model compared favourably with an alternate model of judgement bias choices. The model generalizes aspects of diffusion-to-bound like models in particular because of the risk associated with stochastic timing.</p><p>In contrast to typical psychometric function fitting, we included an additional lapse rate parameter to characterise the psychometric function in our POMDP model (which was justified according to both AIC and BIC scores), to allow for separate lapse rates for the ambiguous and reference stimuli. This reflects that the likelihood of errors differs between trials where there is little doubt about the direction of motion of the RDK, and trials where direction of motion is difficult to detect -which may arise from the application of a different strategy for each of these cases.</p><p>Importantly, the results of this study suggest that the latent variables underlying decision-making that are revealed by the model may provide a better measure of affect than judgement bias itself. In particular, variation in time estimation (characterised by Î¶ and Ï) within the task may provide a measure of affective valence, while propensity for errors (characterised by Î» amb ) may provide a measure of affective arousal. This possibility should be investigated in future studies.</p><p>In addition to asessing the external validity and reliability of these results, an important next step to assess our novel POMDP model will be to investigate how the current model parameters relate to neurobiological processes. Endogenous fluctuations in dopaminergic activity in the midbrain have been shown to correspond to within-subject variability in risky decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref>; hence we might expect our results to correspond with the mean or standard deviation of these fluctuations within an individual participant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Conclusions</head><p>Serial decision-making tasks have been used to study and measure affective states or disorders. However, little consideration has been given to the potential influence of outcomes within these tasks on subsequent decision-making and affect. We hypothesised that a more favourable within-task experience would lead to more positively-valenced affect and riskier decision-making. This study revealed a number of novel relationships between within-task reward experience, affective state, and behaviour in a decision-making task -some of which were in direct contrast to our hypotheses. In line with our hypotheses and previous research, we found that individuals reported more positive affective valence during epochs of the task when recent prediction errors were more positive, and offered outcomes were more positive. The study also highlighted the role of the favourability of task outcomes in modulating risk-aversion; contrary to our hypotheses, increased risk-averse decision-making was observed when the average earning rate and most recent outcome were higher. Finally, in contrast to our hypotheses, but in line with the aforementioned findings, increased risk-aversion tended to be associated with high-arousal and negative-valence affective states. Thus, within-task experience influenced both decision-making and affect, and this should be considered when using serial decision-making tasks to investigate affect.</p><p>The findings, which linked reward and punisher experience and decision-making, would not have been revealed without the development of a novel computational model for examining decision-making in the judgement bias task. Overall, our results provide evidence that within-task rewarding and punishing experiences determine both future decision-making and subjectively experienced affective state. This has implications for other tasks that are employed to detect links between serial decision-making and affective states or disorders, and highlights the potential for computational modelling to reveal novel variables and constructs underlying within-task decisions that can be used as new markers of these states. In future studies, it would be worthwhile to attempt to replicate these results, and to investigate aberrant decision-making in clinical populations using the methodology outlined here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Judgement bias task</head><p>The judgement bias task is a widely-used paradigm to investigate putative affect and decision-making in non-human animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>; in particular it assesses whether an animal makes a risky ('optimistic') or safe ('pessimistic') action when sensory information about the outcome of the risky action is ambiguous. Our task was a human version of the automated rat judgement bias task described by Jones et al. (2018) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref>.</p><p>In their task, rats self-initiated trials by putting their snout in a trough. This led to the presentation of a tone, the frequency of which provided more or less ambiguous information about the outcome of the risky action ('stay'; where the rat kept their snout in the trough). The rats had two seconds, during which the tone was played, to decide whether to make this risky action or whether to make the safe action ('go': in which the rat removed their snout from the trough) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref> for discussion of Pavlovian influences in this task).</p><p>Here, we replace the auditory stimuli with random dot kinomatograms (RDKs) which are widely-used sensory stimuli for primates (including humans). Instead of initiating trials by placing their nose in a trough, the human participants were instructed to initiate trials by pressing and holding the 'enter' key. The 'risky'</p><p>action was to continue pressing the key for the two seconds of the RDK presentation ('stay'), while the 'safe' action was to release the key ('leave'). Execution of the 'stay'</p><p>response was the 'risky'/'optimistic' decision, as it could result in either a reward or loss, while execution of the 'go' response was the 'safe'/'pessimistic' decision, as it resulted in neither a reward nor loss. Half of the participants were told that when the direction of motion was rightwards (threatened loss trials), they must release the 'enter' key ('go') prior to two seconds to avoid a loss (see below), and when the motion was leftwards (offered reward trials) they must continue to press the 'enter' key ('stay') for two seconds to obtain a monetary reward (see below), while the other half of the participants were told the obverse (i.e. leftwards=threatened loss; rightwards=offered reward). The semantics of 'stay' and 'go' were the same across the groups.</p><p>Following each presentation of the RDK and response, participants were shown on-screen feedback. For the 'offered reward' trials, the correct response was to continue holding the key for two seconds ('stay') to gain a monetary reward, while for the 'threatened loss' trials the correct response was to release the key prior to two seconds ('go') to avoid a monetary loss. In the first two training blocks either 'Correct' (in green font) or 'Incorrect' (in red font) was displayed for 1.5s. In the final training block and test block, participants could win or lose money according their responses. In the final training block, they were informed that they would win or lose a multiple of Â£10, 20/40 otherwise they would get Â£0. For the test block, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, the notional amount rewarded in the fluctuating reward condition, or potential loss, in the fluctuating loss condition, for correct or incorrect responses respectively varied across trials according to a sine function with added noise. In the fluctuating reward condition, the rewards shown to the participant varied between Â£0.87 and Â£19.16 and the loss was fixed at Â£10. In the fluctuating loss condition, the losses shown to the participant varied between Â£0.87 and Â£19.16 and the reward was fixed at Â£10 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4)</ref>. The participant was truthfully informed that they would receive an amount proportional to their total wins and losses. To illustrate these amounts as clearly as possible, participants were informed about these values using connected green and red bars (with lengths proportional to the potential reward and loss respectively, and amounts written in figures at their ends) shown on the screen for 1.5s prior to each trial <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 5</ref>). The amount won or lost was displayed on screen for 1.5s following each trial; this figure was green when a correct response was made and red otherwise. Participants were told that the monetary amounts they saw on the feedback screens during the final training and test block ( following acknowledgement of this by pressing the 'enter' key were first instructed by an on-screen prompt to press and hold the 'enter' key. This led to a fixation cross being displayed for 500ms, followed by a RDK displayed for 2000ms. The duration of the RDK display was 2000ms regardless of choice. Participants were required to make one of two responses to RDKs; (1) continue to press the 'enter' key ('stay') or (2) release the 'enter' key ('go'). The 'stay' response resulted in a reward if the RDK moved in the rewarded direction (either leftwards or rightwards), and a loss if the direction of the RDK was in the alternate direction. The magnitude of the reward or loss varied across trials in a systematic manner. The 'go' response resulted in neither a reward nor loss.</p><p>The outcome of their action was then displayed on screen for 1.5s.</p></div>

Given the coherence of the stimulus (written as Î¸), the participant's relative belief that the stimulus is favourable at time t will depend on their prior belief that the stimulus would be favourable, the relative likelihood of their observations prior to time t, and the relative likelihood of the current observation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">log P (Âµ = 1|x 0:t , Î¸) P (Âµ = â1|x 0:t , Î¸) = log P (Âµ = 1) P (Âµ = â1) + log P (x 0:t |Âµ = 1, Î¸) P (x 0:t |Âµ = â1, Î¸) = log P (Âµ = 1) P (Âµ = â1) + log P (x 0:tâ1 |Âµ = 1, Î¸) P (x 0:tâ1 |Âµ = â1, Î¸) + log P (x t |Âµ = 1, Î¸) P (x t |Âµ = â1, Î¸)</formula><p>We assume that the likelihood follows a Gaussian probability distribution with a mean dependent on the true value of Âµ and the coherence level Î¸, and (fixed) variance Ï 2 that reflects the participant's ability to detect the direction of motion of the RDK:</p><p>23/40 P (x t |Âµ, Î¸) â¼ N (x t : ÂµÎ¸, Ï ).

Second, we simplify the stochastic, interval-timing <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref> relationship between objective and subjective time by imagining that timeout can happen probabilistically when the participant chooses a = stay. It would be more realistic for the participants' time to evolve subjectively rather than objectively, and for timeout to happen deterministically in objective time.</p><p>However, this would mean a non-uniform acquisition of evidence (i.e. the statistics of x t would not be homogeneous), making for extra complexities of only modest import.</p><p>We therefore imagine that, from a participant's perspective, the stay time is a random variable which is primarily determined by a gamma distribution Î(Î¶, Ï), with shape and scale parameters Î¶ and Ï, respectively.

The state values earlier in the trial in which there is a weaker belief that the trial will be rewarded (i.e. bottom left quadrant of each heatmap), are close to zero; this reflects that the 'go' action is the most likely future action and hence the trial outcome will most likely be zero. The value of states representing no strong belief changes across time (i.e. middle third of the y-axis on each heatmap); this reflects that transitions to a state with a high value (e.g. resulting from a strong certainty of reward) may be considered probable earlier in time, but if there is uncertainty about the stimulus further into the trial, then it is most likely that the stimulus has a low coherence and that reaching a high value state is less probable.

We fitted the choice/reaction time data (i.e. the probability of remaining until time t for 'go' responses; the probability of timeout for 'stay' responses) to a given model by maximum likelihood with multiple starting values, implemented using the fmincon and GlobalSearch functions in MATLAB. We added parameters in stepwise manner, and compared models using Bayes's information criterion (BIC) values, and the final set of models was compared using both Aikake and Bayes's information criterion (AIC and BIC) values (see S1 Supplementary Material). Thus, parameters that did not increase the model parsimony were excluded. Parameters that characterised decision-making in 30/40 the absence of biases (i.e. B, Î» amb , Î» ref , Ï, Î¶, and Ï) were included in all models to account for their potential influence on behaviour ('core' parameters, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). We first assessed whether the parameter that characterised constant biases in decision-making improved model parsimony (Step 1 parameter, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>); then the second set of parameters included in the model-fitting procedure were those that allowed within-task variation either resulting from experience or time (i.e. , and also between the number of trials completed and the average earning rate (R nâ1 ), these variables were not included in the same GLMM but instead separate GLMMs including each variable were compared according to their BIC value and the GLMM which provided the best fit was selected for further analysis.

This is at odds with the theoretical framework for affect proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mendl et al. (2010)</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> in which affective valence is hypothesised to reflect environmental levels of rewards and punishers; high-reward environments are considered to induce a positively valenced state to drive reward acquisition, and high-punisher environments are suggested to induce a negatively valenced state to promote punisher avoidance (see also<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68]</ref>). As this task was conducted over a short timescale, further research should investigate whether absolute and relative levels of rewards and punishers would indeed influence longer-term affect (mood) as opposed to transient trial-by-trial fluctuations in reported affect.Participants also reported more positive affective valence when the most recent trial had offered a higher reward or lower loss, indicating that the opportunity to win greater amounts is likely to induce a positive emotional state, while the potential to lose greater 15/40</figDesc></figure>

Conversely, despite influencing decision-making, there was no evidence that the average earning rate or previous outcome influenced reported affect, although baseline biases in risk-aversion tended to be associated with both reported affective valence and arousal. These findings indicate that particular influences on decision-making within the judgement bias task need not also have an effect on self-reported affective valence, and vice versa. This raises the question of whether effects on decision-making of recent experience are necessarily mediated by changes in affective state. It is possible, for example, that transient fluctuations in affect (such as those associated with the prediction error) do not exert a strong influence on decision-making, while longer-term affect (i.e. mood) may be a more important determinant of decision-making. This might be compounded in the current study by the use of rapidly fluctuating offered rewards and threatened losses creating a relatively volatile environment which is less informative about the outcome of future decisions [70, 71].</figDesc></figure>

Any dot that went outside of aperture was replotted in a random location within the aperture on the subsequent frame. The direction of motion of the signal dots was always either leftwards or rightwards, and the proportion of dots moving coherently (i.e. the number of signal dots; termed the 'coherence level') was varied across trials to alter the difficulty with which the motion could be classified by the participant as leftwards or rightwards. In all blocks of trials, the signal direction of motion was equally often leftwards and rightwards, and each coherence level used within each block occurred an equal number of times within each direction of motion.

It was not feasible to fit all possible models to the data due to the computational complexity of the model-fitting procedure and the large number of possible combinations of model parameters. The model was found to provide accurate recovery of parameters, as determined by simulating data and assessing the correlations between the parameters recovered by the model and those used to simulate the data (see S1 Supplementary Material). The code for the model was written in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natwick, MA, USA) and model-fitting was conducted using the Advanced Computing Research Centre High Powered Computing Facility at the University of Bristol. We used permutation tests to assess whether the parameter estimates from the most parsimonious model, as determined through model-fitting, differed significantly from zero. Due to significant correlations between the weighted prediction error (wPE nâ1 ), squared weighted prediction error (wPE 2 nâ1 ), and previous outcome (O nâ1 ), and likewise between the average earning rate (R) and number of trials completed (n), with the extent of the correlation dependent on the model parameters, parameters characterising the influence of these variables on the same aspect of the decision-making process were not fitted simultaneously in the same model, but instead fitted separately and the goodness of fit of each model compared using their BIC values. 4.6 Statistical analysis: correlation between parameter estimates and reported affect To examine whether the parameter estimates correlated with reported affect, a general linear model was fitted to the parameter estimates with mean reported arousal and mean reported valence (from each individual's affect grid data averaged across the 31/40 session) as the predictor variables, as well as condition (i.e. fluctuating reward or fluctuating loss) as a control variable. 4.7 Statistical analysis: influence of within-task experience on reported affect Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were fitted to the affect grid data (i.e. the x and y coordinates for the selected location on the affect grid across the test session) in R [81] using the nlme [82] package. Likelihood ratio tests were then used to assess whether the difference in model deviance was significant following removal of a parameter from a model. Each GLMM included a random effect of participant and fixed effects of the potential outcome ( Rn+Ln , and condition (i.e. fluctuating reward or fluctuating loss). To examine if and how affect depended on reward and punisher experience, the values of the average earning rate (R nâ1 ), weighted prediction error (wPE nâ1 ), squared weighted prediction error (wPE 2 nâ1 ), and previous outcome (O nâ1 ) immediately prior to presentation of each affect grid were calculated (using the best-fit model with the parameter estimates for each individual, and standardised by dividing by the standard deviation for each individual), as well as number of trials completed, and included as predictor variables in the GLMMs of reported valence and reported arousal.

Specifically, the average earning rate and previous outcome were important determinants of the participants' discretised reaction times. Participants were more risk-averse when recent outcomes or the average earning rate were higher. A similar judgement bias task with rodents also found that a rewarding outcome on one trial resulted in a greater likelihood of making a risk-averse response on the subsequent trial<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. Both findings contrast with our prediction that a greater average earning rate (and a better recent outcome) reflect the favourability of within-test experience and hence should be associated with more risky decision-making. Instead, within-task experience of a rewarding event or environment appears to increase the likelihood of risk-averse responses on subsequent trials. In each task, the 'stay' response could be considered both risky and exploratory as the outcome of the 'stay' action is variable while the outcome of the 'go' action is fixed. Accordingly, the relationship between decision-making and both the average earning rate and previous outcomes would be consistent with previous findings from animal studies showing that risk and exploration can become greater as overall conditions become less favourable<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>, a trend that may be explained by individuals in poorer conditions having 'little to lose'. Why this appears to be more evident in a short-time window (within-task) compared to a longer-time window when less favourable pre-task conditions are often associated with less risky within-task decision-making<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> requires further investigation.</figDesc><table><row><cell>2.2 How do variables underlying decision-making behaviour</cell></row><row><cell>relate to self-reported affect?</cell></row><row><cell>2.1 Does recent experience of reward and loss modulate</cell></row><row><cell>decision-making?</cell></row><row><cell>13/40</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
