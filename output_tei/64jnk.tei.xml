				<p>Deciding whether to explore unknown opportunities or exploit well-known options is a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives. Extensive work in college students suggests that young people use two strategies to make these &quot;explore-exploit&quot; decisions: directed exploration, where exploration of uncertain options is driven by information seeking, and random exploration, where exploration is driven by chance. Whether, and to what extent, older adults use the same strategies is unknown. To address this question, 51 older adults (ages 65-74) and 32 younger adults (ages 18-25) completed the Horizon Task, a gambling task that quantifies directed and random exploration as well as &quot;baseline&quot; measures of uncertainty preference and behavioral variability. We found that older adults do indeed use directed and random exploration, but that there are quantitative differences between age groups. Older adults showed more uncertainty aversion and less random exploration than younger adults, while their directed exploration and baseline behavioral variability were the same as younger adults. In addition, we found a subset of approximately 26% of older adults who showed &quot;extreme ambiguity aversion,&quot; almost never choosing to explore a lesser-known option, even when it was clearly the better choice. Unsurprisingly, such extreme ambiguity aversion led to worse performance on the task for this group. Conversely, task performance in the remaining &quot;non-ambiguity averse&quot; older adults was better than younger adults suggesting that age-related differences in explore-exploit decision making may be adaptive except when it is taken to extremes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Throughout our lives, we often face decisions in which we must trade off the relative benefits of exploring options that are unknown with exploiting options we know well. For example, when dining at a favorite Singapore-style restaurant, should we explore fish head curry we know nothing about, or exploit the rice noodles we know and love? As we age, such explore-exploit choices take on increasing importance as we decide how to invest savings in retirement (e.g., explore a new balance of stocks and bonds or exploit the balance we've used so far?), or how to treat a chronic disease (e.g., explore new treatments with unknown side effects, or exploit known treatments we've used for years?).</p><p>Explore-exploit decision making has received considerable attention in recent years and the behavior of young people has been extensively studied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Meyer &amp; Shi, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banks, Olson, &amp; Porter, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Daw et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Frank et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Steyvers, Lee, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lee, et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Payzan-LeNestour &amp; Bossaerts, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhang &amp; Yu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wilson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Frank, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gershman 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Somerville 2017)</ref>, for review see <ref type="bibr">(Schulz and Gershman 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wilson et al. 2021)</ref>. This work suggests that young people, at least, use two distinct strategies to solve the explore-exploit dilemma: directed exploration and random exploration.</p><p>In directed exploration, choices are driven by a bias for information. Returning to the restaurant example, one way to decide between known rice noodles and unknown fish head curry is to assign an expected utility to each option, corresponding to how enjoyable we think each meal will be. Thus, a known rice noodle dish might get a utility value of 65 out of 100, indicating it has been good but not great in the past, while an unknown curry might get 50, based on our previous experience with curries. In this context, directed exploration works by adding an "information bonus," (IB) to the expected value of each option according to the information provided by choosing that option. Thus the known rice noodles receive no information bonus, IB(noodles) = 0, because eating them tells us nothing new; while the unknown fish head curry receives a large information bonus, IB(curry) = 20, because eating it is informative and we will learn how good the curry is. This "information bonus" biases us to explore the curry, even if, on average, it is likely to be worse than the rice noodles.</p><p>In random exploration, choices are driven by seemingly "random" behavioral variability or in this context "decision noise." In contrast to directed exploration, random exploration adds this random decision noise to the expected values of both options. This noise tends to randomize the choice, making us more likely to explore low value options by chance. In the restaurant, this would be choosing the curry, not because it is something unknown or because it is something you really enjoy, but simply due to random chance.</p><p>While the theory of directed and random exploration is straightforward, a number of psychological factors complicate the study of explore-exploit decisions in practice. For directed exploration, a desire for information is often opposed by an aversion to uncertainty, whereby people tend to avoid choosing options whose outcomes they know less about. In explore-exploit tasks, this uncertainty mostly comes in the form of ambiguity, where the uncertainty associated with exploration reflects a lack of knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Ellsberg, 1961</ref><ref type="bibr">, Camerer &amp; Weber, 1992</ref>. The uncertainty can also come in the form of risk <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>, where uncertainty associated with exploration reflects real variability in the world that no amount of knowledge can reduce, such as when flipping a coin. For random exploration, decision noise used for exploration is often indistinguishable from baseline behavioral variability driven by boredom, disengagement from the task, or simply making mistakes. Thus, to measure directed and random exploration correctly, it is critical to account for baseline levels of uncertainty (i.e., risk and ambiguity) preference and behavioral variability.</p><p>These baseline factors become increasingly important to consider when comparing exploration behavior across the lifespan. Research shows that risk aversion and ambiguity aversion are higher in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Zamarian, Sinz, Bonatti, Gamboz &amp; Delazer., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Best &amp; Charness, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mata, Josef, Samanez-Larkin, &amp; Hertwig, 2011)</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Tymula, et al., 2013</ref>, who found ambiguity aversion in older adults for losses but not for gains). Likewise baseline behavioral variability across cognitive domains goes up with age <ref type="bibr">(Cousins, et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ruderman et. al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brocas, Carrillo, Combs, &amp; Kodaverdian, 2018)</ref>. For this reason, and because many explore-exploit tasks cannot distinguish between directed and random exploration, previous findings showing that exploration is reduced in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Louâpre et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mata et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ligneul, 2019</ref>; although see <ref type="bibr">Cooper, Blancko, &amp; Maddox, 2017</ref>) must be interpreted with caution.</p><p>One way to dissociate directed and random exploration from the confounds of uncertainty aversion and baseline variability is to vary the time horizon, the number of decisions people will make in the future. For example, in the restaurant example, imagine making the unknown-curryvs-known-noodle decision on the day before you leave town for good (perhaps upon completion of your PhD). In this short horizon condition, there is no benefit to exploring the curry and your best bet is to exploit the noodles. In contrast if you plan to stay in town forever (perhaps upon receipt of tenure), exploring the curry has value because, if it is good, you get to enjoy fish head curry for the rest of your life, but if it is bad, you only pay the cost of a bad meal once. Thus, when the time horizon is long, exploration has more value. Thus, we can quantify directed and random exploration as the change in information seeking and behavioral variability between different short and long horizon conditions.</p><p>In this work we used such a horizon manipulation to investigate how explore-exploit behavior differs between younger and older adults. In particular, we had older adults perform the "Horizon Task," an explore-exploit task explicitly designed to distinguish directed and random exploration from baseline uncertainty attitude and behavioral variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilson et al. 2014)</ref>. In this task, participants choose between two virtual slot machines, or "one-armed bandits", loosely based on those found in a casino. When played the bandits pay out probabilistic rewards, with one of the bandits always paying out slightly more on average. Thus, to maximize their reward on the task, participants must exploit the bandit with the highest mean rewards but can only determine which bandit is best by exploring both options first. By manipulating the time horizon, i.e., number of trials participants will make in the future before the means of the bandits reset, the Horizon Task allows us to quantify directed and random exploration as the change in information seeking and behavioral variability with horizon. In addition, the Horizon Task allows us to quantify baseline uncertainty aversion and baseline behavioral variability as uncertainty attitude and behavioral variability when the horizon is short.</p><p>The Horizon Task has now been used to study explore-exploit behavior in several different studies, in different populations and with different experimental manipulations (see <ref type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2021 for review)</ref>. Of most interest to the present study are findings suggesting that directed and random exploration have different age dependence. For example, in teenagers we found different developmental profiles for the two types of exploration, with directed exploration increasing from age 12 to 18 and random exploration staying constant throughout adolescence <ref type="bibr">(Sommerville et al. 2017)</ref>. In middle-aged adults (who were the control group for a study on schizophrenia, Waltz et al. 2020), we found greater baseline uncertainty-aversion, baseline behavioral variability, and greater directed exploration relative to younger adults. Based on this previous work, we predicted that older adults would behave differently on the Horizon Task and that the pattern of these differences would be similar to middle-aged adults with older adults showing more directed exploration, more baseline variability, and more uncertainty aversion to older adults, while random exploration would be constant between the two groups.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>To determine the effect of aging on directed and random exploration, (74) older adults (ages 65-74) and (37) young adults (ages 18-25) from the local Tucson community performed the Horizon Task in the Neuroscience of Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making lab at the University of Arizona. Older adult participants were recruited using an ad in a local newspaper. Younger adult participants were recruited from online newsletters given to undergraduates at the University of Arizona. All participants reported being free from a lifetime diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, current Axis I -disorder (including drug dependence), neurological disorder, or cognitively impairing medical disorders. Participants were screened using an fMRI Safety Questionnaire, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation safety questionnaire (both of these screenings were for related studies that will be reported elsewhere), and the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Participants were paid $60 for their time, but the payment was not contingent on performance. All participants gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the University of Arizona Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size calculation</head><p>The target sample size of 40 participants per group after exclusion was determined to detect an effect of age on directed or random exploration of size d = 0.63. This effect size was based on preliminary data from middle aged and younger adults in which we saw an effect of this size on uncertainty seeking in horizon 1. To ensure we had at least 40 older adults passing the exclusion criteria (see below) we recruited 74 older participants.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schmidt, 1996)</ref>, which includes a list of 15 words to be recalled immediately after each of the 5 verbal presentations, as well as after immediate and 30-minute free recall delay following presentation of an interference word list. Selected subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (Letter Number Sequencing, Block Design, Coding, Symbol Search, Vocabulary) were also administered <ref type="bibr">(Wechsler, 2009)</ref>. Participants also completed the North American Adult Reading Test (NAART, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blair &amp; Spreen, 1989</ref>), and the Stroop task <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Golden &amp; Freshwater, 1978)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusion criteria</head><p>Out of the 74 older adults who took part in the experiment, 55 met our criterion through neuropsychological testing (a score of 26 or higher on the MoCA). In line with exclusion criteria from previous work with the Horizon Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilson et al. 2014)</ref>, we removed four more participants who were not performing the task above chance on the last trial of horizon 6 games with p &lt; 0.01 confidence. This left 51 older adults for the main analysis (Male=25, Female=26, age: M = 69.4, SD = 2.7, education: M = 17.0 years, SD=1.9).</p><p>For the young adults, we tested 39 individuals, out of these, one was removed due to reporting a previous concussion and another for taking medication to treat depression. Two young adults were removed due to scores less than 26 on the MoCA. Out of the remaining 34 individuals, three were excluded for performance on the Horizon Task, leaving 32 younger adults for the main analysis (Male = 16, Female = 16, age: M = 20.8, SD = 1.9, education: M = 14.6, SD = 1.6).</p><p>To ensure that our results were not skewed by the exclusion for performance on the Horizon Task, we repeated our main analyses without exclusions based on performance. These are reported in Supplementary Analysis 1 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Supplementary Figure 1</ref>. Including these participants did not change any of the main findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Demographics</head><p>Our older adult group had an overall higher level of education than our younger adult group (t(81) = 6.09, p &lt; 0.001). A Chi-Square test for Independence showed no difference in gender composition within or between each age group (p &gt; 0.05, all comparisons).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuropsychological Performance</head><p>Given that many of our tests were measuring the same cognitive ability, we combined neuropsychiatric tests into six factors (Memory, Processing Speed, Working Memory, Language Ability, Crystallized Intelligence, and Executive Function). To do this we z-scored performance on all tasks individually across both age groups. We then took the mean z-score for all the tests within a given factor.</p><p>• Differences in these composite factors across age groups are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. We found that Young Adults in our sample had better scores in Processing Speed, Episodic Memory, and Executive Functioning. Older adults in our sample had better scores in Crystallized Intelligence. These results are consistent with the idea that Fluid intelligence decreases with age, while Crystallized Intelligence continues to grow <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cunningham et. al.,1975</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Horizon Task</head><p>Participants performed the Horizon Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilson et al., 2014)</ref> to measure explore-exploit behavior, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). This task consists of 144 "games" (16 practice games and 128 test games) over the course of 30-45 minutes in which participants make a series of explore-exploit decisions between two slot machines, or one-armed bandits. All participants were presented with the instructions for the task and were asked if they had any questions both before and after their practice games.</p><p>More specifically, participants chose between virtual slot machines, loosely based on the "onearmed bandits" found in a casino. When chosen, each machine pays out a reward in the form of points sampled from a Gaussian distribution. The mean of the Gaussian is different for each option and is initially unknown to the subject. Thus, to maximize their points, participants must try to exploit the slot machine with the higher average payoff but can only be sure which option is best by exploring first.</p><p>The mean reward for each bandit varies from game to game. The mean of one option (randomly counterbalanced across games) was always equal to either 40 or 60 points. The mean of the second option was offset relative to the mean of the first bandit by plus or minus 4, 8, 12 or 20 points. When played, rewards were sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 8 points centered on the mean of the chosen bandit. In the instructions, participants were informed that in every game one of the bandits always has a higher mean reward than the other.</p><p>To control the amount of information participants have before making a decision, at the start of each game, participants see the outcome of four "example plays." These example plays set up two information conditions: an unequal information, or [1 3], condition in which subjects see 1 draw from one bandit and 3 draws from the other bandit, and an equal information, or [2 2], condition in which subjects would see 2 draws from each bandit. The unequal information condition allowed us to assess information seeking and (equivalently in this task) uncertainty seeking as the probability of choosing the more informative option -that is, the option played once during the forced plays ( (high info), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>, left). The equal information condition allows us to assess behavioral variability as the frequency of mistakes -that is choosing the option with lower observed mean reward during the forced plays ( (low mean), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>, right).</p><p>To distinguish baseline uncertainty seeking and behavioral variability from directed and random exploration, the key manipulation in the Horizon Task is the horizon, the number of trials in each game. The horizon determines how valuable it is to explore. When the horizon is short (1 trial), exploration has no value since there is no opportunity to use new information in the future. When the horizon is long (6 trials), it is often worth exploring at first to gain information about the exploratory option. Thus, by contrasting behavior between horizon 1 and horizon 6 on the first choice of each game, we can quantify the components of behavior that are related to exploration. We define the baseline uncertainty attitude as (high info) in horizon 1, and baseline behavioral variability as (low mean) in horizon 1. Conversely, we define directed exploration as the change in (high info) between horizon 1 and horizon 6, and random exploration as the change in (low mean) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D &amp; E)</ref>. In these trials a green box appears inside the bandit participants are required to choose. Once a bandit is chosen, the reward is displayed and the next trial begins. Instructed trials for Horizon 6 games are similar, with the only difference being the size of the slot machines which have slots for 10 trials. (B, C) After the instructed trials, participants make free choices between the two bandits for the rest of the game, which lasts either 1 trial (Horizon 1 games, B) or 6 trials (Horizon 6 games, C). (D) The key analysis in the Horizon Task focusses on the first free-choice trial. On this trial, the instructed trials set up one of two information conditions: an unequal, or [1 3], condition in which one bandit has been played once and the other three times (left), and an equal, or [2 2], condition in which both bandits have been played twice (right). (E) Choosing the high information option in the unequal condition quantifies baseline uncertainty preference in horizon 1, while the change in p(high info) in horizon 6 quantifies directed exploration. Choosing the low mean reward options in the equal condition quantifies baseline behavioral variability in horizon 1, while the change in (low mean) in horizon 6 quantifies random exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Older adults are slower and more accurate on the Horizon Task</p><p>As a simple measure of performance on the Horizon Task, we computed accuracy as the frequency with which participants chose the objectively correct option (i.e., the option with the higher generative mean, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref>, B). Accuracy is at chance during the instructed trials, which reflects the fact that participants do not get a free choice during these trials. During the freechoice trials, however, participants chose the objectively correct option significantly more than chance (t(82) = 86.5, p &lt; 0.001) at approximately 77% overall accuracy. There were no age group differences in this measure of overall accuracy (t(81) = 1.6773, p = 0.097), although older adults were numerically more accurate than younger adults (older: M = 0.78, SD = 0.07; young: M = 0.75, SD = 0.07). Next, we analyzed accuracy on the first free-choice trial in more detail using an ANOVA with horizon condition and age group as factors. We found a main effect of horizon (F(1, 81) = 29.77, p &lt; 0.001) due to increased accuracy in the horizon 1 condition (M = 0.78, SD = 0.09) relative to horizon 6 (M = 0.73, SD = 0.10), no main effect of age group (F(1, 81) = 0.71, p = 0.4), and an interaction between age group and horizon (F(1, 81) = 11.60, p = 0.001) such that young adults shifted their accuracy more between horizons (M = 0.09, SD = 0.09) than older adults (M = 0.02, SD = 0.08).</p><p>We then looked at how accuracy changed for both age groups as they progressed through their free trials in the horizon 6 condition. A two-way analysis of variance with age group and trial number as factors yielded a trending main effect of age group (F(1, 405) = 3.79, p = 0.055), consistent with older adults being more accurate than younger adults. The main effect of trial was significant (F(5, 405) = 23.09, p &lt; 0.001) consistent with both groups improving their performance on later trials due to learning (73% on the first free trial compared to 81% on the last free trial). There was also a significant interaction between age group and trial (F(5, 405) = 4.48, p &lt; 0.001) with young adults improving accuracy at a faster rate (1.9% per trial) than older adults (0.9% per trial).</p><p>In addition to accuracy, we also quantified response times on the Horizon Task. Consistent with previous aging research, older adults took longer to respond on all trials than younger adults (t(81) = 5.8970, p &lt; 0.001, older: M = 1.20 seconds, SD = 0.46, younger: M = 0.72 seconds, SD = 0.23).</p><p>More detailed analysis, restricted to just the first free-choice trial revealed a main effect of age group (F(1, 81) = 29.37, p &lt; 0.001) with older adults taking longer to respond than young adults. We also found an effect of horizon on response time (F(1, 81) = 7.92, p = 0.0061) with all participants taking longer in Horizon 6 (M = 2.16 seconds, SD=1.08) than in Horizon 1 (M = 1.98 seconds, SD = 0.98). There was also an interaction between age group and horizon (F(1, 81) = 6.97, p = 0.0099) with older adults showing a larger increase in RT from horizon 1 to horizon 6 (M = 0.29 seconds, SD = 0.54), compared to young adults (M = 0.01 seconds, SD = 0.35).</p><p>We then looked at how response times changed for both groups as they progressed through their free trials in horizon 6. There was a main effect of age group (F(1, 405) = 24.48, p &lt; 0.001), with older adults (M = 1.38 seconds, SD = 0.59) having larger response times than younger adults (M = 0.82 seconds, SD = 0.33).

Older adults were slower overall but performed numerically better than younger adults in terms of accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Older adults exhibit increased uncertainty aversion and decreased random exploration</head><p>To look at the age-group differences in directed and random exploration we focused on the first free-choice trial, where we could fairly compare behavior in the two horizon conditions. We performed separate repeated-measures ANOVAs for (high info) in the unequal condition and (low mean) in the equal information condition with age group as a between-subjects factor and horizon as a within-subjects factor.</p><p>In the unequal information condition, the ANOVA on (high info) revealed a main effect of age group (F(1, 81) = 15.26, p &lt; 0.001), a main effect of horizon (F(1, 81) = 24.71, p &lt; 0.001) (horizon 1: M = 0.38, SD = 0.20; horizon 6: M = 0.48, SD = 0.22) and no interaction between age and horizon (F(1, 81) = 0.22, p = 0.64). This pattern was due to reduced information seeking overall in older adults ( (high info) older: M = 0.37 SD = 0.21) compared to younger (M = 0.52, SD = 0.18) and no change in directed exploration (Δ (high info) older: M = 0.09, SD = 0.18; Δ (high info) younger: M = 0.11, SD = 0.19).</p><p>In the equal information condition the ANOVA on (low mean) revealed a main effect of horizon (F(1, 81) = 28.94, p &lt; 0.001) with participants showing more behavioral variability in horizon 6 (M = 0.14, SD = 0.13) than in horizon 1 (M = 0.08, SD = 0.09). There was a trending main effect of age (F(1, 81) = 3.29, p = 0.073), with younger adults choosing the low mean option more frequently (M = 0.14, SD = 0.11) than older adults (M = 0.09, SD = 0.12). In addition, there was a significant interaction between age and horizon (F(1, 81) = 4.53, p = 0.036) due to younger participants showing a greater change in (low mean) with horizon (Δ (low mean), younger: M = 0.09, SD = 0.12; older: M = 0.04, SD = 0.10).</p><p>Thus, explore-exploit behavior is quite different in older adults than younger adults.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C D</head><p>While the Horizon Task is designed to look at directed and random exploration on the first freechoice trial, it is possible to define similar model-free metrics on later trials ( (high info, later) and (low mean, later)). (high info, later) can be defined on trials in which participants have sampled one option more than the other. In this case (high info, later) is simply the frequency of choosing the lesser-known option, i.e., the option that has been played less often up to the current trial. (low mean, later) can be defined on all trials as the frequency of choosing the option with the lower observed mean. Note that this definition of (low mean, later) slightly differs from the definition of (low mean) on the first free-choice trial, because (low mean, later) also includes behavior in the unequal ([1 3]) information condition. There are therefore slight numerical differences between (low mean, later) and (low mean) (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 2B and 4C, D)</ref>.</p><p>As discussed in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilson et al. 2014)</ref>, interpreting measures on later trials as reflecting directed and random exploration is difficult because of the "reward-information" confound. When people choose freely -as they do on the later trials -they tend to choose options that are more rewarding. Thus, as the game goes on, they become more certain about the more rewarding options thus confounding the "low mean" option with the "high info" option and random with directed exploration. Nevertheless, it is still possible to compare behavior between groups on later trials, with the caveat that it is difficult to ascribe any changes specifically to directed or random exploration.</p><p>For (high info, later) in horizon 6 games, we found main effects of trial (F(5, 405) = 138.26, p &lt; 0.001) and age group (F(1, 405) = 26.38, p &lt; 0.001), but no interaction between age group and trial (F(5, 405) = 1.35, p = 0.24). (high info, later) decreased in both age groups over the course of the horizon 6 games (trial 1: M = 0.48, SD = 0.22; trial 6: M = 0.13, SD = 0.12) and was reduced on all trials for older adults (younger: M = 0.33, SD = 0.22; older: M = 0.20, SD = 0.15).</p><p>For (low mean, later) in horizon 6 game, we found a main effect of trial (F(5, 405) = 11.09, p &lt; 0.001), a main effect of age group (F(1, 405) = 4.10, p = 0.046), and a significant interaction between age group and trial (F(5, 405) = 3.63, p = 0.0032). This latter pattern was driven by (low mean, later) decreasing more over the course of the game for the younger adults than older adults (change between trial 1 and trial 6: younger: M = -0.083, SD = 0.12; older: M = -0.022, SD = 0.087).</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that age differences in ambiguity aversion and random exploration persist beyond the first free-choice trial.</p></div>

Perhaps most notable, is the subset of 11 older adults and 1 young adult who pick the more informative option less than 25% of the time in both horizon conditions (highlighted region in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2C</ref>). Our previous work suggests that such "extreme ambiguity aversion" is rare in young adults accounting for 1 of the 32 younger participants (3%) in the present study and about 1% of over 500 young adults that we have run in the Horizon Task across multiple studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Krueger et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Somerville et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zajkowski et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wang &amp; Wilson 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sadeghiyeh et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Smith et al., 2022)</ref>.

We found no significant differences in demographics or neuropsychological scores between these two groups (all p &gt; 0.05, <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 2)</ref>, although there was a trend towards ambiguity averse older adults having lower episodic memory scores (ambiguity averse: M = -0.44, IQR(-0.89; 0.04), nonambiguity averse: M = -0.17, IQR(-0.66; 0.47), p = 0.1).</p><p>On the first free-choice trial, an ANOVA revealed no significant differences between the ambiguity averse and non-ambiguity averse older adults (apart from a main effect of ambiguity aversion, F(1, 49) = 152.34, p &lt; 0.001). Ambiguity averse older adults show similar (albeit numerically smaller) levels of directed exploration (Δ (high info), ambiguity averse: M = 0.07, SD = 0.05; non-ambiguity averse: M = 0.10, SD = 0.20). In this regard, the older adults here differ from ambiguity averse schizophrenic patients, who did not show an increase in directed exploration with horizon <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Waltz et al. in 2020)</ref>. In addition, there was no difference in random exploration between the two groups; although, again, the ambiguity averse group had numerically lower scores (  On later trials, unlike the non-ambiguity averse group, the ambiguity averse group did not change their behavior over the course of the horizon 6 games, meaning that there was no change in accuracy, (high info, later), or (low mean, later) on later trials (Supplementary Analysis 2, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Supplementary Figures 2 and 3)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, to determine whether the age-group differences described in the previous section were driven by this ambiguity averse group of participants, we also characterized the behavior of the non-ambiguity averse group of older adults. As shown in the Supplementary Material, reduced baseline information seeking was preserved in this group. Thus, the "non-ambiguity averse" older adults were still more ambiguity averse than younger adults (main effect of age on (high info): F(1, 69) = 8.96, p = 0.0038; younger: M = 0.54, SD = 0.16; older: M = 0.46, SD = 0.15). However, the reduced random exploration in older adults was no longer significant (interaction between age and horizon on (low mean): F(1, 69) = 2.84, p = 0.097; younger: M = 0.09; SD = 0.12; older: M = 0.05; SD = 0.11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we examined the impact of aging on directed and random exploration, while decoupling these measures from baseline uncertainty attitude and behavioral variability. Qualitatively, we found that older adults resolve the explore-exploit dilemma much like younger adults -they use a mixture of directed and random exploration, increasing both information seeking and behavioral variability with horizon. Quantitatively, however, we found that older adults' behavior is quite different -they show more ambiguity aversion in both horizon conditions and less random exploration than younger adults. In a subset of older adults this ambiguity aversion is taken to extremes, with 22% of older participants (11 of 51) showing extreme ambiguity aversion and no random exploration, while only 3% younger adults (1 of 32) exhibited similar behavior.</p><p>Taken together, our findings are consistent with previous work showing reduced exploration with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Louâpre et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mata et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ligneul, 2019)</ref>. Our work adds nuance to these findings by showing that this reduced overall exploration is driven by increased ambiguity aversion and decreased random exploration in older adults. Our findings also suggest that reduced overall exploration is not driven by an inability of older adults to modulate directed exploration with horizon. Indeed, the extent to which older adults changed their information seeking with horizon was identical to younger adults.</p><p>More generally, this differential age dependence for directed exploration and random exploration mirrors earlier findings in adolescents where directed exploration increased with age while random exploration remained constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Somerville et. al., 2017)</ref>. Taken together, these results point to an asymmetric relationship between age and these two types of exploration. Directed exploration is low in young teens, increases throughout adolescence into young adulthood and is maintained in older adulthood. Random exploration stays constant through adolescence and young adulthood but decreases in older adulthood.</p><p>Our findings are also consistent with the "lifespan hypothesis," which postulates that reducing exploration and increasing exploitation as we age is adaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Eliassen et al., 2007)</ref>. Building from theories of optimal foraging, this theory proposes that early in our lives we should be more predisposed to explore in order to gain information about the world. Then, as we get older, the balance should shift towards exploitation, as we should have gained enough information to live comfortably. In this view, the change in explore-exploit behavior is adaptive, a healthy change that should occur as we get older and does not reflect any sort of deficit. In line with this idea, older adults performed better on our task than younger adults, earning more points and choosing the objectively correct option more often.</p><p>Interestingly, this improved performance was not seen for older adults who were extremely ambiguity averse -i.e., those who almost never chose the more informative option. These participants performed worse on the task than younger adults and did not improve their performance over the course of the horizon 6 games. This finding suggests that this subset of older adults reduce their exploration too much in old age, leading to worse performance and an inability to learn about new options. In the real world, such pathologically low exploration could be disadvantageous and help to explain why ambiguity and risk aversion are associated with cognitive decline in older age <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bayard et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">de Siqueira et al. 2017)</ref>. Clearly more work, using real-world measures of exploration and health outcomes, is required to test this idea in detail.</p><p>More generally, extreme ambiguity aversion in the Horizon Task is not a common behavioral phenotype in younger adults or teenagers. Indeed, in our previous work with over 500 participants under the age of 30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Krueger et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Somerville et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zajkowski et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sadeghiyeh et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Smith et al. 2022)</ref>, extreme ambiguity occurs less than 1% of the time. The only other group, in which this behavior is prevalent, thus far, is in patients with schizophrenia, where approximately 21% (23 of 108) showed extreme ambiguity aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Waltz et al. 2020)</ref>. Intriguingly, there were two slight differences between the behavior of the patients and the older adults. First, while they were always ambiguity averse, older adults were less ambiguity averse in the long horizon condition, suggesting that directed exploration was somewhat preserved in this group. In contrast, the ambiguity averse patients did not adjust their behavior based on horizon, suggesting that directed exploration is absent. Second, ambiguity averse older adults showed almost no random exploration, whereas random exploration was intact in the patients. Exactly what is underlying these different patterns of behavior is unclear, but a key target for future work will be to pin down the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying extreme ambiguity aversion, and whether these mechanisms differ in older adults and schizophrenia.</p><p>Finally, we note that our finding of differential age dependence for directed and random exploration is consistent with growing evidence that these two types of exploration rely on dissociable cognitive and neural systems (see Schulz <ref type="bibr">&amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gershman, 2019 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wilson et al. 2021)</ref>. Such a dissociation between directed and random exploration has been seen in pharmacological (Warren et al. 2017), neuroimaging (Tomov et al 2020), neurostimulation <ref type="bibr">(Zajkowski, Kossut &amp; Wilson, 2017)</ref>, and individual difference experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Somerville et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sadhegiyeh et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Smith et al., 2022)</ref>, as well as in clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Waltz et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wiehler, Chackroun, &amp; Peters, 2019)</ref>. Intriguingly, however, whenever this dissociation has been seen between groups, the group difference has always been in directed exploration not random exploration, suggesting that random exploration may not vary between groups. It is therefore notable that in this study we find a selective effect of age group on random exploration but not directed exploration. This shows that group differences can also arise in random exploration in a case where horizon-dependent directed exploration remains unchanged.</p><p>Going forward, future work with neuroimaging and neurostimulation will be necessary to determine the neural mechanisms underlying these age effects on explore-exploit behavior. More generally, a better understanding of age-related differences in explore-exploit decision making may help to advance efforts to support and enhance quality of life for individuals over the adult lifespan.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Supplementary Figure 1</ref>, the main patterns of behavior on the first free-choice trial are the same as in the main paper ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). For (high info), we find main effects of horizon (F(1, 90) = 19.72, p &lt; 0.001) and age group (F(1, 90) = 10.25, p = 0.0019), but no interaction (F(1, 90) = 0.03, p = 0.87). This is consistent with older adults being more ambiguity averse overall but having no difference in directed exploration.</p><p>For (low mean), we find a main effect of horizon (F(1, 90) = 32.42, p &lt; 0.001), no main effect of age (F(1, 90) = 1.65, p = 0.2), and a significant interaction between age and horizon (F(1, 90) = 5.63, p = 0.02). This is consistent with older adults showing reduced random exploration compared to younger adults. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Supplementary Figure 1</ref> -First free-choice trial performance on the Horizon Task without excluding participants for performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Analysis 3: Correlation between individual difference measures and Horizon Task behavior</head><p>As an exploratory analysis, we investigated the correlations between individual differences in Education, MOCA, and neuropsychological scores and behavior on the Horizon Task within each age group. It is important to note that our sample size for this analysis is small and our findings should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, some interesting patterns emerge that will be worth following up in larger studies.</p><p>Specifically, we computed Spearman correlations between each individual difference measure and six model-free measures from the Horizon Task ( (high info) and (low mean) in each horizon condition and the changes Δ (high info) and Δ (low mean)) separately for each age group. These correlations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref>. In part because of our small sample size, very few of these correlations are significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level and none of these significant correlations survive correction for multiple comparisons. In older adults, only two correlation was significant at the 0.05 threshold -increased Crystalized Intelligence and Working Memory scores were both associated with lower levels of variability (i.e. (low mean)) in horizon 6. This appeared to be part of a broader pattern in which measures of behavioral variability ( (low mean) in both horizon conditions) were negatively correlated with most measures of cognitive function. This finding is similar to our findings in schizophrenic patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Waltz et al. 2020)</ref> and is in line with other work suggesting that behavioral variability across a range of domains, from finger tapping to walking to decision making, is related to cognitive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bielak et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Grand et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mulligan et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">MacDonald et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Moutoussis et al. 2021</ref>, for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Haynes et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>A second general pattern that appears in older adults is the positive correlation between several measures of cognitive function and overall information seeking ( (high info) in both horizon conditions). MOCA, Processing Speed, Episodic Memory, Fluency, and Executive Function all have positive correlations here. Again, this pattern is consistent with the correlations we observed in schizophrenic patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Waltz et al. 2020)</ref> where we found measures of Processing Speed, Verbal Fluency, and overall cognitive function (MATRICS composite score) related to overall information seeking.</p><p>In younger adults, we see a similar association between overall behavioral variability and a number of cognitive measures, such that higher cognitive scores are associated with lower (low mean) in both horizon conditions. In contrast, we see a different pattern for (high info) in which most neuropsychological measures are negatively correlated with horizon 1 behavior, but less strongly with horizon 6 behavior, leading to a situation where directed exploration is positively correlated with most cognitive measures. Again, this is similar to our findings in schizophrenia, where patients (who were younger and middle-aged) also showed a positive association between measures of cognitive function and directed exploration.</p><p>Taken together, these individual difference correlations are suggestive. In both age groups, higher neuropsychological scores are associated with lower behavioral variability. In older adults, higher neuropsychological scores are associated with more information seeking overall. In younger adults, higher neuropsychological scores are associated with less information seeking in horizon 1 and more directed exploration. Of course, given our small sample size these findings should be taken with a grain of salt until our experiment can be replicated in a larger sample.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The Horizon Task.
