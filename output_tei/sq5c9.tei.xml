				<p>People are inundated with popular press reports about medical research concerning what&apos;s healthy, get advice from doctors, and hear personal anecdotes. How do people integrate conflicting anecdotal and statistical information when making medical decisions? In four experiments (N = 4,125), we tested how people integrate conflicting information to judge the efficacy of artificial and real medical treatments. Participants read an anecdote from someone in a clinical trial, or who had undergone a medical treatment previously, for whom the medical treatment was ineffective. We found that reading anecdotes for either artificial or real medical treatments shifted participants&apos; beliefs about the efficacy of a medical treatment. We observed this result even when the anecdote was uninformative, was paired with an icon array, or when participants were provided with thorough medical decision-aids about reproductive health procedures. Our findings highlight the pervasive effect of anecdotes on medical decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Making decisions about medical treatments can be a difficult and stress inducing process. When the decision concerns those we love, or those who are vulnerable, the stakes can make even relatively clear decisions seem paralyzing. People are inundated with popular press reports about medical research concerning what's healthy, get advice from doctors, and hear personal anecdotes from friends, relatives, and the media (see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sillence, Briggs, Harris, &amp; Fishwick, 2007)</ref>. How can people make appropriate medical decisions under these conditions? It might seem obvious that people's beliefs should reflect the scientific consensus, but when our own and our families' health is at stake, a compelling narrative or personal anecdote can be hard to ignore <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Powell, Bian, &amp; Markman, 2020)</ref>. Network abortion fund reported an increase in pregnant people contacting them with concerns of the safety of abortions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acevedo, 2022)</ref>, including unwarranted concerns that abortion causes breast cancer or future infertility <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acevedo, 2022)</ref>. Just as researchers have observed for reproductive health treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kern &amp; Reader, 2022)</ref>, hesitancy about common and safe medical treatments (e.g., the MMR vaccine) has been found to be driven by reliance on anecdotal evidence spread through online communities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Powell, Weisman, &amp; Markman, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Outside of medical decision-making contexts, researchers have found that people are capable of correctly integrating statistical information to make informed medical decisions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allen &amp; Preiss, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hornikx, 2005)</ref>, but they may nonetheless improperly attend to irrelevant anecdotal information, particularly when that information is salient and relates to uncertainty and risk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allen &amp; Preiss, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shen, Sheer, &amp; Li, 2015)</ref>. It has also been established that narratives are more engaging and comprehensive than statistical information alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dahlstrom, 2014)</ref>, but when learning about new scientific information, anecdotal information might interfere with scientific judgments when that information deviates from the available evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rodriguez, Rhodes, Miller, &amp; Shah, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Of course, real life medical decision-making isn't so easy as comparing abridged data from clinical trials with anecdotal information that uniformly support or are contrary to that data. Beyond the lab, neither anecdotal information nor statistical information are presented in isolation; people often learn about medical treatments through media outlets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dobransky &amp; Hargittai, 2012)</ref>, which will report both the statistical findings of a clinical trial, whilst also providing the "human-side" of this trial. For instance, media outlets will cite anecdotes of some of the participants who were in the clinical trial to better highlight the (typically, positive) outcomes of the trial. In the months following the roll out of the covid vaccine, there was an increase in anecdotal reports of the vaccine affecting people's menstrual cycles, a side effect that has since been confirmed empirically <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Male, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, to have a comprehensive understanding of the extent of the impact of anecdotal information on medical decision-making-whether positive or negative-researchers need to understand the effects of anecdotal reports from trial participants paired with statistical information.</p><p>There are further aspects of medical decision making that are harder to capture in controlled studies. Not only do healthcare providers cite overall findings from clinical trials to help their patients make informed decisions, but for decisions that are more optional or present greater risks for specific populations, patients are also informed about how demographic details (e.g., sex, race, preexisting conditions) can interact with the efficacy or risks of some medical procedures (e.g., patient demographic information for prednisone Single Care Team, 2022). Because of the additional uncertainty and complexity in making their decisions, healthcare providers often assist patients by also providing them with decision-aids that include icon arrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lewandowsky, Gignac, &amp; Vaughan, 2013)</ref> to guide them through their choices. Decision-aids often take the form of a kind of step-by-step guide to evaluating the pros and cons of a prospective procedure or treatment intended to increase patients' knowledge about a procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Stacey et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, to more clearly resolve the impact of anecdotal information on medical decision-making, researchers need to establish the extent of their influence in the presence of additional tools patients would likely be given by their healthcare provider (e.g., demographic information, decision-aids which include icon arrays for communicating complex statistical information, and so forth).</p><p>Here, we sought to address two questions: First, when people are presented with both statistical summary information about a clinical trial and anecdotes, and the anecdotes are from a patient in the trial, how do participants reason on the basis of this information? Do people follow the summary statistics or do anecdotes still affect their judgments? Some research suggests that anecdotes do not impact the integration of statistical evidence in non-medical domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hornikx, 2018)</ref>, but there is less research on this question in the domain of medical decision-making, where the stakes can be high and thus anecdotes might may exhibit stronger effects. Second, what impact, if any, does anecdotal information have on participants' judgments in applied domains and uncertain situations, where participants might seek out additional information and where individual differences and demographic factors are likely to exert an effect?</p><p>In the present experiments, we examined the effect of anecdotes on decision-making about novel and real-life medical decisions. In Experiments 1a -1c, we investigated the ways in which anecdotal information influences how people interpret a (fake) clinical trial describing the efficacy of a medical treatment. Describing a comparatively unfamiliar medical treatment allowed us to tightly control the anecdotal and statistical information participants were presented with. In Experiment 2, we examined how anecdotal information impacted decision-making in an applied domain about preventative, but optional, reproductive healthcare treatments. Experiment 2 allowed us to test the generality and applicability of the effects we observed in Experiments 1a -1c.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic Approach</head><p>We performed Bayesian estimation using the R package brms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bürkner, 2017)</ref>. The priors we set for each analysis are on the Open Science Framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments 1a -1c</head><p>In Experiments 1a -1c, we first examined whether for less familiar medical treatments, anecdotes-which provided no additional information over statistical summary information-impact people's beliefs about the efficacy of a medical treatment.</p><p>Consequently, in Experiments 1a -1c, we focused on a plausible but relatively unknown medical treatment that people would not have strong beliefs about. Specifically, we examined people's beliefs about B-12 injections as means for treating chronic headaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1a</head><p>Participants. In Experiment 1a, we recruited 497 participants through Cloud Research recruitment (47% women, M age = 38 years old). Cloud Research has created a curated sample of approximately 75, 000 participants from Amazon Web Services (AWS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chandler, Rosenzweig, Moss, Robinson, &amp; Litman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Litman, Robinson, &amp; Abberbock, 2017)</ref>. This sample was developed to remove low quality participants, participants with duplicate IP addresses, and prevent participants with suspicious geocodes from participating in studies. It also requires participants' country location is verified to remove the likelihood of "bots" in the sample. All subsequent experiments used these recruitment features from Cloud Research to ensure data quality.</p><p>Participants were paid approximately $6.00 an hour for participating in a five-minute study. After excluding participants who missed questions checking their attention, 431 participants remained in our sample. Our exclusion criteria were determined a priori and were in accordance with our study preregistration.</p><p>Procedure. In Experiment 1a, we presented participants with either statistical evidence, anecdotal evidence, or the combination of both types of evidence about a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of B-12 injections on chronic headaches. The study consisted of three parts: a pretest questionnaire, an intervention, and a posttest questionnaire. After completing this portion of the study, participants completed individual differences measures related to beliefs in medical skepticism, holistic medicine, and finally demographic questions. For brevity, we will not describe our exploratory analyses of these individual differences measures, but the data containing this information is available on the Open Science Framework.</p><p>Pretest Questionnaire. In Experiments 1a-1c, we sought to create a controlled context in which people judged the efficacy of an unfamiliar, but plausible medical treatment. To that end, participants made decisions about B-12 injections as a treatment for headaches. B-12 injections are not a widely used treatment but may nonetheless seem efficacious to people because most people are familiar with B-12 supplements.</p><p>The pretest phase of the study proceeded as follows: First, participants answered a brief questionnaire examining their familiarity with B-12 injections (Yes/No), then they indicated whether they are currently receiving or have received B-12 injections (Yes/No), and finally they indicated whether they are currently considering receiving B-12 injections as a medical treatment (Yes/No). After responding to these questions, participants were then asked on a five-point Likert scale whether they believe B-12 injections are an effective medical treatment (1 = "Not effective at all", 5 = "Extremely effective").</p><p>Conditions. After completing the B-12 pretest questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a between-subjects design: the Statistics condition, the Positive Anecdote condition, the Statistics + Positive Anecdote condition, or the Statistics + "Negative" Anecdote condition.</p><p>In the Statistics condition, participants read a description of a (fake) clinical trial examining the effects of B-12 injections on patients with chronic headaches. Specifically, participants read that in a clinical trial with 1,000 subjects, B-12 injections were 87.3% effective as a medical treatment for chronic headaches. In the Positive Anecdote condition participants did not receive statistical information but were told "Jamie's [the protagonist in the anecdote] doctor recommended that she participate in a new clinical trial that was examining the effects of B-12 on headaches". Participants in the Positive Anecdote condition were then were told that Jamie decided to receive B-12 and subsequently experienced a reduction in her symptoms. In the Statistics + Positive Anecdote condition, participants first read the summary statistics demonstrating the efficacy of B-12 injections (that is, the exact material presented in the Statistics condition). They were then told that they would read about the experience of one of the subjects in the study, after which they were presented with the anecdote from the Positive Anecdote condition. Thus, the anecdote described is redundant with the statistical summary information participants had already read. Finally, participants in the Statistics + "Negative" Anecdote condition were given the same materials as participants in the Statistics + Positive Anecdote condition, but the anecdote was a self-report of someone in the trial for whom the treatment was ineffective. Participants learned that "Jamie received a B-12 injection and her headaches, lack of energy, and inability to focus persisted." Critically, however, Jamie was not described as experiencing any side effects as a consequence of her treatment. Rather, the treatment was described as only being ineffective.</p><p>We will highlight two key design decisions about Experiments 1a (as well as Experiments 1b-1c): First, the anecdote participants read contained no new information in the conditions where it was paired with statistical information. This is because summary statistics already capture the success or failure of B-12 injections in the clinical trial and the anecdote concerns someone who was in the clinical trial. In other words, the anecdote contains no additional information over and above the statistic -the anecdote either describes the treatment as effective or ineffective and no other relevant information beyond this. This point is related to a second design decision: Namely, in the Statistics + "Negative" Anecdote condition, B-12 was described as failing as a treatment but not introducing any unwanted side-effects. From a rational decision-making perspective, then, the negative anecdote should not affect participants' interpretation of the statistical information presented to them.</p><p>Posttest Questionnaire. After completing the intervention portion of the task, participants completed a posttest questionnaire in which they were asked whether they believed B-12 injections were an effective medical treatment.</p><p>As noted, one possibility is that when the stakes are high for a given medical decision, people may be more susceptible to anecdotal information leading them to ignore statistical information. To this end, we also included two additional questions in the posttest questionnaire. First, participants were asked how likely it was they would try B-12 injections on a five-point Likert scale. Second, they were asked how likely they were to give B-12 injections to their child (if applicable). It's possible that a negative anecdote would exhibit a stronger negative effect on people's reasoning about their child compared to themselves because people are more risk averse when it comes to making decisions that impact their children's health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brody, Annett, Scherer, Perryman, &amp; Cofrin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Johnson et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We predicted that participants in the Statistics + Positive Anecdote condition would be most likely to think that B-12 injections were effective as a treatment for chronic headaches -the positive anecdote would make salient the statistical summary information.</p><p>This outcome would suggest that health communication experts could include similar positive anecdotes to increase people's uptake of statistical information <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, we were unsure whether the Statistics condition or the Positive Anecdote condition would differ from each other, though the Statistics condition objectively contains stronger evidence.</p><p>Of particular interest was how participants would respond to the negative anecdote in the Statistics + Negative Anecdote condition. One possibility is that presenting participants with a negative anecdote could raise the salience of the inefficacy of B-12 injections. However, we were unsure to what extent a single negative anecdote could impact people's use of the statistical summary information.  and pretest beliefs about the efficacy of B-12. Following the recommendations of (Bürkner, 2018), we modeled pretest as a monotonic effect because of the ordinal nature of this predictor. A comprehensive discussion of the motivation to model ordinal predictors this way can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bürkner, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>This model revealed that the Positive Anecdote, Statistics, and Statistics + Positive Anecdote conditions did not materially differ from each other (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). However, the negative anecdote in the Statistics + Negative Anecdote condition caused participants to discount the statistical information, despite the fact that (1) the statistic already summarizes the information contained in the negative anecdote and (2) the negative anecdote in no way suggests that the protagonist suffered a side-effect as a result of taking We made two other minor changes in Experiment 1b. First, participants in the Statistics condition were explicitly told both the inefficacy and efficacy rates of B-12 injections in treating chronic headaches. We did this to better equate the salience of the inefficacy rate in the Statistics condition to the conditions in which the negative anecdote appeared. Specifically, participants read that "After a two-year trial with 1,000 participants, their study revealed that B-12 injections failed to work for 12.7% of participants and worked for 87.3%." Second, we changed the Likert scale for our posttest questions regarding the likelihood of trying B-12 injections and giving B-12 to one's child.</p><p>These were changed from a five-point Likert scale to a six-point Likert scale which ranged from 1 = "Very unlikely" to 6 = "Very likely" to better reflect the question participants answered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>As in Experiment 1a, we predicted that participants in the Statistics + Positive  however, did not consistently improve participants' integration of the statistical information, and in some cases, did not differ at all from when participants only received the negative anecdote (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2)</ref>. Still, the uncertainty in the estimates of the effects of positive and negative anecdotes suggested that our sample sizes may be too small to reliably detect the effect of short anecdotes on medical decision-making. We sought to resolve this in Experiment 1c by recruiting a substantially larger sample of participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1c</head><p>Experiment 1b revealed that presentation of a negative anecdote raises the salience of the inefficacy of B-12 injections. This effect was not consistently negated by positive anecdotal information, demonstrating the intransigence and pervasiveness of the effect of even uninformative anecdotal information.</p><p>Experiment 1c addresses two questions. First, we addressed the possibility that participants did not realize the anecdote they read was about a person in the study. Our hope was that by visually showing participants that the anecdote they read was about a person in the study we could rule out the possibility that a negative anecdote had its effects just in virtue of it being perceived as new, negatively-valenced information. Second, inspired by recent work on data visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lewandowsky et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nyhan &amp; Reifler, 2018)</ref>, Experiment 1c tested whether the effect of the negative anecdote would persist even when a visual aid was presented to increase understanding of the statistical information participants were presented with. Several recent studies suggest that icon arrays, for instance, can improve understanding of scientific consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lewandowsky et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nyhan &amp; Reifler, 2018)</ref>. Experiment 1c tested whether the effect of the negative anecdote would persist even when an icon array was used to succinctly express the statistical summary information about the clinical trial.</p><p>Participants. We recruited 1,622 participants through Cloud Research recruitment (54% women, M age = 38). Participants were paid approximately $6.00 an hour for participating in a five-minute study. After excluding participants who missed questions checking their attention, 1,539 participants remained in our sample. A larger sample was collected to ensure that any failure to find an effect of icon arrays on reducing the effect of the negative anecdote was not due to lack of statistical power. Our exclusion criteria were determined a priori and were in accordance with our study preregistration.</p><p>Procedure. The procedure of Experiment 1c was similar to that of Experiments 1a and 1b. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 (Icon Array: Present or Absent) × 2 (Negative Anecdote: Present or Absent) between-subjects design.</p><p>All four conditions included the summary statistical information from the Statistics condition in Experiment 1a, allowing us to internally replicate our results in a larger sample.</p><p>In the Icon Array only condition, participants first read the statistic about the efficacy of B-12 injections as a medical treatment. They were then shown an icon array showing the success rate of B-12 in 100 people <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3</ref>). Participants were then told:</p><p>"This image is a depiction of the effectiveness of B-12 as a medical treatment.</p><p>Imagine 100 people received B-12 injections. The blue figures represent participants that would benefit from the B-12 injections. The green figures represent participants who would fail to benefit from the B-12 injections."</p><p>We chose a "neutral" color scheme and did not include red icons or circles to avoid any immediate associations that might indicate that patients in the clinical trial in red, or circled in red, experienced negative side-effects of the treatment. Again, negative anecdotes simply indicated a treatment was ineffective rather than that it had unwanted side-effects.</p><p>In the Icon Array + Negative Anecdote condition, participants received the same information as the Icon Array only condition but were then told they would read about the experience of one of the subjects in the study and an icon array was displayed with one of the participants circled <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3)</ref>, indicating that the anecdote was from someone who participated in the clinical trial. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We predicted that we would replicate the effect of negative anecdotes on participants' acceptance of strong statistical evidence, as we found in Experiments 1a and 1b. We also predicted that in the Icon Array + Negative Anecdote condition, the presence of the icon array would weaken the effect of the negative anecdote (indicating an Icon × Anecdote interaction).  We replicated the effects of Experiments 1a and 1b <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Experiments 1a -1c</head><p>In Experiments 1a -1c, we tested how people reason about a novel medical treatment when provided with statistical and anecdotal information. In Experiment 1a, we found that a negative anecdote caused people to ignore strong statistical information even though the anecdote described no negative side effects -indeed, the information presented in the anecdote was already captured by the summary statistics presented to participants.</p><p>In Experiment 1b, we explored whether providing a positive anecdote in addition to a negative anecdote would counteract the effect of the negative anecdote. We found that emphasizing a positive outcome of a clinical trial did not consistently undo the effect of the negative anecdote, again demonstrating the pervasiveness of the anecdotal-information effect. In Experiment 1c, we found that introducing icon arrays improved integration of statistical information overall, but even in this case, anecdotal information impacted people's beliefs. This suggests that a single negative anecdote can carry substantial weight when making medical decisions.</p><p>It is striking that a "negative" anecdote led people to discount strong summary statistics even though the patient was described as suffering no negative side effects because of their treatment. In reality, many medical treatments involve an element of risk, and some treatments can even involve severe side effects. In these situations, anecdotes that contain new information and highlight side effects would, if anything, yield a larger negative impact on people's ability to properly integrate statistical information (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shen et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To examine the breadth of the effects of negative anecdotes on medical decision-making, Experiment 2 tested how they impact medical decision-making about widely-known reproductive health treatments. Testing the effect of anecdotal information in this domain allows us to examine how anecdotal information interacts with demographic information (e.g., sex). Further, as we will detail, turning to real medical decisions allowed us to study how the presence of further information often provided to patients to guide their medical decisions may attenuate the affects of anecdotal information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>In Experiments 1a -1c, we found that presenting people with a negative anecdote can influence people's efficacy beliefs even when presented with compelling statistical evidence. However, people are not typically presented with medical information in an isolated manner about a treatment about which they have little information. Medical practitioners will often provide their patients with decision-aids, and patients themselves will often learn about prospective treatments online or by talking to friends and family. In a study examining the effect of googling on doctor-patient relations, researchers found that two-thirds of patients looked up their symptoms online prior to a doctor's consultation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Van Riel, Auwerx, Debbaut, Van Hees, &amp; Schoenmakers, 2017)</ref>. It is clear then that patients no longer solely rely on their doctors' opinions when making their choices.</p><p>Consequently, in Experiment 2, we tested whether negative anecdotes would continue to impact participants beliefs in a situation in which participants were provided with both decision-aids and negative anecdotes.</p><p>In The anecdotal information was taken from online discussion forums where people shared their experiences after undergoing a medical treatment. These anecdotes were stripped of any possibly identifying information to ensure anonymity.</p><p>Attitudes about preventative health treatments, trust in their efficacy, and uptake of treatments are highly variable depending on an individual's access to affordable, non-discriminatory health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pullen, Perry, &amp; Oser, 2014)</ref>. Likewise, narratives are also multidimensional, and the specific dimensions may impact how much of a role they play in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Shaffer &amp; Zikmund-Fisher, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Shaffer and Zikmund-Fisher (2013)</ref> argued that if a narrative is used to provide information or persuade but the content outcome is contrary to the purpose (i.e., the person in the story reports a negative experience), then the content is not suited for the intended purpose. Medical decision-aids often consist of anecdotes from individuals, including those who had a negative experience with the treatment. Consequently, health professionals often include anecdotes in their decision-aids to provide patients with a full spectrum of the potential outcomes they could experience.</p><p>Participants. We recruited 1,580 participants through Cloud Research recruitment (53% women, M age = 40). Participants were paid approximately $6.00 per hour for participating in a 20 minute study. After excluding participants who missed attention check questions, 1,407 participants remained in our sample. Our exclusion criteria were determined a priori and were in accordance with our study preregistration.</p><p>The data from Experiment were collected a year before the Dobbs v. Jackson decision was handed down by the United States Supreme Court.</p><p>Procedure. We aimed to test medical treatments that highlighted two key features. First, we aimed to capture the optional nature of some treatments -most medical treatments are optional, so a strong test of the effect of anecdotes on decisions should reflect this fact. Second, we selected treatments that are highly effective and thus reflected similar efficacy rates as Experiments 1a-1c. To this end, we used three medical treatments in reproductive health: the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) test, epidurals as a method of birth pain relief, and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD).</p><p>The procedure of Experiment 2 was similar to that of Experiment 1c: Before the experimental manipulation, participants were asked to complete a pretest questionnaire examining their familiarity about each of the three reproductive health treatments (Yes/No). After responding to these pretest questions, participants were then asked on a five-point Likert scale whether they believe these were effective preventative health treatments (1 = "Not effective at all", 5 = "Extremely effective").</p><p>Participants were then randomly assigned in a 2 (Icon Array: Present or Absentbetween-subjects) × 2 (Negative Anecdote: Present or Absent -between-subjects) × 3 (Medical Decision -within-subjects) mixed-effects design. After assignment to one of the four between-subjects conditions, participants read three different vignettes about reproductive health treatments. Vignettes were blocked so that posttest measures were administered after a given vignette (e.g., the IUD posttest questionnaire was administered after the IUD materials). Because these vignettes were paired with extensive health-decision aids commonly given to women considering these treatments, and to improve the generalizability of our results, participants were asked about three different treatments (rather than a single treatment -B-12 injections) to increase our statistical power. Further, we wanted to test the affect of anecdotes across a wider variety of treatments in the event that, unbeknownst to us, one treatment was more polarizing or idiosyncratic than we anticipated. As before, all four between-subjects conditions included summary statistical information. The order of the three within-subjects conditions was randomized.</p><p>The Statistics Only condition is displayed in the left-most column of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Here, participants read information from a medical pamphlet about hormonal IUDs (South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, n.d.). Participants were presented with the following statistical information, "In a clinical trial studying the efficacy of the hormonal IUD in preventing pregnancy, there was less than 1 pregnancy per 100 women using an IUD over the first year (two per 1,000 women). This means that 998 of every 1,000 women using hormonal IUDs will not become pregnant."</p><p>In the Anecdote condition, participants read the same statistical information as participants in the Statistics Only condition. They also read about the experience of Jennifer who had a hormonal IUD inserted. Unlike studies 1a -1c, we presented the anecdotal information at the start of the vignette (i.e., before participants read all of the information in the rather lengthy decision-aid). This design decision was motivated by the fact that anecdotal information is comparatively easy for patients to access relative to decision-aids, and the finding that patients tend to Google experiences of their possible treatments prior to consulting with their physician <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Van Riel et al., 2017)</ref>. When presented with the statistical summary, participants were told that "Jennifer, the patient you read about who chose to have a hormonal IUD inserted, was a patient in this clinical trial."</p><p>In the Icon Array only condition, participants first read a statistic about the efficacy of a preventative medical treatment, such as the hormonal IUD to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>These vignettes were taken from preexisting medical decision aids (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Participants were then shown an icon array showing the success rate of the hormonal IUD to prevent pregnancy ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Participants were then told: <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> . The icon array used in the Icon Array + Negative Anecdote condition for the hormonal IUD vignette in Experiment 3. See SOM for the icon arrays used in the HPV test vignette and the Epidural vignette.</p><p>"Imagine 100 people like you sitting in a cinema. Now, imagine they all choose a hormonal IUD for birth control. Out of those 100 people, the IUD will have effectively prevented pregnancy for 99 people."</p><p>In the Icon Array + Negative Anecdote condition, participants received the same information as the Icon Array only condition but first read about the experience of someone who experienced having a hormonal IUD inserted. After the trial, participants answered questions to test how effective they thought the medical treatments are and whether they would try them themselves or recommend someone they know to try them.</p><p>Finally, participants who identified as female answered a battery of demographic questions pertaining to reproductive health of female identifying individuals. Thus, male identifying participants were not asked to complete this questionnaire.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We first sought to test whether the inclusion of a negative anecdote would affect participants' judgments as we saw across Experiments 1a -1c. We fit a Bayesian multivariate cumulative model regressing efficacy attitudes on the presence of an Anecdote (Reference = No Anecdote) and Sex (Reference = Female) and the interaction between these predictors. The summary of this model is shown below. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 6 and 7</ref> show the effect of anecdotes across sex and each medical treatment. As predicted, the anecdote affected females' beliefs about the efficacy of the treatment, along with their willingness to try it, whereas males were only nominally, and weakly, affected by the presence of an anecdote (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 2</ref>). Note, however, that Sex and Negative Anecdote did not interact.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 6 and 7)</ref>. The details of these analyses are located in the Supplement. Although this finding diverges from prior literature demonstrating that icon arrays are effective at communicating statistical information, participants in our study received extensive decision-aids in which icon arrays played only one role.    <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> . Participant ratings of the likelihood they would try or recommend the treatment across conditions in Experiment 2. Higher Likert scale choices indicate more favorable attitudes towards health topics. The figure indicates that participants presented with negative anecdotal evidence had less favorable attitudes towards treatments after the intervention relative to participants who were not presented with negative anecdotal evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>People have access to more medical information than ever before. From journal articles to online forums, people must determine what information is relevant and reliable to make medical decisions. High rates of misinformation regarding medical decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Suarez-Lledo, Alvarez-Galvez, et al., 2021)</ref>, mostly recently, about issues like women's reproductive health and vaccine safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Patev &amp; Hood, 2021)</ref>, makes these decisions even more difficult. How do people make these decisions? It appears that despite the best attempts to support evidence-based decision-making with well designed decision-aids, anecdotes persistently affect decisions.</p><p>Across four experiments, we observed that negative anecdotes reduced the perceived effectiveness of, and willingness to try, a variety of medical treatments. We observed this effect despite the fact that negative anecdotes added no new information that was not subsumed by the summary statistics participants were presented with. Further, in Experiments 1a -1c, they did not highlight any greater risk or side effects; the new medical treatment was only reported to have been ineffective for a single patient. This pattern was consistent when statistical reasoning was supported by icon arrays -a data visualization tool specifically designed to aid people's understanding complex statistical information. Finally, the effect of negative anecdotes on people's reasoning emerged even when a single anecdote was accompanied by established decision-aids.</p><p>There are two important qualifications of the effect of negative anecdotes on decision-making. First, we did not observe that positive anecdotes boosted the perceived credibility of clinical trials, suggesting that perhaps anecdotes are particularly effective when they undermine a clinical trial or raise the salience of side effects. Further research is necessary to establish the generalizability of this finding. Second, we did not observe an interaction between sex of the participant and the anecdote for Experiment 2 on reproductive health, although it appears females, at least nominally, were more affected by the anecdote than were males. This suggests that the effect of the anecdote may be related to the decision-maker's capacity to think they could have to make this same decision, or at least be empathetic to the need to make the decision. This interpretation of the sex-interaction is consistent with a recent meta-analysis on anecdotal bias where anecdotes have bigger effects when they concern a decision more relevant to the decision-maker <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Freling, Yang, Saini, Itani, &amp; Abualsamh, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>It is quite possible that making the anecdote more compelling could make men more empathetic to the woman in the anecdote condition and increase its effect for men <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Argo, Zhu, &amp; Dahl, 2008)</ref>. On the other hand, this indicates that the effects we observed across four experiments are unlikely to be the product of task-demands; participants for whom the anecdote was less relevant appear to be less impacted by it. In any case, this exploratory result suggests an important direction for future research -why are anecdotes simply ineffective for some; in this case, half of the participants in Experiment 2.</p><p>Our study highlights the persistent effects of negative anecdotes on medical decision-making. It is striking that a single anecdote can impact reasoning even when presented with medical decision aids. Everyday experience suggests that when people research and discuss their medical decisions, they come across not one, but multiple negative anecdotes. In certain cases, people seek these anecdotes out, particularly when one has broad concerns about a prospective treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Van Riel et al., 2017)</ref>. But some of the information they encounter could contain misinformation. Consequently, we expect that the findings reported here provide a conservative estimate of the effect of anecdotal information on people's reasoning. In fact, we expect that the effects of anecdotal information are strong and cannot altogether be overcome by providing patients with decision-aids; people's medical decisions can be affected by anecdotal information even when they are provided with the best tools we know of for supporting medical decision making. The present research highlights the need for new research to counter the effects of anecdotal information.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The difficulty in determining what's best to do is made more difficult to the average information consumer because of the systematic spread of misinformation.

We gathered three preventative women's health treatment decision-aids (HPV testing, Epidurals, and the Hormonal IUD) from The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. We provide further details about the decision aids in the materials section below.</figDesc></figure>

A subsequent exploratory analysis interacting pretest beliefs with condition suggested no improvement in model fit (see the Supplement).Altogether, these findings suggest that (negative) anecdotal information affected participants' beliefs. A single positive anecdote carried the same evidential weight as a study describing a double-blind clinical trial with 1,000 participants, though it appears that it did not affect beliefs additively-the Statistics + Positive Anecdote condition did not differ from the Positive Anecdote condition nor the Statistics condition. (We note however that even in the positive anecdote condition, we described the protagonist as having been in a clinical trial, so participants could reasonably infer her outcome was similar to other people in the trial).More worrisome was the effect of the negative anecdote on participants' reasoning about compelling statistical evidence. One negative anecdote caused people to discount strong statistical evidence, even though the anecdote implied no negative side effects and contained no additional information over and above the information carried by the statistics.Experiment 1a suggested that people's beliefs about the efficacy of B-12 injections are affected by anecdotal information. In Experiment 1b, we sought to further understand the impact of anecdotes on medical decision-making in this context. Given that a single negative anecdote can undercut otherwise strong statistical evidence, we sought to determine what would reduce the impact of this negative anecdote. Consequently, we tested whether presenting participants with both a positive and negative anecdote paired with statistical information would lead participants to primarily attend to the statistical information about the efficacy of B-12 injections in treating chronic headaches. Reading contradictory anecdotal information should indicate to participants that a different evidence source (in this case, the statistics) is needed to come to an informed belief about B-12 injections. We recruited 492 participants through Cloud Research recruitment (50% women, M age = 36 years old). Participants were paid approximately $6.00 an hour for participating in a five-minute study. After excluding participants who missed questions checking their attention, 431 participants remained in our sample. Our exclusion criteria were determined a priori and were in accordance with our study preregistration.Procedure. The procedure of Experiment 1b was similar to Experiment 1a, with the exception of the conditions participants were assigned to. Namely, we replaced the Positive Anecdote condition with a Statistics + Positive &amp; Negative Anecdotes condition to determine whether including a positive anecdote in conjunction with a negative anecdote would lead participants to focus on summary statistics.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Experiment 1b</cell></row><row><cell>Method</cell></row><row><cell>Participants.</cell></row></table><note>B-12 injections, b Effective = −1.71, 95% CI [−2.26, −1.17]; b Try = −0.70, 95% CI [−1.36, −0.05]; b Child = −0.87,</note></figure>

We predicted that when participants in the Statistics condition are explicitly presented with the rate of ineffectiveness, this would raise the salience of the inefficacy of B-12 injections. In turn, this may reduce overall endorsement of the efficacy of B-12 injections relative to the Statistics + Positive Anecdote condition. Finally, we sought to examine whether inclusion of the positive anecdote with the negative anecdote in the Statistics + Positive &amp; Negative Anecdotes condition would cause participants to primarily attend to the statistical information they received. However, we suspected that the presence of the positive anecdote would not entirely undercut the effect of the negative anecdote on participants' judgments.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">B−12 Effective</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Not effective</cell><cell>Slightly</cell><cell cols="2">Moderately</cell><cell>Very</cell><cell>Extremely</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>at all</cell><cell>effective</cell><cell cols="2">effective</cell><cell>effective</cell><cell>effective</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>0.8</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EffectivePostTest</cell><cell>0.2 0.4 0.6</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Condition Statistics Statistics Positive Anecdote Statistics Both Statistics Negative Anecdote</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>0.0</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Try B−12</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Very unlikely</cell><cell>Unlikely</cell><cell>Somewhat unlikely</cell><cell>Somewhat likely</cell><cell>Likely</cell><cell>Very likely</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>0.8</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>0.6</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>TryPostTest</cell><cell>0.4</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Condition Statistics Statistics Positive Anecdote Statistics Both Statistics Negative Anecdote</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>0.2</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>0.0</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="3">Give B−12 to child</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Very unlikely</cell><cell>Unlikely</cell><cell>Somewhat unlikely</cell><cell>Somewhat likely</cell><cell>Likely</cell><cell>Very likely</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>0.8</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>ChildPostTest</cell><cell>0.2 0.4 0.6</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Condition Statistics Statistics Positive Anecdote Statistics Both Statistics Negative Anecdote</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>0.0</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
