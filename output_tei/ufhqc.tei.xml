			<abstract>
				<p>Decision-making is driven by factors such as motivation, pleasure, and cognitive skill. The current study evaluates how these factors are related to decision-making in a community population. In recent years, work in the field of reinforcement learning has identified two main pathways that drive decision-making: model-based and model-free learning. Model-free learning updates action values retrospectively, after a reward is received. In contrast, model-based learning updates action values prospectively, by weighing contextual factors, the overall structure of the situation, and reward received. The current study utilizes a two-stage decisionmaking task to assess the relative contribution of model-free vs model-based learning in relation to measures that assess motivation, pleasure, and cognition in a community sample (n=127). General linear mixed effect models showed that individuals high in motivation and pleasure had significantly greater reliance on model-free decision making (p=0.0267). In contrast, individuals with better working memory, as measured by a running span task, had significantly greater reliance on model-based learning (p=0.0003). These findings provide evidence that individual differences in motivation and cognition are associated with reliance on particular learning pathways. It has been suggested that lower levels of motivation, pleasure, and cognition in various forms of psychopathology (e.g., depression) can impair decision-making. Our results show these relationships transcend clinical contexts. Specifically, these findings suggest that individuals who experience low motivation and pleasure may be less sensitive to immediate rewards, and that working memory capacity is highly relevant to model-based learning.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>When deciding how to maximize a reward in a particular environment, individuals can use a variety of learning strategies. Broadly, associations between actions and their outcomes are considered to be optimally learned when an individual's expectations of an action's outcome meet the actual outcome. However, action-outcome associations are not always deterministic (i.e., a given action can lead to different outcomes at different times or in different situations), so individuals often use cues and contextual information to predict which actions will result in reward most frequently. Reliance on particular learning strategies to maximize reward differs from individual to individual. Thus, optimization of the decision-making process in reinforcement learning paradigms can look different depending on individual difference factors such as trait motivation, sensitivity to pleasure, and cognitive skills (e.g., working memory ability). Clinical studies have evaluated individuals with psychopathology where reinforcement learning is known to be impaired (e.g. schizophrenia, depression). Such studies suggest that variation in symptomology (e.g., anhedonia, cognitive impairment, etc.) tied to these disorders contributes to variation in the decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barch et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Q. J. M. Huys &amp; Browning, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kangas et al., 2022)</ref>. Critically, core symptoms of mental illness, such as reductions in the experience or anticipation of pleasure (anhedonia) or reduced motivation (avolition), can appear in more attenuated forms in individuals without clinical disorders. However, studies on how variation in motivation and pleasure or cognition in non-clinical populations relate to learning strategies are much less common. Thus, in the current study we investigated how gradients of motivation, pleasure, and cognition in the general population may relate to different aspects of decision-making in the context of reinforcement learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of Learning</head><p>Work utilizing human behavioral and imaging approaches, as well as animal models have proposed two dissociable pathways of reinforcement learning that underpin behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buschman &amp; Miller, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Daw et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gläscher et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The first of these pathways is responsible for updating the salience of actions after their respective outcomes (model-free learning), while the other is responsible for more anticipatory processes and integrating known information about relationships among actions, stimuli, and outcomes with current information about the most recent outcome (model-based learning).</p><p>These pathways work in parallel and have an interactive relationship. However, individuals can show a bias towards using one pathway vs. the other. Recent studies have used Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that model the structure of these pathways to determine how they manifest across individuals with psychopathology and as a function of particular symptom profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Culbreth et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ruan et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Voon et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wyckmans et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Critically, each of these learning pathways have associated strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Model-free (MF) algorithms are mapped to a pathway that is fast, less effortful, and associated with habitual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2003)</ref>. Action-outcome contingencies in a MF approach are updated based on discrepancies between initial expectations and outcomes, thought to be driven by a reward prediction error signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Montague et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schultz et al., 1997)</ref>. Associations, when predictable, strengthen at an exponential rate after continued experience with the action-reward contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Roesch et al., 2012)</ref>. As this association solidifies, it becomes less sensitive to changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bayley et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schultz, 1986)</ref>. The tradeoff for the speed of this pathway is that it can overlook vital details that consider context and conditions. For instance, imagine you drive the same route to work every day. One day, while listening to the morning news, you hear there will be some heavy construction on the way. A MF dominant approach would encourage you to still take your same route to work despite potentially encountering traffic, and thus you will be less likely to experience satisfaction with that choice as your trip is delayed due to traffic. Therefore, it is important to consider the context of the situations to alter habitual actions and, in this case, prevent getting stuck in traffic.</p><p>The Model Based (MB) learning pathway addresses such considerations by collecting contextual information, integrating past information with current information, and altering future behavior to optimize the anticipated outcome. MB algorithms update along steps or "states'' before the reward is received in addition to after reward is received. When MB decision-making is used, individuals construct cognitive maps of a situation rather than base choices solely on the relation between action and outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Deserno et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Doody et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gläscher et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hampton et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pauli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tolman, 1948)</ref>. Thus, in this traffic example, instead of taking the same route after hearing about construction, a MB learner may invest energy into finding a new route that may spare them the traffic jam given that they are aware of how their current motivational state (i.e., being low on time) will influence decision-making (i.e., choosing an alternative route) to avoid an aversive outcome (i.e., tardiness at work ). Such information can be useful to integrate in many contexts; however, MB learning is computationally intensive in that it requires more cognitive resources than its MF counterpart. Interestingly, different people rely on one strategy more than another, raising questions about what individual difference factors might drive use of MF versus MB learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactions of individual differences and decision-making strategies</head><p>Experiential psychopathology has long used individual difference measures to investigate symptom severity in decision making within disorders where decision making appears disrupted. For instance, learning from small, immediate rewards is an imperative part of model free learning, and it is hypothesized that individuals with depression are generally less responsive to rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pizzagalli et al., 2008)</ref> and show disruption in approach related behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mukherjee et al., 2023)</ref>. Studies looking at depression have proposed that canonical symptoms of this disorder, like anhedonia or "lack of pleasure" and in more recent years "reduced anticipation and motivation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Treadway et al., 2012)</ref>, may be a significant contributor to impairment in reinforcement learning and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gradin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pizzagalli et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2020)</ref>. In support of this, anhedonia also plays a significant role in other severe psychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, and is suggested to impair RL related processes important to planning and anticipation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akouri-Shan et al., 2021)</ref>. Taken together, evidence suggests that anhedonia may disrupt reinforcement learning in the context of depression.</p><p>In the general population, many individuals experience different amounts of motivation and pleasure, including anhedonia. Research on how variation in pleasure and motivation relate to reinforcement learning in the general population is sparce yet could provide important insight into whether these symptoms impair decision-making outside of clinical contexts. The closest relevant work has looked at depression symptoms, which can include disruptions in pleasure/motivation. For example, work by Gillan and colleagues in a general population sample found that compulsive behavior and intrusive thoughts were related to MB learning, but general depression was not <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gillan et al, 2016)</ref>. Another study by Patzelt et al. (2019) in a general population sample found that depression was related to a reduction in MB learning when low and high incentives were introduced. However, none of these studies specifically exampled motivation/pleasure symptoms. Thus, the first aim of this study investigated whether individual differences in motivation and pleasure in a community sample are associated with either MB or MF learning.</p><p>Second, working memory is proposed to play a key role in the ability to integrate old information with current information to formulate appropriate responses in conjunction with these learning pathways Studies in clinical literature including individuals with more negative symptoms such as those with schizophrenia and depression, found that lower IQ or executive function indicated less model based decision making. Working memory has also been highly implicated as a mechanism that moderates integration of past information with current available information. Previous literature has demonstrated that better working memory is highly associated with the use of model based mechanisms in samples with healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Friedel et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Otto, Raio, et al., 2013)</ref>. Therefore, our second aim investigated influence of working memory in relation to MB and MF learning in our non-clinical sample. This may provide insight into the extent working memory is engaged given the use of MF versus MB learning.</p><p>Working memory, motivation, and pleasure have all proposed to play important roles in decision making across clinical contexts. They are also factors that appear on a spectrum in the general population. In order to understand their relationships in a normative sample, we used MF and MB learning models in a two-stage decision making task to explore their contribution to decision making in relationship to individual differences in motivation/pleasure and working memory. We predicted that motivation and pleasure would be highly related to MF processes given that those with increased pleasure may be learning more from reward. We also predicted MB learning would be highly related to working memory given it role in contextualizing and updating old representations with newly available information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants &amp; Procedure</head><p>Participants were (N=132) recruited from the St. Louis community. Exclusion criteria were younger than 18 and non-native English speakers. Participants were part of a larger study examining relationships between motivation and cognition in a community sample. All participants provided written informed consent to the protocol approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.</p><p>Participants completed one visit to the laboratory to complete tasks assessing learning and reward processing along with completing individual difference measures. Five participants had missing task data due to technical issues with data collection. Thus, in our final analysis, we included 127 people. Demographics are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Difference Measures</head><p>To examine motivation and pleasure, participants completed the Motivation and </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcement Learning Task</head><p>Participants completed a two-stage decision making task as described by <ref type="bibr">Culbreth and colleagues (2016)</ref> and originally developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daw et al., 2011</ref>. At the start of each trial, participants were presented with two options. Participants' choices then led, probabilistically, to one of two second stage "states" comprising two subsequent alternatives (state 1 or state 2). In this "Space Alien" version of the task, the first stage choice was between two spaceships that could take you to one of two different planets. The second stage choice was between two "aliens" on that planet that could give you space gold. Importantly, each first-stage choice led more frequently (70%) to one of two second-stage states <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref>). Choices in the second stage probabilistically resulted in visual feedback of reward or no-reward. To ensure learning throughout the task, the probability of receiving a reward for the four second-stage alternatives varied slowly according to Gaussian random walks. Altogether, participants completed 200 trials. Participants were given 3 seconds to make each choice. The interval between first and second-stage stimuli was 1 second, following choice. Feedback following the second-stage choice was presented for 1 second, followed by another 1 second before the next trial began.</p><p>Participants were informed that they would receive increased bonus money for task accuracy.</p><p>However, we paid participants a five-dollar bonus for completing the task, regardless of performance.</p><p>In this task, MF learning encourages decision makers to stick with choices that were previously rewarded. Thus, an MF learner should choose the same spaceship selected on the previous trial if it led to an alien that gave them reward, regardless of whether it took them to the "common" planet or the "rare" planet. In contrast, MB learning involves considering contextual factors such as whether the rewarding outcome occurred following a spaceship choice that led to the common or rare planet. If the previous spaceship choice had led to the rare planet, an MB learner should be less likely to make the same spaceship choice on the next trial. This is because an MB learner would understand that given the structure of the task, they are less likely to return to the "rare" planet with the generous space alien. Thus, MF learning should be indexed by a high likelihood of repeating first-stage choices when the previous trial was rewarded, regardless of the rarity of the transition to the planet. In contrast, MB learning should be indexed by an interaction between reward and transition rarity, such that repetition of a previously rewarded first-stage choice should be less common when the prior transition has been a rare versus a common one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Working Memory Task</head><p>Participants completed a Running Span task to assess working memory. Specifically, a series of letters were presented on a computer screen one at a time, spaced two seconds apart.</p><p>During a trial, the length of the series of letters was unpredictable. Participants were asked to remember the last x number of letters from the series. The first block of the task began with participants recalling the last letter presented. In subsequent blocks the number of letters required to be retained increased by one letter. In the final block, the participant was asked to recall the last five letters. Participants had to complete two out of four trials correctly to move on to the next block. The outcome measure was the total number of correct letters recalled across all trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Analysis approach followed the approach used in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Culbreth et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daw et al., 2011)</ref>. Trial by trial learning was analyzed for evidence of MB vs. MF using a hierarchical logistic regression model (HLM) examining selection of the same or a different first stage option based on the previous trial's reward and transition type. Analyses were performed using the lme4 linear mixed-effects package in R <ref type="bibr">(Bates &amp; Sarkar, 2007)</ref>. The dependent variable was the first-stage choice (coded: stay or shift). Predictors included dummy variables indicating whether the previous trial was rewarded or not (1 and -1, respectively), whether the previous trial's transition was rare or common (-1 and 1, respectively), and their interaction. All coefficients were taken as random effects across participants, and estimates are reported across participants. Working memory as measured by the Running Span task, motivation and pleasure from the MAP-SR, depression from the CES-D were group-centered and interacted as factors with task effects (i.e., reward, rarity, and the reward x rarity interaction) to determine individual difference relationships across participants. To visualize results, we extracted beta values from the rarity interaction (MB learning) and the reward interaction (MF learning). Higher values indicate large reliance on either MB or MF learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Free Versus Model Based Learning</head><p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. in the first model predicting the probability of first-stage choice with no covariates, we found a significant main effect of reward and an interaction between reward and transition type. Similar to previous work, participants were more likely to choose the same first stage choice as the previous trial on the current trial when they received a reward on the previous trial. However, this tendency was stronger when the previous first stage choice was followed by the common versus the rare transition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivation and pleasure predicted model-free learning</head><p>We then examined a model that included MAP-SR, our individual difference measure for motivation and pleasure. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we found a reward x MAP-SR interaction such that higher motivation and pleasure were related to an increased tendency to stay with the first-stage choice following a reward, irrespective of transition type (MF decision-making <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure   1</ref>). We did not see a significant further interaction between reward x rarity x MAP-SR, suggesting that motivation and pleasure did not interact significantly with model-based learning.</p><p>In addition, when running models with MAP-P and MAP-M separately, we found pleasure significantly interacted with reward (β=0.111, z=2.61, p&lt; 0.01) but not with reward x rarity x MAP-P interaction (β= 0.014, z= 0.316, p = 0.752). When looking at MAP-M, we found a trend with reward (β= 0.076, z= 1.719, p= 0.085) but again was no significant interaction with rarity (β= -0.015, z= -0.327, p= 0.744). Thus, pleasure was related to MF learning and neither pleasure nor motivation were related to MB learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depression scores did not predict either model-free or model-based learning</head><p>In the next model examining relationships with depression symptoms, we did not see a significant relationship between depression symptoms and MF or MB behavior (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, C and D).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Running span related to both model-based and model-free strategies</head><p>In our final model as seen in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we saw a significant and robust interaction between reward x rarity x running span. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> E, as running span scores increased, the probability of staying with the same first-stage choice as the previous trial increased. However, running-span scores were even more strongly associated with the interaction with the second-stage transition, such that as running span scores increased, this tendency to repeat the first stage choice was particularly strong if the previous transition was the common one (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2 F)</ref>. This result suggests that better working memory was particularly associated with MB decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The goal of this study was to understand the relationship between MF or MB learning pathways, and measures of motivation, pleasure, and cognition in the general population. We used a two-stage probabilistic learning task to examine relationships between MF and MB learning and individual difference measures. Our findings suggest that motivation and pleasure were positively associated with MF learning but not MB learning. Further, working memory had a positive relationship with both MF and MB learning, though it was most strongly related to MB learning. We discuss these findings below.</p><p>The first aim of this study was to better understand the relationship of motivation and pleasure to the relative reliance on MF or MB pathways of learning. We found a significant interaction between our individual difference measures for motivation and pleasure <ref type="bibr">(MAP-SR)</ref> and probability of sticking with the same first-stage choice for the next trial, given that the same choice was rewarded in the previous trial. When separating MAP-SR items between motivation and pleasure, pleasure continued to be related to MF learning while motivation was related at a trend level to MF learning, and not related to MB decision-making. This finding indicates that those reporting more motivation and pleasure, particularly pleasure over the past week, tended to stick with choices that were previously rewarded regardless of whether the previous transition was common or rare one.</p><p>Prior work looking at negative symptoms (lack of motivation and pleasure) within clinical contexts has shown that motivation and pleasure negative symptoms are associated with less reliance on MF learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brandl et al., 2023)</ref>. Our findings are consistent with these results in a clinical sample. Our findings also align with another study that examined the role of anhedonia in healthy controls and found a negative association between lack of pleasure and decreased activity in brain regions that mediate response to reward feedback, an MF relevant process given MF learning dominantly learns from reward when associations are variable and novel <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wacker et al., 2009)</ref>. Importantly, we extend previous findings and show this association can also be seen outside of clinical contexts in the general community. Our results, however, challenge some previous findings. A study conducted by Heller et al. used the same two stage decision task and evaluated MF and MB learning and its interaction with Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), a commonly used questionnaire to examine hedonic capacity. They found no interaction between transitions (Rare vs Common) and SHAPS in their sample of undergraduates <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Heller et al., 2018)</ref>. This could be due to the type of questions asked in each questionnaire. While MAP-SR asks individuals to retroactively recall past instances of pleasure and near future anticipation of pleasure, the SHAPS scale uses a more hypothetical approach by asking subjects how they "would" feel. Therefore, our results may capture a dimension of motivation and pleasure that is based on recall of real events rather than thinking about pleasure in a hypothetical manner. With this in consideration combined with work from clinical and animal models, our results indicate that experiences of motivation and pleasure, particularly pleasure, may modulate reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bayley et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">Hitchcott et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">O'Doherty et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Pizzagalli et al., 2008</ref> and influence the likelihood of using MF learning strategies that are dependent on reward responsivity.</p><p>Previous work has found that MDD is associated with a reduced sensitivity to reward (Q. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Huys et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pizzagalli et al., 2008)</ref>. Further, evidence from these studies have also shown that increased anhedonia among individuals with depression was negatively related to parameters that measure sensitivity to rewards, indicating anhedonia plays a significant role in sensitivity to pleasure independent of depression general symptoms. We did not find that overall depression symptoms related to the use of either MF or MB learning strategies in our more normative sample. This finding, coupled with our finding of MAP-SR and more specifically pleasure, suggests that disruptions in RL learning, may be linked primarily to the symptom of anhedonia rather than more depression general symptoms among a normative population.</p><p>However, further work is needed to determine whether other aspects of depression beyond anhedonia contribute to decision-making or reinforcement learning impairments in clinical depression.</p><p>Another aim was to determine if working memory was related to either MB or MF learning. Running span is widely used to test working memory, an important cognitive domain that is strongly associated with integration of current information and past information to advise future decisions <ref type="bibr">(Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001</ref>). Literature has investigated this relationship within clinical populations in which mechanisms that integrate information are impaired such as valuation or executive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Culbreth et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gold et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lee &amp; Park, 2005)</ref>, illustrating that working memory has a strong relationship with MB learning. Our results, consistent with previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Otto, Gershman, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schad et al., 2014)</ref>, show a significant relationship between reliance on both MF and MB learning and working memory capacity, though, this relationship was stronger for MB than MF learning. These results support working memory as an integrative mechanism that influences decision making that can also be seen outside of clinical contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Culbreth et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heerey et al., 2008)</ref>. Working memory capacity may be relevant because MB learning requires creating a cognitive map of the environment and its relationships. These representations are flexibly altered by referencing old representations of a situation and updating those representations with newly available information. This in turn can modulate future behavior to ensure probable acquisition of future reward. This flexibility and integration could be supported by working memory capacity.</p><p>There are several important limitations to consider in the evaluation of the results of this study. First, while looking at symptomology on a spectrum allows for us to investigate how motivation and pleasure may relate to decision-making not in the context of pathology, we did not conduct diagnostic interviews on our participants. Thus, our sample may have included a range of experiences that could have met criteria for a clinical disorder. We also looked at individual differences in relation to performance aggregated across trials rather than dynamic fluctuations over the course of learning. Thus, we cannot determine if an individual consistently uses either MF or MB or a combination throughout the task or if pathway reliance shifts throughout the task. For example, information about how the MF pathway interacts with motivation and pleasure over the course of a complex decision-making task can provide insight as to whether there is there is a general propensity to use MF pathways in people who experience more pleasure/motivation or if early learning starts with little bias for either pathway and gradually engages reliance on a particular pathway over time. Therefore, future work on this matter could investigate the relationship of MF pathways and motivation and pleasure over the course of learning.</p><p>This study allowed us to examine motivation and pleasure and working memory in relation to MF and MB learning outside of the context of clinical populations. By doing so, we were able to examine how variation in these individual differences relates to behavior outside the context of a clinical diagnosis, allowing us to gain insight into their associations across the non-clinical to clinical symptom spectrum. Our findings indicate that gradients in the experiences of motivation and pleasure, particularly pleasure, and working memory capacity relate to the use of MF and MB pathways in the general population, suggesting a continuity of these relations across the clinical to non-clinical divide. then make a choice from one of the Aliens within the given state. To increase task engagement, whether the choice was rewarded was based on random walks. B: The rarity interaction predicts the probability of staying with the previous trial's first stage choice given that it led to a rare transition and its outcome output reward. Looking at this interaction can help expose what learning pathways decision makers use. Since model free learners update action outcomes after the reward is received, we would expect MF learners to stay with the previous trial's first stage choice in the next trial since it predicted reward in the previous trial. However, a MB learner, who updates after each stage and corresponding state, may be more likely to shift their first stage choice with deeper regard the general structure of the task. These interactions can then be interacted with individual difference measures in a general linear mixed effects model.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Pleasure Scale(MAP-SR; Llerena et al., 2013). Higher total scores on this measure reflect greater motivation and pleasure across the past week. While the primary analysis focused on the total MAP-SR score, we conducted follow-up exploratory analyses examining motivation and pleasure independently. Towards this goal we created a MAP-pleasure (MAP-P) which combined items 1-6 of the MAP-SR. Items in the MAP-P factor asked questions such as "In the past week, what is the most pleasure you experience from being with other people?"Motivational questions that made up MAP-motivation (MAP-M) factor (questions 10-15) included items such as "In the past week how motivated have you been to be around other people and do things with them." To examine whether motivation and pleasure had a unique relationship to learning strategies, beyond depression symptoms, we assessed depression symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale(CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Higher scores on the CES-D reflect more symptoms over the prior week.</figDesc></figure>
