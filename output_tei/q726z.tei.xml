			<abstract>
				<p>The purpose of this study is to examine whether girls and boys exhibit different risk and time preferences and how this difference evolves during the critical phase of adolescence. To achieve this, we use a large and powered sample of 4830 non-self-selected teenagers from 207 classes across 22 Spanish schools with very different socioeconomic backgrounds. Alongside time and risk preferences, we also collected additional information about class attributes, social network measures, students&apos; characteristics, and the average level of economic preferences of friends. These measures enable us to account for potentially omitted variables that were not considered in previous studies. The results indicate that there are no significant gender differences in time and risk preferences, but older subjects exhibit more sophisticated time preferences and higher risk aversion. We also perform an exploratory heterogeneity analysis, which unveils two important results: first, cognitive abilities play a critical role in the development of time and risk preferences; second, interaction within the class social network does matter.</p>

This research has led the scientific community to wonder how these preferences are formed and, particularly, to ask how they are shaped throughout the life cycle. In this line, the literature has identified different heterogeneity sources: genetic variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cesarini et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zyphur et al., 2009)</ref>, cultural transmission from parents to children <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bisin &amp; Verdier, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Brañas-Garza et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Samek et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Stoklosa et al., 2018)</ref> and maturation of children and adolescents during the years of schooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Booth &amp; Nolen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Brocas &amp; Carrillo, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sutter et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, studies based on different types of intervention have provided crucial insights into how malleable are these economic preferences during school age. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Bruhn et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lührmann et al. (2018)</ref> found that financial education increases savings, and time consistency in teenagers. In line with these results, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sutter et al. (2023)</ref> find that increasing financial literacy of 16-year-old high-school students makes them behave more patiently, more time-consistent, and more risk averse, and these results are stable after five years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alan and Ertac (2018)</ref> found that an intervention aimed to improve the ability to act in a forward-looking manner and to exercise self-control in inter-temporal decision contexts increased the patience of children, with this result maintained three years later.</p><p>This study focuses on examining whether girls and boys exhibit different risk and time preferences and if so, how this difference evolves during the critical phase of adolescence. Although the literature in this domain is recent, this paper is closely related to several studies that have examined adolescent preferences. Some of them analyzed whether time preferences develop with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Angerer et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bettinger &amp; Slonim, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sutter et al., 2015)</ref> or whether males are more or less patient than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bettinger &amp; Slonim, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Castillo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Deckers et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Golsteyn et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Horn et al., 2022)</ref>. Similarly, some other papers study if risk preferences change with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Eckel et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Harbaugh et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Munro, Tanaka, et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Piovesan &amp; Willadsen, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sutter et al., 2013)</ref> and if there are differences between genders <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andreoni et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Booth &amp; Nolen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Borghans et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Eckel et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Khachatryan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Piovesan &amp; Willadsen, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sutter et al., 2013)</ref> or even between countries and cultures like <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cárdenas et al. (2012)</ref>. Some of the most important findings of these papers are that patience increases with age and that older children become less risk lovers, but these relations are not significant during adolescence 1 . Regarding gender differences, evidence finds that girls are more risk averse than boys but the findings are inconclusive for time preferences: some studies indicate that boys display less patience than girls <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bettinger &amp; Slonim, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Castillo et al., 2011)</ref>, while others report the opposite pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Deckers et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Golsteyn et al., 2014)</ref>, and still others find no statistically significant differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Horn et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sutter et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sutter et al., , 2015</ref> 2 .</p><p>To revise the development of preferences during adolescence (and gender differences), we conducted a lab-in-the-field experiment in 22 Spanish schools. We gathered data from 4,830 adolescents from 12 to 17 years old distributed in 207 different classrooms, of whom 49% were female. Two additional elements make our study unique. First, we collected data on the class enmity and friendship network, which allows for the assessment of social isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ruiz-García et al., 2023)</ref>. Second, we are able to compute the mean value of time and risk preferences for each subject's friends inside a classroom. It is also important to emphasize that the tasks to elicit time and risk preferences were designed specifically for adolescents. The time preference task constitutes a simplified and visual version with six decisions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Coller and Williams (1999)</ref> (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alfonso et al. (2023)</ref> for details). Similarly, the risk preferences task is a simplified version with six decisions adapted from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Holt and Laury (2002)</ref> lottery task (for details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vasco and Vazquez (2023)</ref>). In both tasks, we used hypothetical payments since using economic incentives with children and adolescents requires a signed consent of parents. In a recent paper, we validated the use of hypothetical incentives as a reliable alternative to real incentives for similar tasks to measure risk and time preferences in adolescents (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alfonso et al. (2023)</ref> for details).</p><p>This paper complements previous research on gender differences in economic preferences in three ways. First, we are able to detect a minimum gender difference of 0.12 SD, while in previous studies the minimum detectable gender difference ranges from 0.33 SD to 0.97 SD. Typically, those papers involve experiments conducted in a limited number of educational institutions, usually ranging from one to six 3 and smaller sample sizes across ages (which range from 16 to 305 for time preferences and 12 to 293 for risk preferences) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . This means that, even if they consider the measurement of cognitive abilities (such as GPA and Raven's Progressive Matrices) and socioeconomic factors as controls, those studies can only find medium to large gender differences, while our dataset allows us to find statistically significant smaller differences.</p><p>Second, given our rich and wide dataset, we measure and explore the role of different external factors that could affect gender differences and economic preferences and, consequently, bias the estimations. Social interactions at the school do not necessarily involve all classmates but may be limited to a subset of them -the friends that the teenager voluntarily chooses, forming his or her social network. In other words, not only does the classroom environment where the individual spends at least thirty-five hours a week play a role, but also the network of friends could also influence the formation of economic preferences since there is evidence that risk and time preferences are shaped by environmental factors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alem et al. (2023)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Booth and Nolen (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lucks et al. (2020)</ref>, and Zárate (2023)). Hence, not including them in the regression models could lead to omitted variables problems. To solve this problem, this dataset allows us to control not only for schools' fixed characteristics but also for classroom specific factors (such as size, number of repeaters, cohesion, among others). Additionally, we consider the student's social position within the class network, including measures of popularity and centrality in the network, and the average level of patience or risk of each subject's friends, which indicates whether preferences are aligned with the average level of preferences of friends 5 . Students' cognitive abilities are also assessed, including Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) scores, the number of A grades in the last academic year, and proficiency in probabilities understanding.</p><p>Third, the existing literature studying gender differences has not usually delved into individuals' cognitive abilities and friendship formation in explaining gender differences in economic preferences. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Dasgupta et al. (2019)</ref>, regression analyses commonly employ the binary gender variable to measure the variation in economic preferences between males and females after accounting for other factors. However, these regressions assume that the impact of these characteristics on economic preferences is the same for both genders, which is often not the case. So, we explore various sources of heterogeneity in time and risk preferences using the most important determinants of these economic preferences. Specifically, we investigate the interaction between the gender dummy variable and various measures of subjects' cognitive abilities, as well as the average level of risk and time preferences among friends. Our findings strongly support the significance of these variables in explaining gender and age differences.</p><p>The results of this research can be summarized as follows. After controlling for class and individual's and network measures, we find that girls and boys do not differ in patience at younger ages. We also find that older teens become less present-oriented and more sophisticated in their time preferences, and that the latter effect is higher for girls. Regarding risk preferences, we do not find gender differences in the number of risky options at lower grades, but we find that older teens choose fewer risky choices on average. However, in upper grades, we find some gender differences in the different risk types: girls become less risk averse and more risk neutral than boys.</p><p>In addition, the heterogeneity analysis unveils two new results to the existing literature concerning cognitive abilities and interaction with the social network. First, cognitive abilities play a critical role in the development of time and risk preferences. We find that cognitive abilities are positively correlated with patience but this relation varies according to age and gender: in lower grades, boys with higher cognitive abilities become less present-oriented than girls, but in upper grades, girls with higher cognitive abilities become less present-oriented and more sophisticated than boys. Regarding risk preferences, cognitive abilities also explain age and gender differences. We find that higher levels of cognitive abilities make boys less willing to take risks at lower grades, while girls with higher cognitive abilities become less risky at upper grades.</p><p>Second, interaction within the social network of the class also matters. We find that the average level of patience (risk) of friends is also correlated with adolescents' preferences. Interestingly, we observe that the higher the average level of patience (risk) of friends, the smaller the probability of becoming present-oriented (risk averse), and the higher the probability of choosing all future options (all risky options). However, none of these interactions with gender or age (grade) are significant, which means that all these effects are the same across genders and ages.</p><p>The structure of this paper is as follows: section 2 presents the experimental protocol and dataset; section 3 presents the econometric approach used in the paper; section 4.1 presents the main results of the research; section 4.2 explores different mechanisms behind the results; and section 6 concludes.</p><p>friends are more patient, or that friends are more patient because an adolescent is more patient 2 Dataset</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Protocol</head><p>We collected data from 22 Spanish secondary schools by contacting the principals. The purpose was to include the experiment as part of the regular class activities. Participants could opt-out, as required by our institutional review board (IRB), but none of them exerted this option, eliminating any selection effect. Only children absent on the day of the experiment did not participate, leading to an overall participation rate of 83% 6 and a final sample of 4,830 subjects. The data for replication is available at https://github.com/teenslab/datateenslab 7 . The experiment was conducted as a regular class activity using a self-administered questionnaire programmed in a tailored online platform named SAND. Subjects answered it on computers, tablets, or mobile phones with guaranteed anonymity. The Ethical Committee of Universidad Loyola Andalucía approved the study and the experiment was pre-registered in AsPredicted 8 . Our sample consists of schools from very different backgrounds, although most of them were located in intensely deprived areas of Andalusia. These socio-demographic differences are reflected in our dataset, with students' expectations of achieving a university degree varying enormously across the sample: only 5% students of the bottom 10% schools thought they would achieve it, while this number increased to 50% in a school of the first quartile, 75% in the median school, 95% in a school of the third quartile and almost 100% in schools of the top 10%. We also observed differences in the average number of repeaters across schools varying from 0% to 33.6% with an average value of 12.8%, and the average number of A grades 9 varying from 0.53 to 1.21 with an average value of 1.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The truck and the gumball tasks</head><p>This study employs tailored tasks explicitly designed for non-adult population. The truck task is a visual version of the Multiple Price List task of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Coller and Williams (1999)</ref> used to elicit time preferences as developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alfonso et al. (2023)</ref>. The gumball machine is a graphical version of the risk preferences task of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Holt and Laury (2002)</ref>, introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vasco and Vazquez (2023)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> provides a view of the second decision screens for participants in the truck task (top) and the gumball task (bottom). In both tasks, subjects must take six consecutive decisions. In the truck task, they must choose in each decision between 10€ tomorrow or 10+x€ one week later, with x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. In the gumball task, subjects must choose between two paired lotteries (A and B), each of them with varying high and low payoffs. Lottery A is initially better than Lottery B, until p high becomes sufficiently large to make Lottery B more rewarding. Appendix A provides detailed explanations about both tasks. Under consistency 10 , the truck task allows us to compute several measures of time preferences. These include the number of future (#F uture) allocations ranging from 0 to 6 choices 11 . Additionally, we created three dummy variables: subjects who always choose the early period, indicating present-oriented preferences (AllP resent, 22.6% of participants); subjects who always choose the later period, indicating future-oriented preferences (AllF uture, 11.7% of participants); and subjects who choose both the early and the later periods, indicating interior preferences (Interior, 65.7% of participants). We used this nomenclature in reference to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Andreoni et al. (2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: The truck and gumball tasks</head><p>Similarly, the gumball task allows us to compute several measures of risk preferences under subject consistency. 12 . The number of risky choices (#Risky) represents the count of instances when subjects choose lottery B (the risky lottery) over lottery A between 0 and 6 times. The dummy Averse takes value 1 if the subject indicates risk-aversion by choosing lottery A at least in the first three decisions and 0 otherwise (44.6% of participants), the dummy N eutral takes value 1 if the subject indicates risk-neutrality by choosing Lottery A two times (45.4% of the sample) and the dummy Lover takes value 1 if the subject indicates risk-love by choosing Lottery A once (10.0% of participants).</p><p>It is important to note that for the first 11 schools, the tasks were presented in a fixed order, with subjects answering the time elicitation task before the risk elicitation task. Subsequently, we randomized the order of the tasks across schools. Five schools continued with the original order (truck → gumball), while the remaining six schools followed the reversed order (gumball → truck). This randomization resulted in 23.88% of participants answering the risk elicitation task before the time elicitation task. The order of tasks may have an impact on how teenagers make decisions, particularly concerning consistency. However, it is important to note that since the order was assigned to the entire school, it becomes a part of the school's fixed effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sources of heterogeneity</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Class heterogeneity</head><p>Our experiment was conducted in 207 classes. In addition to our primary variables of interest (gender and grade), our dataset includes several class characteristics, such as size 13 , the number of repeaters within the class, the number of students who did not complete the experiment (hereafter slackers), the number of migrants within the class, and the level of cohesion within the class (hereafter cohesivity). The last variable is defined as the difference between the density of friends and enemies at the class level (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ruiz-García et al. (2023)</ref>). Each density is defined as the number of connections a participant has divided by the total possible connections a participant could have 14 . Additionally, the variable grade can take values 7, 8, 9, and 10. 15 For simplicity, we will decompose them into two categories: lower when grade =7 or 8 and upper when grade =9 or 10. To avoid perfect collinearity, we only incorporate in our analysis the dummy variable upper (with value 1 when grade = 9 or 10, and 0 otherwise). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> displays the correlations between our variables of interest. More detailed information is available in the Appendix in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table B</ref>.1.1. The diagonal in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the distribution of the respective variable. All the variables were standardized using the max-min method <ref type="bibr">16</ref> . The first notable feature of our dataset is the great diversity in class characteristics, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table B</ref>.1.1. We have classes of varying sizes, ranging from 17 to 34 students, and varying percentages of repeaters (0% to 67%), slackers (0% to 76%), and migrants (0% to 60%). These classes also exhibit diverse social network structures, with cohesivity levels ranging from -0.01 to 0.75 and popularity.f and popularity.e (popularity in the network of friends and enemies is the number of classmates that name subject i as a friend or enemy) varying from 0 to 22. We observe interesting correlations for time and risk preferences of subjects. First, we find positive correlations between the #F uture allocations and f emale (p &lt; 0.05), class size (p &lt; 0.01) and class cohesivity (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, we observe that #Risky choices are negatively correlated with being in an upper grade (p &lt; 0.05). Focusing on class characteristics, we also obtain interesting correlations. We observe that upper classes are smaller in size (p &lt; 0.01) and cohesivity (p &lt; 0.01). They also have a higher number of repeaters (p &lt; 0.01), and a smaller number of migrants (p &lt; 0.01) and slackers (p &lt; 0.05). Classes with more repeaters tend to have fewer f emale (p &lt; 0.05) 17 , lower cohesivity (p &lt; 0.01) and a higher number of migrants (p &lt; 0.01). Finally, we also observe that classes with a higher number of migrants have a smaller number of slackers (p &lt; 0.01), and that cohesivity is negatively linked with the number of slackers (p &lt; 0.01) and migrants (p &lt; 0.01). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Network heterogeneity</head><p>We employ network analysis for two distinct purposes: i) to assess the integration of students within the classroom, measuring factors such as popularity and centrality in the network, to which we propose a metric based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gower and Legendre, 1986</ref>; and ii) to examine student relationships, probing potential peer effects on time and risk preferences stemming from direct friends. As mentioned above, we measure popularity in the network of friends and enemies (hereafter popularity.f and popularity.e) as the number of classmates that name subject i as a friend or enemy, respectively 18 . In addition, using the friendship networks, we computed the betweenness centrality measure for each subject. This variable measures how central to the network each subject is by counting the number of shortest paths connecting any pair of nodes in the network that pass through that particular subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Branas-Garza et al., 2010)</ref>. To calculate this index, we need to examine the entire network architecture rather than just considering the local properties of a specific node. Finally, we also computed the average level of patience and risk preferences of each subject's friends (hereafter f riendsAP and f riendsAR) 19 . Table B.1.1 provides some summary statistics for these variables. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows the distribution (and correlations) of each relevant variable and the social network measures. There are some interesting results. First, we observe that popularity.f (in friends) is positively correlated with the #F uture allocations (p &lt; 0.05) and centrality in the class network (p &lt; 0.01), but it is negatively correlated with f emale (p &lt; 0.01), being in an upper grade (p &lt; 0.01), popularity.e (p &lt; 0.01) and f riendsAR (p &lt; 0.05). It means that having more risk-loving friends makes you less popular. Regarding popularity in enemy networks, we also observe that it is negatively correlated with being in an upper grade (p &lt; 0.01), centrality in the class network (p &lt; 0.01), and f riendsAP (p &lt; 0.01). This means that more popular subjects in enemy networks have more impatient friends.</p><p>It is worth noting that risk preferences do not correlate with the network position of a subject (i.e. centrality in friends' and enemies' networks). We also see that popularity (both positive and negative) is negatively correlated with upper grade, meaning that teenagers become less popular when they grow up (p &lt; 0.01 for both variables). Additionally, we find that girls exhibit less centrality in the class network (p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>Finally, we observe that the #F uture allocations are highly and positively correlated with f riendsAP (p &lt; 0.01). And we can see the same phenomenon between #Risky choices and f riendsAR (p &lt; 0.01). These results indicate that patient individuals have patient friends and risk-loving subjects have risk-loving friends. In the end, individuals have friends with whom they share similar economic preferences. We also remark that the variable #F uture allocations is negatively correlated with f riendsAR (p &lt; 0.05) and that #Risky choices is negatively correlated with f riendsAP (p &lt; 0.01). It might suggest that having risk-loving friends makes the subject more present-oriented and having impatient friends makes the subject more risk-loving. Finally, we remark that f emale and f riendsAP are positively correlated (p &lt; 0.05), which suggests that females have more patient friends. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Individual heterogeneity</head><p>For each student, we have a set of variables related to academic performance and cognitive abilities. There is evidence that time and risk preferences are correlated with academic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Castillo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Oreopoulos &amp; Salvanes, 2011)</ref> and with cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benjamin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Burks et al., 2009)</ref>. This suggests a non-trivial interaction between schooling and unobserved abilities. First, we administered the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT ) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Frederick (2005)</ref>, with a version adapted for teenagers. Second, we included six questions to assess subjects' accuracy in probability understanding, as outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Delavande and Kohler (2009)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">20</ref> . We also have a dummy variable to identify repeaters and the expectations of subjects to achieve a university degree (expect). It is important to note that, due to Spanish regulations, we lack certain crucial variables such as the academic background of the student and their family income (SES). To fill the gap, we asked the students to report whether they obtained an A grade in the subjects of Spanish, Mathematics and English 21 during the last academic year. We obtained three dummy variables with value 1 if the individual answered "Yes", and 0 otherwise. We then captured academic performance by summing these three variables in the number of A grades (#As). We also asked subjects to indicate the position of their family in the 1 to10 income stair to have a proxy of the family SES. However, several schools did not approve this question. Therefore, 18.07% of the sample did not provide this information and consequently, we decided to not use this variable in out analysis. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the distribution and the correlations between these variables and Appendix B.2 provides some summary statistics. First, concerning economic preferences, we observe that more #F uture choices are associated with higher cognitive abilities in terms of CRT score, #As grades, and accuracy in probability understanding (p &lt; 0.01 in all cases). We also see that more #F uture allocations are correlated with a lower likelihood of being repeaters (p &lt; 0.01) and with higher expectations of going to the university (p &lt; 0.01). Regarding risk preferences, we observe that more #Risky choices are negatively correlated with CRT score (p &lt; 0.01) and accuracy in probability understanding (p &lt; 0.05). Second, if we look at gender differences, we observe that f emale obtain higher #As grades, are less likely to be repeaters and have higher expectations of going to the university (p &lt; 0.01 in all cases). However, they have a lower CRT score (p &lt; 0.01). Third, we focus on age differences. We see that subjects in upper grades have higher CRT scores and accuracy in the probabilities test. They are also more likely to be repeaters and less likely to have #As grades or to hold expectations of attending university (p &lt; 0.01 in all cases). It suggests that despite being endowed with larger cognitive abilities, older subjects are worse in academic performance. Finally, we observe interesting correlations that validate our measures: CRT score and accuracy in probabilities are highly and positively correlated with the #As grades and expectations to go to the university, but negatively correlated with being repeaters (p &lt; 0.01 inall cases) 22 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important remarks</head><p>Before presenting the econometric approach, we would like to mention some final and important remarks about the dataset.</p><p>For more details on the CRT and the probability understanding task, see sections 3 and 4 of Appendix A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4: Individual characteristics: Correlations (ρ)</head><p>Power : our sample consists of a large number of adolescents in grades 7 to 10: we account for 2,751 students (56.96%) in grades 7-8 (49.4% females), and 2,079 students (43.04%) in grades 9-10 (48.6% females). With an effect size of 0.12 standard deviations, our study achieves a statistical power of 0.88 for the first sample and 0.78 for the second sample. This means that our research can detect significantly smaller differences compared to previous studies (for more details, see Tables OA.1.1a and OA.1.2a of the Appendix).</p><p>Non-self-selected subjects: data were obtained in schools that participated in the project. Students were not invited to participate in an experiment but were asked by their teachers to complete a survey as an in-class regular activity. Only 0.39% (19 out of 4,830) of subjects refused to participate in the experiment. These students did not sign the consent form and were automatically expelled from the platform. Additionally, 5.57% (269 out of 4,830) of students did not fill the last task of the experiment (a creativity task), but the fraction varies across schools. This non-completion rate varied across schools, ranging from 0% to 16.58%. Only one school had an exceptionally high non-completion rate of 68.89%.</p><p>Hypothetical incentives: the entire project was conducted without monetary incentives to make it easier to obtain the IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval and to involve a larger number of schools. In the previous phase of the project, we employed both monetary and hypothetical incentives to test the impact of incentives on eliciting time and risk preferences. We found a null result, as detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alfonso et al. (2023)</ref>. Similarly, recent papers with adults have shown that hypothetical payments yield similar results to real payments for time (see Brañas-Garza et al. <ref type="formula">2023</ref>) and risk preferences (see Brañas-Garza et al. <ref type="formula">2021</ref>).</p><p>These features make our dataset different from: i) other experimental studies with teenagers, since we did not use monetary incentives; therefore, our dataset is considerably larger and the schools are more diverse in background; ii) other experimental studies, which involve standard subjects, usually university students, since our participants were not not self-selectes and a significant portion of them may not pursue a higher education degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Econometric approach</head><p>To study if females behave differently than males and whether their preferences develop differently across adolescence, we employed the following regression model 23 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y j i = β0 + β1 × f emalei + β2 × upperi + β3 × f emalei × upperi + ϵi (1)</formula><p>The term y j i refers to one variable from our set of outcome variables j={#F uture, AllP resent, Interior, AllF uture, #Risky, Averse, N eutral, Lover}. We are interested in the dummy variables f emalei and upperi (used as a proxy for age), as well as the interaction term f emalei × upperi. Since we use the binary variable upper, this discretization may have unintended consequences and we will need to check the results with the original variable. The error term is denoted by ϵi.</p><p>First, we analyze the outcome variables of time and risk preferences. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> displays the distributions of these variables for subjects that are consistent in the respective task. Histograms A and B display the outcome variables related to time preferences. It is important to remark that our analysis is focused on subjects that exhibit consistency in the task, reducing our sample from 4,736 to 3,923 (82.8%) observations. Panel A of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> displays the distribution of the #F uture allocations (standardized) for consistent subjects, while the inset graph includes all subjects (consistent and inconsistent). Both graphs have a similar distribution. Panel B shows the distribution of the different dummies: 22.7% of the consistent subjects allocate all to the present (AllP resent), 65.6% use interior allocations (Interior), which we name sophisticated individuals, and 11.7% allocate all to the future (AllF uture) <ref type="bibr">24</ref> . Similarly, Panels C and D of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> display the various outcome variables related to risk preferences. As for time preferences, we limited the analysis to consistent subjects, reducing the sample from 4,685 to 3,727 observations (79.6% of the original sample). Panel C displays the distribution of the #Risky choices (standardized) for consistent subjects, with the inset graph showing the distribution for all subjects. Again, both distributions are quite similar. Additionally, Panel D shows that 44.6% of subjects are risk-averse, 45.4% are risk-neutral, and 10.0% are risk-lovers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5: Distribution of time and risk preferences</head><p>We estimate equation 1 for each outcome variable using OLS. We use four different specifications to analyze the robustness of the estimations. First, we estimate equation 1 with school fixed effects (S) to account for unobserved heterogeneity across schools (such as socioeconomic status, teachers quality, etc.). We will use this model as a reference. In our second specification (SC), we add class controls such as class size, number of repeaters, number of slackers, number of migrants, and class cohesivity, to take into consideration class heterogeneity (such as selection of students into different classes, differences in effort doing the experiment, and class environment). Third, we add social networks measures (SCN) such as popularity in friends (popularity.f ) and enemies (popularity.e) networks, centrality, and the average level of time and risk preference of subject's friends (f riendsAP and f riendsAR) to control for social hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alem et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Branas-Garza et al., 2010)</ref> and peers effect that might be correlated with the economic preferences of subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lucks et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Zárate, 2023)</ref>. Finally, we add individual controls (SCNI) related to cognitive abilities such as #As grades, CRT score, accuracy in probabilities, expectations to go to the university, and whether the subject is a repeater. It is worth noting that we estimate the different specifications using the same sample; that is, we restricted the sample to those subjects with all the information for all the control variables. In doing so, we lost 186 (4,74%) and 137 (3.68%) observations in the time and risk outcome variables regressions, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Economic preferences</head><p>4.1.1 Time preferences <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> displays the estimated coefficients of the variables of interest (in columns), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals, for each outcome variable related to time preferences (in rows). It shows that the variable f emale is not significant for all specifications under scrutiny (p &gt; 0.20), which means that girls are not more and not less patient than boys at lower grades. The use of school fixed effects (S), class controls (SC), social network controls (SCN), and individual controls (SCNI) does not change this result on the #F uture allocations. We find identical results for the type of allocations used by younger males and females (p &gt; 0.60). Therefore, it suggests that there are no gender differences in time preferences at younger ages.</p><p>On the other hand, when we compare the #F uture allocations between older and younger males, we observe in specification SC that upper is positive and statistically significant. This result indicates that older boys tend to choose more future options (p = 0.04). However, this variable is no longer significant once we add social networks (SCN) and individual (SCNI) controls.Regarding the types of allocations used by subjects, we find some significant differences. Young teens select all present (AllP resent) allocations more often than old ones in specifications S (p = 0.04) and SC (p = 0.02) but this result is not robust to the inclusion of additional controls in specifications SCN and SCNI (p &gt; 0.05). Additionally, while older teens are more likely to make Interior choices (p &lt; 0.05 for all specifications), upper is not significant (p &gt; 0.35) on whether they allocate everything to the future (AllF uture). Finally, the interaction term f emale × upper is never significant.</p><p>For a better understanding of the interaction terms, we compute the marginal effects of f emale and male on each outcome variable for lower and upper grades and their 95% confidence intervals. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 7</ref> summarizes these results using the SCNI specification since it has the lowest AIC statistic and the highest adjusted R-squared. This figure reveals no gender differences in patience (Panel A), and AllF uture allocations (Panel D) across lower and upper grades. However, we find significant differences in allocating everything to the present (Panel B) and choosing interior allocations (Panel C). We find that older teens are less present oriented and more sophisticated than younger ones. In addition, we find that females become even more sophisticated than males in upper grades. This difference is significant (p = 0.05) and represents an increase in the probability of using interior solutions of 4.6 percentage points (7.4%) for females compared to males. However, since the interaction of f emale × upper in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> is not significant, we conclude that girls and boys become more sophisticated with age and there is weak evidence that this effect is higher for girls than for boys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6: OLS estimations for time preferences outcomes</head><p>While the null results on patience are in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Horn et al. (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sutter et al. (2013)</ref>, the sophistication results, to the best of our knowledge, have not been found previously in the literature. We therefore conclude:</p><p>Result 1: Girls and boys do not differ in patience at younger ages, while older teens are less present oriented but more -especially girls -sophisticated. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table B</ref>.2.1 shows all the regressions with the estimated coefficients of all the control variables. We highlight the following results:</p><p>• From the class controls, class size has a positive effect on the #F uture allocations (p = 0.01 in SC and p &lt; 0.10 in SCN and SCNI) with this effect being driven by a reduction in AllP resent allocations (p = 0.01 in SC and p &lt; 0.10 in SCN and SCNI). We also find that cohesivity is positively related to the #F uture allocations (p = 0.04 in SC specification) with this effect being driven by a reduction in AllP resent allocations (p = 0.01 in SC) and an increase in AllF uture allocations (p = 0.03 in SCN and SCNI). We also remark that the significance of size decreases and the significance of cohesivity disappears when we control for f riendsAP , suggesting that the effect driving the result is the likeliness of finding similar friends in larger classes. These results suggest that patience is positively correlated with large classes.</p><p>• From the networks controls, popularity.f is positively correlated with the use of Interior solutions (p = 0.02 in SCN and p &lt; 0.10 in SCNI) and negatively related to AllF uture allocations (p &lt; 0.05 in SCN and SCNI), suggesting that more popular subjects are more likely to make sophisticated choices at the expense of making more patient choices. Interestingly, f riendsAP is positively correlated with patience (p &lt; 0.01 for all the specifications and variables), with this effect being driven by a reduction in AllP resent and an increase of both Interior and AllF uture. It, therefore, suggests that teens with friends who have higher patience are more patient, some sort of social contagion (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Christakis and Fowler (2009)</ref>).</p><p>• From the individual controls, we find a strong and positive effect of cognitive abilities on the #F uture allocations, specifically in #As grades (p = 0.02), CRT score (p &lt; 0.01) and accuracy in probabilities (p &lt; 0.10). This effect seems to be driven by a reduction in AllP resent allocations resulting in Interior allocations, since AllP resent is negatively correlated to #As (p = 0.02), CRT (p &lt; 0.01) and accuracy (p = 0.02) while Interior is positively correlated with CRT (p = 0.03) and accuracy (p = 0.02). It suggests that subjects with higher cognitive abilities are more sophisticated in their allocations of time preferences. We therefore conclude that:</p><p>Result 2: Subjects with higher cognitive abilities are more patient, sophisticated, and less present oriented. Those who are friends of patient mates are more patient, sophisticated, and less present or more future oriented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Risk preferences</head><p>Figure 8 focuses on risk attitudes and displays the same regression analysis across various control specifications as <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. We observe that being f emale does not have a significant effect on #Risky choices (p &gt; 0.50), being risk Averse (p &gt; 0.30) or risk N eutral (p &gt; 0.70). However, we observe in the SCNI specification that young females are more likely to have risk Lover preferences than males (p = 0.04). It should be noted that this result applies only to one specification and for a small fraction of the sample, as 11.7% of the subjects are risk-lovers. Results, therefore, indicate that there is no gender effect on risk preferences for young subjects. Additionally, we find a negative and significant effect of upper (p &lt; 0.05 for all specifications) on the #Risky choices, indicating that older males take fewer risks than young ones. When we focus on the different types of risk preferences, we find a strong positive impact of upper (p &lt; 0.01 for all specifications) on the fraction of risk Averse teens and a negative effect of upper (p &lt; 0.01 for all specifications) on the fraction of risk N eutral. It suggests that older males are more risk-averse and less risk-neutral than young ones. Finally, we find that the interaction term is never significant (p ≥ 0.2), suggesting that these results also apply to girls.</p><p>As before, we calculate the marginal effects of f emale and male on each outcome variable by upper and lower grades to analyze better the significance of the interaction terms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 9</ref> provides these results for the specification with all the control variables (SCNI) 25 . Panel A confirms that girls and boys choose fewer #Risky choices at upper grades than lower grades and that this effect is not different across genders. This effect is driven by an increase in the proportion of being risk Averse and a reduction in the proportion of being risk N eutral as shown in Panels B and C. In addition, Panel B also suggests that risk aversion evolves differently across genders: we find that the probability of being risk Averse does not differ between girls and boys at lower grades (p &gt; 0.20), but at upper grades, it is 0.06 percentage points (13.2%) higher for boys compared to girls (p = 0.02). Although this difference is significant, the interaction of f emale × upper in the graph 8 is not significant. Therefore, we conclude that teens become more risk Averse and less risk N eutral at upper grades, but there is also weak evidence that the increase in the proportion of risk Averse is higher for boys than for girls. Finally, Panel D shows that there is a small difference in the probability of being risk Lover between males and females at lower grades, this difference disappears at upper grades.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that girls and boys do not differ in risk preferences, however, teens in upper grades prefer fewer risks than those in lower grades. This maturity effect is explained by an increase in the fraction of risk-averse and a reduction of risk-neutral subjects. We also find weak evidence that this maturation process is different between girls and boys: the increase in risk aversion is higher for males than for females. Therefore, our result 3 is:</p><p>Result 3: Older teens are more risk averse and less risk neutral. There are no gender differences at younger ages, but older girls are less risk averse than older boys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 8: OLS estimated coefficients</head><p>While the first part of result 3 is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Harbaugh et al. (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Deckers et al. (2015)</ref>, the second part is new and requires a more detailed analysis of what could be the potential mechanisms. This will be addressed in the next section. • From the class controls, we observe that class size reduces the likelihood of being risk N eutral (p &lt; 0.10 in SC, p = 0.04 in SCN and SCNI) and increases the likelihood of being risk Lover (p &lt; 0.10 in SC and SCN, p = 0.03 in SCNI). We conclude that teenagers in larger classes tend to be more risk-lover and less risk-neutral. As before we find evidence of social contagion.</p><p>• From the network controls, we observe that f riendsAR has a positive effect on #Risky choices (p &lt; 0.01), with this effect being driven by a reduction in risk Averse preferences and an increase in both risk N eutral and risk Lover preferences (p &lt; 0.01 for all specifications and outcomes variables). We also remark that popularity.f decreases the likeliness of being risk Lover in the SCN specification (p = 0.04), this result is most likely driven by higher cognitive abilities since such subjects are generally more popular. We conclude that teenagers with risk-prone friends have higher preferences for risk.</p><p>• From the individual controls, we observe that the #Risky choices are negatively correlated with cognitive abilities, specifically with the #As grades (p &lt; 0.01), the CRT score (p &lt; 0.01) and the accuracy in probabilities (p &lt; 0.01). This effect is driven by an increase in the proportion of risk Averse (p &lt; 0.01 for the three variables) and a reduction in the proportion of risk Lover individuals (p &lt; 0.01 for the three variables).</p><p>We therefore conclude that:</p><p>Result 4: Subjects with higher cognitive abilities choose fewer risky options, are more averse and less risk lovers. Those who are friends of risky mates choose more risky options, are less averse and are more risk lovers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Robustness checks</head><p>To assess the robustness of our results, Sections B.3 and B.4 extend the analysis by using the original variable grade instead of the discrete variable upper grade.  <ref type="figure">Figure OA</ref>.3.1. We found that there are no gender differences in consistency regarding time preferences for younger teens (p &gt; 0.20). However, older males perform more consistently in the task (p &lt; 0.01 in all specifications), while older females are less consistent (p = 0.02 in all specifications). These results suggest that consistency matures for boys but not for girls. As for risk preferences, we found that young females are less consistent (p = 0.02 in all specifications) than young males, while older males are more consistent than young males (p &lt; 0.05 in all specifications). The interaction term not being significant in any specification (p &gt; 0.10) implies that older females are also more consistent than young females. Considering that these differences in consistency could introduce selection bias if disregarded, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table OA</ref>.3.1 presents the regressions for the number of future allocations and the number of risky choices when including inconsistent subjects. We observe similar results than before when including inconsistent subjects, except that cognitive abilities do not influence the #Risky choices anymore. Overall, we conclude that our results are robust to alternative specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Heterogeneity analysis</head><p>In the previous sections, we found evidence of no gender differences and certain maturity effects on risk and time preferences. Additionally, we observed the significant influence of cognitive abilities and the average level of patience and risk among friends on economic preferences. Based on these results, in this section, we will conduct an exploratory analysis to further investigate these findings and determine if the maturity effects can be attributed to any change in these (significant) control variables. Specifically, we will estimate the following interaction model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y j i = β0 + β1 × f emalei + β2 × upperi + β3 × f emalei × upperi + β4 × V j i +β5 × V j i × f emalei + β6 × V j i × upperi + β7 × V j i × f emalei × upperi + ϵi<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Equation 2 is similar than equation 1 but adding to the regression the variable V j i and their interactions with f emalei and upperi. As before. the term y j i refers to one variable from our set of outcome variables, and f emalei and upperi are dummy variables. The term V j i refers to one variable from our set of control variables that have a significant coefficient in Tables B.2.1 and B.2.2, that is j={CRT , accurcy, #As, f riendsAP or f riendsAR}. The error term is denoted by ϵi. We estimate equation 2 using OLS for the specification with full controls (SCNI).</p><p>Subsections B.5 and B.6 of the Appendix display the regression results for the heterogeneity analysis for time and risk preferences, respectively. In the following subsections, we will focus on the marginal effects of V j i on each outcome variable by gender and for lower and upper grades separately. This analysis will allow us to understand better the mechanisms behind the maturity process found in the previous section and the significance of the interaction terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Heterogeneity in time preferences</head><p>Panels A to D from <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> show the linear prediction of CRT , accuracy, #As, or f riendsAP on the different outcome variables by gender. Within each panel, different plots are shown from left to right with these results for each outcome variable (#F uture, AllP resent, Interior, or AllF uture, respectively), by lower and upper grades separately. For example, Panel A shows the results when the interacting variable (V j i ) is the CRT score. The first graph on the left shows the linear prediction of this variable on the number of future allocations (#F uture) for lower and upper grades. It suggests that at lower ages there are no gender differences at any level of CRT (p &gt; 0.07), but boys with higher levels of reflection allocate more to the future (p = 0.03), while this variable does not affect girls' time preferences (p &gt; 0.40). In upper grades, there are also no gender differences (p &gt; 0.40), but now CRT increases the number of future allocations for girls but not for boys (p = 0.03 and p &gt; 0.10). These results suggest that reflective abilities increase the patience of young boys and older girls, but do not explain gender differences. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> We now explore the effect of CRT on AllP resent, Interior, and Allf uture allocations types. The second graph from the left of Panel A refers to the first type and unveils some interesting findings. First, boys with higher levels of reflection become less present-oriented (p &lt; 0.01) at lower grades. Still, the percentage of girls allocating everything to the present remains the same, independent of their level of reflection (p &gt; 0.10). Second, at upper grades, this pattern changes: girls with higher levels of reflection become less present-oriented (p = 0.03) while present orientation for boys is unaffected by reflection levels (p &gt; 0.07). The third graph from the left of Panel A shows the results for Interior allocations. It shows that in lower grades there is no significant effect of CRT on this outcome variable for either girls or boys (p &gt; 0.20). However, at upper grades higher levels of reflection make girls more sophisticated (p = 0.02) while do not affect boys (p &gt; 0.10). Finally, the fourth graph from the left of Panel A focuses on AllF uture allocations. It shows that reflection levels have no significant effect on this outcome variable at any grade for either boys or girls (p &gt; 0.06).</p><p>The same analysis using accuracy as the interacting variable is shown in Panel B of figure 10. The first graph on the left shows that at lower grades, this variable has no significant effect on #F uture allocations for either boys or girls (p &gt; 0.09). At upper grades, we find that boys with low accuracy start with a higher patience level than girls (p = 0.05), but as accuracy increases, girls choose more future allocations (p = 0.03) while this cognitive ability does not affect boys' patience (p &gt; 0.30). From the second graph, we can see that accuracy does not affect AllP resent allocations for girls and boys at lower grades (p &gt; 0.06), but at upper grades, higher accuracy levels induce only girls -and not boys (p &gt; 0.50)-to choose fewer AllP resent options (p = 0.03). Looking at the third graph, we find that there is no effect of accuracy levels on Interior allocations. This is true for both girls and boys in all grades (p &gt; 0.06). Finally, from the fourth graph from the left, we observe that this variable does not affect Allf uture allocations at earlier grades (p &gt; 0.26). In contrast, for upper grades, we find interesting results across genders. Older boys with low probability understanding are more future-oriented than girls with the same cognitive level (p = 0.04), but as probability understanding increases this future orientation of boys decreases (p = 0.01) while for girls is unaffected by accuracy (p &gt; 0.90).</p><p>Panel C of figure 10 uses the #As as the interacting variable and shows that this variable has no effect on any of the outcome variables for lower grades (p &gt; 0.10). However, for upper grades the results are different. First, girls with higher #As become more patient (p = 0.05) while it doesn´t affect #F uture allocations for boys (p &gt; 0.20). Second, this increase in patience for girls is explained by a reduction in the probability of allocating everything to the present (AllP resent, p &lt; 0.01) and an increase in sophistication (Interior, p &lt; 0.01); while for boys, there is no evidence that these variables are affected by #As (p &gt; 0.20). Finally, there is no effect of #As on the development of AllF uture allocations at any grade for either boys or girls (p &gt; 0.06).</p><p>Finally, Panel D shows the results when f riendsAP is used as the interacting variable. We observe that for all subjects, regardless of age and gender, this variable increases #F uture, Interior, and AllF uture allocations, while it also decreases the allocation to AllP resent (p &lt; 0.01 for all the mentioned outcome variables).</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that higher cognitive abilities -measured by CRT , accuracy, or #As-increase teens' patience for boys at lower grades, while at upper grades only increase girls' patience. This last effect is explained by the fact that girls with a higher cognitive ability become less present-oriented and more sophisticated than boys. Finally, we also found that a higher average level of patience of friends makes all subjects more future-oriented. Therefore, we can summarize this evidence in the following result:</p><p>Result 5: Cognitive ability is positively correlated with patience. However, the effect varies according to age and gender: in lower grades, boys with higher cognitive ability become less present-oriented than girls, but in upper grades, girls with higher cognitive ability become less present and more sophisticated than boys. A higher average level of patience with friends makes all subjects more future-oriented.</p></div>

Panel A of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 11</ref> uses the CRT as the interacting variable. The first graph from the left shows the results for the number of risky options (#Risky). It suggests that at lower grades, higher reflective abilities make boys choose fewer risky options (p = 0.04) but there is no significant effect for girls (p &gt; 0.90). At upper grades the results are quite different: girls with low reflective abilities choose more risky options (p = 0.04) than boys, but this gender difference tends to zero since girls choose fewer risky options than boys for higher levels of reflection (p &lt; 0.01 and p &gt; 0.08, respectively). The second graph from the left shows the results for the Averse variable. At lower grades, males with higher cognitive ability become more risk averse (p = 0.04), while the probability of being this type for girls is stable across different levels of reflection (p &gt; 0.90). However, at upper grades the results are different: boys start being more risk-averse than girls (p = 0.01) at low reflection levels, but girls become more risk-averse than boys as their cognitive ability increases, suggesting a convergence of girls' risk aversion levels with those of boys (p &lt; 0.01 and p &gt; 0.50, respectively). The third graph shows the results for N eutral: while for lower and upper grades the linear prediction of CRT looks different across boys and girls, these differences are not significant (p &gt; 0.10).</p><p>Figure 10: Linear prediction of V j i on time preferences for male and female by lower and upper grades Finally, the fourth graph from the left suggests that CRT does not explain gender differences in the probability of being risk Lover at lower grades (p &gt; 0.10). However, at upper grades, we observe that girls with higher levels of reflection become less risk Lover (p = 0.03), while for boys the probability of being risk lovers remains the same at any level of CRT (p &gt; 0.10) 27 .</p><p>We now look at Panel B of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 11</ref>, where accuracy in probability is used as the interacting variable. As before, the first graph shows the results for #Risky and we observe that boys with higher levels of accuracy choose fewer risky options (p = 0.04) at lower grades. However, for girls, this effect is not significant (p &gt; 0.60). At upper grades, this negative effect of accuracy on #Risky is no longer significant (p &gt; 0.10) neither for girls nor for boys. The second graph shows the same analysis for risk Averse. It suggests that at lower grades, higher levels of accuracy in probability make boys more risk Averse (p &lt; 0.01), but has no effect on girls (p &gt; 0.08). This effect of accuracy remains for boys at upper grades (p &lt; 0.01), while higher levels of accuracy make girls now more risk Averse (p = 0.04). The third graph shows that at lower grades, girls with low accuracy in probability are less risk N eutral than boys (p = 0.02), but as this cognitive ability increases, they become more risk N eutral (p = 0.02), while it does not affect to boys (p &gt; 0.09). At upper grades, we do not observe an effect of accuracy on risk neutrality for either girls or boys (p &gt; 0.20). Finally, the fourth graph shows that girls at lower grades become less risk Lover as their accuracy in probability increases (p &lt; 0.01) but it has no effect on boys (p &gt; 0.17). As before, at upper grades, we do not observe any effect of this cognitive ability on being risk lover for either girls or boys (p &gt; 0.07).</p><p>Panel C of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 11</ref> shows the same analysis using the #As as the interacting variable. The first graph from the left shows the results for the number of risky options (#Risky). It suggests that for lower grades, the #As does not affect #Risky for either girls or boys (p &gt; 0.08). However, at upper grades emerges some interesting differences: boys with fewer #As grades choose fewer risky choices than girls with similar grades (p = 0.02). However, as #As increases, girls choose fewer risky choices (p &lt; 0.01) but boys remain at the same level (p &gt; 0.60). The same analysis is presented in the second graph for the variable Averse. As before, we observe that #As does not affect the probability of being risk Averse either for girls or boys (p &gt; 0.30). However, at upper grades the results are different. Males without any A are more risk averse than girls with the same condition (p = 0.02), but they become more risk averse than boys as #As increases (p = 0.02). At the same time, we observe that academic excellence does not affect the risk aversion of males (p &gt; 0.70). The third graph shows that, at lower grades, the #As does not affect risk neutrality (N eutral) for either girls or boys (p &gt; 0.13). At upper grades, girls without any A are more risk N eutral than boys with the same condition (p = 0.03), but as #As increases, girls become less risk N eutral (p = 0.02). However, this outcome variable remains at the same level for boys across independently the number of As (p &gt; 0.70). Finally, we observe in the fourth graph that higher values of #As make boys less risk lovers (Lover) at lower grades (p &lt; 0.01), while it does not affect this outcome variable for girls (p &gt; 0.50). At upper grades, We observe the opposite pattern: girls with higher #As grades become less risk Lover (p &lt; 0.01) while it does not affect boys (p &gt; 0.13).</p><p>Finally, Panel D of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 11</ref> shows the results when f riendsAR is used as the interacting variable. We observe that for all subjects, regardless of age and gender, this variable increases the number of risky options chosen by teens (#Risky). Also, it reduces the probability of being risk Averse and increases the probability of being risk Lover (p &lt; 0.01 for all the mentioned outcome variables).</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that cognitive abilities explain differences in the maturity process of risk preferences: higher levels of cognitive abilities make boys less prone to take risk at lower grades, while girls with higher cognitive abilities become less risky at upper grades. We, therefore, conclude:</p><p>Result 6: Cognitive abilities are inversely associated with risk taking. However, the effect is different according to age and gender: higher levels of cognitive abilities make boys less willing to take risk at lower grades, while girls with higher cognitive abilities become less risky at upper grades. Friends who choose more risky options on average make all subjects more risky.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We use a large and powered sample of n = 4830 non-self-selected teenagers from 22 Spanish schools with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to study whether females behave differently than males, and whether their preferences for time and risk develop differently across adolescence.</p><p>In addition to measuring time and risk preferences and including fixed effects to account for school characteristics, we also collected information on several variables that characterize the different 207 classes in our dataset. These data include factors such as the selection of students into different classes, variations in effort during the experiment, and the level of cohesion at the class level. In doing so, we aimed to control for class-specific heterogeneity.</p><p>We also collected a large array of students' characteristics including controls regarding cognitive abilities that are strongly related to economic preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Horn et al., 2022)</ref>. These controls include the CRT score, the number of A grades, and the accuracy in understanding probability.</p><p>Last but not least, we compute several measures that allow us to identify patterns and trends that go beyond individual decisions and shed light on the influence of social networks on decision-making. Specifically, we compute measures of popularity in friends' and enemies' networks for each participant, as well as the average level of economic preferences of our subjects' friends. These new variables provide valuable insights not explored in the existing literature and serve as valuable controls for potentially omitted variables that have been shown to be significant determinants in recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alem et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Branas-Garza et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lucks et al., 2020)</ref>. By taking all these factors as exogenous, we find that girls and boys do not differ in patience at younger ages while older teens are less present-oriented and more sophisticated in their time preferences because they choose more interior solutions and are less likely to allocate everything to present. However, this effect is higher for girls. Regarding risk preferences, we do not find gender differences in the number of risky choices at younger ages, but we find that older teens choose fewer risky choices on average. However, we find at upper grades some gender differences in the different risk types: girls become less risk averse and more risk neutral than boys.</p><p>To better understand this maturation process in time and risk preferences, we perform an exploratory heterogeneity analysis. We find two new results to the existing literature. First, cognitive abilities play a critical role in the development of time and risk preferences. We find that cognitive abilities increase patience but the effect varies according to age and gender: in lower grades, boys with higher cognitive abilities become less present-oriented than girls, but in upper grades, girls with higher cognitive abilities become less present-oriented and more sophisticated than boys. Regarding risk preferences, cognitive abilities also explain age and gender differences. We find that higher levels of cognitive abilities make boys less prone to take risk at lower grades, while girls with higher cognitive abilities become less risky at upper grades.</p><p>Second, interaction within the social network of the class also matters. We find that the average level of patience (risk) of friends also impacts adolescents' preferences. Interestingly, we observe that the higher the average level of patience (risk) of their ties, the smaller the probability of becoming present-oriented (risk averse) and the higher the probability of taking all patient options (and all risky options). However, none of these interactions with gender or age (grade) are significant, implying that all these effects are the same across genders and ages.</p><p>These results have important implications for future research. First, it is essential to consider the interactions between gender, age, and cognitive abilities, as failing to do so may introduce bias when analyzing gender differences in risk and time preferences. Second, these interactions underscore the importance of cognitive abilities in understanding gender differences. We discovered that increasing cognitive abilities among females, particularly knowledge of probabilities, may lead to lower present orientation, potentially bringing them in line with males in terms of time preferences. Concerning risk preferences, higher cognitive abilities will make females more risk-averse, offering a possible explanation for why women often exhibit greater risk aversion than men in standard experiments involving university students.</p><p>Similarly, the strong and positive relationship between friends' preferences -that we cannot call homophily since, among others, we cannot even isolate the reflection effect -has also two important implications. The first one refers to common habits since good (bad) habits are commonly shared by friends and in turn, this could have an impact on future outcomes. Second, since there is evidence of successful interventions on time preferences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alan and Ertac, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lührmann et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rueda et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sutter et al., 2023)</ref> an interesting study might be to intervene in a random number of students to test whether their friends change their preferences as well. And if these spillovers in preferences appear then interventions might be even more beneficial.</p><p>Additionally, these results have important policy implications for reducing gender differences.</p><p>While prior studies have demonstrated the impact of financial literacy on participants' risk and time preferences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sutter et al. (2023)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alan and Ertac (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lührmann et al. (2018)</ref>), our findings highlight the significance of including probability calculus in efforts to reduce gender differences in patience. This suggests the necessity of incorporating probability education into such interventions and even into standard school curricula.</p><p>Before closing the paper it is necessary to acknowledge its limitations. The first limitation of this study is that we do not have treatments, therefore the entire analysis is purely correlational. Therefore, although our results are suggestive still we cannot discard that certain variables may co-evolve jointly. Second, it's also important to note that both time and risk preferences are elicited with simplified (and visually formatted) versions of classical tasks - <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alfonso et al. (2023)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vasco and Vazquez (2023)</ref> respectively. While these tasks provide very good results in terms of consistency (higher than 80% in both cases), still is true that our results are valid for these tasks only and therefore we cannot extrapolate them to other experimental settings. Lastly, the entire study is based on hypothetical rewards. Besides our previous experience shows that hypothetical tasks -in this particular dominion -are informative (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alfonso et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brañas-Garza et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, 2023</ref> still we could be missing relevant information. Monetary amounts are represented by a gift for the participant with a blue ribbon indicating their value. Using a gift symbol should help subjects understand that they make a choice for themselves. <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>1.2 shows how the ribbon darkens proportionally to the increase in the monetary value in order to help subjects understand the concept of interest rate. Waiting times are represented by a van surmounted with the text "Delivery in: 1 day / 8 days". A curved arrow represents the truck movement and points at the time delay to help subjects understand the meaning of the van symbol. Instructions above the answers say: "What do you prefer?". We used an emotional vocabulary following the advice of psycho-pedagogical teams that it would make subjects comfortable with answering the experiment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Elicitation of risk preferences</head><p>We measured risk preferences with a modified version of the Holt-Laury task. Subjects were asked to make six decisions between two paired lotteries where they have p h to obtain the highest payoff and p l to obtain the lowest payoff. The first decision in the standard Holt-Laury task is taken with probabilities p h =0 and p l =1, then p h increases by 0.2 in each following decision. Lottery A is initially better than lottery B until p h becomes sufficiently high and it reverses, but subjects might continue to pick lottery A because it is less risky than lottery B. The trial at which they switch to lottery B gives an interval of estimated values for their riskaversion parameter. Because inconsistency in the Holt-Laury task is usually high, we expected teenagers to face serious problems in this task. We, therefore, reduced the number of trials to six to limit the number of potentially inconsistent choices. We also added the (p h =0, p l =1) trial to get an additional measurement testing the consistency of subjects.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 Cognitive Reflection Test</head><p>We use two complementary tasks to study the abilities of teenagers: the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) adapted to teenagers to measure cognitive abilities. We used the following questions:</p><p>CRT1: In a library, the number of books doubles every month. If the library takes 48 months to fill, how long will it take to fill it halfway? Indicate with a number. (reflective: 47; intuitive: 24).</p><p>CRT2: If you are running a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in? Indicate with a number. For example: 1 (first), 2 (second), etc. (reflective: second; intuitive: first).</p><p>CRT3: The father of Emilia has 3 daughters. The first two are named April and May. What is the name of the third daughter ? (reflective: Emilia; intuitive: June).</p><p>Subjects answered the three CRT questions on the same screen and were instructed that there were correct answers to all questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4 Probability knowledge</head><p>To elicit probabilistic expectations, we follow the approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Delavande and Kohler (2009)</ref> and adapted to Spanish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Estepa et al. (2021)</ref>. We asked students to allocate a slider between 0 and 100 to express the likelihood that an event will be realized. We called this the "Delavande Test". We first elicit the understanding of our participants on probabilities. The first two questions allow us to test teenagers' ability to calculate a known probability with the slider. We used the following questions:</p><p>Q1 Imagine I have a basket with five apples: 1 green and four red. If I ask you to pick one of the apples without looking at the inside of the basket, how likely do you think it is that you will pick the green apple?</p><p>Q2 Imagine I have a basket with 10 apples: 1 green and 9 red. If I ask you to pick one of the apples without looking at the inside of the basket, how likely do you think you will pick the green apple?</p><p>The third and fourth questions inquire about events that are very close to 0 and 100 (absolute certainty), aiming to assess whether teenagers can accurately represent probabilities of zero and one.</p><p>Q3 How likely do you think it is that you are not going to attend school during the entire next month (including today)?</p><p>Q4 How likely do you think it is that you are going to take a shower at least once in the next month (including today)?</p><p>Finally, questions five and six jointly assess whether teenagers respect a fundamental property of probability by examining nested events.</p><p>Q5 How likely do you think it is that you will eat rice in the next week (including today)?</p><p>Q6 How likely do you think it is that you will eat rice in the next month (including today)?</p><p>In this paper, we use the two first questions to define a measure of accuracy. Specifically, using the true values of Q1 and Q2, we first define a variable called inaccuracy as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Inacci =(Yi1 − T V1) 2 +(Yi2 − T V2) 2 ,</formula><p>where Yij is the value given by individual i in question j = [1, 2]; and T Vj is the true value for question j. We then standardize this variable between 0 and 1 using a max-min procedure. Next, we compute our outcome variable, accuracy as accuracyi = 1−std(Inacci). Higher values of these variables indicate answers that are closer to the true values, while lower values reflect higher errors in computing objective probabilities. In addition, we introduce the following question: "How likely are you to attend UNIVERSITY?". This question was designed to elicit students' perceptions of their likelihood of enrolling in university. The responses obtained were used to quantitatively assess expectations of university attendance, referred to in our analysis as expectations.  </p></div>

Results remain almost the same: we do not see that older teens make more allocations to the future, but we see in all specifications that younger teens are more likely to allocate everything to the present (p &lt; 0.10) while older teens are more likely to choose at least one interior allocation (p &lt; 0.05).</p></div>

Similarly, Table B.4.2 in Section B.4 reproduces the findings of Table B.2.2 for risk preferences. We find that results are robust to an alternative specification of the grade variable.Additionally, Section OA.2 extends the analysis by employing alternative regression models according to the different nature of the outcome variables. In this line, columns (1) to (4) of Table OA.2.1 and OA.2.2 deliver the corresponding Tobit regression for the #F uture allocations and #Risky options, respectively. The same tables also provide Probit estimations in columns (5) to (16) where the dependent variables are binary. We find that results hold, demonstrating the robustness of our findings to these alternative specifications.Finally, in Section OA.3, we analyze whether inconsistency depends on gender and grade. The results are displayed in</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">For a comprehensive review of the effects of age and gender on various economic preferences, see<ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Sutter et al. (2019)</ref>.2 One must be cautious in generalizing these results since<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Filippin and Crosetto (2016)</ref> and<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Niederle (2016)</ref> note that gender difference might be context and task sensitive.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">Except for<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Horn et al. (2022)</ref> which involved 9 schools. 4 See Tables OA.1.1a and OA.1.2a in the Online Appendix that summarize the mean sample sizes per age group in each study for time and risk preferences, respectively.5 The relationship between adolescent's preferences and the average preferences of friends should be interpreted with caution. It will be considered as a correlational analysis since it is not possible to distinguish between peer effects and/or homophily (the tendency of individuals with similar preferences to interact with each other in social groups, rather than with those who have different preferences). Furthermore, this measure might be affected by the reflection effect<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Manski, 1993)</ref>, which could mean either that an adolescent could be more patient because his/her</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">This percentage is similar to the 15.3% of early leavers from high school in Andalusia (Ministerio de Educación y Formación Profesional, 2023).7 Data on networks is not available yet, but it can be requested from the authors.8 See the following link https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=af3rw7 9 This variable takes values between 0 and 3 since we asked the subjects if they had any A in English (English as a Foreign Language, EFL), Mathematics, and Spanish during the last year.10 Consistent subjects in the truck tasks are those who do not switch back.11 In the literature it is common to use discount factors or rates, however, following Chowdhury et al. (2022) we use the number of future allocations.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">There are three types of inconsistency: i) Lack of understanding, when subjects selected lottery B in the first decision since there is no uncertainty in probabilities and B is dominated by A; ii) Switch back, when subjects switched back from lottery B to A; and iii) Lack of attention when subjects chose lottery A in the sixth decision since there is no uncertainty and A is dominated by B.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="13">We define class size as the number of students in the class on the day of the experiment. This variable is important to control because<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bandiera, Larcinese, and Rasul (2010)</ref> reported negative effects on student outcomes, particularly for students at the top of the test score distribution.14 The value of each density ranges from 0 to 1 and gives an idea of how connected the network is compared to how connected it could be. The difference between both densities ranges from -0.1 to 0.75, where negative and low values of the variable indicate a higher level of conflict within the class.15 These values correspond to the American educational system. In the Spanish system, they correspond to 1st to 4th year of Compulsory Secondary Education (Educación Secundaria Obligatoria).16 The max-min method of standardization involves re-scaling the range of features to scale the data between 0 and 1. For each variable, the formula used is (x − min)/(max − min), where x is the original value, min is the minimum value of the variable, and max is the maximum value of the variable.17 Which is consistent with the lower likelihood of f emale being repeaters (seeFigure 4)</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="18">This measure is known as in-degree, while out-degree measures the number of friends named by subject i. We use the former because it depends more on the choices of others than on the choices of the subjects themselves, which reduces any potential endogeneity problem.19 These variables will not capture the causal effect of peers, as there is an endogeneity problem: adolescents may exhibit assortative matching in their choice of friends, or attending the same friendship group may lead to convergence in economic preferences over time. Additionally, this measure is affected by the reflection effect defined by<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Manski (1993)</ref> </note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="23">We do not study the same individual across adolescence (like in a panel), but different teens in different cohorts.</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="25">Again, this specification has the lowest AIC statistic and the highest adjusted R-squared.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1 Time preferences</head><p>We measured time preferences with a modified version of the Multiple Price Lists task. Subjects were asked to take six decisions between two amounts of money. Option A allowed them to obtain money tomorrow, and option B allowed them to obtain money at the later date of one week and one day. The amount of money at the early date is always e10, and the amount of money at the later date increases from decision to decision: e10, e12, e14, e16, e18 and e20. Subjects should initially select option A and the trial at which they switch from option A to option B gives an interval of potential values for their discount rate. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alfonso et al.
