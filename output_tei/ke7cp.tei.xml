			<abstract>
				<p>The Implicit Association Test (IAT), like many behavioral measures, seeks to quantify meaningful individual differences in cognitive processes that are difficult to assess with approaches like self-reports. However, much like other behavioral measures, many IATs appear to show low test-retest reliability and typical scoring methods fail to quantify all of the decision-making processes that generate the overt task performance. Here, we develop a new modeling approach for IATs based on the geometric similarity representation (GSR) model. This model leverages both response times and accuracy on IATs to make inferences about representational similarity between the stimuli and categories. The model disentangles processes related to response caution, stimulus encoding, similarities between concepts and categories, and response processes unrelated to the choice itself. This approach to analyzing IAT data illustrates that the unreliability in IATs is almost entirely attributable to the methods used to analyze data from the task: GSR model parameters show test-retest reliability around .80-.90, on par with reliable selfreport measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate how model parameters result in greater validity compared to the IAT D-score, Quad model, and simple diffusion model contrasts, predicting outcomes related to intergroup contact and motivation. Finally, we present a simple point-andclick software tool for fitting the model, which uses a pre-trained neural network to estimate best-fit parameters of the GSR model. This approach allows easy and instantaneous fitting of IAT data with minimal demands on coding or technical expertise on the part of the user, making the new model accessible and effective.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For more than two decades, researchers have used the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure psychological constructs in a way that circumvents the need for introspection on the part of respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Greenwald et al., 1998)</ref>. Most commonly, researchers use IATs in an attempt to capture so-called "implicit" constructs that are generally conceived of as evaluations or beliefs that are relatively uncontrollable and whose existence or influence operates at least partly outside of conscious awareness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">De Houwer, 2006)</ref>. The IAT paradigm has undoubtedly been influential outside of academia, with more than 28 million IATs completed at the Project Implicit website (K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Ratliff &amp; Smith, 2021)</ref>. The psychometric value of behavioral measures, however, stems largely from their ability to reliably assess meaningful psychological constructs. Critics have long argued the IAT does not succeed in either of those requirements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Fiedler et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Schimmack, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blanton et al., 2006)</ref>. *Corresponding author, Peter D. Kvam https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3195-8452, pkvam@ufl.edu; Louis H. Irving https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2423-0375.</p><p>For readers unfamiliar with IATs, the task is structured as follows. Participants are presented with stimuli from two conceptual and two attribute categories -which may include words, pictures, phrases, or other visual or lexical itemsand asked to match them with their corresponding category by pressing one of two keys on the keyboard (e.g., 'e' or 'i' for 'left' and 'right' category responses). The task proceeds in a set of four types of blocks, each of which has different sorting rules. Participants begin with two practice blocks, sorting positive and negative words (valence stimuli) and then words related to the categories of interest (e.g., faces of young and old people). In these blocks, participants simply have to classify each stimulus by pressing one button or the other (e.g., positive words on the left, negative words on the right). The key manipulation of the IAT comes in the remaining two blocks (referred to as critical blocks) in which the two practice blocks are combined so that there are two categories on the left and two categories on the right side of the screen. In these blocks, participants use a single response key to sort evaluative stimuli (e.g., positive words) and category stimuli (e.g., faces of young people). The task is illustrated on the left side of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The guiding idea behind the IAT is that responses will be easier <ref type="bibr">(i.e., faster)</ref> when categories that share a response key also share a relationship in the participant's mind and more difficult (i.e., slower) when categories sharing a response key do not share a relationship or are even at odds with one another. In other words, researchers use an individual's pattern of responses on the IAT to draw conclusions about, for example, their degree of positivity toward one social group relative to another.</p><p>Of course, there are research practices such as selecting appropriate stimuli and using multiple measurement occasions that can improve on an IAT's psychometric properties <ref type="bibr">(Greenwald et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Carpenter et al., 2022)</ref>, but there are certainly serious and credible concerns about the structure of the task and its ability to measure individual differences. In aggregate (e.g., averaging scores by experimental condition or geographical region), many IATs reliably produce large effects, distinguish known-groups, and are associated with relevant outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Payne et al., 2017)</ref>. Where the IAT could stand to improve the most is at the individual-level. The existing research indicates low test-retest reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref> along with imprecise individual estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Klein, 2020)</ref>, reflecting psychometric properties that make it potentially undesirable as a measure of individual differences. Moreover, the predictive validity of IATs is also disputed. On one hand, some researchers interpret the available evidence as indicating IATs can predict an array of relevant outcome measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Buttrick et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Greenwald et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Kurdi et al., 2019)</ref>, in some cases over and above analogous self-report measures. On the other hand, critics argue that there is little to no evidence that IATs meaningfully predict any outcomes with practical relevance or real-world significance at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Carlsson &amp; Agerström, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">Van Dessel et al., 2020)</ref>, and not incrementally over any sufficiently valid self-report measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blanton et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Oswald et al., 2013)</ref>. We want to continue to remind readers that the IAT is a measurement procedure in much the same way that a survey is a measurement procedure and that there is no such thing as The IAT. It may be, for example, that psychometric properties are better for IATs measuring some attitude objects rather than others.</p><p>Designing effective behavioral measures is difficult in part because it requires balancing a trade-off between the robustness of experimental manipulations (i.e., how consistently a manipulation creates an effect) and the reliability for assessing individual differences in task performance (we focus here on test-retest reliability, specifically; <ref type="bibr">Greenwald et al., 2021</ref>, suggest that other dimensions or measures of reliability may not be as concerning for the IAT). This issue is not unique to IATs, and has been termed the "reliability paradox" <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Hedge et al., 2018)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Haines et al. (2021)</ref> have shown that this issue is one of measurement as opposed to an issue with behavior in general. Specifically, they showed that the way behavior is quantified on tasks like IATs is counterproductive to high reliability and, consequently, predictive valid-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Diagram of the structure of the GSR-DDM model. The stimulus provides information that guides participants toward white / black and positive / negative evaluations, which are mapped onto responses on the left (L) or right (R) sides of the screen based on which threshold (dotted / dashed lines for compatible / incompatible blocks, respectively) is crossed. This drives an evidence accumulation process, shown in blue, that moves around until it hits one of the choice boundaries. Shown here is a model of an individual with a slight bias toward white faces (smaller angle between white faces &amp; positive and black faces &amp; negative) relative to black faces (larger angle between black faces &amp; positive and white faces &amp; negative).</p><p>ity. There are two reasons for this. First, simple summary statistics like mean response times do not fully capture the rich patterns of behavior that people exhibit on these tasks, lacking the distributional information about response times as well as the accompanying accuracy participants exhibit. By condensing performance down to a single index like the D-score <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Greenwald et al., 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Greenwald et al., , 2003</ref>, all the different cognitive processes involved in performance -and the error in measurement -are confounded.</p><p>As we note below, there have been efforts to dissect performance into multiple dimensions with models like the diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Röhner &amp; Lai, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Klauer et al., 2007)</ref>, but even these models suffer from an additional issue related to test-retest reliability. Specifically, they quantify performance on IATs using a difference score or comparison between conditions. Any time performance is quantified in two separate conditions and then compared between them, the summary statistic or model parameter used to quantify behavior in any single condition is doubled. This issue has been raised before in the psychology and educational measurement literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bereiter, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Thomas &amp; Zumbo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Overall &amp; Woodward, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gardner &amp; Neufeld, 1987)</ref>, but it was dismissed or glossed over largely because tests of significance between conditions (e.g., blocks of the IAT) based on the difference score are still well-powered (and in fact they are highest when reliability is zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Overall &amp; Woodward, 1975)</ref>. This means that comparisons between conditions are likely to yield significant results, but will not serve well as reliable measures of individual differences.</p><p>A natural parallel can be drawn to IATs, where large effects of pairing manipulations (attitude-congruent / attitudeincongruent) are observed alongside low test-retest reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>. This trade-off is potentially damaging to IATs because its theoretical underpinnings are largely predicated on its ability to measure differences in individuallevel automatic cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Greenwald et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Kurdi &amp; Banaji, 2017)</ref>. Its value as a behavioral measure is in its ability to assess these latent processes, making reliable measurement and high predictive validity paramount to effective use. To the extent that the test-retest reliability and predictive validity of IATs is diminished by measurement practices, we should strive to improve our measurement procedures to imbue the task with greater utility. To use it as a measure of individual differences, we must therefore solve the dual challenges of generative modeling and avoiding relying on difference scores. This paper outlines a modeling approach that accomplishes both objectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling IATs</head><p>One of the reasons that IATs have been criticized is that the usual metric for summarizing IAT task performance (IAT D-scores) is inappropriately interpreted as a process-pure measure of individual differences in automatic associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Conrey et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Schimmack, 2021)</ref>. It is fairly clear that, although IATs almost certainly pick up on associative relationships, a purely associative account is not tenable and, instead, the possibility exists that IATs also pick up on propositional information (for the most recent and comprehensive account see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">De Houwer et al., 2021)</ref>. In other words, researchers assume D-scores primarily capture the strength of target-attribute associations stored in long-term memory rather than ephemeral or non-associative factors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Fiedler et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bading et al., 2020)</ref>. However, behavior on an IAT does not correspond one-to-one with the (automatic) activation of underlying attitudes (e.g., associations). Rather, it results from a mix of controlled and automatic processes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Calanchini &amp; Sherman, 2013)</ref> and contains both attitudinal and non-attitudinal content <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Calanchini et al., 2014)</ref>. For example, IAT task performance is influenced systematically by non-associative cognitive variables including general processing speed, task-switching abilities, and cognitive control (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blanton et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Ito et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Klauer et al., 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Additionally, different IATs that target seemingly distinct attitudes still have substantial overlap in their associations after decomposing IAT D-scores into associative and non-associative components <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Calanchini et al., 2014)</ref>, thus indicating the presence of construct-irrelevant, common method variance or attitudinal content that is irrelevant to the specific constructs of interest.</p><p>We posit that the controversies surrounding the reliability and validity of IATs are intractable until researchers embrace modeling approaches that can decompose the individuallevel behaviors into unique components that are both reliably quantifiable and theoretically-grounded (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Klauer et al., 2007)</ref>. Doing so will allow researchers to gain new insight into which specific aspects of IAT task performance can be reliably captured across repeated measurements (i.e., testretest reliability), and whether the unique parameters can predict outcomes above and beyond typical D-scores (i.e., predictive validity). The complexity underlying IAT task performance ought to be accompanied by scoring metrics that can meaningfully capture and distinguish the multiple underlying processes. Unfortunately, the simple metrics and models traditionally used to characterize behavior (such as the IAT D-scores, C-scores, or other summary statistics; for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Röhner &amp; Thoss, 2019)</ref> provide an impoverished view. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Recent evidence suggests that the IAT's utility as a traitlevel measure can be increased greatly by requiring individuals to complete at least two IATs and aggregating D-scores onto a latent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Carpenter et al., 2022)</ref>. This approach has real promise, but retains the D-score, which we argue is not ideal. Indeed, the field's near total reliance on IAT summary statistics and scores has left researchers to make inferences about "implicit" constructs that are, arguably, too ill-defined and heterogeneous -not only between different researchers but also within the same ones -to have real theoretical and practical utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Corneille &amp; Hütter, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">De Houwer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gawronski et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Schimmack, 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, the repetition of IATs as in the procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Carpenter et al. (2022)</ref> increases the risk of participants learning to fake their performance in an attempt to mask their attitudes from detection via traditional scoring methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Röhner et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Fiedler &amp; Bluemke, 2005</ref>). As we note below, models are better able to disentangle faking strategies from activated associations, presenting an additional solution to the repetition problem.</p><p>In this paper, we address this issue by developing a new computational model of performance on IATs, adopting and formalizing the link between models of semantic meaning and similarity and models of decision-making on response time tasks. The goal of our modeling approach is to disentangle the many factors influencing performance on IATsincluding response caution, encoding, and non-decision processes such as pushing the keys on the keyboard (R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Ratcliff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Busemeyer et al., 2019)</ref> -from the constructrelevant mental content that the task is designed to measure. To accomplish this, we estimate the cosine-similarity between the concepts specific to an IAT (e.g., Black, White, good, and bad for the Black/White Race IAT) alongside model parameters describing other elements of the decision process. A complete detailing of this model is provided in the "Modeling approach" section, but we provide a summary of the benefits here. Specifically, our modeling approach provides a richer description of what participants are actually doing on an IAT by providing multiple measures quantifying performance on the task. Applying a cognitive modeling perspective to IATs provides a relatively clean theoretical slate.</p><p>In particular, attempting to define the "implicit" nature of the associations captured by the task a priori <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Corneille &amp; Hütter, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gawronski et al., 2022)</ref> is unnecessary to the approach. Measuring representational similarity in terms of geometric relationships makes no assumptions about how similarities are formed or whether participants are aware of their existence. We merely presuppose that these semantic similarities exist and affect decisions, an assumption that has been wellvalidated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bhatia, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bhatia, , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bhatia &amp; Mullett, 2018)</ref> to the extent that it should be reasonable even to the strongest critics of IATs.</p><p>At their core, IATs are designed to measure the strength of relationships (e.g., associations) between categories (e.g., social groups) and attributes such as valence <ref type="bibr">(Greenwald et al., 2021)</ref> or personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Back et al., 2009)</ref>. In this respect, they are similar to vector space semantic models, which seek to represent the meanings of words and concepts in terms of the similarities between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Günther et al., 2019)</ref>, including the representation of collective biases reflected in language <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Charlesworth et al., 2021)</ref>. In typical semantic models, these similarities are measured from word co-occurrences across large samples of text <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Turney &amp; Pantel, 2010)</ref> ranging from 100,000 documents to 1-2 billion for large language models like BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">(Zhu et al., 2015)</ref> or even half a trillion tokens for models like GPT-3 <ref type="bibr">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref>. One of the architects of the IAT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Greenwald (2017)</ref>, noted the potential relationship between IATs and vector-space models seeking to represent similarity between concepts: "Caliskan et al. (2017)'s Word-Embedding Association Test (WEAT) algorithm uses cosine similarity (a correlation-like indicator) between word vectors in different word categories, much as the IAT uses response latencies; greater cosine similarity corresponds to faster IAT responding."</p><p>The idea that response times on IATs reflect semantic similarities among words, or between words and visual stimuli is intuitively appealing. The speed at which we can retrieve the word "royal" from the word "gold" is much faster than we can retrieve it from the word "shale" -which might seem unassociated or even inversely associated with royalty. When these associations are pitted against one another, it can create competing or interfering relationships among categories. For example, if the categories were royal/gems vs peasant/rocks, we might expect a "ruby" stimulus to easily correspond to the former, resulting in a fast response; however, when they are juxtaposed or conflicting as in royal/rocks vs peasant/gems, the royal and gems categories might compete to make the response to "ruby" slower. Low conflict stimuli, trials, and conditions should create less interference and thus better (faster) performance, whereas conflicting or incongruent semantic similarities should result in worse (slower) performance. In this way, the degree of competition or interference is thought to provide the link between semantic associations on one hand and response speed on the other.</p><p>However, IAT performance involves many processes beyond similarity: a decision-maker performing the task must encode the stimuli (a process which may be faster or slower depending on the stimulus type, such as word vs face), relate the stimuli to support for the different response categories, determine what response to trigger, and carry out the action of entering their response. The modeling challenge is to disentangle these processes from those related to associations between concepts, determining if and how similarity has impeded or facilitated the choices that someone makes across trials and conditions of IATs.</p><p>Critics and proponents of IATs agree that better modeling techniques are the most promising path forward to developing an accurate account of the multiple cognitive processes that generate task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Carpenter et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Schimmack, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Corneille &amp; Hütter, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gawronski, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Fiedler et al., 2006)</ref>. Applying cognitive models to behavioral tasks allows for effective estimation of distinct latent cognitive processes underlying performance on response time tasks in social cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Pleskac et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Johnson et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, it becomes possible to reliably characterize individual differences in latent processes by developing quantitative theories of how conceptual similarities influence choices and response times.</p><p>Indeed, researchers have already begun applying various approaches to generative models of the behaviors underlying IAT task performance. In the next section, we outline how several of these approaches have improved measurement practices on IATs, then segue into our own approach and how it solves many outstanding issues with IAT modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multinomial Process Trees</head><p>Two of the earliest and most common models for decomposing IAT task performance, the quad <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">(Wang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Dunham et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Ruiz et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Wrzus et al., 2017)</ref> and ReAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Meissner &amp; Rothermund, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Z. Jin, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Koranyi &amp; Meissner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Calanchini et al., 2021)</ref> models, use multinomial process trees [MPTs] to account for accuracy data on IATs. In these models, error rates are compared across conditions of the task to make inferences about the order in which different cognitive processes occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Hütter &amp; Klauer, 2016)</ref>. The first and most well-known model of IAT behavior is the Quad model (i.e., Quadruple Process model: <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Conrey et al., 2005)</ref> which uses the distribution of error responses to estimate four different parameters. Namely, representing activation of target-attribute associations (estimated separately for each IAT block), accuracy in detecting correct responses, self-regulation to overcome associations that would result in incorrect responses, and guessing when other processes fail to fully guide responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Calanchini &amp; Sherman, 2013)</ref>. The activation parameter thus represents relatively process-pure associations whereas the remaining parameters represent non-associative or mixed processes. The model allows researchers to determine the extent to which each process guides IAT task performance to answer various research questions.</p><p>A second model, the ReAL model, estimates three parameters that represent a task-simplifying recoding process, activation of evaluative associations (separately per IAT block), and label-based discrimination of the correct response <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Meissner &amp; Rothermund, 2013)</ref>. The recoding parameter is central to the model because it estimates the role of a wide variety of response strategies that are distinct from evaluative associations that are typically assumed to underlie IAT effects. In general, participants are more likely to apply recoding to the compatible 3 IAT block by reducing the target and attribute categories into a single category. Thus, recoding is problematic for typical interpretations because it is a non-associative process that causes IAT effects to appear more stereotype-consistent (e.g., stronger preference for majority over minoritized social groups).</p><p>Both the Quad (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Wang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Dunham et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Ruiz et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Wrzus et al., 2017)</ref> and ReAL model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Meissner &amp; Rothermund, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Z. Jin, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Koranyi &amp; Meissner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Calanchini et al., 2021)</ref> have shed light onto the cognitive processes underlying performance on IATs, and generated insights that would not have been possible without these modeling approaches. For example, research using the ReAL model suggests that recoding is responsible for producing the smaller IAT effects that are observed with word-versus picture-based stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Meissner &amp; Rothermund, 2015)</ref> as well as the apparent differences in gender associations for younger versus older males (Z. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Jin, 2016)</ref>. After controlling for recoding, the ReAL model es-timates the unique contributions that positive and negative associations between target concepts and attributes make to IAT scores. Researchers can then not only be more confident that they are making inferences about associations per se, but also about the specific content of those associations. For example, the ReAL model provided evidence that motivation to initiate romantic relationships leads specifically to weaker associations between potential partners and negative characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Koranyi &amp; Meissner, 2015)</ref>. Similarly, the Quad model illustrated that performance on the Young-Old IAT differs by gender, race, and motivation to control prejudice <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Ruiz et al., 2015)</ref>, and age-related effects across various IATs appear to be attributable primarily to differences in overcoming bias rather than in association strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">(Wrzus et al., 2017)</ref>. The ReAL model is used infrequently despite its potential applications, perhaps because it requires several modifications to the typical IAT procedure including an increased number of trials. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Calanchini et al. (2021)</ref> applied both the original ReAL model and a simplified version across a wide set of IAT procedures (e.g., 320 vs. 120 trials, single block vs. multi-block). The original ReAL model performed well across a number of conditions but cannot be fit to the standard IAT procedure; the simplified model was also unable to provide a range of meaningful parameter estimates from standard IAT data. However, the Quad model can be fit to standard IAT data, provided there are enough errors. Below, we apply the Quad model and compare it to our new approach in order to better situate it relative to multinomial processing trees.</p><p>These models can provide unique insights into IAT task performance in part because typical response time measures like IAT D-scores omit response accuracy. Nevertheless, multinomial process trees fail to overcome a major deficiency of IAT D-scores because they omit a different source of information (response times) that could shed light on the underlying cognitive processes. Although some different formulations of the D-score attempt to integrate the two sources of information into a single metric, such as adding a response time penalty for errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Röhner &amp; Thoss, 2019)</ref>, they cannot fully account for both at the same time. As a result, both sum scores and Quad / ReAL models are unable to detect the joint information that is provided at the intersection of response times and accuracy, such as if a participant responds more slowly to improve accuracy or when a partici-pant sacrifices accuracy to respond faster <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Luce, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Röhner et al., 2013)</ref>. People commonly differ in how they approach these so-called speed-accuracy trade-offs when completing response time tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Wickelgren, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Heitz, 2014)</ref>, so models that cannot or do not capture this trade-off are almost certainly missing a fundamental piece of the behavioral phenomenon of completing an IAT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffusion Model</head><p>A classic and effective approach to modeling binary choice response time tasks, such as those in IATs, is to use a dynamic decision-making model like the diffusion model, where noisy information is accumulated over time until a decision threshold is reached and a response is initiated (R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">R. Ratcliff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">R. Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>. A basic version of the diffusion model (i.e., not including start point bias or cross-trial variability) estimates parameters related to three processes underlying IAT performance, including the speed at which information is gathered (drift), speed-accuracy tradeoffs (thresholds), and nondecision time <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Röhner &amp; Lai, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Röhner &amp; Ewers, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Klauer et al., 2007)</ref>. The accumulation speed parameter or drift represents how easily stimulus information is processed before deciding which key to press on each trial, and it is intended to reflect the relatively automatic associative processes between targets and responses that researchers typically hope to measure with IATs. The speed-accuracy tradeoff parameter (threshold) estimates the level of caution people take to ensure accurate rather than quick responding. It is often considered a construct-irrelevant decisionmaking process for implicit measures, because it is thought of as relatively controlled rather than automatic process, although it has been demonstrated to be related to methodspecific variance as well as faking strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Klauer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Röhner, 2016)</ref> and it is actually possible that thresholds are learned or adjusted over time, which may occur automatically or without awareness following reinforcement <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cavanagh et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Fontanesi, Palminteri, &amp; Lebreton, 2019)</ref>. Non-decision time captures variance in IAT performance stemming from individual differences in cognitive and motor abilities, as well as any other external factors that cause people to increase or decrease their response speed. As a result, the diffusion model distinguishes between processes that are directly related to decision making (drift / ν, threshold / a) and processes that can be seen as outside the decision process (non-decision time / t0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Röhner, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>A great deal of progress on modeling IATs using the diffusion process has been made, often with the aim of disentangling processes of interest (e.g., automatic activation of evaluative associations) from processes deliberately controlled by a participant <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Röhner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Röhner &amp; Ewers, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Röhner &amp; Thoss, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Röhner &amp; Lai, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Röhner et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Klauer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">van Ravenzwaaij, van der Maas, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">von Krause et al., 2021)</ref>. A strength of this approach is that it is able to disentangle construct-related variance in the drift from impression management and "faking" strategies, which often appear as shifts in thresholds or non-decision times between congruent and incongruent conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Röhner &amp; Ewers, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Fiedler &amp; Bluemke, 2005)</ref>. It has also succeeded in dissecting the processes underlying the impact of interventions on IAT performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Röhner &amp; Lai, 2021)</ref>, and the effects of modifying IAT target categories and stimuli (van Ravenzwaaij, van der Maas, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2011).</p><p>The limitation of traditional diffusion modeling methods is that the parameters are estimated separately for congruent and incongruent conditions -and often neglect the other conditions entirely. Once computed for each condition, a difference score such as IAT ν (difference in drift rates between conditions), IAT a (difference in thresholds between conditions), or IAT t0 (difference in non-decision time between conditions) is computed. As we mention above, these difference scores are effective for detecting differences in behavior between conditions, but they will naturally be unreliable because of the compound error variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bereiter, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Thomas &amp; Zumbo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Overall &amp; Woodward, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gardner &amp; Neufeld, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>As with the ReAL model, diffusion model analyses are typically too complex to be applied with less than 90 trials per condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Röhner &amp; Ewers, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Klauer et al., 2007)</ref>. One way to overcome this limitation is by using the Discrimination-Association Model to estimate similar parameters but with a mathematically simpler Poisson race model <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">(Stefanutti et al., 2013)</ref> or to use a simplified version of the diffusion model like the E-Z diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Paige et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Wagenmakers et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Röhner &amp; Thoss, 2018)</ref>. These approaches are advantageous over the diffusion model in that they need less information and can function even when there are no trials with incorrect responses, but non-identifiable parameters remain common when analyzing standard IAT data. However, all of them still require a reasonably high level of coding and modeling ability to apply. Although computational modeling ought to be an accessible and achievable route to better theory in psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Guest &amp; Martin, 2021)</ref>, it is often avoided because of the demands on quantitative and programming skills on the part of the model user. We suspect that this barrier has significantly affected research on IATs, where many may wish to use computational models but lack the background to confidently do so. Technical issues with model estimation aside, each of the variants of the diffusion model suffer from a major disadvantage in that they do not directly index what IAT researchers are usually interested in -capturing the degree of similarity or association between concepts (e.g., Black / White faces and positive / negative words). The models are applied such that they estimate separate drift rates for the compatible and incompatible IAT blocks, meaning the only way to get a proxy for degree of similarity is by contrasting the parameter estimates. As we mentioned above, this falls prey to the second issue of reduced reliability in behavior, which is the compound error of difference scores. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the drift rate measures processes above and beyond the activation of associations, such as the ease with which a particular type of stimulus is processed (e.g., words vs faces), the discriminability of the categories, and the relative strength of category activations <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Kvam &amp; Pleskac, 2016)</ref>. The more processes that need to be quantified using the same parameter, such as drift, the less specific -and arguably, less informative -that parameter tends to be. Using the difference between catch-all drift rate parameters therefore results in an estimate that contains greater uncertainty and fails to directly quantify the association-specific processes that IATs are designed to measure. In our analyses in this paper, we show that this results in greatly reduced reliability and ultimately predictive validity.</p><p>Despite its drawbacks, the diffusion model is an excellent starting point for building a model of IATs because it quantifies behavior -including both response times and accuracy -in terms of meaningful cognitive processes. The proposed work improves on the diffusion modeling approach by directly addressing the practical and theoretical hurdles outlined above. It specifically addresses the main drawbacks of current modeling approaches, which are 1. Separately computed metrics of performance for congruent and incongruent conditions, resulting in difference scores (e.g., IAT ν , IAT a , and IAT t0 ; Röhner &amp; Lai, 2021); 2. The absence of a single parameter that directly quantifies conceptual similarities between stimuli and categories;</p><p>3.

The difficulty of applying complex dynamic cognitive models to the relatively small number of trials typically observed in IAT studies; and 5. The difficulty of applying cognitive models in general.</p><p>Our approach addresses each of these issues by (1) quantifying associations between concepts (Black / White, positive / negative) in terms of a single parameter that quantifies individual differences in performance; (2) doing so using a representational similarity framework that predicts the differences in both choice and response time between conditions;</p><p>(3) leveraging data from all four conditions in order to disentangle differences in performance related to different stimuli versus differences related to experimental manipulations; (4) using hierarchical Bayesian methods for model fitting that help constrain estimates of individual-level performance on IATs even with small sample sizes; and (5) introducing a new online tool for automatically fitting the model we developed to IAT data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling approach</head><p>Our approach to modeling behavior on IATs uses a framework called the geometric similarity representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Kvam, 2019a;</ref>, which generalizes the diffusion decision model to an arbitrarily large number of interrelated choice options. The GSR has been used to model multi-alternative choice and continuous-response paradigms <ref type="bibr">(Kvam, 2019a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Kvam &amp; Busemeyer, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Kvam et al., 2023)</ref>, where it has been subjected to stringent tests like selective influence. Because IATs only feature two response options (left and right), this generalization of the diffusion model is largely conceptual, as drift rates cannot be disentangled into direction and magnitude when there are only two response options. Fortunately, the implementation of the GSR in binary choice is still conceptually richer as well as computationally convenient, sharing many advantages of the diffusion model while introducing a measure of representational similarity. The similarity metric is derived from computational linguistic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Deerwester et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Landauer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Furnas et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Goldberg &amp; Levy, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Lin, 1998)</ref>, where different concepts are represented as vectors in a multidimensional space and the similarity between concepts is a function of the angle between vectors. In doing so, it forges a formal link between these two approaches that has been suggested by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Greenwald, 2017)</ref>. We refer to this model as the geometric similarity representation extension of the diffusion decision model, GSR-DDM or simply GSR, reflecting its roots in traditional evidence accumulation models like the DDM while emphasizing its new connections to models of conceptual similarity using vector-space semantics.</p><p>The idea underlying the GSR-DDM model is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: a small angle between two concepts (&lt; 90 degrees), such as White faces and positive, indicates that two concepts are more similar. Conversely, a large angle between concepts (≥ 90 degrees), such as White faces and negative, indicates that they are dissimilar to one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Kvam, 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">P. L. Smith, 2016)</ref>. The GSR-DDM incorporates these representations of concepts to estimate the angle between (for example) a Black-White faces axis and a negative-positive valence axis as a measure of the relative similarity between the concepts from an IAT.</p><p>The similarities among concepts are then built into a model of accuracy and response time using a geometric framework developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Kvam (2019a)</ref>. This model predicts the same distributions of accuracy and response times as the diffusion model (a Wiener distribution) but disentangles drift rates into stimulus-specific factors and conceptual similarity among category responses. In this approach, a decision can be facilitated or hindered based on the similarities or associa-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>Effects of manipulating each of the parameters of GSR-DDM (except non-decision time, which simply shifts the response time distribution right or left).</p><p>tions between the options or features under consideration. As a decision-maker considers their options, their state changes over time according to the attributes or information provided by the stimulus. In the Race IAT, the visual features of an image might favor a "White" or "Black" response, moving their state upward or downward in a space like the one depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The idea motivating IATs as an implicit measure of attitudes is that the image may also carry some positive or negative valence based on a decision-maker's relatively automatic associations with those categories. In GSR-DDM, this is reflected by a smaller angle between concepts of Black (race) and negative (valence) as well as between white and positive. Compatible associations or similarities speed up the decision process by allowing both the target category and its evaluation valence to lead participants toward the same response (e.g., a "left" / L response). Conversely, incompatible associations or dissimilarities slow down the decision process by pulling decision-makers in opposing directions (similar to lateral inhibition in the LCA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001</ref>). If the evidence accumulation process crosses a category boundary associated with the target category or its partner (e.g., "Positive" or "White person" for a positive word in the congruent condition), it triggers a correct response. If it instead crosses a category boundary of one of the two other categories (e.g., a "Negative" or "Black person" response for a positive word in the congruent condition), an incorrect response is generated. By connecting these cognitive processes to the frequency of these boundary crossings, both accuracy and response time are used to estimate the parameters of the model.</p><p>The decision process for determining which choice is triggered could be described as a mutual power struggle between the responses of Black, White, positive, and negative on a Race IAT. A stimulus showing a positive word tips the balance of power in favor of the positive response, but it may also "activate" or cause the Black or White responses to muster strength according to the conceptual similarity relationships between race and valence. If they associate Black faces with positive valence, then the Black faces and positive valence responses will work in tandem, thus resulting in the fastest response times when Black faces and positive valence are paired on the same side of the screen. Conversely, the Black faces and positive word responses would engage in a direct struggle with one another when Black faces and positive words are on opposing sides of the screen, thus resulting in slower response times.</p><p>A confluence of interfering or facilitating activations is a feature present in many psychological tasks. For example, a participant in a Stroop task typically speeds up when the words and colors are aligned relative to a neutral condition where words are unrelated to colors <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Heathcote et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Lindsay &amp; Jacoby, 1994)</ref>, indicating that the presence of a facilitating word leads to faster choices. Conversely, colors that conflict with words can be influenced by lexical processing that drives decisions away from the correct responses, thus slowing people down in incompatible blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(MacLeod, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(MacLeod, , 1992</ref>). Like the Stroop task, IATs seek to measure interference or facilitation among stimuli by measuring response times. Using a model of response times that closely resembles the underlying cognitive process allows us to create more reliable and valid measures of association <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Haines et al., 2021)</ref>, enabling the GSR-DDM to substantively improve upon standard practices such as the D-score. However, to do so, its assumptions must align with the structure of the neural and cognitive mechanisms that support performance on IATs. There are a few aspects of the structure of IATs that are relevant for constructing a new model. Specifically, we make three observations about decision-making on a typical IAT:</p><p>1. Most IATs feature multiple types of stimuli, such as faces and words, which are processed at different speeds in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Heider &amp; Groner, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>2. Participants can change their decision criteria from condition to condition, either intentionally as part of a deliberate impression management or faking strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(van Nunspeet et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Röhner et al., 2013)</ref> or even unintentionally based on feedback or cues to task difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Fontanesi, Palminteri, &amp; Lebreton, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>3. Response times for correct responses are typically faster than those for incorrect category responses (which are rare). This is true even when looking at the raw mean response times, or after removing response time penalties for incorrect responses included in some scoring procedures.</p><p>The final observation may depend on the specific IAT being used, but appears common from our analyses. 4 These observations inform our modeling assumptions. Based on point (1), we use two separate drift rates for different types of stimuli, in this case words and faces. These two types of stimuli are processed in entirely separate neural circuits of the brain, with face processing occurring in the inferior temporal cortex / fusiform face area <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bentin et al., 1996)</ref> and lexical processing of written words occurring in opposite hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(McCandliss et al., 2003)</ref>. Backward masking studies have made it clear that words and faces are processed at different speeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Heider &amp; Groner, 1997)</ref>. Therefore, drift rates that are intended to capture the processing of these two types of stimuli relative to response options should naturally differ according to whether faces or words are being assigned to different categories. As we show later, this distinction in the model is vindicated by substantially higher drift rates for faces than for words across participants and conditions.</p><p>The second observation implies that participants can adjust their thresholds strategically, either trading accuracy for speed to reduce response time or taking a longer time on each choice to maintain accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Wickelgren, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Luce, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Heitz, 2014)</ref>. Accounting for this speed-accuracy tradeoff is critical to assessing performance on the IAT, and is one of the main reasons that models like multinomial processing trees (which only assess accuracy) or the D-score (which only considers response times) alone cannot provide complete accounts of performance. In GSR-DDM, changes in response caution can occur across conditions. For example, a participant concerned about appearing biased in their response times <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Schlenker, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Röhner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Röhner &amp; Ewers, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Röhner et al., 2022)</ref> might sacrifice accuracy to match their mean RTs across compatible and incompatible blocks. Allowing thresholds to vary provides the opportunity to involve explicit or conscious processes in performance on an IAT. It also indexes an element of behavior that is orthogonal to similarity (or implicit associations) but still relevant to beliefs and behaviors related to topics an IAT seeks to measure, like race, sexual orientation, age, and so on.</p><p>The final observation imposes a restriction on the modeling approach; namely, that it should be able to capture patterns of response times that are asymmetric (faster) for correct relative to incorrect responses. In the modeling approach we adopt, this is accomplished by assuming that the stimuli have random effects (R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">R. Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004)</ref>, i.e., some stimuli yield stronger signals than others. This is a common assumption in signal detection, where the strength of "signal" and "noise" stimuli each follow normal distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref>. Our measure of signal strength, the drift rate, affects both RT and choice accuracy: higher drift rates result in more correct and faster responses, while lower drift rates result in slower and fewer correct responses. The reason this is able to produce asymmetric response times is that weaker signals (lower drifts) are more likely to result in incorrect responses. As a result, incorrect responses appear to result more frequently from weak or conflicting signals, associated in the model with longer response times, as opposed to fast guesses or strong / variable prior beliefs, which are typically associated with shorter response times.</p><p>Put together, the GSR-DDM features (1) a conceptualsimilarity parameter that describes the relationships between the concepts on either side of the screen on an IAT; (2) a mean drift rate for each type of stimulus present in the study describing how fast they are processed; (3) a threshold for each condition of the study, controlling how careful a participant is relative to how quickly they wish to decide; and (4) a drift rate variability parameter describing how much variance there is in the drift rates for different stimulus sets (e.g., "positive" stimuli). The effects of each of these parameters on response times and accuracy is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The key element of GSR-DDM that enables it to account for differences in behavior between compatible and incompatible blocks on an IAT is the similarity parameter, which provides a singular measure of how a participant represents the relationship between the concepts activated by stimuli. However, the relative response times and accuracy between conditions are also affected by thresholds (how cautious a participant is) and differences in processing speed between different stimulus sets (drift rates) as well as variability within these stimulus sets from trial to trial or stimulus to stimulus (drift rate variability).</p><p>One final note is that we are using the relative-evidence choice boundary version of the GSR, where responses are made based on the balance of support between two actions (left, right) as opposed to the absolute degree of support for each of the possible categories (e.g., Black, White, good, and bad) separately. This modeling choice is similar to using a diffusion rather than an accumulator model, although these are only two among many configurations of response boundaries that are possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Kvam, 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Kvam et al., 2023</ref>). Because we only collect a limited amount of accuracy and response time data with each IAT, it would be almost impossible to tell the two approaches apart from one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Donkin et al., 2011)</ref>. However, future work looking at confidence judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Reynolds et al., 2021)</ref>, distributions of evidence collected <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Kvam et al., 2022)</ref>, neuroimaging data <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Turner et al., 2015)</ref>, or other information should shed light onto the representations of evidence during decision-making on IATs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling summary</head><p>So far, we have examined a variety of different approaches to modeling performance on IATs and enumerated their potential costs and benefits. A diagram of each of the approaches to modeling the IAT we have described is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The classical difference-score approach (left) quantifies attitudes and associations in terms of (standardized) mean differences in response times between two conditions, under the assumption that the sign and direction of this difference is proportional to a participant's degree of bias. The multinomial processing tree approach, including the Quad and ReAL models (middle left), uses accuracy on IATs to estimate the probabilities of different events happening -such as a participant's bias being being activated or overridden or a stimulus being correctly discriminated. Third, we have the diffusion decision model (center right), which quantifies both accuracy and response times within a condition in terms of the quality of incoming information (drift), response caution (threshold), bias, and non-decision processes like stimulus encoding and motor actions. Finally, we have our new geometric similarity approach (right panel), which proposes that performance across all conditions is driven by the stimulus and the degree to which it activates different category responses.</p><p>Below, we examine a model from each of these four examples. We test the D-score, Quad model, simple diffusion model, and geometric similarity / association model, examining their ability to predict important outcomes related to outgroup contact and motivation from individual-level parameter estimates.</p><p>There are clear issues we identified with the first three approaches that are addressed in the new model. First, classic scoring algorithms like the D-score, as well as the diffusion decision model, suffer from the compound variance problem, where difference scores result in much greater measurement error than single parameters alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bereiter, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Thomas &amp; Zumbo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Overall &amp; Woodward, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gardner &amp; Neufeld, 1987)</ref>. Second, the three approaches on the left all ignore valid information contained in IAT data -classic scoring algorithms ignore both accuracy and non-paired (singlecategory) conditions, multinomial processing trees ignore response time information, and the diffusion decision model ignores (or at least does not capitalize upon) non-paired conditions.</p><p>Finally, each of the models presents an impoverished view of what participants are doing on an IAT. Any model has to deal with some degree of simplification or abstraction in order to be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">(Sun, 2008)</ref>. However, ignoring processes like the speed at which different types of stimuli are processed or the degree to which participants try to disguise or control their performance across conditions omits critical information that is directly or indirectly relevant to understanding behavior. In the discussion, we revisit how the va-</p></div>

In this paper, we compare the classic scoring algorithms like the D-score (left) as well as the diffusion decision model (as it has been previously applied; center-right) and a new model based on geometric relationships among concepts involved in performance on the IAT. While we focus on comparisons between congruent (green) and incongruent (blue) conditions here, the GSR-DDM is fit to all four IAT conditions. lidity of a model interacts with its reliability and predictive power, emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling relevant psychological processes as one seeks to understand latent traits and processes from behavior.</p><p>Below, we test our new approach and its ability to reliably capture behavior on several IATs.

While future iterations may be fit to data that exclude accuracy or response time to deal with practical constraints imposed by existing datasets, the present version requires both accuracy and response time data to best estimate its parameters. Given the informativeness of both sources of data, we strongly encourage any researchers considering using IATs to record both accuracy and response timesan individual's data might not show an effect in accuracy or speed alone due to their ability to deliberately control the speed-accuracy tradeoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Reed, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Wickelgren, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Heitz, 2014)</ref>.

We focus on four main studies: two to examine the test-retest reliability of the parameters, and two to examine its ability to predict important real-world behaviors relevant to the attitudes or associations IATs seeks to measure. These studies each included 1-2 blocks of 30-40 trials in each IAT condition, with an average of 60 trials per condition -typically 40 trials per condition for non-target condition, and 80 trials per condition for congruent / incongruent condition. As is fairly common in social psychological tasks, the number of trials is lower than most dynamic decisionmaking tasks for which the diffusion model is estimated, making the hierarchical constraints we use particularly important <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Pleskac et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency and openness</head><p>The goal of this study was to evaluate performance on existing data in order to evaluate whether our modeling approach improves on current methods for analyzing IAT data. We therefore used secondary data for all of the analyses presented here.

This was done to avoid a biased data-selection process whereby data were selected that might favor the new modeling approach.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing test-retest reliability</head><p>As we outlined above, part of the issue with accurately measuring the reliability of behavioral measures is the lack of good generative models explaining how observed data are related to latent processes. Modeling processes underlying a single test session -as in the ReAL, Quad, and diffusion models -is a step in the right direction. However, there are (at least) two levels of error that enter into assessments of test-retest reliability. Modeling helps account for trial-level error, or variability in response times and accuracy that occurs within a single session. However, it does not account for session-level error, or variability in performance that naturally occurs from day to day or session to session. Properly incorporating this error into our estimates of reliability is critical to understanding how reliable our measures actually are <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Haines et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Rouder &amp; Haaf, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The approach that we took to re-assess reliability on IATs is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Rather than estimating a model separately for time points 1 and 2, we used a joint model that simultaneously fit behavior across both time points using a factor-based link <ref type="bibr">(Kvam et al., n.d.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Turner et al., 2017)</ref>. This constitutes a shift from treating behavior at each time point as a separate, independent measurement to treating behavior as two measurements of a common set of latent cognitive processes. Formally, we fit a bivariate normal distribution that specified the relationship between parameter estimates from the first session (x) and the parameter estimates for the second session (y) in terms of their means (M x and M y ), variances (V x and V y ), and covariances (Σ xy ) alongside the session-level parameters that we normally fit with these models (conceptual-similarities γ, drift rates δ, thresholds θ, non-decision times τ, and drift variabilities ν; see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). This accounts for both trial-level and session-level error, and allows us to control for these dual sources of error when estimating the test-retest reliability of our model parameters.</p><p>We tested this new approach to estimating reliability using a data set from a series of studies where participants com-pleted various implicit measures at two different timepoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>. Specifically, we re-assessed the test-retest reliability of Race and introversion-extraversion IATs administered twice over a one to two month interval. We compare this against both the D-score <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Greenwald et al., 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Greenwald et al., , 2003</ref>) and a diffusion model that is fit separately to congruent and incongruent conditions. In the original paper, the reliability of both IATs was assessed as being relatively poor, with correlations of r = .44 and .63 between IAT Dscores across the two timepoints for Race and introversionextraversion IATs, respectively. Accordingly, the findings are commonly cited as a key piece of evidence in failing to establish the validity of IATs as valid measures of relatively stable individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gawronski, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Payne et al., 2017)</ref>. In the results, we show that a re-analysis modeling the measurement relationships among latent variables and time points ultimately paints a much more favorable picture of the reliability of performance on the IAT, as well as quantifying how these parameters change (e.g., with practice) across sessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing predictive validity</head><p>In addition to reliability, we also sought to examine whether our modeling approach could provide more a valid account of behavior on IATs. By virtue of disentangling performance into multiple cognitive processes, it already improves upon the discriminant validity of previous approaches by quantifying distinct elements of performance. Likewise, modeling the underlying cognitive processes gets us closer to a complete description of performance and helps IATs align more closely with the established literature on lowerlevel perception and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(Weber &amp; Johnson, 2009)</ref>. However, much of the debate surrounding IATs has concerned their ability to predict real-world outcomes and by extension their predictive validity. To test whether the model parameters were indeed better predictors of important outcomes, we fit GSR-DDM to another secondary data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Buttrick et al., 2020)</ref> and used its estimates to predict relevant outcome measures that were related to the attitudes or associations those IATs sought to quantify. Buttrick et al. (2020) sought to compare a typical regression approach versus a structural equation modeling approaches for estimating the unique predictive validity of the IAT above and beyond analogous self-report measures. To do this, they randomly assigned participants (volunteers from the Project Implicit website; total N &gt; 14,000) to one of ten experimental conditions where they completed IATs and self-report measures whose content was manipulated to target different social groups. Although their study included 10 pairs of social groups as well as self-reported criterion measures spanning across five criterion domains, we selected two IATs that are both widely used in the extant research literature and socially relevant (Race IAT and Sexuality IAT) along with self-report</p></div>

It is widely used in the IAT literature and has been adapted to other contexts including prejudice toward gay men and lesbians. The five-item internal motivation subscale is associated with relevant outcomes in both domains, and it is especially relevant to implicit measures like the IAT because it is theorized to index a relatively automatic process.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>All of the model fits presented in the results were generated using hierarchical Bayesian methods, which estimate not only the individual-level parameters that characterize individual differences in cognitive processes but also the group-level central tendency of these parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">(Shiffrin et al., 2008)</ref>. In the next section, we examine a neural networkbased approach to fitting the model. Such an approach is more accessible in that it can be embedded into point-andclick model fitting tools, but it does not estimate the covariance across testing sessions (and thus is not as useful for estimating reliability) like the Bayesian joint model shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Therefore, we focus for now on the Bayesian methods. Bayesian analyses compute an approximate posterior distribution of parameter values, which assigns probabilities to different possible values of the parameters of the model. For simplicity and brevity, we typically report the mean value of each parameter along with the 95% highest density interval <ref type="bibr">[HDI]</ref>, which specifies the range of the 95% most likely values of each parameter. It is analogous to a confidence interval except it directly quantifies the most likely values for a parameter as opposed to quantifying the range in which we would expect them to fall if the sampling process were repeated many times, thus providing an overall more coherent and interpretable measure of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Kruschke, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Kruschke &amp; Liddell, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, these values were computed using a Gibbs sampler <ref type="bibr">(JAGS Plummer, 2003)</ref> using 4 chains of 5000 samples each, with 1000 burn-in samples per chain.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability</head><p>The results of the first study (Self-Concept / introversionextraversion IAT), Study 1a from <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gawronski et al. (2017)</ref> are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 5</ref>. The top panels show the estimates of the model parameters from the first testing session (x), compared against the estimates from the second testing session (y). There are a few key findings to note here. We discuss the mean estimates of model parameters in greater detail in the Predictive Validity section, but there are several findings specifically related to reliability. First, GSR-DDM model parameters related to the decision process -specifically, similarity, thresholds, and drift rates -showed a high degree of test-retest reliability, with all linear correlations at least .77. Non-decision time has somewhat lower reliability at only .51, but this parameter specifically indexes nondecision components of response time and is therefore not of particular theoretical interest; its lower reliability is not particularly surprising, as it is a catch-all parameter that quantifies multiple different processes like stimulus encoding and response execution.</p><p>In addition to the reliability of the parameters, we also observed that the base drift rate -indicating how well participants are able to assign words or faces to categories regardless of the associations between categories on either side of the screen -were higher in the second testing session than in the first. This is exactly what we would expect from practice effects, as participants get faster and more accurate as they do the task more. Critically, drift rates were the only parameter that changed between sessions -not similarity. This means that the model is capturing one process related to decisionmaking that is stable across time (associations) and another that improves with practice (drifts). This lends credibility to the conceptual-similarity parameter as a measure of latent associations that participants have among concepts, and suggests that the model is showing a high degree of discriminant validity by disentangling practice effects from core individual differences. This stands in contrast to unitary measures of performance like the D score or even advanced approaches like the diffusion model where associations and information processing speed are both combined into a single measure of drift.</p><p>In the model, rather than merely correlating the estimates from the first and second testing session (as in the top panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 5</ref>), we estimated the reliability of each parameter directly by estimating the variance-covariance matrix for parameter values across the two sessions. The covariance is estimated in a Bayesian way that obtains a posterior distribution describing the likelihoods of different values for the reliability given the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Haines et al., 2021)</ref>. Results from this analysis are shown in the bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 5</ref>. The approach was stricter than the simple correlations due to the Estimates of model parameters (top) and the posterior distribution of their reliability (bottom) on the introversionextraversion IAT. In the top panels, the estimated values of each parameter for the first test session (x) and second test session (y) are shown. In the bottom panels, posterior distributions of estimated test-retest reliability for each of the model parameters are shown. These are compared against the test-retest correlations of the IAT D-score (black dotted line) and the differences between congruent and incongruent conditions for drift rates (IAT ν , orange dashed line), thresholds (IAT a , purple dashed line), and non-decision time (IAT t0 , green dashed line) from a traditional diffusion model. inclusion of a prior centered at zero, and thus resulted in lower mean estimates of reliability relative to the top panels. Bayesian analyses require priors, and in all cases we strove for relatively vague ones (i.e., ones that would not favor particular conclusions a priori). However, it is clear that almost all of the model parameters -association strength Compared to the reliability of the traditional diffusion model contrasts, these reliabilities are exceptionally high, as shown by the dashed lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 5</ref>. Ironically, the raw drift rates of the diffusion model show quite high reliability (r(δ I ) = .67 and r(δ E ) = .73), as do the thresholds (r ( θ C ) = .64 and r ( θ I ) = .66). By taking the difference, their error variability is doubled and the metric becomes unreliable (r(IAT ν ) =.61, r(IAT a ) =.11, and r(IAT t0 ) =.03; colored dashed vertical lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 5)</ref>, clearly illustrating the issue of compound error in difference scores. This is exactly the reason we approached the problem using one similarity parameter to create differences between congruent and incongruent conditions as opposed to computing a contrast coefficient.</p><p>The results of the second reliability analysis using the Race IAT <ref type="bibr">(Gawronski et al., 2017, , Study 2b)</ref> are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Like the introversion-extraversion IAT, it showed relatively high reliability of the model parameters relative to the D-score. However, the reliability of the similarity parameter (M(r γ ) = .56, 95% HDI = [.55, .58]) and the drift parameters (Faces: M(r δ F ) = .55, 95% HDI = [.40, .69]; Words: M(r δ W ) = .52, 95% HDI = [.37, .67] was somewhat lower than in the introversion-extraversion IAT analysis. The difference in association strength reliability appears to stem primarily from smaller overall variance of the estimates. That is, people appear to have less variability in their associations between race and positive/negative words than they do between their representations of self/others and particular traits.</p><p>Conversely, the test-retest reliability of the threshold parameters in this study was much higher (M(θ) = .86, 95% HDI = [.82, .93]). Even if participants behavior in terms of information processing was more variable, the level of caution they implemented across testing sessions was highly consistent, to the point of being comparable to the reliability of some trait-level measures. As in the introversion-extraversion IAT, these reliabilities substantially out-performed the D-score (r D = .46) and were on par or greater than the reliability of mean response times (r RT = .55).</p><p>The test-retest reliability of nondecision time was highly uncertain, M(r τ ) = .46 (95% HDI = [−.49, .99]), preventing any clear conclusions regarding the reliability of this parameter. As before though, the most important parameters out-performed the diffusion model contrasts (r(IAT ν ) =.53, r(IAT a ) =.07, and r(IAT t0 ) =.19; colored dashed lines in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Also as before, the diffusion model could reach higher reliability by foregoing contrasts, as the individual condition drift rates had fairly high reliability (r(δ F ) =.70 and r(δ W ) =.69) as did the thresholds (r(θ C ) =.54 and r(θ I ) =.51).</p><p>A particularly interesting finding related to the drift rates is that the face stimuli (M(µ F ) = 3.34, 95% HDI = [3.07, 3.62]) appeared to be processed faster than the words</p></div>

In the top panels, the estimate values of each parameter for the first test session (x) and second test session (y) are shown.

These are compared against the test-retest correlations of the IAT D-score (black dotted line) and the test-retest correlation of differences between congruent and incongruent conditions for drift rates (IAT ν , orange dashed line), thresholds (IAT a , purple dashed line), and non-decision time (IAT t0 , green dashed line) from a traditional diffusion model.

Holistic visual processing of images is often found to be an efficient process relative to serial or lexical processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Richler &amp; Gauthier, 2014)</ref>, so this appears to reflect real differences that we might have expected a priori. We elaborate on this finding further in the latter part of the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive validity</head><p>It is clear from the reliability analyses that the test-retest reliability of the GSR-DDM model parameters exceeds that of simple metrics of performance like the D-score. In theory, this should translate to greater predictive validity. Observed correlations between constructs r xy are determined by both the "true" relationship between the constructs (ρ xy ) as well as the reliability of the predictor(s) r xx and the reliability of the outcome r yy . As a result, if we can improve the reliability of our predictor (r xx ), we should be able to better predict any outcome (y) provided the true relationship between predictor and outcome does not change by using a slightly different version of our predictor (x). Put simply, being better able to measure individual differences in cognitive processes should mean that we can better predict other outcomes.</p><p>For both studies, GSR-DDM was fit in a hierarchical Bayesian way as in the previous studies. It included nine total free parameters: baseline drift for face stimuli, baseline drift for word stimuli, an association parameter indexing the relative degree of association between White/Straight or Black/Gay and positive or negative words, four thresholds for the four conditions, a drift variability parameter to account for slow errors, and the non-decision time. These nine parameters were used as predictors of internal motivation and contact outcomes, and compared against the D-score (a single predictor) as well as the difference scores from the diffusion model (IAT ν , IAT a , and IAT t0 ) and the parameters of the Quad model. The GSR-DDM having more parameters makes it more complex, but ultimately serves as a benefit to the model as a whole by indexing multiple cognitive processes that can predict real-world outcomes. For example, a desire to manage one's impressions could appear as differences in either θ C or θ I , which may predict responses on an explicit self-report, while differences in similarity γ may predict behavioral or self-report outcomes that cannot be as easily controlled through impression management <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Röhner &amp; Ewers, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fit</head><p>There are several ways to assess predictive validity of the GSR-DDM model parameters relative to the D-score. If we simply look at total variance in the outcomes that each one can account for, the GSR-DDM is the clear winner (middle column of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. However, in some cases the GSR-DDM may perform better simply because it is more complex (more parameters and thus more predictors). To control for greater number of predictors in GSR-DDM, we penalized model fit for each parameter used to predict outcomes. We tested two different metrics that favor models with fewer predictors: a classical measure called Adjusted R 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Shieh, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b223">Yin &amp; Fan, 2001</ref>) and a Bayesian measure called the deviance information criterion <ref type="bibr">[DIC]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Spiegelhalter et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Even after applying the correction to the model fit indices, GSR-DDM still out-performed the D-score, Quad model, and diffusion contrasts on nearly every outcome measure, as shown in the DIC and Adjusted R 2 columns of Table 1. The only model to ever edge out the GSR-DDM, the Quad model, did so only on one metric (Adjusted R 2 ), and was inferior to the GSR-DDM when predicting every other outcome. Note that lower DIC scores indicate better predictive validity, with differences of at least 10 between models indicating strong support for the better-performing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Spiegelhalter et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Schwarz, 1978)</ref>. GSR-DDM exceeds this criterion relative to the D score in all but one of the outcome measures (Contact on the Race IAT), where it only improves the DIC by 2. Overall, GSR-DDM shows clearly superior performance relative to the D-score, as well as the simple diffusion model and Quad model, in predicting contact and motivation outcomes.</p><p>It is also worth examining which model parameters pull the most weight when predicting the outcomes of interest. The estimates of the relationship between the motivation and contact outcomes (for the Race and Sexuality IAT) and each model parameter, as well as the D-score, Quad model parameters, and the three diffusion model contrast scores, are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. The conceptual-similarity parameter was most strongly related to each outcome, which is intuitive given it was designed specifically to quantify the similarity among cognitive representations of race, sexuality, and valence (positive / negative). In fact, this parameter alone out-performed the D-score, Quad parameters, and diffusion contrasts on almost every outcome measure. There are only two exceptions, which are the D (discriminability) parameter in the Quad model for Race-Motivation outcome and the Dscore for the Sexuality-Contact outcome. Critically, although the improvement in prediction moving from the D-score to the similarity parameter is consistent, the small overall improvement in predictive power with this parameter alone is complemented by significant predictive power arising from the other parameters in the GSR-DDM such as the thresholds. Together, the parameters of the GSR-DDM constitute a considerable step up from the other existing models, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Those interested in a more "process-pure" measure of similarity than the D-score need look no further than the similarity parameter, which contains less noise / error due to GSR-DDM's ability to disentangle associations from effects related to thresholds, drift rates, and other parameters. These findings suggest that the strength of the model is not only its greater number of estimable predictors, although this is certainly a strength in terms of discriminant validity, but it can also isolate the impact of associations from those of other cognitive processes involved in performance on IATs.</p><p>In addition to the conceptual-similarity parameter, the threshold for the incompatible block trials (e.g., with Gay people+positive vs. Straight people+negative) adds considerable predictive power. It seems that participants who set higher thresholds in this condition had lower motivation and contact scores. This could be because participants are trying to manage their impressions in these conditions and avoid bias-indicative mistakes by lengthening their response times, as with participants who try to fake their IAT scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Röhner et al., 2013)</ref>. It could also be that participants who are more biased are simply attuned to the fact that this condition could be more difficult or more sensitive, and adjust their thresholds based on this perceived difficulty. In either case, it is clear that both similarity / interference and response caution in the face of bias-induced conflict (measured by threshold adjustment) are predictive of participants' interactions with minoritized group members (the majority of whom form an outgroup to participants).</p><p>Beyond these parameters, there are remaining significant correlations between base drift rates and motivation / contact outcomes. These positive correlations indicate that participants who generally performed better on an IAT (were more accurate, made faster responses) also reported more internal motivation to be unbiased as well as more prior contact with outgroup members. Drift rates have been increasingly viewed as global measures of neural processing speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Schubert et al., 2019)</ref> and intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Lerche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">van Ravenzwaaij, Brown, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2011)</ref>, indicating perhaps that more intelligent or better educated participants tend to be less biased in their behaviors toward others. This interpretation is consistent with findings that executive functioning is associated with smaller IAT effects and less explicit bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Klauer et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Ito et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Put together, the conceptual-similarity parameter alone provides an incremental advantage over existing approaches. Even if we were to ignore all other parameters entirely, this would be a small victory for the GSR-DDM. However, when we consider the other parameters of the model and the predictive power that they confer over and above similarity, alongside the conceptual benefits of disentangling these cognitive processes, the result overwhelmingly supports the GSR-DDM on every outcome and data set we have tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterizing the model outcomes</head><p>Given that this is the first time this type of model has been applied to such large IAT data sets, it is prudent to investigate the patterns of GSR-DDM parameter estimates for each data set. This can help us understand more about issues related to biases that exist in large populations, how participants perform with different stimuli, and how they generally shift their thresholds across conditions. It is rare that dynamic cognitive models are fit to such a huge data set, as typical experiments encompass only a few participants for thousands of trials each rather than thousands of participants for a few trials each. The use of hierarchical Bayesian ap-proaches for model fitting were therefore particularly important here <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">(Shiffrin et al., 2008)</ref>, as each participant only had a few trials from which to estimate their parameters.</p><p>Once the model is fit, we can explore the group-level distributions of estimates for each parameter to ensure (a) that these distributions are sensible with respect to what they are theorized to measure, and (b) to explore any patterns in the data that allow us insights about the population. In general, the approach we used for model fitting appears to have turned up sensible results, indicating that the GSR-DDM is capturing realistic patterns of individual differences. Distributions of model parameter estimates across individuals for the Race IAT in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Buttrick et al. (2020)</ref> are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. For each of the parameters we discuss, we report the mean group-level estimate (best estimate of the population mean) and the 95% highest density interval [HDI] on this mean. This means that the 95% HDI is not describing the distribution of individuallevel estimates, which are shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 7 and 8</ref>, but the uncertainty about their central tendency. Because of the immense volume of data in both experiments, these HDIs are very thin. Any comparisons between conditions with nonoverlapping intervals will be significant by essentially any classical or Bayesian inferential test.</p><p>There are a few key findings here to note. First, most people are biased toward pro-White / anti-Black associations, on average. A total of 71.97% of conceptual-similarity parameter estimates lie above zero (M(γ) = .10, 95% HDI = [.09, .10]), indicating a greater similarity between White people and positive / Black people and negative than Black people and positive / White people and negative. This is consistent with findings based on the D score <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Greenwald et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Nosek, 2007)</ref> as well as simpler metrics like mean response times <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Greenwald et al., 1998)</ref> and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Calanchini &amp; Sherman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Calanchini et al., 2014)</ref>. Out of an abundance of caution on our part, the priors for the association parameter were actually centered at zero. This means that the model likely slightly underestimated the group-level mean of the association parameter, although with over 14,000 participants, this underestimation should be negligible. Regardless, the model reproduces the classic bias findings related to race, although it does not make any claims about whether these associations or biases are "implicit" or "automatic" in any of the ways in which that term has been used <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gawronski et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Moors &amp; De Houwer, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>As in the reliability experiment, the drift rates for faces (M(δ Faces = 3.62, 95% HDI = [3.53, 3.68]) were higher than the drift rates for word stimuli (M(δ Words = 3.43, <ref type="bibr">95% HDI = [3.34,</ref><ref type="bibr">3.49]</ref>). This appears to reflect greater processing speed for stimuli that are processed holistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Richler &amp; Gauthier, 2014)</ref>, and emphasizes the importance of differentiating between types of stimuli that can be presented from trial to trial in IATs.</p><p>The model does suggest that people have at least some</p></div>

It appears that people are more careful when they know race is involved in their choices, either because they are aware of their biases or because they know that their decisions during the IAT are meant to reflect self-relevant evaluative information with respect to a sensitive topic. Estimations of non-decision time across participants resulted in a wide distribution of individual differences, characterized by a mean estimate of M(τ) = 345ms (95% HDI = <ref type="bibr">[344,</ref><ref type="bibr">346]</ref>). The drift rate variability indicating trial-to-trial differences in stimulus processing speed showed a relatively modest degree of drift variability with a mean of M(ν) = 0.53 (95% HDI = [0.51, 0.57]).</p><p>The distributions of parameter estimates for the Sexuality IAT are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, and share many patterns of results with the Race IAT distributions. Participants in this task were slightly less biased in terms of the distribution of their conceptual-similarity parameters, with 69.30% of participants showing a Gay people/negative and Straight people/positive association (M(γ) = .08, 95% HDI = [.07, .09]). They showed slightly faster processing for valence words (M(δ Valence = 2.77, 95% HDI = [2.74, 2.80]) than for sexuality words (M(δ Sexuality = 2.32, 95% HDI = [2.29, 2.34]). There are several reasons this could be the case. For example, the valence words might be shorter, more common, or otherwise faster to encode or recover their meaning as in the introversion-extraversion IAT reported in the Reliability sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">(Scarborough et al., 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Polich &amp; Donchin, 1988</ref>  <ref type="bibr">2.42, 2.47]</ref>). This indicates that they had some feeling or knowledge that the incompatible block would be more difficult and, consequently, exercised greater caution and exerted more control (higher thresholds) when sexuality associations were being tested in those blocks of the IAT. Put together, both IATs indicate that performance is driven by both differences in conceptual similarity and in proactive response caution. It may</p></div>

Accounting for both clearly improves the reliability of IATs, making modeling all the more important to interpreting performance on the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An automated modeling tool</head><p>Despite the benefits of the modeling approach we have outlined above, modeling approaches like these remain enigmatic to many researchers. We suspect this will be a major barrier to its widespread use. While most solutions to this problem center around systemic issues like quantitative and computational training, it is also possible for modelers to make their models more accessible to a wide audience. We seek to accomplish this by using a new approach to modeling using neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Radev, Mertens, Voss, Ardizzone, &amp; Köthe, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Radev et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Lueckmann et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Gutmann &amp; Corander, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Fengler et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cranmer et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Sokratous et al., 2022)</ref>. In this approach, rather than requiring a user to use a modeler's code to re-run their model on a new data set, a modeler instead trains a neural network to map input data (e.g., accuracy and response times) onto the most likely parameter estimates. This is made possible by the capacity of neural networks to approximate functional relationships, such as the relationship between model parameters and behavioral data (see the Universal Approximation Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cybenko, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Zhou, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>We implemented the GSR-DDM model in this way by training it to map behavior on an IAT onto the parameters of the model. A diagram of the approach is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  9</ref>. First, a modeler simulates a large volume of data from the model they want to fit -in our case, we used 100,000 simulated "participants." Each simulated participant has a true underlying set of 9 model parameters, including the similarity parameter γ; two drift rates δ A and δ B signifying different types of stimuli; four thresholds θ A (first binary condition), θ B (second binary condition), θ C (congruent condition), and θ I (incongruent condition); non-decition time τ; and drift variability ν. For a specific combination of these parameters, we can simulate a simulated participant's performance on the IAT, including 40-60 response times in each of the four conditions. This allows us to understand how the values of the model parameters are related to behavior -the neural network is designed to invert the simulation process by taking observed behavior and mapping it backward onto model parameters. It is enabled by using a large volume of simulated Diagram of the structure of the neural network fitting approach. During training, data is simulated from the model and used to teach the network the relationship between observed IAT data (response times, accuracy) and underlying model parameters. Once trained, real IAT data can be fed into the network so as to obtain appropriate parameter estimates for that data set. participants with known values for the different parameters, which is used to train the network.</p><p>The data set of 100,000 simulated participants was created by randomly varying the values of the 9 parameters and drawing a new data set (performance on an IAT) for each combination. The values of the parameters were each drawn from a distribution as specified below. The distribution from which each of these parameters is drawn essentially constitutes a prior distribution for the network over what it considers to be reasonable parameter values, as the relative frequency of parameter values in the training set will bias the values that the network produces. In extreme cases where there is no data, the network will simply predict the mean of this training distribution -as we would like, as the grouplevel mean is the best estimate one can give in absence of individual-level data. We chose the following values to simulate data from, based in part on the posterior estimates from the predictive validity study above:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">γ ∼ Beta(3, 3) δ A ∼ Gamma(4, .8) δ B ∼ Gamma(4, .8) θ A ∼ Gamma(5, .75) θ B ∼ Gamma(5, .75) θ C ∼ Gamma(5, .75) θ I ∼ Gamma(5, .75) τ ∼ Gamma(1.5, .25) ν ∼ Gamma(1.5, .5) (1)</formula><p>The data was fed into the network by summarizing the response time distribution in terms of 5 quantiles (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90%) for correct and incorrect responses in each condition and the accuracy in each condition, for a total of 44 inputs (5 quantiles × 4 conditions × 2 correct/incorrect + 4 accuracies). If there were no incorrect responses, zeros were passed for the incorrect quantiles. For example, if there were 40 responses in each condition of an IAT and all responses were correct, we would take the 4th, 12th, 20th, 28th, and 36th fastest responses in that condition as inputs to the network along with five 0s for the incorrects and 1.0 as the accuracy. These quantiles and accuracy statistics allowed us to summarize performance on an IAT in a way that was sufficient to identify different values of the model parameters. We also tried versions of the network where we fed in all 160 (for 40 trials / condition) or 240 (for 60 trials / condition), but this approach would not work if there was any missing data. We also tried versions where a kernel density estimator was passed over the response times to approximate a probability density function <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">(Turner &amp; Sederberg, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Holmes, 2015)</ref> before passing the probability densities as inputs to the network, but performance was no better than the current approach.</p><p>The structure of the neural network was designed to condense the information in the IAT data down into information in the parameters. To do so, it helps to have multiple layers decreasing in size, allowing the network to iteratively condense its representation of the inputs into ones that are closer in dimensionality to the outputs (W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Jin et al., 2021)</ref>. Specifically, we decreased the size of each successive hidden layer by 50-75% <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">(Walczak &amp; Cerpa, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Stathakis, 2009)</ref>, going from 44 to 25, 15, and then 9 nodes in each layer, with the final layer feeding into a regression layer to predict the generative model parameters. We tested deeper (more layers) and wider (more nodes per layer) up to 100 nodes × 5 layers, but there was not a substantial improvement in network performance with either of these manipulations. Fewer nodes often decreased performance, so although they improved fitting time, we persevered with the original network structure.</p><p>In addition to the 100,000 simulated data sets used to train the network, we generated an additional 100,000 simulated data sets that were used as a validation data set. The trained network was fit to these simulated data as an out-of-sample prediction, allowing us to check for overfitting and other issues that can arise with neural network-based approaches. For the training and validation sets, we estimated the parameters based on each set of inputs and compared predicted parameters from the neural network to the true parameters that were used to generate the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A comparison between the true and estimated parameters for both the training set (blue) and the validation set (orange) is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>. In general, the recovery of the true parameters was excellent for both the training set and validation set, with non-decision time and similarity slightly worse than the other parameters. There was no difference for any parameters between estimation for the training set and estimation for the validation sets, indicating that the network is free of overfitting. Therefore, we only report the correlation between true and estimated parameters in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>.</p><p>The performance of the network in recovering known parameter values provides evidence of both the model's ability to be recovered (a non-trivial component of model design) and the neural network's ability to carry out the parameter estimation. Fundamentally, it means that if the model nearly enough approximates the true structure of the cognitive processes underlying performance on an IAT, it should be able to capture the values of these processes with reasonable fidelity. Since there were no issues with out-of-sample prediction, we expect it might work well even for a slightly misspecified model.</p><p>Although it does well at recovering known parameters, many readers may be more concerned that the network-based estimation process lines up with other methods of estimating the model, such as the hierarchical Bayesian approach we used above. To test this, we fit the same data from the predictive validity studies above -the Race IAT and Sexuality IAT from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Buttrick et al., 2020</ref>) -using the neural network. We then compared the resulting estimates against those from the hierarchical Bayesian approach.</p><p>The results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> as correlations between standardized (z-scored) parameter values. Because the scale of a model is fixed by the value of the diffusion rate and the step size used to approximate the diffusion process, the parameters will not necessarily be on the same scalehence the standardization. In general, the two modeling approaches lined up fairly well, with all correlations around .5 or higher. Note that both methods are good at estimating the true parameters, in that they recover known values from simulations. However, they both have imperfect correlations with the true values, meaning that both the predictors (e.g., Bayesian estimates) and predicted values (e.g., neural network estimates) shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> have noise. As a result, the correlation between models is lower than the correlation between a model and the true parameter values. Specifically, there is a natural upper limit to how well they can correspond to one another, which is how well they can correspond to themselves (i.e., the reliability). Therefore, we computed both the linear correlation r between network-based and Bayesian (MCMC)-based fitting approaches as well as the corrected correlation ρ. These are shown in the top-left and the bottom-right of each panel, respectively.</p><p>In general, we have found that comparisons between hierarchical Bayesian and neural network-based approaches to model fitting result in relative parity between the two ap-proaches. The major difference is the hierarchical Bayesian approach tends to induce some shrinkage, drawing estimates closer to the group-level mean compared to the neural network estimates. We leave the question of whether this is desirable to the user, but note that it often results in slightly lower correlations between true and estimated parameters (i.e., slightly worse recovery) for the hierarchical Bayesian approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Availability</head><p>The estimates from the neural network appear to correspond well to both true values (recovery) and estimates from a hierarchical Bayesian fitting approach. However, much of its value is in its ability to immediately fit the data. In terms of fitting time, the hierarchical Bayesian model takes 2-4 hours combined to fit the two Buttrick data sets, which is reasonable given the hierarchical constraints on over 3700 participants. By comparison, the neural network takes about 15 seconds. This speed-up is typical of neural network approaches, which we have found to be on the order of 500-1000 times for large data sets.</p><p>Because the trained neural network operates so quickly, it is possible to embed it within online tools for model fitting. Using MATLAB Compiler, we created a downloadable application that allows users to upload their data, estimate the model parameters, visualize the results, and save the resulting parameter estimates for each participant in their data set. This app is available as an executable on the OSF page for this paper at osf.io/znsfb. We strongly urge users to follow the instructions in the readme file before using it on their own data, and to be sure to inspect the resulting estimates -and ideally compare them to estimates from a hierarchical Bayesian implementation -to ensure they are sensible before using them in any subsequent analyses.</p><p>Our hope is that by making a simple point-and-click web app for model fitting these tools will become more widespread. The use of computational modeling has the potential to make IATs much more effective measurement tasks and, as we show above, shows clear promise in terms of improving their reliability and predictive validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we introduced three main innovations. First, we developed a model of performance on the IAT (GSR-DDM) that put together cutting-edge models of decisionmaking and similarity representation. This model teased apart conceptual similarity -arguably the construct that the IAT is designed to measure -from processing speeds for different stimuli, control processes related to response caution, and processes like stimulus encoding that each also make contributions to behavior on the IAT. In doing so, it allows for a more in-depth and complete understanding of what partici-</p></div>

This approach allows us to characterize both individual differences in performance (e.g., similarity representations) alongside group-level trends (e.g., differences in response caution between conditions, general tendencies toward anti-Black mental representations), as well as to estimate the covariance and uncertainty in performance across multiple testing sessions. By virtue of using hierarchical Bayesian estimation, we did not require the large volume of data that other dynamic modeling approaches do <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Röhner &amp; Lai, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Klauer et al., 2007)</ref>. As a result, this model is widely applicable to the deep IAT literature whose foundation is built on traditional paradigms with only 60 total trials for the compatible or incompatible conditions (and only 20 or 40 per testing block within each condition), rather than restricting our inferences to a limited set of specific data sets featuring a large number of trials or heavy time pressure to induce mistakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Calanchini &amp; Sherman, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we developed a neural-network implementation of the model, which sped up the fitting process by nearly 1000 times over and allowed it to be embedded within a freely-available web app. We showed that this approach consistently arrived on the true underlying parameters in a model recovery study, and that it arrived at similar estimates to the hierarchical Bayesian approach on the two large <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Buttrick et al. (2020)</ref> data sets.</p><p>Put together, the modeling and estimation approaches allow us to reliably quantify performance on the IAT in terms of the processes we are trying to measure, use these measures to better predict real-world outcomes like contact with people from minoritized social groups, and made it possible to use these approaches without requiring extensive training on computational modeling or coding. As an added bonus, the model conferred insights that would not be possible without the modeling. For example, participants appear to be more careful when completing trials during the incompatible block (higher thresholds), which would produce weaker IAT effects while being undetectable when using purely response timebased measures.</p><p>Our results suggest that the "reliability paradox" <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Hedge et al., 2018)</ref> and parallel criticisms of the IAT as an unreliable method for capturing individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Banse et al., 2001)</ref> are largely a matter of measurement. The D-score and other simple metrics that attempt to summarize the richness of behavior with a single metric naturally miss many psychologically meaningful aspects of task performance. These metrics, as well as contrast-based measures of individual differences like between-condition parameter differences from the diffusion model, contain a large amount of noise when compared to GSR-DDM parameters, and thus provide a highly impoverished view of individual-level behaviors that go into generating IAT data (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Vadillo et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct validity and selective influence</head><p>One of the major reasons that the new model presented here was able to out-perform other approaches is that it quantifies behavior in terms of more (meaningful) psychological</p></div>

In other words, it appears to have greater discriminant validity than other accounts of behavior. To truly test whether the model parameters index separable psychological and cognitive processes, we also examined the correlations among GSR-DDM model parameters. The results are provided in Appendix A. In short, the two drift rates are highly correlated in both the Race and Sexuality IATS, likely corresponding to a domain-general measure of processing speed or intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Lerche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Schubert et al., 2015)</ref>. This provides convergent validity for the drift rates, as correlations among within-person drifts across tasks and conditions is something we should expect to find in any study <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Schubert et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>There are otherwise only weak correlations among model parameters, suggesting that they describe distinct compo-nents of performance on IATs. In particular, the conceptualsimilarity parameter that is central to the GSR-DDM was unrelated to any other parameters. Put together with the finding that conceptual-similarity has the greatest predictive validity of any of the model parameters, it is clear that it is a critical component of the model and an element of performance that ought to be delineated from other contributions to performance like response caution. Overall, the model exhibits a high degree of discriminant validity across its different parameters, reinforcing the proposition that there are many components of behavior on the IAT that ought to be differentiated in a valid model. Fortunately, there seems to be sufficient evidence of discriminant validity and its separability from other model parameters, as shown in Appendix A. This evidence is com-pounded by common-sense observations about most of the model parameters: drift rates (but not conceptual-similarity) increases over time reflecting practice effects, drifts for words vs faces differs in the expected direction, parameter recovery is consistently successful for each of the estimation methods we examined, and the conceptual-similarity parameter is restricted to affect performance only in the pairedresponse conditions (and in fact is the only parameter that can capture positive covariance between speed and accuracy in these conditions!) yet the model accounts well for performance in these conditions.</p><p>It is important to note that the restrictions we placed on the parameters, and which ones change across conditions, is critical to interpreting them. Both base drifts and conceptual-similarity are parameters that ultimately feed into drift rates to create the (statistical) Wiener distribution of response times. This means that it is not possible to allow them both to vary freely across conditions, as a completely unrestricted model would not be identifiable -in the same way that a diffusion model without the within-trial noise (or some other) parameter would not have a fixed scale. Note that this confusion only occurs for binary choice paradigms: these parameters are clearly distinguishable and uniquely identifiable continuous-response or multi-alternative choice, where drift magnitude and drift direction correspond to base drift and conceptual similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Kvam et al., 2023)</ref>. Future work could explore the formation and change of attitudes and conceptual-similarity using paradigms like reinforcement learning, where participants learn an association between stimuli and valence (or two stimulus features) and then take an IAT where performance is quantified using the GSR-DDM. There is some evidence that it is at least theoretically possible to induce secondary associations with unconscious conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Greenwald &amp; De Houwer, 2017)</ref>. If the experimental paradigm induces a strong enough association, then we should expect it to show up in estimates of γ in such a task. This type of study is a substantial undertaking and well outside the scope of the current paper, but we look forward to future work exploring this possibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications of GSR-DDM for the IAT's "implicitness"</head><p>As noted throughout this paper, the ongoing <ref type="bibr">(and, generally, unexamined)</ref> assumption that a participant's responses on the IAT map directly onto something "implicit" has led us into conceptual confusion. It is important to remember that the IAT is a measurement procedure and does not have a one-to-one relationship to the psychological construct of "implicit bias" <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gawronski et al., 2022)</ref>. Further, it is important for researchers to state in what way they mean that something is implicit <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Corneille &amp; Hütter, 2020)</ref>. Recently, a consensus appears to be building that the conceptual focus of implicitness is more usefully organized around intentionality rather than awareness which, arguably, was the pri-mary focus for the first two decades of research using the IAT (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">De Houwer &amp; Boddez, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Dovidio &amp; Kunst, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Krajbich, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Melnikoff &amp; Kurdi, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Olson &amp; Gill, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">K. A. Ratliff &amp; Smith, 2022)</ref>. Although GSR-DDM does make substantial progress in quantifying conceptualsimilarity and its role on IATs, it does not speak fully to the "implicit" (e.g., automatic, unconscious, unintentional) nature of the IAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Corneille &amp; Hütter, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gawronski et al., 2022)</ref>. Traditionally, thresholds (θ) have been thought of as processes that are under the control of the decision maker (R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>, as they describe the level of caution a person takes. Thresholds are thought to vary across blocks, so that participants can set them strategically based on the directions they are given, but not from trial to trial based on the stimuli they see. These thresholds are often described as "sticky" because they cannot be adjusted quickly with learning, directions, or even incentives <ref type="bibr">(Larson &amp; Hawkins, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Fontanesi, Gluth, et al., 2019)</ref>. A participant would almost certainly have to strategically set their threshold higher in the incompatible condition for the model to detect an effect, given the limited number of trials on most IATs. Whether or not a participant will explicitly admit to having a bias, many participants clearly recognize that the incongruent condition will be more difficult for them and set their thresholds accordingly.</p><p>Even without assuming that changes in thresholds are driven by changes in strategy, we can at least say that observing a threshold shift should increase our belief that participants are aware of or control their performance between conditions. Specifically, if we want to make an inference about the likelihood of participants being aware (strategically shifting their thresholds, Pr(strategic)) based on an observed change in the threshold ∆θ, we can use Bayes rule to update our beliefs:</p><p>Pr(strategic | ∆θ) = Pr(∆θ| strategic) • Pr(strategic) Pr <ref type="bibr">(∆θ)</ref> . A threshold change should signal awareness by increasing the strength of our beliefs in strategic manipulation from the prior (Pr(strategic)) to the posterior (Pr(strategic | ∆θ)) whenever Pr(∆θ | strategic) &gt; Pr(∆θ). In essence, a threshold change indicates strategic manipulation of choice strategy so long as thresholds are more likely to change when participants are strategically manipulating them. Given the deep literature showing that participants successfully strategically manipulate their thresholds under instructions to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Wickelgren, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Pew, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Heitz, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">R.

Detecting a difference in thresholds when participants are deliberately changing their strategies, Pr(∆θ | strategic), can be expected to occur much more often than spontaneous differences in thresholds, Pr(∆θ), ultimately providing strong support for strategic manipulation when threshold changes are detected. We can therefore infer, based on the available evidence, that participants exhibiting this effect are likely to be deliberately changing their strategies between congruent and incongruent conditions.</p><p>Based on this evidence, the differences we observe between conditions in thresholds (e.g., highest in incompatible blocks) should correspond to biases for which participants have some level of awareness. Previous research estimating similar threshold parameters used the literature on "faking" IAT task performance as their starting point <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Röhner &amp; Ewers, 2016)</ref>. Behavior on the IAT is less controllable than responses to analogous self-report measures (e.g., thermometer ratings), but participants can "fake" their IAT scores, at least under some conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Fiedler &amp; Bluemke, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Kim, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Steffens, 2004)</ref>. The most straightforward method for faking IAT scores is a combination of consciously slowing down during the compatible blocks and speeding up during the incompatible blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cvencek et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Fiedler &amp; Bluemke, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Röhner et al., 2013)</ref>. Accordingly, the response caution parameter from the diffusion model is especially relevant to identifying faking behavior. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Röhner &amp; Ewers, 2016)</ref> used a simplified diffusion model and found that participants who were instructed to fake their IAT performance -with or without being given explicit directions as to how -showed greater response caution on the incompatible block trials. Likewise, our findings indicated that the threshold parameter was relevant primarily for the incompatible trials.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that response caution was affected by intentions to fake IAT scores, people with less prior contact with minoritized group members had higher thresholds for the incompatible trials on the Race and Sexuality IATs, respectively. Yet, people with greater internal motivation to respond without prejudice actually had a lower incompatible threshold for the Sexuality IAT. The most coherent explanation for this is that people with an intrinsic motivation to respond without prejudice are successful at doing so -that is, they wind up having fewer negative associations with minoritized groups and thus a lower similarity parameter (close to zero), as shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. As a result, there is less of a need to "fake" performance on the Sexuality IAT by increasing their thresholds on incongruent trials, and thus lower thresholds for Motivation on these trials compared to other participants who know they might be biased and have difficulty with this condition <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. Conversely, a similar effect did not occur for the Race IAT, indicating that internal motivation to control prejudice may not confer the same advantage across all target social groups. Given that the Race IAT and implicit race bias are the focal point of Project Implicit where these data were collected <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(Xu et al., 2014)</ref>, people who are more motivated to control racial prejudice may set relatively higher thresholds because they recognize how important the incompatible pairings are in the context of Project Implicit. Accordingly, they exercise additional response caution that puts them more in line with people with lower motivation, albeit for different reasons.</p><p>Although thresholds are typically deliberately controlled, it is less clear whether drift and similarity in the model are driven by features of the stimulus or by an underlying attitude. It may be the case that participants are aware of their own biases that are measured by the association parameter, but unable to control them when elicited via the IAT, or it could be that they simply do not know that they hold these negative associations. For those participants who shifted their threshold in the incongruent condition, we can be more certain that they are aware of the bias on some level. That is, if it is unimportant for a person to appear unprejudiced, then they should have no reason to go through the trouble of implementing a strategy that makes their IAT scores indicate less bias. Of note, the apparent presence of bias, and participants' apparent knowledge of them illustrated by the threshold shifts, does not necessarily mean that participants will be able to use explicit measures to report on the biases that the model captures. This issue of whether one is (or can be made) aware of the mental contents and/or processes indexed by the IAT (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Hahn et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gawronski et al., 2022)</ref> has been an exceptionally thorny one over the years, in part because the answer may depend on how one defines the terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hahn &amp; Goedderz, 2020)</ref>. Methodical examination of the threshold parameter in GSR-DDM may add productively to this conversation.</p><p>Finally, although the positive correlation between IATs and parallel explicit measures of attitudes is well-established <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Nosek, 2007)</ref>, there is mounting evidence that the overlap is more substantial than previously thought when researchers account for measurement error and ensure that explicit measures provide adequate coverage of the attitudinal domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blanton et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Schimmack, 2021)</ref>. Therefore, it is especially valuable to develop modeling approaches that can provide additional insight into the automatic versus controlled processes underlying the IAT. In this case, our approach provided unique insights by GSR-DDM's ability to not only isolate clearly distinguishable parameters that should be controllable or uncontrollable, but also to use the parameters to directly predict multiple explicit outcome measures. By doing so, we opened another avenue for generating new hypotheses for future research; specifically, future work should aim to identify the specific factors that cause response caution to function differently across people and IAT content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative approaches</head><p>We assumed that the effect of similarity is additive with those of the stimulus in terms of determining drift, and can speed up decision-making in cases where the similarities facilitate a particular response in addition to slowing them down when the similarities are incompatible. However, it may be the case that the total information processing capacity (i.e., our overall ability to update our beliefs over time) is restricted to the point where these similarities cannot be processed in parallel to the target categorization task, or where the overall drift is a dilution of target categorization + similarities. This would mean that the influence of similarities would be limited in how they could intrude on the choice that someone is trying to make. In such a case, even positive similarities might not help information processing because attention would be split between the target task and the similarities between stimuli and irrelevant categories. Put differently, it may be that drift for the target decision (good-bad, or Black-White in the Race IAT) shares a fixed capacity with similarity-driven beliefs (good-bad). One way to resolve this question would be to identify clear facilitation effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Lindsay &amp; Jacoby, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Heathcote et al., 1991)</ref>, which would directly contradict an interference-only explanation for performance.</p><p>Another important consideration is the ability of the model and experimental paradigm to disentangle positive attitudes toward one category from negative attitudes toward the opposing category. Here, we have treated race, introversion-extraversion, and sexuality each as a single dimension with the categories represented as polar opposites (e.g., Black is opposite White in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Given that Black people are not actually the opposite of White people nor straight people the opposite of gay people, the model's setup gives rise to the potential that the model works best for attitude objects that are naturally bipolar (e.g., Democrats vs. Republicans) or for people who have a tendency to see groups as being opposite from one another. For example, we might posit better model fit for those high in essentialism <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Haslam et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Prentice &amp; Miller, 2007)</ref>. Interestingly, IATs for bipolar pairs of attitude objects correspond more closely to self-reported attitudes than IATs for more unipolar pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Nosek, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>IATs allow us to make inferences about the relative valence of the two categories by comparing compatible and incompatible conditions. We could weaken the overall effect by increasing similarity with the minoritized category, or by making more dissimilarities with the majority category <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dasgupta &amp; Greenwald, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Joy-Gaba &amp; Nosek, 2010)</ref>. However, the base IAT does not allow us to examine the association of one category with positive / negative in absence of the other category, and thus we cannot estimate separate similarities for each of the target categories. However, the model could in principle incorporate multiple similarities, including (e.g., for the race IAT) White-positive, Whitenegative, Black-positive, Black-negative, and even White-Black. The cognitive representations of these categories are high-dimensional, and are formed by many examples and pairings that people encounter across their lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Deerwester et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Kvam, 2019a)</ref>. To get at each of the separate similarities, we would need richer behavioral data. This could involve looking at decisions consisting of only three of the options, as in the single target IAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bluemke &amp; Friese, 2008)</ref>, comparing multiple single-target IAT conditions like those for neutral / reference stimuli, adopting approaches like the word-embedding association test <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Caliskan et al., 2017)</ref> to inform our estimates of multiple similarity parameters, or even doing latent semantic analysis on a large corpora of text all collected from one person <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Landauer, 2006)</ref> to estimate these similarities a priori. Certainly, it would be an interesting challenge to relate the model parameters to independent assessments of similarity.</p><p>Another potential extension of our approach would be to put it together with multi-stage models of decision making, accounting for dual or sequential influences of automatic and controlled processes. This could also bring together the disparate lines of work looking at multinomial processing trees, which are inherently multi-stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Calanchini &amp; Sherman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Meissner &amp; Rothermund, 2013)</ref>, with the type of single-process, response-time focused models like the one we present here. This might be accomplished by having evidence accumulation unfold in multiple stages as in work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Diederich &amp; Trueblood (2018)</ref>, or could extend MPTs with response time models embedded into each branch as in work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Klauer &amp; Kellen (2018)</ref>. Increasing start point variability or having a contaminant guessing process would also bring the model more closely in line with models like the Quad model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Calanchini &amp; Sherman, 2013)</ref>; however, the lack of fast errors in the IATs we analyzed suggest that guessing may not play a significant role, at least in this data set (R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Ratcliff, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">R. Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual differences in parameter estimates</head><p>The relationship between individual differences and estimated model parameters has not been tested in any meaningful way and could make an important theoretical contribution on its own. In one example, using a similar modeling approach as the one we propose, those higher in Need for Closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Roets &amp; Van Hiel, 2007)</ref> have a lower decision threshold in a speed-accuracy tradeoff task when speed was emphasized, but not when accuracy was emphasized <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Evans et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> As such, testing the relationship between Need for Closure and the threshold parameter in the current model may prove be useful.</p><p>Closer to the current work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Calanchini et al. (2014)</ref> speculate that their observation that the Quad model's Detection parameter is correlated across attitude domains may indicate that it is related to individual differences in motivation or ability to focus on the task. They further suggest that the overlap in AC (association activation) parameters, even for highly-unrelated IATs, may be due to those higher in Need to Evaluate <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Jarvis &amp; Petty, 1996)</ref> having stronger activation of associations across all tasks. Both of these ideas remain untested, but they highlight how a focus on modeling processes that underlie behavior on an IAT can lead to new hypotheses as compared to when a summary score such as the IAT D-score is the unit of analysis. Given the lack of previous theorizing in this vein, the following is highly speculative. That said, it is worth testing the prediction of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Calanchini et al. (2014)</ref> that Need for Evaluation correlates positively with GSR-DDM's similarity parameter. In addition, it seems likely that the association / similarity parameter would be stronger for those higher in Need for Affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Maio &amp; Esses, 2001</ref>) due to the relationship between affect and the IAT (e.g., C. T. <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Smith &amp; Nosek, 2011)</ref>, as well as for those whose behavior related to the measured construct is habitual <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">(Verplanken &amp; Orbell, 2003)</ref>. Any variable that increases the accessibility of attitudes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Fazio, 1995)</ref> would be likely to increase the utility of the similarity parameter in GSR-DDM, as it changes the decision space in which the evidence accumulation process unfolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Kvam, 2019a)</ref>. We can make additional predictions for the threshold parameter such as that it will be lower for those who are more likely to make decisions based on a reliance on intuition <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Pacini &amp; Epstein, 1999)</ref> or spontaneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Scott &amp; Bruce, 1995)</ref>. Again, these predictions are speculative, but highlight a central benefit of the described modeling approach in that it allows for tests of this type of theoretically-informed speculation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions</head><p>Although evidence accumulation processes for modeling are now ubiquitous within decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Busemeyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">R. Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>, their adoption in social psychological tasks has only just begun <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Johnson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Pleskac et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Röhner &amp; Lai, 2021)</ref>. As further work is carried out on specific tasks, our theories of the cognitive and social processes that are involved will naturally improve. While the GSR-DDM provides a step forward -an accessible and effective step, we hope -we are certain it will not be the last. In particular, the similarity parameter serves only as a first-pass method at quantifying the role of representational overlap in IAT performance. There are undoubtedly multiple similarities at play, and deeper ways to quantify representational similarity using neural measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Kriegeskorte et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The neural network fitting approach we used <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Sokratous et al., 2022)</ref> is also in its infancy, having only been developed over the past few years. While it already shows impressive performance compared to traditional modeling methods -yielding equallyprecise estimates in a tiny fraction of the time -it is best used as a method for simulation-based models that are frequently applied to a common task. This makes it an excellent fit for modeling IATs, but there is undoubtedly room for improvement in terms of optimizing the structure of the neural network (number of nodes, layers, etc.), estimating the error in model parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Radev, Mertens, Voss, Ardizzone, &amp; Köthe, 2020)</ref>, and comparing different models <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Radev et al., 2021)</ref>. We are hopeful that more modelers will adopt this approach in order to make modeling as a whole more accessible.</p><p>One element of dynamic decision models that we did not approach in this paper is starting point biases. Both multinomial processing trees, like the Quad model, and dynamic models often include a parameter that quantifies a participant's general tendency or bias to respond on the left or right side. This can occur when there is a general bias toward responding 'positive' on incongruent trials -on the premise that it is worse to accidentally categorize a black face as positive than it is to accidentally categorize it as negative. Empirically, there did not appear to be an overall bias toward one side or another in the data sets that we used, which is why we did not include this parameter in the current model. However, there are certainly data where this would be useful to include, and potentially IATs where this would be important to control and account for. Certainly paradigms where there are manipulations of base rates, incentives for different responses (including those conferred by social interactions), or predecision information provided would constitute cases where start point biases would be important to consider <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Diederich &amp; Busemeyer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Axt &amp; Johnson, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Heathcote et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In sum, our newly-developed GSR-DDM model describes behavior on IATs in a more complete and accurate way not only compared to simple summary metrics like IAT D-scores but also other previous attempts to model the distinct processes underlying IAT task performance. We gained unique insights into test-retest reliability and predictive validity both for the similarity parameter that is most reflective of the relatively automatic associative processes that researchers typically intend to capture with the IAT, as well as processes that may or may not be subject to participants' control or awareness. Consistent with the most common theoretical accounts of the IAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Greenwald &amp; Banaji, 2017)</ref>, associations or conceptual similarities are a central part of GSR-DDM and were most important for predicting relevant outcomes (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">De Houwer et al., 2021)</ref>. These similarities are formed and revised over time through both classical and operant learning processes, they correspond to meaningful individual differences, and they affect choices that people make in the real world. The new approaches we developed here should make them more accessible to researchers working on these problems, improving the utility of IATs and the ease of modeling the cognitive processes involved in performance on these tasks.</p><p>Declarations, Open Practices, &amp; Data Availability Funding.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>Model fit metrics for the D-Score, GSR-DDM, diffusion model, and Quad model for each of the studies and outcomes we examined.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> Ability of the D-score, diffusion model, Quad model, and GSR-DDM model parameters (rows) to predict motivation and contact outcomes. Values in bold indicate significant / credible predictors whose HDIs exclude zero. One concern among models in general is their ability to index separable psychological and cognitive processes. To do so, we can examine how strongly the estimates of different parameters are related to one another. Theoretically, parameters that index common or related cognitive processes will have high correlations with one another while ones that are unrelated or easily malleable are more likely to have low correlations with one another. Therefore, it is useful to look at the inter-parameter correlations when assessing the discriminant and convergent validity of the model. The correlations among model parameters for the GSR in the Race IAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Buttrick et al., 2020)</ref> are shown in <ref type="table">Table  A2</ref>. The highest correlation is between the two drift rates, at r = .69. This is perfectly in line with what we should expect, as correlations among drift rates reflect a general tendency toward overall faster or slower information processing across participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Lerche et al., 2020)</ref>. Aside from this, most correlations among parameters are weak, with some stronger ones between thresholds or drift rates and the drift variability parameter ν. Again, this is a relatively common finding in diffusion models, and not one that should give us much pause. The lower discriminant validity is part of why we do not focus much on the drift rate variability parameter, as much like non-decision time it tends to be a "nuisance" parameter that is included to account for extraneous factors in order to improve the overall fit of the model and recovery of other parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Steingroever et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Race</head><p>Finally, there are some weak correlations between the thresholds in "basic" IAT conditions (valence-only "+-" condition, and black-white "BW" condition) and drift rates for the different types of stimuli (δ F for faces and δ W for words). This can reflect either participants' informed expectations about their own performance -participants who know they will perform well (higher drifts) on a basic task like these conditions are able to set lower thresholds while maintaining a high level of performance -or correlations among parameters that sometimes occur with differences in speed-accuracy manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Donkin et al., 2014)</ref>.

The findings are almost exactly the same, lending credibility to the conclusions we drew from the Race IAT. As in the Race IAT, the highest correlation among model parameters is between the two drift rates, at r = .67, reflecting a general tendency toward overall faster or slower information processing on the task. Also as before, there were some correlations with drift rate variability and some between threshold and drift rates that should not be too concerning <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Steingroever et al., 2020)</ref>. All other correlations were fairly weak and within acceptable limits for discriminant validity in cog-nitive modeling.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly and most notably, the correlations between the conceptual-similarity parameter γ and all other parameters, in both IATS, was extremely low. This suggests that the most central parameter of our model was distinguishable from all other parameters, meaning it indexes a unique component of performance on IATs that is not clearly captured by the classic DDM. These results therefore emphasize the discriminant and convergent validity of our modelparameters that are meant to be distinct (e.g., γ) are uncorrelated with others, while those that are clearly related (e.g., drift rates) are tightly correlated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 5</head><label>5</label><figDesc>Figure 5</figDesc></figure>
