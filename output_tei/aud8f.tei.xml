			<abstract>
				<p>We investigated the universality versus cultural specificity of preferences for internal decisionmaking strategies (intuition/deliberation) over external strategies (advice from friends or crowds). Participants from samples spanning five continents (N=3,517), including Indigenous communities, considered scenarios involving personal and social decision-making. Across cultures, most participants preferred and felt better using internal strategies, although they believed their peers would seek external advice, revealing a discrepancy between personal preferences and perceived group norms. While internal strategies were generally favored in each culture, the magnitude of internal endorsement varied: individualists and those with a higher need for cognition favored internal strategies more, whereas collectivists and those with an outsider view reflective style favored them somewhat less. These findings challenge the traditional view of non-Western cultures as predominantly advice-following and have implications for understanding the interplay between individual and social learning, and for the design of decision-support systems in different societies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance statement</head><p>Understanding decision-making across cultures can transform policy and tool design for diverse populations. We surveyed over 3,500 participants from various cultural backgrounds, including Indigenous groups, to assess their decision preferences. Results showed a universal preference for intuition and deliberation over external advice, with most participants in each culture personally favoring this "inner self" approach, considering it wise and expecting to feel better about choosing it. This challenges the belief that non-Western cultures seek external guidance. Though most people in each culture discounted advice, individualists favored internal strategies more, while collectivists were somewhat more open to advice. These insights enhance our comprehension of social learning and cultural evolution, demonstrating that the reliance on the "inner self" is a common thread across humanity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The primacy of the inner self in decision-making across cultures</head><p>Imagine a farmer in a small village in South America facing a difficult decision about which crops to plant for the upcoming season. Will they follow their intuition based on years of personal experience, or seek advice from their neighbors and the local cooperative? This question is at the heart of understanding social learning and decision preferences, with scholars from disciplines of anthropology, psychology, economics and evolutionary biology often advancing conflicting propositions. On the one hand, decision scientists have shown that seeking and incorporating advice from others can enhance individual decision-making and adaptability (1-4). Indeed, cultural anthropologists and evolutionary biologists argue that such features of social learning facilitate human cultural evolution, allowing our species to adapt and thrive <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. On the other hand, experiments in psychology and economics reveal that people often prioritize personal insights over others' advice, a phenomenon known as 'advice-discounting' (e.g., <ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11)</ref> that seemingly contradicts the adaptive value of social learning <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>.</p><p>Existing research has often explained this contradiction by pointing to a unique psychological profile of Western, affluent, and educated samples used in prior advice-discounting studies <ref type="bibr">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. These samples may be shaped by an individualist ethos of independence and selfreliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>, which is anomalous compared to the rest of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. In contrast, collectivist cultures, representing the majority of the world, emphasize community and interdependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr">19)</ref>, potentially leading to a greater reliance on advice <ref type="bibr">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. However, despite reflecting the standard textbook portrayals of cultural differences in behavioral and social science, the evidence for this cultural dichotomy remains inconclusive <ref type="bibr">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr">20)</ref>. This inconclusiveness partly arises from the limited sampling of broader socio-economic and cultural variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>, with limited comparative studies on advice-discounting, which so far primarily focused on affluent North American and East Asian populations.</p><p>To address this contradiction, we conducted a large-scale study of decision preferences across diverse cultural contexts, including Indigenous small-scale societies. Our research goes beyond previous two-sample comparisons of well-off countries by including participants from 13 languages and 12 countries in the Global North and South. By comparing preferences for and anticipated subjective utility (i.e., the expectation to feel good about the choice; 18) of internal decision strategies (relying on intuition or deliberation, i.e., the "inner self") over external strategies (seeking advice from friends or the wisdom of crowds), we aimed to provide a comprehensive test of how cultural orientation and individual differences shape decision preferences.</p><p>Following dominant cultural psychological and evolutionary frameworks (e.g., <ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>, we hypothesized that collectivist cultures would prefer external strategies, while an account of advice-discounting as a psychological universal <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> would predict a preference for internal decision strategies across all cultures. We also explored culturally-grounded folk theories of decision-making by asking participants how they believe a wise person and most people from their culture would approach these decisions.</p><p>Our findings challenged the notion that collectivist cultures are predominantly advice-following, instead revealing a universal preference for internal decision strategies in each of the sampled population, inviting a re-evaluation of advice-taking in cultural psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr">19)</ref> and evolution theories <ref type="bibr">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref> and the portrayal of non-Western societies in social and behavioral sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Overview</head><p>In three studies conducted under the Geography of Philosophy Project, we surveyed participants from diverse settings-spanning five continents, urban to rural environments, various socioeconomic statuses, and including two Indigenous communities <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S1</ref>). In Study 1, participants read six stories. We varied the context of the decision to ensure applicability across targeted samples (agricultural assistance, financial investment, educational choices, travel planning, neighborly assistance, and academic support). Half of the scenarios involved a choice between two equally attractive options, whereas the other half involved a dilemma between pursuing self-protective and socially-considerate goals, with scenario order randomized or counter-balanced. For pragmatic reasons, participants from the working class Meitei community in New Delhi and the time-constrained South African college students responded to a subset of two stories (see Methods and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S2</ref> in the supplement for breakdown).</p><p>To ensure cultural relevance, all scenarios were selected based on the inputs of the ethnographers and anthropologists on the research team; participants in each sample reported moderate-to-high personal relevance of each scenario, as indexed by feeling of closeness to the protagonist ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.  S1</ref>; see details in the supplement). The diversity in scenarios allowed us to explore decisionmaking across different contexts and trade-offs, including time, resources, and opportunities. The following story, used across all sites, illustrates the types of decisions participants considered:</p><p>Carlos, a young man, asks Marcos, his neighbor, if he can help him prepare his field to be able to plant before the rainy season. Marcos has already started working in his field a few weeks ago and knows that if he helps his neighbor Carlos, he will not be able to finish all the remaining work on time, and his harvest will not be as abundant as expected.</p><p>We asked participants to choose between four decision strategies after reading a scenario: i) Internal-Intuition, where one attends to gut feelings, personal experiences, and emotions; ii) Internal-Deliberation, involving reasoning and solitary reflection; iii) External-Friend's advice, where one spends time getting the opinions and advice of friends about the situation; and iv) External-Wisdom of Crowds, where one relies on majority advice from either an online community or anonymous public board contributors (see supplementary methods for verbatim text). Each of the four decision strategies emphasized that the protagonist made their decision based on a single source of information (e.g., decision based on thoughts and reasoning, even if it does not align with gut feeling, or with what others may think about the situation). This approach aimed to control for potential confounds from integrating multiple sources.</p><p>After reading a scenario, participants indicated their personal preference, and chose the strategy they deemed wisest and the one most people from their cultural background are likely to use, serving as proxies for personal choice, prudential norm, and descriptive norm, respectively. Subsequently, participants indicated the anticipated subjective utility of each strategy and completed measures of cultural orientation, need for cognition, reflective and meta-cognitive styles, as well as problem solution focus (see Methods). Cultural orientation was assessed using the Individualism and Collectivism Scale (30) (e.g., 'I determine my own destiny' for individualism; 'In general, I accept the decisions made by my group' for collectivism). Need for cognition, or the tendency to engage in and enjoy thinking, was measured with the Need for Cognition Scale (31) (e.g., 'I would rather do something that requires little thought than something that is sure to challenge my thinking abilities'). Reflective and meta-cognitive styles and problem-solution focus were evaluated using the Situated Wise Reasoning Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, assessing tendencies to reflect on events from an outsider's perspective, recognize diverse viewpoints, and consider various solutions to problems (e.g., 'Tried to see the conflict from the point of view of an uninvolved person'' for reflective style; 'I looked for alternative explanations before forming my opinion' for meta-cognition; 'I looked for different solutions for this situation' for problem-solution focus).</p><p>In the pre-registered Study 2, we followed the same procedure, with two modifications. First, for pragmatic reasons we presented participants with a subset of four stories. Second, whereas in Study 1 each of the four decision strategies included a clause of omission of other strategies to highlight the single source of information (e.g., decision based on thoughts and reasoning, even if it does not align with gut feeling, or with what others may think about the situation), Study 2 used a more naturalistic prompt without the omission clause (e.g., decision based on thoughts and reasoning). Thus, we ensured the observed pattern of results is not an artifact of the omission.</p><p>To examine if the present results extend beyond the industrialized communities, in Study 3 we tested participants from two small-scale communities in South America, using a shortened version of the Study 1 protocol in a form of verbal interviews. Specifically, participants were presented with a subset of two stories designed to match the socio-ecological context of participants from these small-scale communities, and provided responses to abridged versions of the scales (see Supplementary Appendix for verbal protocol). Finally, Supplementary Study 4 replicated all key results on an ethnically heterogeneous North American sample, simultaneously testing preferences across two modalitiesas a force choice method and via rating scales of internal and external strategies as wise, rational, and culturally acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Favoring of Internal Strategies across Cultures</head><p>In Study 1, when participants were asked about their personal preference, deliberation was the strategy most often chosen in each of the samples, ranging from 37% among Tamils and Meitei in India to 60% among English-speaking South Africans (see left part of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Intuition was consistently the second most chosen strategy, ranging from 23% among the Chinese to 40% among the Canadian participants. The other two strategies were less popular. Considering friends' advice ranged between 9% in South Africa and 22% among Tamils and Meitei. Finally, relying on the wisdom of crowds was preferred only between 2% in Slovakia to 12% in Germany. Results were similar when we asked participants about the prudential norms, with deliberation chosen as the wisest strategy in most samples (36%-61%), followed by intuition (15%-36%), with fewer people selecting friends' advice (9%-19%) or wisdom of crowds (3%-16%). Post-hoc contrasts of personally preferred strategies were consistent with descriptive observations: In each site, deliberation was significantly more likely to be preferred than other strategies together, 5.15 ≤ zs &lt; 26.13, Ps &lt; .001, though pairwise comparisons suggested that Canadians and Tamil/Meitei favored deliberation on par with intuition. Conversely, wisdom of crowds was significantly less likely to be chosen, 5.82 ≤ zs &lt; 17.20, Ps &lt; .001, though in pairwise comparisons Germans, South Africans and South Koreans chose it to the same extent as considering a friend's advice. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Cultural variation and systematicity in decision-making preferences. Left panel: preferred choices per sample across strategies reflecting internal (intuition and deliberation) and external (friend's advice and wisdom of crowds) strategies, with countries sorted by dominance of internal strategies. Middle panel: estimated preference for internal strategies with 95% confidence interval. The graph represents sample-specific preferences averaged across scenarios. Numbers in parentheses represent sample size. All samples were significantly more likely to select internal strategies. Right graph: Dominance of internal strategies among prudential and descriptive norms. In each sample participants overwhelmingly viewed internal strategies as wiser choices but were less consistent in pointing to what strategy most people from their culture would choose (except for an Indigenous Shiwiar sample in Ecuador).</p><p>However, the pattern of results looked different when examining descriptive norms. Though wisdom of crowds was again seen as the least preferred strategy (ranging from 6% among Canadians to 17% among Germans), expectations of other people in one's culture to choose deliberation (23% among Tamil/Meitei-speaking Indians to 41% among Canadians) and intuition (18% among Hindu-speaking Indians to 27% among Ecuadorian students) were not different from expectations to seek friends' advice (23% among Germans to 42% among Hindi-speaking Indians). In fact, in five samples -South Africa, Ecuador, South Korea, Hindi-and Tamil/Meitei-speaking Indians -friends' advice was viewed as the strategy others would most commonly choose.</p><p>To systematically compare relative preferences for 'internal' versus 'external' strategies across diverse cultural contexts, we performed a series of generalized linear mixed logistic regressions. Our modeling strategy incorporated responses nested within specific scenarios and individuals which in turn were nested within samples, allowing for the assessment of both fixed effects (to capture overall trends) and random intercepts (to accommodate variations attributable to scenarios and the nested structure of individuals within cultures). This approach enables simultaneous assessment of potential influences of cultural background and scenario-specific contexts on individual decision-making preferences.</p><p>Internal strategies dominated people's choice (69% in China to 87% in Slovakia; see <ref type="figure">Fig.1-B)</ref>, B = 83%, 95%CI [74%, 89%], z = 5.85, P &lt; .001, OR = 4.92, and prudential norms (65% in China to 88% in Slovakia), B = 85%, 95%CI [76%, 91%], z = 5. 97, P &lt; .001, OR = 5.53, whereas descriptive norms of decision preferences were more variable across sites (cf. right panel of <ref type="figure">Fig.  1</ref>), B = 59%, 95%CI [45%, 72%], z = 1.25, P = .211, OR = 1.45. Whereas people in some sites reported that most people in their culture would consider both internal and external decisionmaking strategies (e.g., 48% in South Korea), other sites viewed internal strategies as preferred by most people in their culture (e.g., 66% in Canada; see right panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>Each of these results replicated in the pre-registered Study 2, where we did not present strategies as mutually exclusive. As <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows, deliberation was the dominant strategy everywhere except in India (where participants favored gut feeling), and internal strategies were favored, overall, B = 72%, 95%CI [58%, 82%], z = 2.99, P = .003, OR = 2.52, and viewed as prudent in each sample, overall B = 74%, 95%CI [59%, 85%], z = 3.01, P = .003, OR = 2.88. There was no conclusive preference for internal strategies in descriptive norms, overall B = 49%, 95%CI [36%, 62%], |z| = 0.13, P = .890, OR = 0.96. In post-hoc contrasts, deliberation was significantly more likely to be preferred than all other strategies together in each site, 6.11 ≤ zs &lt; 27.86, Ps &lt; .001, except for the Indian sample, z = 1.38, P = .168, where it was on par with gut feeling and friend's advice. Conversely, wisdom of crowds was significantly less likely to be chosen in all sites, 2.63 ≤ zs &lt; 14.82, Ps ≤ .008, though pairwise comparisons showed that in South Africa it was similarly preferred to intuition and friends' advice.</p><p>Finally, we replicated these results in two Indigenous South American communities (Study 3 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Like other samples, participants favored internal strategies, B = 72%, 95%CI [62%, 80%], z = 3.94, P &lt; .001, OR = 2.62, and viewed them as wise, B = 71%, 95%CI [61%, 80%], z = 3.86, P = .0001, OR = 2.51. Notably, participants from these samples also considered internal choices as favored by others in their community ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>, B = 70%, 95%CI [51%, 84%], z = 2.08, P = .034, OR = 2.34. In post-hoc tests, deliberation was preferred to all other strategies, 3.22 ≤ zs &lt; 6.79, Ps ≤ .001, though pairwise comparisons showed that among the Shiwiar it was similar to intuition and friends' advice. Wisdom of crowds was significantly less preferred to other strategies in both sites, 4.29 ≤ zs &lt; 4.81, Ps &lt; .001. Supplementary analyses showed that the favoring of internal strategies holds when accounting for demographic variability and sense of closeness to decision scenario protagonists <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table S5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reports of Anticipated Subjective Utility of Decision Strategies</head><p>To ensure the pancultural preference for internal strategies was not a methodological artifact of forced-choice responses, we also examined to what extent participants expected each strategy would made them feel good on a 5-point scale (see further evidence from rating-scale responses in the Supplementary Study 4; <ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>). As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> shows, in each sample participants were significantly more likely to expect feeling better about choosing internal compared with external strategies, with the cultural differences largely mirroring the forced-choice results in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Furthermore, preferences for internal strategies on the forced-choice task qualified the relative differences in anticipated subjective utility: generalized linear mixed model results revealed that in each site, participants choosing internal strategies expected to feel better about them (vs. external strategies), Study 1: B = 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural and Individual Differences in Internal Decision Preferences</head><p>Though we observed an overwhelming preference for internal strategies in all samples, Figs. 1-2 also demonstrates substantial cultural and individual differences in the degree of endorsement of these strategies. We formally evaluated the extent to which preference for internal strategies was due to cultural, individual, and scenario-specific factors. For parsimony, we performed an internal mega-analysis across our three studies (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>), which revealed a substantial contribution of sample-specific, as well as individual and situational factors: For the personally preferred strategy, 3.3% of the variance was accounted for by sample, 20.3% by inter-individual differences, and 7.5% by scenario-specific variability. Similarly, 3.5%, 24.6%, and 7.6% of the variance in the selection of internal strategies as wise were accounted for by sample, interindividual differences, and scenario-specific variability, respectively. 1</p><p>To unpack cultural and individual differences, we examined contributions of individualism, collectivism, need for cognition, as well as reflective style (outsider vs. insider view), metacognition and prosocial tendencies for internal decision preferences (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). We simultaneously included predictors theorized to be inversely related to decision preferences and to each other, thereby accounting for differences in response styles. We used group means to estimate sample-level effects and group-centered scores to estimate person-level effects. Samples that on average were more individualist showed stronger preference for internal strategies (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> and left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>). In contrast, samples that, on average, were more likely to endorse collectivism and an outsider view in reflection on social issues showed a stronger preference for strategies that involved external advice (right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>). Furthermore, within a given culture, individuals with a stronger endorsement of individualism and a higher-thanaverage need for cognition were more inclined toward internal strategies <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>. Conversely, people who, compared to the averages for their sample, held more collectivist values and more strongly endorsed an outsider view, were more likely to choose external strategies. These results hold when controlling for participants' age, sex, educational status, and sense of closeness to the scenario protagonist <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table S5</ref>). &lt; 0.02. We use a stricter α than 0.05 because of large sample size (and statistical power). Under such circumstances, when the null hypothesis is true, a p-value = .04 is more likely than when the alternative hypothesis is true (33).  . Cultural variation and systematicity in anticipated subjective utility-sense of feeling good about oneself (1 = not at all; 2 = slightly; 3 = moderately; 4 = very; 5 = extremely)-when choosing a particular decision-making strategy. Left panel: boxplots (Md = bold vertical line; box = 25-75% interquartile range <ref type="bibr">[IQR]</ref>; whiskers = values within 1.5 * IQR; points = outliers) and estimated means for each strategy (tealcolored diamonds, obtained from the linear mixed model with subjective utility scores nested in participants and scenarios). Right panel: estimated relative preference for internal (minus external) strategies with 95% confidence interval, obtained from the linear mixed model with internal/external contrast as a fixed effect of subjective utility scores nested in participants and scenarios. In each sample, participants were significantly more likely to feel better about choosing internal over external strategies, especially deliberation. All samples were significantly more likely to select internal strategies.</p><p>Supplementary analyses further revealed similar results for prudential norms <ref type="table">(Table S6)</ref>, but not for descriptive norms <ref type="table">(Table S7</ref>): In the latter case, only samples reporting outsider view in reflection and participants endorsing collectivism were more likely to believe that most people from their cultural background would select external strategies, once again underlining the dissociation between descriptive norms on the one hand and personal preferences and prudential norms on the other hand (also see the right panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Moreover, Supplementary Study 4 replicated each of these results using both forced-choice and rating scale responses: While participants endorsing individualism consistently favored internal strategies, considering them wiser and more rational, those endorsing collectivism were somewhat less inclined to do so. Importantly, even participants with the highest levels of collectivism did not favor external strategies over internal ones (Figs. S8 and S10).</p><p>In further supplementary analyses, we also used a linear mixed model to explore how cultural and individual factors impact relative subjective utility of internal vs. external strategies. Higher individualism at both the sample and individual levels were associated with greater anticipated subjective utility/satisfaction of internal strategies, whereas higher collectivism and outsider view at the personal level were linked with a relatively greater utility of external strategies <ref type="table">(Table S8</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Situational Differences in Internal Decision Preferences</head><p>By design, half of our scenarios involved a choice between a self-protective option to further one's priorities and a socially considerate option of helping a neighbour or a fellow student (social choice). The other half concerned a choice between two equally attractive options (personal choice). The likelihood of favoring internal strategies was significantly more pronounced for social choice (93%, 95% CI [88%, 95%]) compared to personal choice scenarios (77%, 95% CI [67%, 84%]), B = 1.33, 93% CI [0.87, 1, 78], z = 5.75, P &lt; .001, R 2 = .05. Thus, inner self strategies were favored for each scenario type, but especially for scenarios involving social considerations.</p><p>Next, we tested the extent to which variability in internal decision preferences across scenarios were associated with normative and subjective utility factors. To this end, we partitioned each factor into sample-specific effects of the average sample, person-level effects of individuals' average tendencies across scenarios, and effects of variability in choices across scenarios, and fit in a generalized linear mixed model, adjusting for corresponding random effects. We observed a high cumulative effect size of these factors on choice preferences, R² (fixed effects) = .43. The results revealed significant person-specific and scenario-specific effects of descriptive norms, person: B = 0.91, 95% CI [0.72, 1.10], z = 9.27, P &lt; .001, OR = 2.48; scenario: B = 0.81, 95% CI [0.70, 0.93], z = 13.44, P &lt; .001, OR = 2.26, and subjective utility, person: B = 1.06, 95% CI [0.99, 1.03], z = 29.95, P &lt; .001, OR = 2.90; scenario: B = 1.30, 95% CI [1.24, 1.36], z = 42.57, P &lt; .001; OR = 3.66. For each predictor, effects representing variability across scenarios were more pronounced compared to person-specific effects. Moreover, preference for internal choice in a given situation was 1.20 times more likely to be associated with the expectation of feeling good about one's choice compared to what other members of one's society may choose. Additionally, whereas cultural differences in subjective utility further contributed to internal choice, B = 1.40, 95% CI [1.01, 1.79], z = 7.09, P &lt; .001; OR = 4.06, cultural differences in descriptive norms did not, B = 0.03, 95% CI [-1.81, 1.86], z = 0.03, P = .976. Similar pattern of results emerged when performing supplementary analyses to examine views of internal strategies as a wise choice (see https://osf.io/7s3z6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our study investigated decision-making preferences across diverse cultural contexts, exploring whether the primacy of the inner self in decision-making is universal or culture-bound. Remarkably, despite the diversity of our samples spanning 12 countries across five continents, including urban and rural communities in the Global North and South and several Indigenous communities, we found a consistent preference for relying on internal strategies (i.e., intuition and deliberation) when facing challenging decisions, even when such strategies conflicted with external advice (i.e., friends' advice or crowd wisdom). Most societies favored deliberation most, and wisdom of crowds least. This finding challenges traditional views of collectivist cultures as predominantly advice-following (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref> and suggests that the preference for internal decision-making strategies is more universal than previously thought <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>.</p><p>The observation that collectivist samples generally favor internal strategies (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>) invites a revision of common portrayals of collectivist as well as individualist communities. It suggests that the dichotomy between individualism and collectivism, often framed in terms of independence versus interdependence, might be more nuanced than previously understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Whereas individualist communities are often depicted as self-reliant and collectivist communities as community-oriented, our findings imply that both groups might prioritize internal decisionmaking strategies, albeit for different reasons. For collectivist communities, this reliance on internal strategies might stem from a deep-seated distrust (35) of external advice, including advice from their friends and for those outside their immediate social circles. This challenges the assumption that collectivists are naturally predisposed to seek and follow external input, highlighting a potential undercurrent of self-reliance driven by caution and skepticism rather than communal trust.</p><p>Despite general decision preference for internal strategies in each sample, the extent of this tendency varied by social orientation <ref type="bibr">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>, with persons endorsing individualist values showing a stronger preference for internal strategies and persons endorsing collectivist values being more relatively more open to external advice. Additionally, persons with a higher need for cognition showed a stronger preference for internal strategies, whereas persons favoring an observer's perspective in self-reflection were more open to external advice. Internal strategies were preferred even more in situations involving other people. Whereas the primacy of the inner self in decision-making appears pancultural, further cultural and individual factors clearly mattered to explain the degree to which individuals embraced it.</p><p>Our findings of a cross-culturally consistent preference for person-centric decision strategies also prompt a re-evaluation of the role of advice-taking in cultural evolution theories. Several psychological and evolutionary explanations have been proposed for the phenomenon of advicediscounting (1, 9, 12, 37). One reason people may favor their deliberations and intuitions, despite common benefits of external advice, is that they anticipate a greater sense of subjective utility from such inward-oriented decision strategies, driven by self-enhancement motives in pursuit of a sense of autonomy and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> when relying on their own judgment. Indeed, across cultures and decision scenarios, individuals expected to feel better about internally made decisions than those influenced by others' advice, and this tendency was heightened among individuals valuing autonomy. A complementary account holds that people trust their own views more because they have access to the reasons behind them <ref type="bibr">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>, though some evidence suggests that this may not be a necessary condition <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. Another perspective, rooted in the epistemic vigilance framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref>, suggests that humans have an a priori reluctance to believe communicated information unless accompanied by arguments or guarantees of reliability. Our study tested this hypothesis in the context of seeking advice from trusted individuals. Even though participants had an opportunity to seek out advice from trusted sources, they nevertheless favored internal deliberation, challenging the latter account of advicediscounting.</p><p>Before concluding, it's important to acknowledge a few caveats. As with previous research on advice-taking in the social sciences, our study relied on non-representative convenience samples. Although we did not find significant differences among samples that varied widely in cultural orientation, socio-economic status, religion, and education, the lack of representativeness limits our ability to draw strong inferences from the national rankings of advice-following behaviors. This limitation highlights the need for future research to explore national and regional differences in advice-taking using representative samples (also see results from the Supplementary Study 4 in Figs. S2-S6). Second, like prior studies, our research focused on preferences. However, an important question remains: Would the apparent cross-cultural consistency in decision preferences on standardized scenarios concerning personal choices extend to actual decisions people make in their lives? The answer to this question requires further research. Existing cross-cultural research suggests that reports of actual behavior might be even more consistent across societies than responses to abstract scenarios. For example, while abstract beliefs about emotions often vary across cultures, reinforcing societal stereotypes, reports of emotions in response to specific autobiographical experiences tend to be more consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</p><p>The finding that the majority of participants in each sample exhibited a preference for decisionmaking strategies they expected to yield higher subjective utility appears to align with classic economic theories of rational choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. However, the resulting pancultural bias toward internal strategies isn't necessarily rational. Behavioral science research suggests that selffocused decision-making can be subject to biases, such as overestimating positive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref> and seeking confirming evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes. While our findings demonstrate a pancultural preference for internal decision-making, future research should investigate the conditions under which relying solely on intuition and deliberation may be detrimental and explore ways to encourage the integration of external viewpoints (1, 4, 49).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants for our study were recruited via the Geography of Philosophy Project research consortium (www.geographyofphilosophy.com)--a research collective of collaborating research institutions in twelve countries <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S1</ref>). Each research team recruited participants using their own protocols, and all participants were then interviewed using a common set of standardized materials (see supplementary materials). At most sites, researchers attempted to include at least one sample of university students and one community sample outside the university, though how these were identified and recruited varied across the research teams (see https://osf.io/7s3z6 for more information). Teams were encouraged to include participant communities that they felt would be relevant for the study, and that could be feasibly included. As a result of the heterogeneity of local recruitment preferences and procedures, our participant samples were heterogeneous, varying in demographic characteristics, sample size, and composition.</p><p>As a result of this recruitment strategy, our sample sizes differed across sites <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S1</ref>) as did renumeration <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table S2)</ref>, though in most sites reached the pre-registered targeted sample of 55 participants for within-subject designs (https://osf.io/xmhfu). The average age of participants ranged from 20.3 years (Canada) to 39.7 years (Germany). The smallest variation in samples' age was among college students in Ecuador (SD = 2.4 years) and the largest was among the Shiwiar participants (SD = 15.0 years). Overall, 52% of participants identified as female, though distributions varied across sites (from 29% in Slovakia to 84% among Canadian students). In addition to sex and age, participants reported their highest educational qualification, which ranged from participants with primary or secondary school only, to those who are enrolled or have completed college, to participants with advanced graduate degrees. To further increase power for sample-wise analyses and be consistent with our pre-registered sufficient sample size cut-offs (n &gt; 55), we combined sub-samples in the U.S. (students from the University of Pittsburgh and crowdworkers from Amazon Mechanical Turk) and in India (community samples of Tamil and Meitei-speaking adults in Delhi). We acknowledge that this procedure might have obscured large intra-national cultural variations, which we did not have sufficient statistical power to test in the main results (see Supplementary Study 4 for intra-national ethnic group tests in North American samples). Nevertheless, it appeared justified given that comparison of national (vs. intra-national) communities represent the focal test in much prior cross-cultural research on individualism and collectivism. Consequently, our research aims to probe preference for internal (vs. external) strategies across national communities that vary vastly in socioeconomic, ideological, religious, and demographic make-up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-analysis plan and pre-registration deviations</head><p>The initial pre-analysis plan for materials, and study administration for Study 1 were reviewed and approved by the Geography of Philosophy consortium (see materials in the Supplementary Appendix). Study 2 was pre-registered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/z98by). Because the first pre-registered hypothesis was underspecified with regard to the nature of effect across four strategies, we performed post-hoc contrasts (contrast 1: deliberation vs. other strategies; contrast 2: other strategies vs. wisdom of crowds) with false-discovery rate adjustments, as well as pairwise comparisons with Tukey adjustments. Further, we implemented two minor deviations from the pre-registered analyses. First, we omitted analyses with Hofstede's culture-level markers of individualism-collectivism due to validity concerns (e.g., 50). Second, in primary analyses we opted to include individualism and collectivism as simultaneous predictors in linear mixed model analyses instead of relying on the difference score-to estimate independent contribution of each factor; supplementary analyses with the individualism-collectivism difference scores yield conceptually similar results with a higher effect size. Finally, we performed supplementary analyses with factor scores from measurementinvariant structural equation models instead of average scores of pre-registered predictor variables to test the robustness of effects <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S10</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>The initial version of the materials was developed in English by an international team of researchers representing different cultures in the sample. Our translation approach was twofold. Firstly, we enlisted an extensive team of experts in cross-cultural research, linguistics, and anthropology. These specialists played a crucial role in the translation, adaptation, and validation of all materials. Secondly, in-depth discussions were conducted focusing on key terms, ensuring cultural appropriateness and semantic accuracy. This process involved classical back-translation techniques and consensus-building among experts to finalize the terms used across different cultural sites. Additionally, research teams at each site were encouraged to report any challenges encountered during the translation of materials. Finally, for scale-based measures, whenever possible we relied on existing validated back-translated versions in respective languages, asking local experts on our teams to further review (and if necessary correct) the existing translations.</p><p>Participants read each story and chose the strategy that they would prefer in this situation, the strategy they considered to be wisest and the strategy they think most other people from the cultural background would use (proxy of perceived descriptive norm). Finally, participants rated the extent to which they anticipated each strategy would make them feel good about themselves (a proxy for subjective utility of each decision strategy; 1 = not at all; 2 = slightly; 3 = moderately; 4 = very; 5 = extremely). Strategies were presented either online on the Qualtrics platform, via the paper &amp; pencil (Slovakia in Study 1), or in an interview with an Indigenous translator (Study 3; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S2</ref>). In small-scale societies, participants were interviewed, with responses recorded by the interviewer (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S2</ref> and protocol in the online supplement). To control for scenario order, order of stories was randomized. In each culture, we used local names typical to a given country for each role and location (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table S3</ref>). To avoid confusion and to increase reliability, we standardized response options across subsequent instruments to a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Somewhat disagree, 3 = Neither agree nor disagree, 4 = Somewhat agree, to 5 = Strongly agree).</p><p>Individualism and Collectivism. Participants completed the 22-item Individualism and Collectivism Scale developed by Oyserman <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. An example of an individualism item is "I determine my own destiny" and an example of a collectivism item is "In general, I accept the decisions made by my group." Need for Cognition. The need for cognition refers to people's tendency to engage in and enjoy thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. To assess individual differences in motivation to engage in effortful thinking, participants complete the 18-item Need for Cognition Scale. An example item is "I would rather do something that requires little thought than something that is sure to challenge my thinking abilities."</p><p>Self-reflective, meta-cognitive, and conflict-solution-oriented style. Participants completed the Situated Wise Reasoning Scale inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, which assesses self-reflective, meta-cognitive and conflict-solution-oriented tendencies. Following an event-reconstruction protocol, participants recalled and reconstructed a recent interpersonal disagreement with another person. Subsequently, they reported to what extent they reflected on the events from the perspective of an outsider (outsider view reflective style; 4 items; example item: "Tried to see the conflict from the point of view of an uninvolved person"), recognized diverse viewpoints and acknowledged limits of their knowledge (perspectival meta-cognition; 8 items; example item: "I looked for alternative explanations before forming my opinion"), and considered the possible solutions to the problem (conflict-solution-orientation; 9 items; example item: "I looked for different solutions for this situation"). The three-factor model is based on the preliminary cross-cultural analyses suggesting that it reflects the most robust solution across most of the samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>. For pragmatic reasons, we employed a short version of the instrument in Study 3 (outsider view: 2 items, meta-cognition: 4 items; problem-solution: 4 items; see supplement for verbatim items).</p><p>Psychometric considerations. For each scale, we performed preliminary psychometric analyses (e.g., exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses) with an eye to identifying a reliable structure. Analyses of individualism-collectivism scale suggested that several factors did not load well on the theorized constructs when accounting for a common method bifactor. Therefore, we excluded three items from the individualism sub-scale and one item from the collectivism subscale. The resulting instrument showed good reliability across Studies 1-3 (individualism: αoverall = .74, .64 ≤ αsite-specific &lt; .82; collectivism: αoverall = .81, .70 ≤ αsite-specific &lt; .85), except for collectivism score among Shipibo participants (α = .44). The reliability of need for cognition scale was high overall (α = .84) and acceptable across most sites, .63 ≤ αsite-specific ≤ .95, apart from the Zulu participants in South Africa (α = .39), Tamil/Meitei in India (α = .54) and Shiwiar participants (α &lt; .10)-each of these three samples showed a high degree of response bias. Finally, the measure of reflective, meta-cognitive, and problem-solution tendencies showed good reliability (outsider view: αoverall = .78, .67 ≤ αsite-specific &lt; .84; meta-cognition: αoverall = .80, .69 ≤ αsite-specific &lt; .86; conflict-solution: αoverall = .82, .64 ≤ αsite-specific &lt; .88), with the exception of modest reliability for sites discussed above and those from South Africa for outsider view (.40 ≤ α &lt; .54), poor reliability among the Shiwiar for meta-cognition (α = .36), and Shiwiar and Shipibo for conflict-solution (.25 ≤ α &lt; .59). The latter results are not unexpected because of the smaller size of Indigenous samples, reliance on an abridged version of the instrument in Study 3, and an in-person mode of survey administration preventing anonymous responding about a personal social conflict. Nevertheless, these psychometric insights suggest that the cross-cultural comparisons on these metrics among indigenous South American, Indian, and South African samples have to be treated with caution. Besides these minor deviations, the overall reliability of each instrument was high. To ensure comparability of the results across studies and sub-samples, we followed the pre-registered plan and calculated average scores for each of the resulting subscales for further analyses. To avoid response bias, we simultaneously entered these scores into linear mixed model analyses.</p><p>In supplementary analyses, we relied on the alignment procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref> to ensure measurement invariance in each scale across sites. Alignment optimization adjusts factor loadings and intercepts to minimize group differences while preserving the overall measurement structure. This approach allowed for the identification of approximate scalar invariance, facilitating meaningful cross-site comparisons with minimal bias despite potential heterogeneity in the sample (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S10</ref> for the results of the alignment procedure). We subsequently used the factor scores from the individualism, collectivism, need for cognition, as well as from the reflective, meta-cognitive, and problem-solution tendencies to replicate the patterns of main results. Because a short version of reflective, meta-cognitive, and problem-solution tendencies in Study 3 presented a challenge due to a large number of missing items, we performed one analysis with individualism/collectivism, and need for cognition on participants across three studies, and a separate analysis including meta-cognitive tendencies on samples from Studies 1 and 2. The results yield a similar picture to the one reported in the main results (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S11</ref>).</p><p>Exclusions. We excluded participants who failed attention checks in online surveys, missed whole blocks of responses to decision-scenarios, and provided non-sense responses to demographics. As pre-registered in Study 2, we further excluded a few participants who did not answer open-ended questions on the Situated Wise Reasoning Scale or provided nonsensical responses (see <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> for breakdown of exclusions). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discrepancy between preferred choice and descriptive and prudential norms</head><p>We examined the overlap between personal preference for internal choice and the expected choice of the majority in one's cultural group. First, we fit a baseline model comparable to the generalized logistic mixed models in the main text. In 68% of the cases, 95% CI [61%, 74%], participants responses for both scenarios overlapped, suggesting that for one third of the samples there was an overlap, OR = 2.12. In comparison, an analogous model for the overlap between personal preference and prudential norm showed a much higher overlap, 90%, 95% CI [87%, 92%], OR = 8.78. In other words, the overlap between personal preference and the prudential norm was 20% higher than between personal preference and the descriptive norm.</p><p>We further examined how sample-specific, inter-individual, and scenario-specific effects are related to the overlap between the personal preference and the descriptive norm. As <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table S9</ref> shows, overlap was lower for samples that, on average, endorsed greater individualism. Furthermore, on the individual level, overlap between personal preferences and descriptive norm was greater the more an individual endorsed collectivist values. Moreover, both on the sampleand individual-levels, outsider view in self-reflections was associated with significantly less overlap between personal choice and descriptive norms.</p><p>Conversely, analyses for the overlap between the personal preference and the prudential norm yield a very different pattern of results. As <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table S9</ref> shows, overlap was lower for samples that, on average, endorsed greater collectivism. Also, overlap was more pronounced among samples that showed higher reports of meta-cognition. Furthermore, on the individual level, overlap between personal preferences and prudential norm was greater the more an individual endorsed individualist values and the less they endorsed collectivist values. Also, persons with higher need for cognition and greater conflict resolution focus showed greater overlap between personal preferences and prudential norms. Moreover, both on the sample-and individual-levels, outsider view in self-reflections was again associated with significantly less overlap between personal choice and prudential norms.</p><p>Overall, it appears that cultural orientation toward individualism and collectivism had opposite effects for the overlap between personal preferences and descriptive norms vs. prudential norms. On the other hand, the outsider reflective style had a consistent effect across both analysesi.e., the more the person distanced themselves and considered themselves from an outsider perspective in their reflections, the more likely they were to view their choice as distinct. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alignment procedure and replication of results using aligned factor scores</head><p>We relied on the alignment procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref> to ensure measurement invariance in each scale across sites. Alignment optimization adjusts factor loadings and intercepts to minimize group differences while preserving the overall measurement structure. This approach allows for the identification of approximate scalar invariance, facilitating meaningful cross-site comparisons with minimal bias despite potential heterogeneity in the sample. For individualism and collectivism, we followed a priori theorized model <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. The preliminary confirmatory factor analysis models largely confirmed the theorized model, with a minor modification. Specifically, across our samples, three factors represented individualism-'uniqueness &amp; personal identity,' 'independence and personal happiness,' and 'achievement,' whereas another factor represented collectivism-'group identity and relationships.' Psychometric analyses further indicated that initially theorized 'group support and well-being' facet consisting of 3 items does not fit well the overall structure and failed to show measurement invariance across cultural regions and was therefore omitted from further analyses. Alignment procedure supported the approximate invariance allowing regression and mean comparison across cultural regions. In India, the correlation between Achievement and Uniqueness factors was very high, r = .96, yet we retained the sample to ensure the completeness of the factor scores for further analysis.</p><p>For need for cognition, the scale included reverse-coded items. Therefore, we could test a bifactor two-factor model-a 'substantive' factor reflecting need for cognition and a 'method factor' where all items loaded positively irrespective of their meaning. Applying an exploratory SEM approach with target rotation followed by the alignment procedure yield strong support for approximate scalar measurement invariance.</p><p>For reflective, meta-cognitive, and problem-solution tendencies, alignment further largely confirmed approximate measurement invariance across sites for the three-factor model. Except for a high correlation between reflective and problem-seeking factors in Morocco, r = .91, the model fit was acceptable and only a small fracture of parameters was non-invariant (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  S10</ref> below). Note. All the models showed share of non-invariant parameters much lower than the maximum recommended 25% pointing to a higher approximate invariance.</p><p>We subsequently estimated the factor scores from the aligned models to replicate the patterns of main results. Because a short version of reflective, meta-cognitive, and problem-solution tendencies in Study 3 presented a challenge due to a large number of missing items, we performed one analysis with uniqueness, independence, achievement (markers of individualism), group identity (marker of collectivism), as well as need for cognition on participants from the three studies, and a separate analysis including meta-cognitive tendencies (outsider view, problem-solution focus, and perspectival meta-cognition) on samples from Studies 1-2. Results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S11</ref> replicated the main results, with some additional details. In all analyses, collectivism on both individual and group levels was significantly negatively related to internal preferences, though never enough to reverse the default response indicated in the intercept. Secondly, among the three individualism factors, it was independence that was chiefly associated with stronger endorsement of internal preferences on the individual-level, with less systematic support on the group level. Finally, we replicated the effect of outsider view reflective style being inversely related to internal preferences on the individual level, with some weaker support in the same direction on the group level. Additionally, on the group level, we observed some evidence that samples expressing greater preference for problem solution orientation were more likely to endorse internal preferences, whereas samples endorsing perspectival meta-cognition (incl. consideration of others' viewpoints) were less likely to endorse internal preferences. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S11</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Study 4</head><p>Whereas Studies 1-3 provided a broad and diverse samples, the external decision strategies in these studies were limited to friends' and communal advice, raising the question if the avoidance of external strategies extends to situations involving advice from family members-parents or siblings. One of the goals of the Supplementary Study 4 was to address this question. Second, samples in Studies 1-3 compared responses across countries, but were not sufficiently heterogeneous within a given sample to probe within-cultural differences. To address this question, Supplementary Study 4 specifically targeted ethnically divesre groups of North Americans, comparing patterns of results among the European-American and -Canadian samples with Asian-, African-, East Indian, and Hispanic-American/-Canadian samples, while simultaneously examining student and non-student samples, as well as Canadian and US samples. Finally, Studies 1-3 relied on a choice between a small subset of strategies, which may have forced participants to inflate the differences between otherwise similarly preferred strategies. TO address this concern, Supplementary Study simultaneously assessed decision preferences with a force choice method and via rating scales of internal and external strategies as reflecting good judgment-by asking participants to evaluate how wise and rational each strategy each. Further, to supplement rating of descriptive norms in Studies 1-3, participants in Supplementary Study 4 also rated the culturally acceptability of each strategy.</p></div>

To account for potential attrition and incomplete data, we aimed to recruit approximately 340 participants.</p><p>Participants were initially recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk; n = 342, Mage = 36 years, SD = 11.84 years) from the United States. Compensation was set at $1.75 USD per participant. The sample consisted of 147 males and 145 females, with 86.5% reporting at least some college education. The ethnic composition included 35 Asian-Americans and Hispanic Americans, and 247 African-and European-Americans. Gender distribution and education levels were comparable across these groups.

Among the Prolific participants, a significant subset (n = 37) resided in Canada, as determined by IP address geolocation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedure</head><p>The survey was administered online using Qualtrics. Participants were presented with four vignettes (see OSF for verbatim instructions and full vignettes; osf.io/vqrx2), each describing a protagonist facing a decision-making dilemma. For instance:</p><p>• Katherine: A student balancing her own study time with helping a struggling friend.</p><p>• Paul: A traveler deciding whether to give up his seat for an elderly woman, risking missing his friend's graduation. • Sophia: A recent graduate choosing between a job abroad and staying with her boyfriend.</p><p>• Ian: A high school senior deciding between two prestigious universities.</p><p>For each vignette, participants chose between two decision strategies:</p><p>• Internal: The protagonist deliberates independently, reflecting on personal experiences and knowledge.</p><p>• External: The protagonist consults others (friends, parents, siblings), making a decision based on their advice.</p><p>We note that the number of options was reduced to one internal and one external scenario for pragmatic reasons of accommodating additional elements in the study (see rating scales below). Specifically, we selected two options that corresponded to the most prevalent choices in the studies reported in main text.</p><p>For example, one vignette presented the following scenario:</p><p>Sophia and her boyfriend David have recently graduated from the University of Toronto. David has accepted a job offer in Toronto, while Sophia has been offered a prestigious job in another country. The couple has been dating for three years and is very happy together. If Sophia accepts the offer, they will live on opposite ends of the world, seeing each other only once a year due to the high cost of travel.</p><p>For each vignette, participants were presented with two decision strategies, labeled "A" and "B":</p><p>• A. Internal: [NAME] reflects independently on the situation, considering her personal experience and knowledge of herself and <ref type="bibr">[NAME]</ref>. She makes her decision based on this reflection, even if it contradicts external advice.</p><p>• B. External: [NAME] discusses the situation with friends who listen and offer advice.</p><p>[NAME] makes her decision based on these conversations, even if the advice diverges from her personal knowledge and experience.</p><p>The order of vignette and strategy presentation was randomized. Participants were asked to choose which strategy they considered (1) wiser, (2) more rational, (3) more culturally acceptable, and (4) more personally preferable. Here, the term 'rational' was employed as a proxy for a 'good' decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>.</p><p>Participants then re-read each vignette and rated each of the two strategies on five dimensions (1 = Not at all, 5 = Very much): intelligent, rational, acceptable to people in your culture, promoting openness to new and different ideas or opinions, and wise. The order of vignettes and dimensions was randomized.</p><p>Following the vignettes, participants completed the Individualism and Collectivism scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Scores were averaged to create two indices: collectivistic values (α = 0.92) and individualistic values (α = 0.88). Demographic questions concluded the survey.</p></div>

The model was specified as a mixed-effects generalized linear regression with a binomial distribution and logit link function. The model included random intercepts for both participants and the specific vignette.</p><p>The model was based on 2,879 observations, with the following model fit statistics: AIC = 3495.97, BIC = 3513.87, Pseudo-R² (total) = 0.052. The fixed intercept was estimated at 0.88 (SE = 0.15), indicating a significant baseline preference for internal strategies, z = 5.99, p &lt; .001. The random effects analysis revealed that the variance attributable to individual differences within each vignette/ID grouping was 0.32, while the variance between vignettes was 0.28.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal strategy as a cultural norm by Ethnicity, Sample, Residence, and Individualism / Collectivism</head><p>In our main analyses, we observed that the view of internal and external strategies as descriptive norms was closer to parity compared to the personal preferences and views of internal strategies as reflecting good judgment. Following on this observation, we explored which strategy participants viewed as more acceptable in one's culture. Baseline model tests (2,879 observations, Pseudo-R² (total) = 0.017) supported this assertion, with a non-significant fixed intercept at 0.08 (SE = 0.09), z = 0.90, p = .371. On average, participants were equally likely to endorse internal and external strategies as culturally acceptable, probability = .521, 95% CI [0.476, 0.565].

European-American and -Canadian participants (probability = .565, 95% CI [0.515, 0.614]) significantly endorsed internal strategies as acceptable to people in their culture, with the 95% CI not including zero. Conversely, the group of Asian, African-American, East Indian and Hispanic American participants were at parity in endorsing internal or external strategies as acceptable to people in their culture (probability = .484, 95% CI [0.436, 0.534]). <ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref> further showed that the ethnic group effect was more pronounced in the Ian and Paul vignettes (including siblings and parents, respectively), compared to the other vignettes (albeit with effects in the same direction). <ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rating scales instead of dichotomous choicerational, wise, acceptable in one's culture</head><p>So far, our results documented that American and Canadian crowdworkers and Canadian college students prefer internal strategies and are more likely to view them as rational and wise. Concurrently, opinions about cultural acceptability of internal and external strategies varied from this pattern of results, with opinions about cultural acceptability of each type of strategy closer to parity. We further observed some evidence of ethnic group differences in the US and Canada, with European-Americans and -Canadians more likely to endorse internal strategies. Finally, we observed that participants endorsing individualist values were more likely to endorse internal strategies, whereas participants endorsing collectivism values were less likely to endorse them. In short, we replicated all main results from the main manuscript, simultaneously documenting within-national group differences. However, one important question remains. By design, we relied on force-choice responses between sets of two opinions. Yet, it is possible that both strategies are viewed as signs of good judgment, and the observed dominance of internal strategies may be merely an artifact of the force-choice nature of our experimental set-up. To address this limitation, we will turn to rating scales, whereby participants rated each strategy in terms of its rationality, wisdom, and cultural acceptability. .04, p &lt; .001. This effect was further qualified by a significant Strategy X Ethnic Group interaction, t(df = 5587) = 3.86, p &lt; .001. As <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref> shows, the attribution of rationality to internal (vs. external) strategies was more pronounced for European-American/-Canadian participants, compared to other ethnic groups in the sample. Further, as simple slope results in <ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref> show, view of internal (vs. external) strategy as more rational was more pronounced for participants endorsing individualist values, Strategy X Individualism interaction, t(df = 5735) = 6.90, p &lt; .001, and less pronounced for participants endorsing collectivist values, Strategy X Collectivism interaction, t(df = 5735) = 12.61, p &lt; .001. <ref type="figure">Figures S7-S8</ref> also show that only at the highest collectivism does the preference for external over internal strategies as rational reverse-a rare event in this data.  <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref> shows, the attribution of wisdom to internal (vs. external) strategies was more pronounced for European-American/-Canadian participants, compared to other ethnic groups in the sample. Further, as simple slope results in <ref type="figure">Figure S9</ref> show, view of internal (vs. external) strategy as wiser was more pronounced for participants endorsing individualist values, Strategy X Individualism interaction, t(df = 5735) = 8.51, p &lt; .001, and less pronounced for participants endorsing collectivist values, Strategy X Collectivism interaction, t(df = 5735) = 12.78, p &lt; .001. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures S9-S10</ref> also shows that only at the lowest individualism and highest collectivism does the preference for external over internal strategies as wise reverse.</p><p>Culturally acceptable.

Critically, we observed a reversal of the pattern of preferences for internal vs. external strategies here: Participants viewed external strategies to be more acceptable in their culture (M = 3.99, 95%CI <ref type="bibr">[3.95, 4</ref>.02]) compared to internal strategies (M = 3.89, 95%CI [3.79, 3.87]), t(df = 5752) = 5.84, p &lt; .001. This difference was in turn qualified by ethnic group interaction, t(df = 5590) = 3.35, p = .001. As <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref> shows, Non-European-American/-Canadian participants viewed external strategies as more culturally acceptable than internal strategies, z = 6.53, p &lt; .001, whereas for European-American/-Canadian participants both strategies appeared similarly acceptable, z = 1.47, p = .142. Finally, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  S11</ref> demonstrates, view of external (vs. internal) strategy as culturally acceptable was more pronounced for participants endorsing individualist values, Strategy X Individualism interaction, t(df = 5738) = 2.36, p = .018, and was largely comparable across the spectrum of collectivist values, Strategy X Collectivism interaction, t(df = 5738) = 1.62, p = .110. <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>.

Supplementary Study 4 replicated key results from the main manuscript, simultaneously evaluating rating-based (vs. force-choice) assessment of each strategy. Regardless of modality, participants viewed internal strategies as wiser and more rational, even though they believed that both strategies were equally culturally acceptable. Moreover, in each case, individualism was associated with stronger preference for internal strategies, and collectivism was associated with weaker preference. Critically, our data suggested that a reversal in preferences for external (rather than internal) strategies, akin to textbook-portrayals of individuals in collectivist communities, can only be expected at the highest possible level of the collectivism scale-a rare event in the present samples. Additionally, we observed systematic group-level differences in North America, with European-American and -Canadian participants showing a stronger preference for internal strategies compared to the Asian-, African-, East Indian-American, or Hispanic minority groups. <ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref>.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">We performed similar analyses for intuitive preferences: 2% were accounted for by sample, 20% were accounted for by inter-individual differences, and 3.6% by scenario-specific variability. Similarly, 3.2%, 25.2%, and 3.5% of the variance in nomination of intuitive strategies as a wise choice were accounted for by sample, individual differences, and scenario-specific variability, respectively.</note>
