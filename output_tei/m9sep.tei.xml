			<abstract>
				<p>Social norms shape a vast range of human behaviors, from everyday interactions to major life choices. Yet, existing theories of norm emergence typically focus either on why certain norms arise (substantive properties) or on how they spread and persist (dynamical properties), often making conflicting assumptions. Here, we propose a unified account in which norms prescribing how one ought to act emerge naturally from the fundamental algorithms that guide individual learning-whether in social or non-social settings. Our account builds on recent advances in decision-making and emotion research that have highlighted &apos;actor-critic&apos; models as a core mechanism of learning from feedback. We extend this mechanism to social settings by assuming that it is not only we who critique our actions, others critique our actions as well. By simulating this interindividual form of learning, we show that it uniquely produces group behavior that exhibits both substantive and dynamical properties of realworld social norms, including prosociality, ingroup bias, stickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity. Our framework thus offers a uniquely parsimonious way to bridge the gap between individual learning and group behavior.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Human behavior is everywhere regulated by social norms that dictate actions in both mundane contexts (e.g., tipping) and major life decisions (e.g., choosing a life partner; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Etcheverry &amp; Agnew, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Kohler et al., 2001</ref>). Many different accounts have been offered for how such norms emerge, but each has sought to explain different properties of norms, relying on varied and often contradictory assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Gelfand et al., 2024)</ref>. Here, we show how different properties of social norms that previously received different explanations can be coherently and parsimoniously explained, specifically by leveraging advances in research on how humans generally learn how to act, whether in social or non-social settings.</p><p>We focus on a class of algorithms-'actor-critic' reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Sutton &amp; Barto, 2018</ref>)-that is proving increasingly useful for explaining how humans learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Biderman &amp; Shohamy, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Biderman et al., 2023)</ref> and what role emotions and moods play in this regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bennett et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Emanuel &amp; Eldar, 2023)</ref>. As implied by its name, an actor-critic agent is composed of two components: an actor that takes actions, and a critic that evaluates them. This compartmentalization makes it natural to convert actor-critic into an interindividual learning algorithm. All we need to assume is that agents do not only critique their own actions but also those of others. We thus propose a social adaptation of actor-critic learning.</p><p>As we will demonstrate, this interindividual learning model uniquely generates group behavior that exhibits key properties of human social norms, including prosociality, ingroup bias, stickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity. The present work thus shows how a basic cognitive mechanism by which individuals learn from reinforcement offers a uniquely coherent and parsimonious account of the emergence of norms within social groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>This work has three main aims. First, it aims to establish the need for a unified explanation of the emergence of social norms. Second, it aims to propose an interindividual adaptation of actor-critic learning for modeling group behavior. Thirdly, it aims to show that this model can account for well-established properties of human social norms.</p><p>Consequently, the paper is organized into three main sections. After defining the scope of the present work, the first section provides a brief overview of existing research on social norms, distinguishing between different kinds of accounts, and identifying the key properties each sought to explain. The second section presents the structure and basic behavior of the interindividual actor-critic model, and reviews evidence supporting its underlying assumptions. The third section then presents simulation results demonstrating how the interindividual actor-critic can coherently account for properties of norms that have so far received disparate, sometimes inconsistent explanations. Finally, the general discussion outlines future directions for empirical and theoretical research, including implementation of the model in more realistic network structures, and its integration with more advanced mechanisms of social cognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scope of the present work</head><p>Most existing social norm research recognizes three types of norms: descriptive norms, prescriptive norms, and conventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bicchieri, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Hawkins et al., 2019)</ref>. Descriptive norms, such as fashions or customs, are behaviors that are prevalent within a community, but there is no obligation for people to follow them. Prescriptive norms, in contrast, are shared understandings about how people ought to act, specifying which actions are obligatory, permitted, or forbidden <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Crawford &amp; Ostrom, 1995)</ref>. Violations of prescriptive norms are therefore often punished <ref type="bibr">(Fehr &amp; Fishbacher, 2004)</ref>. Typical examples include not littering in public spaces, or helping someone in need. Finally, conventions are means for coordination, which ensure that different people have similar interpretations for a given action (e.g., the meaning of body language; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Hawkins et al., 2019</ref>).</p><p>It has often been observed, however, that behaviors commonly classified as descriptive norms or conventions frequently exhibit a prescriptive aspect <ref type="bibr">(Pezepiorka et al., 2022)</ref>. For instance, driving on the right side of the road may appear merely as a coordination problem, but drivers expect others to comply with this convention, and violating this expectation entails severe penalties <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Hawkins et al., 2019)</ref>. Similarly, changing fashions are often referred to as descriptive norms, but not following them can violate peers' expectations and may get punished by exclusion.</p><p>Therefore, instead of adhering to the common categorization, we more precisely define the norms we aim to explain as group behaviors that are both prevalent and expected, in the sense that not following them is likely to induce retribution from others. Such group behaviors satisfy the criteria for normative regularities recently proposed by researchers of normative behavior in animals <ref type="bibr">(Westra et al., 2024)</ref>. In humans, they may best be thought of as precursors of prescriptive norms, since they include all the necessary ingredients for the emergence of a prescriptive norm but may not yet be explicitly represented as such.</p><p>A comprehensive explanation of such group behaviors necessitates a modeling framework that evaluates behaviors as good or bad to varying extents. Reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited for this task since it explicitly quantifies the goodness of a behavior as the amount of reward it leads to. Negative outcomes and costs can also be accounted for as negative rewards. However, the space of multi-agent reinforcement learning models is vast <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Du et al., 2023)</ref>. This means that almost any behavior can likely be explained by more than one model. To circumvent this problem, we restrict ourselves to a relatively simple form of reinforcement learning that is grounded in the cognitive science of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Biderman &amp; Shohamy, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Biderman et al., 2023)</ref> and emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bennett et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Emanuel &amp; Eldar, 2023)</ref>. This parsimonious modeling approach enables us to conduct multi-agent simulations while making few new assumptions, all of which we make explicit.</p><p>At the same time, the simplicity of our modeling approach means that we do not aim to capture every phenomenon that takes place at the micro-level of interpersonal interactions.</p><p>Studies of such interactions have revealed complexity that goes substantially beyond simple reinforcement learning. Various works established the involvement of planning and strategic adaptation of one's behavior according to estimates of others' values, goals, and likely behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Wu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barnby et al., 2022)</ref>. Bayesian inference in this regard is also thought to enable people to factor in uncertainty and prior knowledge concerning others <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Devaine et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">FeldmanHall &amp; Shenhav, 2019)</ref>. Such advanced cognitions are readily incorporated in reinforcement learning, but how to apply them in multi-agent models is a difficult and important open question. In the discussion section, we describe several potential directions for combining such advanced functions with the simpler model we propose here.</p><p>At the macro-level of group behavior, however, we show that our simple model can already explain well-established properties of social norms that are not explained by existing multiagent models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dominant accounts of norm emergence</head><p>Explanations of how social norms come into being center around two areas of focus: their substance and their dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Gelfand et al., 2024)</ref>. Substantive accounts seek to explain why particular norms emerge and not others. A main focus in this regard has been to explain why norms tend to promote prosocial behavior, such as cooperation, altruism, fairness, equality, and punishing behaviors against non-complying others <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(House, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Ostrom, 2000)</ref>. These properties, it is thought, cannot entirely be explained by approaches such as cooperative game theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Bullinger et al., 2024)</ref> that assume people only strive to maximize their self-interest <ref type="bibr">(Fehr &amp; Schutenberger, 2018)</ref>. This is particularly evident in third-party punishment games where people incur costs to punish others for disadvantaging other players. Self-interest cannot explain this behavior because all players involved remain anonymous and there is no future interaction between the players. Therefore, the most common explanation for the substantive properties of norms relies on a combination of "norm psychology"our inherent inclination, from early childhood, to perceive and act according to what is considered right or wrong in our environmentand evolutionary forces, which make prosocial norms more prevalent over time due to their contribution to a group's survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Sripada et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Tomasello, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">House, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Chudek &amp; Henrich, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kimbrough &amp; Vostroknov, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Kelly &amp; Davis, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bicchieri et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Dynamical approaches, meanwhile, investigate the processes that lead to the emergence, persistence, and fading of norms, regardless of what those norms are. This is of particular interest when there are multiple possible equilibria and no guaranteed agreement within groups, when the choice between actions is arbitrary <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baronchelli, 2018)</ref>, and when environmental changes make a previously established norm maladaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Young, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Gelfand et al., 2024</ref>. A key question in such cases is how society arrives at a particular consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baronchelli, 2018)</ref>. Although centralized institutions likely play a role <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(McCombs, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Keans et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Oliver, 1993)</ref>, most accounts posit that consensus primarily evolves in a bottom-up manner, as a result of spontaneous interactions between group members <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Garrod &amp; Doherty, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Boyd &amp; Richerson;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">, Jones, 1984</ref>.</p><p>There are two prominent approaches to modeling such interindividual interactions. The first, evolutionary game theory, assumes that agents seek to maximize personal gains. It thus centers on modeling how an agent's utility function depends on the choices made by other group members <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Young, 2015)</ref>. The second type of approach, which includes contagion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Moran, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Clifford &amp; Sudbury, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr">Holly &amp; Ligget, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bikhchandani et al., 1992)</ref> and social influence theory <ref type="bibr">(Flasche et al., 2017)</ref>, argues that consensus is driven by an inherent motivation to imitate others. Such models assume that any interaction between individuals drives their behaviors, preferences, or opinions closer together.</p><p>In sum, a multiplicity of accounts have been proposed to explain substantive and dynamical properties of social norms, yet a unified account is lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Gelfand et al., 2024)</ref>. This is a problem for two reasons. The first is that each account only explains a subset of social norm properties, whereas combining the different accounts together results in inconsistencies that stem from their contradictory assumptions. Specifically, the idea of norm psychology that norms are held in place due to individuals' inherent motivation to adhere to prevalent norms is at odds with the claim of evolutionary and cooperative game theory that norms are held in place due to individuals' pursuit of self-interest. And neither of the former explanations is consistent with the idea that norms spread due to the motivation to imitate others.</p><p>The second reason we should strive for a unified account of social norms is the principle of parsimony. Occam's razor entails that in explaining a multifaceted phenomenon we should favor the simplest possible account, provided that it explains as many properties of the phenomenon as the more complicated, multiple-explanations account. For the same reason, we should also give priority to accounts whose key assumptions originate not in an attempt to explain the phenomenon in question, but in prior research that aimed to explain other independent phenomena. In this respect, accounts of group behavior that rely on basic cognitive science research offer a particularly promising avenue <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Cushman &amp; Gershman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baek et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">FeldmanHall &amp; Nassar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Hawkins et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Hawkins et al., 2023)</ref>. A model that relies on established findings about how people learn and make decisions could potentially require little to no new assumptions to explain the emergence of social norms. Here we use this approach to offer a parsimonious, unified explanation of the substantive and dynamical properties of social norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Properties of social norms</head><p>Having established the need for a unified explanation of social norms, we next review the key properties of norms that need to be explained. Building on prior work, we identify two substantive (prosociality, ingroup bias) and three dynamical (stickiness, self-reinforcement, local conformity / global diversity) properties. Below we describe the empirical evidence establishing each of these properties as fundamental to social norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prosociality</head><p>Norms that foster prosocial behavior have emerged many times in human history <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(House et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Curry et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">House et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Rochat et al., 2009)</ref>. Prosocial behavior is also widely evident in controlled experiments employing social decision tasks. In such tasks, people often choose to cooperate in situations where selfish agents would choose to free ride <ref type="bibr">(Fehr &amp; Fishbacher, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fehr &amp; Gachter, 2000)</ref>. This finding has been corroborated in 15 different populations tested across four continents <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Henrich et al., 2006)</ref>. Notably, prosocial norms vary across populations-one community may prioritize recycling over tithing, while another may do the reverse <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Henrich &amp; Muthukrishna, 2021)</ref>. And also within a given population, careful analysis shows that no single norm can fully explain all prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Fehr &amp; Schurtenberger, 2018)</ref>, indicating that multiple prosocial norms must be involved. This is not to say that any individual norm must be prosocial, but the ubiquity and diversity of prosocial norms entails that an explanation of how social norms emerge must give weight to prosocial motivations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ingroup favoritism</head><p>Prosocial behavior does not benefit everyone equally. A meta-analysis of 168 studies shows that people often predominantly benefit others whom they consider a part of their group <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Balliet et al., 2014)</ref>. Evidence that such ingroup favoritism is driven by social norms has been found across observational and causal studies, in both naturalistic intergroup contexts and minimal group paradigms where strangers are arbitrarily assigned into groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Iacoviello &amp; Spears, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Iacoviello et al., 2017)</ref>. Some have taken these findings as evidence for a generic norm that one's group should be favored <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Sparks et al., 2017)</ref>, but how such a norm emerges remains unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Dunham, 2018)</ref>. Most importantly, such a generic norm does not explain why ingroup favoritism vanishes when the potential for within-group reciprocity is denied <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Dunham, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Jin et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Yamagishi &amp; Mifune, 2009)</ref>. Nor can it explain the great diversity that exists in ingroup favoritism across different types of behaviors and contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Spears, 2021)</ref>. A more compelling assumption is thus that the mechanisms by which prosocial norms emerge give greater weight to the benefit of people with whom one more frequently interacts, or at least expects to interact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stickiness</head><p>An important property distinguishing established norms from behaviors that are merely prevalent, is that people tend to stick to them even when they seem disadvantageous or arbitrary <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Horne &amp; Mollborn, 2020)</ref>. This has been shown in both field <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Welsch, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Schneider &amp; van der Linden, 2023)</ref> and laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Pryor et al., 2019)</ref> studies. In the lab, for instance, people continue to stick to a prosocial norm that was induced by a tax even after the tax is removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Farrow &amp; Romaniuc, 2019)</ref>. In real-world settings, multiple occurrences have been documented where societies adopted a norm of medical distrust due to mistreatment, and persisted in their distrust long after it was advantageous to do so despite costs to their health <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Gelfand et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Lowes &amp; Montero, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Ramos-Toro, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alsan &amp; Wanamaker, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martinez-Bravo &amp; Steggman, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Stickiness is important because groups might adopt norms that initially seem advantageous but are later found out to be disadvantageous. This could happen, for instance, because certain courses of action were initially more salient, easier to implement, or had clearer outcomes. Assessments of benefits and costs can also change with time, whether due to objective changes to the environment or due to newly gained knowledge. Indeed, the harms of second-hand smoking were unknown when public smoking first became widespread. The critical question, then, is why it took so many years for smoking in public spaces to become unacceptable even after the harms to non-smokers were revealed <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Nyborg &amp; Rege, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Cummings &amp; Proctor, 2014)</ref>. Put more generally, the question of stickiness is why established norms tend to persist in conditions in which they would not have arisen in the first place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-reinforcement</head><p>When a new norm starts to emerge, the more people follow it, the more people are compelled to follow it <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Young, 2015)</ref>. That is why societal changefor example, in attitudes towards smoking, same-sex marriage, marijuana use, and even footbindingtends to spread rapidly once it initiates <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Tribou &amp; Collins, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Mackie, 1996)</ref>. Similarly, empirical work concerning climate change shows that people are more likely to adopt environmentally friendly practices if many others adopt them <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Welsch, 2022)</ref>. And lab experiments show that people align their preferences in accordance with arbitrary norms manipulated by the experimenters <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Pryor et al., 2019)</ref>, with rapid change occurring once support for a new norm among group members reaches a critical threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Centola et al., 2018)</ref>. Although the mechanism behind this 'tipping point' phenomenon is yet unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andrighetto &amp; Vriens, 2022)</ref>, the S-shaped curve it typically follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Rogers, 1962)</ref> is most consistent with acceleration due to self-reinforcement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local conformity / global diversity</head><p>Another well-established property of social norms is their tendency to produce uniformity of behavior within groups, but diversity across groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Young, 2015)</ref>. This is true not only for conventions like language <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Hawkins et al., 2019)</ref> but also for norms that prescribe value judgments and economic preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Young &amp; Burke, 2001)</ref>. A particularly well-studied example of this property manifests in crop-sharing agreements, whereby a landlord leases land to a farmer in exchange for a fixed share of the crops. Field studies reveal that the landlord's share remains similar across contracts within a local community, but differs widely across communities. Although local economic factors like soil quality systematically influence the landlord's share, such factors do not offer a sufficient explanation for the observed uniformity within communities, nor for the sharp changes between them. This observation has led to the conclusion that social norms are paramount in dictating the proportion of crops given to landlords. That these norms tend to be locally uniform but globally diverse suggests that they are shaped by repeated social interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The interindividual actor-critic model</head><p>As we have seen, one common ground across most accounts of social norms is the idea that norms emerge from repeated interactions among group members. Presumably, people learn from these interactions how they ought to act in different situations. To model this process, we thus turn to the basic cognitive science of learning, and consult the algorithms by which people learn how they ought to act, whether in social or non-social settings. Such algorithms are most often specified using the general framework of reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Barto, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Montague, Dayan, Person, &amp; Sejnowski, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schultz, Dayan, &amp; Montague, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Daw, Niv, &amp; Dayan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Niv, 2009)</ref>. Following a brief description of the reinforcement-learning framework, we will focus on a popular reinforcement-learning algorithm that is increasingly supported by a wide range of studies on learning, decisionmaking, and emotions, and that is highly suitable for modeling interindividual learningthe advantage actor-critic model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The basics of reinforcement learning</head><p>Reinforcement learning is a computational framework that describes how an agent can learn from experience to maximize its expected cumulative reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Sutton &amp; Barto, 2018)</ref>. A reinforcement learning problem is typically specified as a Markov Decision Process, which consists of a set of states the agent may occupy (denoted ), a set of actions it may take in each state (denoted ), and scalar rewards (denoted ) that are associated with different states and actions. By sampling different actions and learning from their outcomes, a reinforcement learning agent updates its action-selection policy (denoted , the probability of taking different actions in each state) so as to reach states and perform actions that are associated with high expected cumulative reward.

Before reviewing this evidence, we briefly describe a simple version of this algorithm.</p><p>An actor-critic agent is composed of two components: an 'actor' that chooses actions, and a 'critic' that evaluates them ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). Each time step, the actor chooses an action according to the agent's policy. The critic then observes the outcome and accordingly evaluates the action. Finally, the critic transmits its evaluation to the actor, which updates the policy accordingly.</p><p>Importantly, the critic's evaluation consists of an estimate of the 'advantage' (denoted ) that the chosen action conferred over and above what was expected from the state in which the action was taken:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( , ) ≡ ( , ) − ( )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>which, given Eq. 4, can be estimated as the temporal difference error:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">̂( , ) = +̂( +1 ) −̂( )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Thus, in addition to updating the policy, the estimated advantage also serves to update state value estimations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">̂( ) ←̂( ) +̂( , )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Given the correspondence between values of actions and states (Eq. 3), advantage can be shown to capture the difference between the values of chosen ( ) and unchosen (̃) actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bennett et al., 2022)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">( , ) = ( , ) − ∑ ( | ) ( , ) = ∑ (̃| )( ( , ) − (̃, ))<label>(8)</label></formula><p>≠ A positive advantage means that the chosen action's value exceeds the value of alternative actions represented in the policy, whereas a negative advantage means that there are other, more desirable actions. In both cases, a rational agent should strive to eliminate advantageby eliminating other actions from the policy in the former case, and eliminating the chosen action in the latter case. Hence, the actor will increase or decrease its propensity to take the chosen action according to the sign of the advantage computed by the critic.</p><p>This adaptation of the policy is achieved by updating policy parameters using stochastic gradient descent <ref type="bibr">(Williams, 1992)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">← + ∇ ( | )̂( , )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where is a learning rate between 0 and 1, and ∇ ( | ) is the gradient of the policy with respect to .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A concrete example of actor-critic learning</head><p>Consider an agent who is riding the train and trying to decide how to pass the time ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure   1B</ref>). She has a phone that plays music, but no earphones. Thus, she may either play music out loud or give up on listening to music. These options constitute the two actions she can take in her current state, the state of riding the train. Each time she rides the train, her actor component chooses one of these actions according to her action-selection policy . Once the action is taken, the agent's critic component evaluates its advantagethe reward r that followed the action, for instance the pleasure of listening to music, minus the currently estimated value of riding the train, . This latter value is continuously updated to represent the average reward obtained in previous train rides, irrespective of whether music was played. If the advantage is positive, the actor shifts the policy in favor of the chosen action,</p><p>whereas if the advantage is negative, it shifts the policy in the opposite direction.</p><p>Since this scenario lacks negative consequences for playing music out loud, the agent will increasingly favor this action as experience accumulates. Learning will converge once the agent always plays music and fully expects to enjoy it. At this point, the value of riding the train equals the reward of playing music, and thus, the advantage of playing music nullifies ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence for actor-critic learning in humans</head><p>Different versions of this basic algorithm vary in how the advantage conferred by a given action is estimated. However, they all share a key property, which is that their propensity to select a given action is determined by a relative evaluation of the action's outcomes; relative, that is, to an expectation that reflects the outcomes of all actions that have previously been taken from the same state (e.g., relative to an average of previous train rides wherein the actor did or did not play music). This property receives strong empirical support from studies showing that people's propensity to select an action is determined by how the action's prior outcomes compared with those of other actions taken in the same phase of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Biderman &amp; Shohamy, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Solomyak et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bavard &amp; Palminteri, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Biderman et al., 2023)</ref>. Moreover, this relative evaluation is consistent with people's emotional responses to actions, which typically reflect not an action's outcome per se, but rather, the advantage it conferred over alternative actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bennett et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Emanuel &amp; Eldar, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, actor-critic learning also receives empirical support from electrophysiological and brain-imaging studies indicating that separate neural populations in the basal ganglia serve as actor and critic <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Kaplan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">O'Doherty et al., 2004)</ref>. Actor-critic learning thus offers a plausible algorithm by which people learn how to act.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The interindividual actor-critic</head><p>The two components of actor-critic learning -the actor and the critic -are normally thought to be implemented by one and the same person. There is no reason, however, that they cannot be implemented by different individuals. Critics just need to be able to observe actors' actions and communicate their evaluations as to the advantage or disadvantage the actions granted them. Actors can then adjust their policies based on an evaluation that factors in how all critics were affected.</p><p>Recent evidence supporting such interindividual learning comes from advances in the study of emotions. Emotions like anger and gratitude, together with the reciprocating behavior (e.g., retribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Nussbaum, 2016)</ref>) and verbal communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Heyes et al., 2020)</ref> they induce, are primary means by which people signal how others' actions affected them <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Emanuel &amp; Eldar, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Garcia-Ponce et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Asif, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Lench et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Levine 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Nesse &amp; Ellsworth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Frijda, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Algoe et al., 2016)</ref>.

Furthermore, such emotional responses act as reinforcers, meaning that people's propensity to repeat actions changes based on whether others responded to them positively or negatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Algoe et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Farrow &amp; Romaniuc, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Fehr &amp; Gächter, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Jones et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Owen et al., 2012</ref>; although in some cases they also act as communicative signals, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ho et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Ho et al., , 2019</ref>. Emotions, then, communicate critics' evaluations and thereby shape actors' policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formalization of the model</head><p>To formalize the model, we consider that a given action may yield a particular reward for the acting agent ( self ) and a potentially different reward for other agents ( other ; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref>).</p><p>Correspondingly, agents learn two expected values, one that applies when they act ( ), and another for when other agents act ( other ). Whenever an agent acts, others with whom it interacts transmit their evaluation of the action, which represents the advantage conferred to them:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">̂o ther ( | ) = other, +̂o ther ( +1 ) −̂o ther ( )<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The acting agent's critic then sums these evaluations with the direct reward it received, to compute the action's advantage:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">̂( | ) = self, + ̂( +1 ) + ∑ other, −̂( )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where iterates over all other agents with whom the acting agents interacts, and denotes the weight the agent gives to others' evaluations relative to their own. Here we assume that typically ranges between 0 and 1, although there are circumstances where agents may care about others' wellbeing more than their own ( 1; e.g., parents and children), or where people derive pleasure from others' displeasure ( &lt; 0; e.g., antisocial personality disorder).</p><p>Finally, the acting agent updates its value estimate and policy as in traditional actor-critic learning. In this way, acting agents shape their policy to give weight to both their own rewards and to those of others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A concrete example of the interindividual actor-critic</head><p>Consider again the case of playing music out loud when riding the train, except that now that there is another person there ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>). And while the person playing the music enjoys it ( self 0), the other person on the train is disturbed ( other &lt; 0). According to actor-critic learning, for this latter person's displeasure to outweigh the acting person's pleasure three criteria need to be met. First, the other person's discomfort must outweigh the pleasure derived by the music player. Second, the other's negative evaluation needs to be communicated. And, third, the person playing the music must give weight to the other's evaluations. Formally, all three criteria manifest in the condition other self .</p><p>We present simulations of two example scenarios in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, one where this condition holds and one where it does not. In both scenarios, the music player's pleasure ( self = 5) is set as lower in magnitude than the other's displeasure ( other = −10), and the music player starts out with a random policy ( play music = 0.5). In the first, 'selfish' scenario, the other person starts out not expecting to be disturbed ( other = 0), but the music player cares little for what the other person feels (or, equivalently, the other person does not express their feeling clearly; both cases can be modelled by setting to a low value, such as 0.2).</p><p>Consequently, the music player evaluates playing music as advantageous (i.e., 0), and thus learns to consistently play music. The other person therefore learns to expect to be disturbed. The end result is a complete adoption of the behavior of playing music out loud, both in terms of the music player's policy ( play music → 1) and in the sense that the other person expects this ( other → −10) and thus no longer objects ( other → 0). This cessation of feedback matches empirical findings that people withdraw feedback once behavior matches their expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Isbell et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>In the second, 'altruistic' scenario, the music player places a higher weight on the other's feelings ( = 0.8). She thus evaluates playing music as disadvantageous. Consequently, she learns to not play music ( play music → 0), and both people come to expect neither pleasure nor displeasure from the trip ( , other → 0).</p><p>These simulations are of course only toy examples meant to illustrate how the algorithm works. They thus do not account for myriad other processes that could be involved in real life. For example, the music player could preemptively adjust her policy by simulating how various actions might affect the other person's emotions. Such mental simulation is enabled by our capacity to infer what other people want and how they are likely to feel and act <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(FeldmanHall &amp; Nassar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Wu et al., 2022)</ref>. Mental simulation can thus enable interindividual actor-critic learning to take place without others actually expressing their evaluations. Guidance from parents, other educators, and public signs could also play a role in shaping behavior. There may even be a fine in place for generating noise. In the discussion section, we consider how the interindividual actor-critic may interact with such higher-order processes. Model and simulated environment. The acting agent acts, and the other agent communicates an evaluation ( other ) of how the action affected them ( other ) relative to how they expected to be affected when another agent is acting ( other ). The critic component of the actor treats other as another reward, on top of its direct reward ( self ), but moderated by to account for factors such as the weight the actor gives to others' evaluations. Σ denotes a sum over the evaluations of all critics with whom the actor interacts. B. An example simulated environment. In the state of 'riding the train', the action of playing music is moderately pleasurable to the actor ( self = 5) but greatly disturbs the other agent ( other = −10), while doing nothing yields no rewards. C. Learning curves, averaged over 1000 simulations, for each of two scenarios. In the 'selfish' scenario, the acting agent give's a low weight to other agents' evaluations ( = 0.2). Consequently, she learns to play music on the train, and the other agent learns that being disturbed is to be expected ( other ≪ 0). The other agent therefore stops communicating negative evaluations ( other → 0). In the 'altruistic' scenario the acting agent cares highly about the other agent ( = 0.8), and therefore learns to avoid playing music, for when it does, it receives negative evaluations from the other agent. For simplicity, advantages are only shown for the action of playing music.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">+ INTERINDIVIDUAL ACTOR-CRITIC</formula><p>This additional complexity notwithstanding, the simulations illustrate two principles governing the behavior of the interindividual actor-critic.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation to prior multi-agent models</head><p>The predominance of self-interest in guiding human behavior, together with the ubiquity of prosocial norms that cannot be reduced to self-interest, means that modeling the emergence of norms requires agents that give weight both to their own interests and to those of others. The majority of existing multi-agent models are unsuitable for this purpose because they assume that all agents have a single objective, whether it is to maximize their own payoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Skyrms, 2001)</ref>, discover a globally optimal policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Zhang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Zhang et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Yu &amp; Thompson, 2024)</ref>, accurately infer the state of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(DeGroot, 1974)</ref>, or succeed in coordinating or communicating with other agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Steels, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Lazaridou et al., 2016</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baronchelli et al., 2006)</ref> while minimize associated costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Hawkins et al., 2023)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explaining the emergence of social norms</head><p>To the extent that members of a social group repeatedly interact with one another, interindividual actor-critic learning naturally drives them to have similar behavioral policies and expectations. This is because members' policies are shaped by how their actions are evaluated by similar sets of people, and their expectations adapt to how similar sets of people behave. Uniformity of behavior and expectations is, of course, a hallmark of social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Burke &amp; Young, 2011)</ref>. But for such uniformity to explain real-world social norms, it needs to capture their substantive and dynamical properties. We next show how interindividual actor-critic learning explains five key properties of social norms: prosociality, ingroup favoritism, stickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prosociality</head><p>Prosocialitythe tendency of individuals to act for the benefit of others, even at a personal costis often tested in scenarios where there is a conflict between one's self-interest and that of others. Here, we consider a choice between a selfish action, which greatly benefits the actor but slightly harms others, and a prosocial action, which modestly benefits both ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A)</ref>. This choice is known as the "prosocial choice task", typically used to demonstrate prosociality in primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Cronin, 2012)</ref>. It resembles various social dilemmas from game theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Ostrom, 2000)</ref>, except that here outcomes are not directly contingent on others' actions.</p><p>Simulating this scenario shows that for prosocial behavior to emerge in interindividual actor-critic learning, actors must interact with a sufficient number of other agents, and they must give sufficient weight to their evaluations ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>). In contrast, if agents interact with few others and do not weight their evaluations highly, they learn to act selfishly. Finally, in intermediate scenarios where the two actions are roughly equally advantageous, the group does not come to favor either action, such that preferences are randomly distributed within the group <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3C, right panel)</ref>.</p><p>The communication of negative evaluations in response to others' selfish actions in the simulation can be seen as a form of punishment, aligning with how humans tend to punish non-cooperating individuals in social games <ref type="bibr">(Fehr &amp; Gächter, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1992</ref>). An important difference from prior models involving punishment, however, is that here, punishment occurs spontaneously, is not motivated by a utilitarian calculation, and does not require coordinated action. Additionally, behavior is also driven in the present model by positive feedback, such as expressions of gratitude, which is received when agents' actions benefit others.</p><p>Thus, prosocial behavior naturally emerges from interindividual actor-critic learning whenever the conditionsreward outcomes, number of connections, and the weight given to others' feedbackmake it so that acting for the benefit of others yields a greater advantage than acting selfishly.

We thus consider a simple example of a conflict between ingroup and universal interests. Although the question of how to define a social group is widely debated (Epstein, 2019), here we only rely on two common assumptions. First, that people interact more frequently with members of their own group. Second, that the consequences of actions can be group specific.</p><p>We thus divide our simulated agents into two equal-size groups. Each agent acts in turn, choosing between an ingroup-favoring action, which greatly benefits ingroup members but slightly harms others, and a universally beneficial action, which benefits everyone equally.</p><p>Following every action, all agents evaluate it, update their values, and the actor updates its policy while accounting for others' evaluations. Since social feedback in the interindividual actor-critic is passed through social interaction, agents only give weight to the outcomes incurred by agents they interact with, whereas negative consequences to other agents are ignored. Ingroup favoritism thus emerges to the extent that agents predominantly interact within, as opposed to between, groups.</p><p>The ratio of within to between group interactions defines the social network's modularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Newman, 2006</ref>; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>). Thus, networks with higher modularity exhibit more ingroup favoritism than networks with low modularity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4B,C)</ref>. And, as can be expected, this impact of modularity is enhanced if agents give a higher weight to others' evaluations (i.e., a higher ). Actors interact more with agents from their own group. Their actions may influence everyone (blue arrows) but only those with whom they interact can transmit their evaluations (magenta arrows). Actors may choose between an action that benefits the ingroup ( ingroup = 0.75) but harms the outgroup ( outgroup = −0.25), and a universally beneficial action that modestly benefits everyone ( = 0.5).

Note though, that repeated interactions with the same individual are not required for ingroup favoritism to emerge in our simulation. In this sense, the interindividual actor-critic offers a potential mechanism for the emergence of what has been called "indirect reciprocity" ("I help you and somebody else helps me"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Balliet et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Nowak &amp; Sigmund, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic properties of norms</head><p>The interindividual actor-critic model is well suited to explain complex norm dynamics because expectations in the model are shaped by existing behavioral policies, which are in turn shaped by how present expectations influence advantage learning. In the computation of advantage, expectations offer a reference point with respect to which outcomes are evaluated.</p><p>The impact of this reference point may be particularly important due to the well-established finding that losses loom larger than gains (i.e., loss aversion; <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, in subsequent simulations we implement loss aversion by magnifying negative deviations from expectations (i.e., increasing if &lt; 0) and scaling down positive deviations (i.e., decreasing if 0) by a fixed factor ( ).</p><p>To first illustrate how the impact of existing behaviors and expectations are enhanced by loss aversion, we return to the simple two-agent scenario of riding the train ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5)</ref>.</p><p>Simulating this scenario again shows that the acting agent is more likely to end up playing music if that is already the established norm, as manifested in her initial policy and the other agent's expectation. However, this effect of the established norm is only apparent if agents are loss averse. This is because loss aversion enhances the disappointment of agents who benefit from the established norm, and diminishes the positive surprise of agents who benefit from changing the norm. Change, therefore, always carries a premium. We next show how this property of the loss-averse interindividual actor-critic explains three dynamical properties of norms: stickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity. We simulate again the scenario from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, with two differences: we examine cases where there is already an established norm, and we assume agents are loss averse, such that negative advantage has a larger impact than positive advantage. B. Simulation results in a case where there is no previously established norm. This is implemented by how and are initialized. Since the impact of others' evaluations is high ( = 0.8), the actor learns to 'do nothing'. C. Simulation results in cases where there is an established norm to play music ( play music = 0.9). The norm is sustained because when the actor plays music, the other agent expects that and therefore does not provide a negative evaluation, whereas when the actor does nothing, the other agents' positive evaluation is relatively diminished due to loss aversion (top). The norm is not sustained without loss aversion (middle), nor if evaluations reflect reward instead of advantage, making them independent of expectations (bottom).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stickiness</head><p>A prominent example of stickinessthe persistence of social norms even under conditions in which they would not initially ariseis offered by public smoking. Smoking in public became popular before the adverse health impacts of passive smoking were known. But even after these negative consequences became common knowledge, it took many years for public smoking to decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Nyborg &amp; Rege, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Cummings &amp; Proctor, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>To simulate this effect, we assume that smokers can choose between two actions: smoking in public, giving a positive reward to smokers ( smokers 0) and a negative reward to nonsmokers ( non−smokers &lt; 0), and not smoking in public, giving a reward of zero to both types of agents. We start the simulation with public smoking being the established norm, such that smokers expect its benefit (i.e., smokers = smokers ), and non-smokers expect its harm (i.e.,</p><p>non−smokers = non−smokers ). The results show that public smoking is more likely to stick if its harm is smaller ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B</ref>, left column), if agents are more loss averse ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B</ref>, = 0.5), and if learning is driven by advantage. Indeed, if learning is driven by reward, loss aversion does not promote stickiness ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6C</ref>), since its impact requires that learning would be shaped by expectations.</p><p>Ultimately, whether or not smoking in public sticks is determined by whether the influence of non-smokers' positive evaluations for not smoking in public ( Σ non−smokers ) exceeds the loss incurred by the smoker for not being able to smoke wherever they want ( smoker ). However, the combination of advantage learning with loss aversion scales down non-smokers' positive evaluations ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B, bottom)</ref>, thus sustaining public smoking under conditions in which it would not have arisen in the first place.</p><p>Put more generally, once a norm is established, its outcomes become expected.</p><p>Consequently, when attempting to change norms, loss aversion magnifies the harm to those who enjoy the established norm, and scales down the benefit to those who suffer from it.</p><p>Thus, any established norm has a built-in advantage over alternative courses of action. An established norm of smoking in public benefits acting agents ('smokers') but harms others ('non-smokers'). Smokers, therefore, expect the positive reward, and non-smokers expect the negative reward. The simulation comprises 1 smoker and 4 non-smokers. B. Simulation results. The norm sticks if its harm to others is low (left column) and agents are loss averse ( 0). The top row shows the average probability of public smoking over time, for varying degrees of harm to non-smokers and loss aversion. The bottom row shows the total impact of positive evaluations received from non-smokers for not smoking in public. The norm of public smoking is abandoned if this impact is larger than the resulting loss to smokers ( smoker ). The model comprises 1 smoker and 4 non-smokers, and results are averaged over 1000 simulations. C. The property of stickiness is not evident when others' evaluations reflect their reward instead of advantage. In fact, in this case loss aversion makes the norm more likely to change, because it magnifies its harm to non-smokers. INTERINDIVIDUAL ACTOR-CRITIC</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-reinforcement</head><p>A key consequence of the self-reinforcing nature of social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Young, 2015)</ref> is the potential emergence of arbitrary norms. That is, in the presence of several equally beneficial courses of actions, each benefiting a different subset of the population, one of these is likely to randomly emerge as the dominant norm. This is because random variations will make one action slightly more prevalent than the others, and this prevalence will then serve to reinforce the spread of the same action.</p><p>To test the emergence of arbitrary norms in the interindividual actor-critic, we consider the example of tipping at restaurants. Our simulated society starts without an established tipping norm ( tipping = 0.5), and with half of agents endorsing tipping ( pro−tippers 0 when another person tips) and the other half opposing it ( anti−tippers &lt; 0; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7A</ref>, left panel).</p><p>For simplicity, we assume that agents interact in groups that are randomly sampled from the population. During a group outing, whether they tip or not, they will, on average, please half of the group members and disappoint the other half. There is thus no reason for the group to reach a consensus one way or the other. And, indeed, without loss aversion ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7C</ref>), or if evaluations reflect reward instead of advantage ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7D</ref>), learned preferences are, on average, evenly distributed within the social network. However, in the loss-averse advantage actor-critic model, self-reinforcement gradually drives the group to adopt a unified preference, either in favor or against tipping ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7B</ref>).</p><p>To understand why this happens, assume that due to random factors, tipping has been chosen slightly more often than not, leading agents to weakly expect that others will tip. This expectation does not change the reward functionpro-tippers still gain a positive reward from tipping while anti-tippers do notbut it makes it so that tipping would be less surprising, whereas not tipping would create greater positive (for anti-tippers) and negative (for pro-tippers) surprises. Since the weight of negative surprises is magnified by loss aversion, increasing positive and negative surprises alike means making overall surprise, and thus others' evaluations, more negative. It is thus best to choose the action that is currently more expected. Actors may choose between two actions: tipping and not tipping, each pleasing a different set of agents: 'pro tippers' (pink) and 'anti-tippers' (purple). In a network of n=100 agents, half of the agents belong to each group. Interactions between agents occur in groups of 10, which are randomly drawn from the population in each round. The initial choice between actions is arbitrary because the benefits are equal, the sets of agents are of equal size, and groups are sampled randomly. B. Simulation results. As time passes, agents tend to choose the action that, by chance, most others previously chose, because that is now what most critics expect. As a result, everyone will eventually make the same choice, despite it being not beneficial for half of the agents in the group. C. When agents are not loss averse, learned preferences differ across agents. D. When others' evaluations reflects their reward, learned preferences differ across agents. Learning curves are slower here compared to panel C because positive evaluations are scaled down by loss aversion.</p><p>Self-reinforcement of arbitrary norms can be induced in this way by any random factor that creates a weak initial preference for one of the actions. For instance, agents may choose one action slightly more than the other due to the stochasticity of their policy. Or there is an initial imbalance in group member participation (e.g., if more agents that find tipping rewarding are initially active, actors will slightly increase their tendency to tip). Noise in the reward function can also make one of the actions seem more advantageous by chance, especially if the noise is correlated across agents. Regardless of the cause, once some agents arbitrarily act in a certain way, the group begins to expect that this is how agents will act.</p><p>This makes it more costly to act otherwise, making more agents behave in the same way, and so on.</p><p>Notably, the same mechanism can equally explain rapid changes occurring when established norms are undermined. Such dynamics can be observed in the public smoking example from the previous section in that, under certain settings, after some time the population suddenly and rapidly turns against smoking in public (creating the S-shaped curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5B</ref>). In the interindividual actor-critic, any change in prevalence is selfreinforcing irrespective of the baseline prevalence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local conformity / global diversity</head><p>As a familiar example of local conformity / global diversity from everyday life, consider again the question of whether to tip or not. The answer to this question can be different depending on where you are in the world, but locally most people would answer similarly.</p><p>Interindividual actor-critic learning naturally gives rise to such local conformity and global diversity because the self-reinforcement of a particular norm is driven by local interactions.</p><p>Thus, whereas the tight connections between individuals of the same group impose within-group uniformity, the looser connections between groups allow each group to adopt a different norm. The more agents primarily interact with people from their own group, the more they will tend to conform to the action that is arbitrarily more popular in that group.</p><p>We simulate this property in the same way in which we simulated self-reinforcement, but here, we divide the population into two groups, with more interaction within than between groups. If the groups are entirely disconnected, each of the groups will reach some consensus independently of the other groups. In this case, uniformity within groups is accompanied by diversity across groups half of the time (given that there are only two possible actions in this scenario, so half of the time the groups settle on the same action merely by chance).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  7</ref>, agents can choose between 'tipping' and 'not tipping', each granting a positive reward to a half of agents <ref type="bibr">('pro-tippers' and 'anti-tippers')</ref>. Each group consists of equal numbers of pro-and antitippers. B. Simulation results. Self-reinforcement imposes uniformity within groups, but the two groups may randomly learn either different (left) or similar (middle) norms. The probability of the groups learning different norms diminishes the more agents interact with members of the other group (lower % of ingroup versus outgroup connections). Results are averaged over 1000. C. When others' evaluations reflect their reward, norms do not self-reinforce themselves and therefore not local uniformity is observed. D. When agents are not loss averse, norms do not self-reinforce and therefore not local uniformity is observed.</p><p>However, the more frequent the interactions between groups, the more the groups influence one another to settle on the same action. The frequency with which this occurs depends on the ratio of within-to between-group interactions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B,C)</ref>. And even when this does not occur, the connections between groups makes their settling on different actions slower (see Appendix, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure B2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of results</head><p>We have shown that the interindividual actor-critic captures five well-established properties of social norms. This included two substantive propertiesprosociality and ingroup biasand three dynamical propertiesstickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity. Whereas the substantive model can likely also be explained by similar models where others' feedback encodes reward rather than advantage, the dynamical properties only emerged in the simulations if others' feedback encoded advantage.</p><p>In our review of the literature, we have found no other model that has the capacity to explain both the substantive and dynamical properties of norms. Thus, norm psychology models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Fehr &amp; Schurtenberger, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Tomasello, 2018)</ref> explain the substantive properties of norms by invoking evolutionary processes, but the explanations are typically not sufficiently defined to predict specific dynamics. By contrast, contagion models, where behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bikhchandani et al., 1992)</ref> or norms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Vinitsky et al., 2023)</ref> tends to be imitated, are well equipped to explain the dynamical properties of norms but not the prevalence of prosocial norms. The same holds for evolutionary game theory models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Young, 2015)</ref>, which assume that agents only maximize their self-interest. The advantage-driven interindividual actor-critic thus offers a uniquely parsimonious unified account of the properties of social norms <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The events of the past few years have highlighted the importance of providing explanations as to how social norms may take hold in social groups, from deciding whether to get vaccinated <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Johnson et al., 2020)</ref> to choosing a political affiliation <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Wilson et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Currently, there is still a disconnect between our understanding of group behavior and our expanding knowledge on individual cognition. We demonstrated how learning algorithms that are well-grounded in the basic cognitive science literature can give rise to social norms among groups of interacting individuals. Moreover, we showed that both substantive and dynamical properties of the resulting group behavior cohere with those of real-world social norms.</p><p>The core assumption of actor-critic interindividual learning is that individuals communicate feedback when the impact of others' actions on them differs from expectations.</p><p>The substantive properties of prosociality and ingroup favoritism directly arise from the incorporation of this feedback in learning as an additional reward signal. The dynamical properties of stickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity arise from how others' expectations serve as a reference point for their evaluation of outcomes, which in combination with loss aversion, exacts an extra cost on deviations from expected behavior.</p><p>Our model gives rise to norms without needing to invoke some of the most common explanations given to social norms in prior literature. Thus, conformity arises in our model without an inherent motivation to conform or imitate others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Jones, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Baronchelli, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rackoczy, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">McDonald &amp; Crandall, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Tomasello, 2016)</ref>. Similarly, social pressure to follow norms arises in our model without necessitating any norm-specific computation, such as the explicit representation of norms or a motivation to enforce them (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Lockwood et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Fehr, E. and Schurtenberger;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Vinitsky et al., 2023)</ref>. We have shown that our model accounts for a wider set of properties than each of these prior explanations accounts for alone. Importantly, however, the argument we make only aims to identify what drives the emergence of norms. We are thus not questioning whether previously characterized mechanisms exist. In fact, we view the cognitive mechanisms proposed by norm psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Sripada et al., 2005)</ref> as essential for transforming the normative regularities generated by our model into fully prescriptive norms <ref type="bibr">(Westra et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, there is ample evidence that humans, as well as other primates, rely on observational learning to choose actions that conform to current group norms <ref type="bibr">(Racokzy, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Haun et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Van de Waal, 2013)</ref>. However, we note that mere exposure to others may not suffice to significantly impact one's behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Hawkins et al., 2023)</ref>. Meaningful influence often requires personal interaction and the affective feedback it typically involves.</p><p>Thus, in coming to understand how group behavior emerges, it is imperative that we also factor in how people learn from the positive and negative feedback they receive from others.</p><p>The interindividual actor-critic offers a uniquely parsimonious unified account of social norms as emergent from such learning. Its simplicity makes it suitable for studying group behavior of various sorts and scales, from interactions within dyads, to large social networks, and even to groups of non-human species <ref type="bibr">(Westra et al., 2024)</ref>. However, the complexity of the real world makes it essential to investigate how the emergence of norms in this way interacts with other individual and societal processes. At the individual level, various cognitive mechanisms support the communication and spread of preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Hawkins et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Tomasello, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Paluck &amp; Shepherd, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Velez &amp; Gweon, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Theriault et al., 2021)</ref>. At the level of a society, norms that emerge from local interactions may be informed and sustained by the centralized action of social institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Van Bavel et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Ostrom, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>These complexities notwithstanding, the framework presented here already affords many new opportunities for research. A particularly promising direction is to investigate how social norms are affected by the structure of social networks. Another important direction is understanding how the behavior of a group is affected by the diversity of individuals that comprise it. For instance, individual differences in empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Mehrabian et al., 1988</ref>) and sensitivity to emotional responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barrett et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Pike &amp; Robinson, 2022)</ref> can be implemented by varying the weights that different agents give to social feedback. Individual differences in how people learn from positive compared to negative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Pike &amp; Robinson, 2022)</ref> may also influence the emergence and stability of norms. Additional unexplored factors include noise and uncertainty about the outcomes of real-world actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(FeldmanHall &amp; Shenhav, 2019)</ref>. The interindividual actor-critic offers a unique quantitative framework for cognitive-science-based investigations of these and many other intriguing questions about the behavior of groups.</p><p>In the remainder of the discussion, we discuss in greater detail the roles of advanced social cognition and network structure in interindividual learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of social cognition</head><p>Although actor-critic learning is a general-purpose reinforcement-learning algorithm, its interindividual implementation inevitably involves additional social cognitive functions. Specifically, our model requires agents to express their own emotions and to interpret others', converting them into scalar reward signals. Such interpretation is particularly challenging because of the intricacy of emotional expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Keltner et al., 2019)</ref> and the overall complexity of social interaction make emotion recognition an inference process in its own right <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Ong et al., 2019)</ref>. Making this inference can be especially difficult because people are often reluctant to express emotions such as anger. To solve this problem, actors may rely on physical features of emotional expressions, on contextual cues that illuminate the situation in which the emotion is expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aviezer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Hassin et al., 2013)</ref>, and on a process of mentalization whereby a critic's emotion is inferred from the outcome the critic experienced and their presumed motives and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Ong et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Ong et al., , 2015</ref>.</p><p>In fact, mentalizing to infer a critic's reward and value functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(FeldmanHall &amp; Nassar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Wu et al., 2022)</ref> can entirely obviate the need for the communication of emotional feedback. This is because such inference can enable the actor to simulate in advance the feedback it will receive from the critic if it acts in different ways. Coming back to the example of playing to music on the train, if the actor observes that no other passenger is playing music out loud, she can infer in advance that others will likely be angry with her if she played music. Learning from such simulated feedback could employ the interindividual actor-critic algorithm in the same way it is employed when learning from actual feedback.</p><p>Mentalizing and planning can thus be leveraged to greatly reduce the algorithm's need for trial and error <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Gershman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Mattar &amp; Daw, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Eldar et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, inferring critics' reward and value functions can help actors solve the creditassignment problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Sutton &amp; Barto, 2018)</ref>. This problem arises in the interindividual actorcritic in situations where feedback is vague and nonspecific, such as fighting with a romantic partner, or communicating via text. Knowing what the critic values and expects in such situations can help the actor infer what precisely it has done to instigate the critic's feedback, so that it could change its policy accordingly.</p><p>Finally, mentalization expands the range of social norms that may emerge from interindividual actor-critic learning. Specifically, it enables norms that are defined with respect to internal states and actions, such as how to act when someone is angry or sad, or when it is appropriate to be sad <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Vishkin et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of network structure</head><p>The norms that emerge from interindividual actor-critic learning critically depend on the structure of the social network where learning occurs. As a starting point, here we considered random-regular graphs where each agent has the same number of connections, randomly distributed across the network. However, altering network characteristics such as size, connectivity, and the distribution of connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Stokman, 2001)</ref> would affect both the volume and sources of evaluations each agent receives. Networks where the average agent has many connections will be more prosocial because actions that benefit others will be rewarded with a greater number of positive evaluations, and actions that disadvantage others will carry a higher cost. Networks where agents are segregated into groups, with more withingroup than between-group connections (i.e., high network modularity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Newman, 2006)</ref>, will produce stronger ingroup favoritism because agents in such a network give less weight to how their actions affect others outside of their group. Variations in social network structure may thus explain some of the diversity that exists among human cultures in the quantity, strength, and type of their social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Gelfand et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Wrzus et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Whereas a detailed characterization of social network structure in different cultures and regions is lacking, it is safe to assume that real-world social networks vary considerably in structure due to geographic, technological, and cultural differences that affect how families, friends, and colleagues coalesce to form local communities. For instance, it has been shown that in certain societies, a larger proportion of people's social networks consists of family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Harrington &amp; Gelfand, 2014)</ref>. Interindividual actor-critic learning predicts that such family-oriented network structure would give rise to social norms that are biased in favor of one's own family. In addition, agents in such societies can be expected to conform to their group's norms more strongly, because they receive evaluations from a more homogeneous set of critics. By contrast, societies with more dispersed social connections should be less biased towards a specific group and have weaker norms overall. Indeed, these predictions already cohere with some research in cross-cultural psychology, for example on the distinction between individualistic and collectivistic societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Gelfand et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Wrzus et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Harrington &amp; Gelfand, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Kagitcibasi, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Carpenter, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Talhelm &amp; English, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>As data technologies continue to advance, precise characterizations of social networks can help form and test additional predictions of interindividual actor-critic learning concerning the emergence, stability, and content of social norms. This could offer a rigorous basis for studying cross-cultural differences that have previously been criticized for a lack of conceptual clarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Voronov &amp; Singer, 2002)</ref>. Especially crucial is anticipating the societal consequences of changes in social network structure due to the rapid spread of social media, which has the potential to enhance people's biases and promote conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Brady et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Schulz &amp; Bhui, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Lindström et al., 2021)</ref>. In studying the potential consequences of these changes, it will be important to remember that the relationship between social norms and network structure is likely bi-directional, since the choice of whom to connect with is itself influenced by social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Emirbayer &amp; Goodwin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cantor &amp; Whitehead, 2013)</ref>. This and other sources of complexity in real-world social networks make a quantitative approach, using actor-critic or other computational frameworks, indispensable to the study of social norms.</p></div>

The network structure was defined as follows: each group consisted of 16 nodes, each with 14 neighbors. The number of ingroup neighbors ranged from 14 to 7 and the number of outgroup neighbors ranged from 0 to 7. Each group was initialized as a random regular network with d = number of ingroup neighbors, and then outgroup neighbors were randomly added from the other group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>d. Stickiness</head><p>The simulations were conducted using the following reward matrix: smokers non−smokers 1 (public smoking) 5 r 2 (not smoking) 0 0</p><p>Initial values were set to smokers = 5, non−smokers = ,the mean of the initial policy control parameters was: 1 = 1.98, 2 = −0.58 over all smokers, corresponding to the initial policy of 1 = 0.94 and 2 =0.06, and = 0.5. In the three cases presented, r was set to -2.5 , -3.6 and -4.5. Simulations were run on a network with 5 smokers and 4 nonsmokers with full connections between the two groups. Only smokers acted, and non-smokers acted as critics.</p><p>As explained in the main text, the norm would change if the loss of smokers' reward for smoking in public is smaller in magnitude than the positive surprise of non-smokers. Without loss aversion, this corresponds to whether smokers ( 1 ) is smaller than ϕ non−smokers ( 1 )</p><p>times the number of non-smokers. For the parameters of the simulation ( = 0.5, 4 nonsmokers, smokers ( 1 ) = 5, non−smokers ( 1 ) = ), the two are exactly equal when = −2.5.</p><p>However, loss aversion diminished the relative impact of requiring it to be higher in the first place for the norm to change.</p><p>e. Self-reinforcement</p><p>The simulations were conducted using the following reward matrix:</p><p>pro−tippers anti−tippers 1 (tipping) 1 0 2 (not tipping) 0 1</p><p>With loss aversion factor of either 0 or 0.5. For simplicity, agents receive these rewards only when others act, and do not receive any personal outcomes (except for other agents' feedback) when they act. Simulations were run on a network on = 100 agents. In each round, the network was divided randomly to 10 fully connected groups of 10 agents. Groups were re-sampled after the round ended.</p><p>f. Local conformity / global diversity The simulations were conducted using the same reward matrix as in e. self-reinforcement, with loss aversion magnitude of 0.5. The social network consisted of 2 groups of size = 100, and the network structure was defined similarly to c. Ingroup favoritism. In each round, a new adjacency matrix was sampled randomly from the population. The number of ingroup neighbors ranged between simulations from 51 to 42, and the number of outgroup neighbors from 1 to 7 (i.e., 51 and 1, 50 and 2, etc.).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Advantage actor-critic learning.
