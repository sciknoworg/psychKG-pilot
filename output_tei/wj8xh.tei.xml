			<abstract>
				<p>Bayesian inference suggests that perception is inferred from a weighted integration of prior contextual beliefs with current sensory evidence (likelihood) about the world around us. The perceived precision or uncertainty associated with prior and likelihood information is used to guide perceptual decision making, such that more weight is placed on the source of information with greater precision. This provides a framework for understanding a spectrum of clinical transdiagnostic symptoms associated with aberrant perception, as well as individual differences in the general population. Whilst behavioural paradigms are commonly used to characterise individual differences in perception as a trait-like characteristic, measurement reliability in these behavioural tasks is rarely assessed. To remedy this gap, we empirically evaluate the reliability of a perceptual decision-making task that quantifies individual differences in Bayesian belief updating in terms of the relative precision weighting afforded to prior and likelihood information (i.e., sensory weight). We analysed data from participants (n = 37) who performed this task twice. We found that the precision afforded to prior and likelihood information showed high internal consistency and good test re-test reliability (ICC = 0.86, 95%CI[0.72, 0.93]) when averaged across participants, as well as at the individual level using hierarchical modelling. Our results provide support for the assumption that Bayesian belief updating operates as a stable, trait-like characteristic in perceptual decision making. We discuss the utility and applicability of reliable perceptual decision-making paradigms as a measure of individual differences in the general population, as well as a diagnostic tool in psychiatric research.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Bayesian accounts of perception suggest that the brain creates an internal model of the world to infer the cause of sensory input. This inference is generated via a weighted combination of prior expectations and incoming sensory observations and is used to estimate the state of any given environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hohwy, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hohwy, , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Knill &amp; Pouget, 2004)</ref>. Intrinsic uncertainty associated with prior and sensory (or likelihood) information determines how they are relatively weighted to form an internal representation of the world. Accurately incorporating this information into a veridical model of one's environment is essential for optimising perception and effective perceptual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Friston, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Friston, , 2008</ref>. This framework, grounded in predictive processing, is useful for understanding complex mechanisms underlying healthy information processing. In turn, it also aids a phenomenological explanation for how aberrancies in the precision afforded to different types of information may characterise altered perceptual experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hohwy, 2020)</ref>. Whilst these aberrancies in belief updating are thought to underlie symptoms of psychopathology and trait-like correlates in non-clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fromm et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gibbs-Dean et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Karvelis et al., 2022)</ref>, the assumption that individual differences in belief updating can be characterizable as a stable, trait-like phenotype is yet to be verified. This can offer valuable insight into the cognitive mechanisms underpinning behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tulver et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Disruptions or alterations in the precision weighting afforded to prior and likelihood information has been utilised as a framework for understanding a spectrum of clinical disorders including psychosis and schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sterzer et al., 2018)</ref>, autism spectrum disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Palmer et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Palmer et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Randeniya et al., 2021)</ref>, mood disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kraus et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Putica et al., 2022)</ref> and more.

In this view, differences in perceptual inference can be conceptualised across a continuum from trait-level alterations in the general population, into to TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 3 more severe aberrancies in clinical disorders. This is particularly important in understanding the development and trajectory of disorders, integrating a transdiagnostic approach into understanding symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gibbs-Dean et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lyndon &amp; Corlett, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Investigating symptomatology and sub-threshold, trait-like characteristics of such disorders relies on the assumption that distinct perceptual phenotypes result from differences in the precision weighting of prior beliefs and sensory evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Leeuwen et al., 2020)</ref>. This assumes that perceptual differences in belief updating remain stable across individuals in a trait-like manner. Despite this assumption offering important empirical utility for understanding symptom formation, the stability or trait-like manner of Bayesian information integration has received little attention thus far. The reliability of behavioural measures to assess cognitive performance are often limited, despite the impact on interpretability and applicability in understanding individual differences in cognitive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Parsons et al., 2019)</ref>. It is important to verify whether measures with high variance (such as the precision weighting afforded to prior and likelihood information) can attributed to stable individual differences in cognitive mechanisms, or whether unobservable noise yields differences within individuals between testing sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Parsons et al., 2019;</ref>.</p><p>Recent research has provided insight into the temporal stability of other behavioural tasks used to measure similar trait-like processes. This has been demonstrated in computational modeldriven measures of model-based planning as a behavioural correlate of compulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref>, as well as several behavioural paradigms to measure processes underlying self-regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zech et al., 2022)</ref>. Behavioural and computational measures of a probabilistic reversal learning task also demonstrated high reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Waltmann et al., 2022)</ref>, validating its interpretability of individual differences in cognitive flexibility, as well as deviances across psychiatric populations in a transdiagnostic manner. Of relevance to the predictive coding framework, a recent study investigated the test re-test reliability in individuals' cross modal usage of priors in the perception of bistable visual stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pálffy et al., 2021)</ref>. This paradigm adjudicated between individuals' reliance TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 4 on auditory versus visual associative cues in visual perception. Importantly, substantial interindividual variability suggested large differences in the relative use of acoustic compared to visual prior information, which researchers found to be temporally stable over two testing sessions.</p><p>Despite this, it is unclear whether other aberrancies in Bayesian perceptual belief updating act as a temporally stable trait-like characteristic, particularly when the uncertainty associated with both prior and likelihood information are differentially altered.</p><p>This study aims to investigate whether a general reliance on likelihood relative to prior information remains stable in a phenotypic, trait-like manner. This will be investigated with a behavioural paradigm that orthogonally manipulates prior and likelihood information and is known to yield systematic variation between individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Vilares et al., 2012)</ref>. It will also allow us to determine whether the subjective uncertainty associated with likelihood and prior information remains stable over two testing sessions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We aimed to recruit at least 30 participants, based on the number of healthy participants recruited in previous coin task paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Randeniya et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Trapp &amp; Vilares, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Vilares et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vilares &amp; Kording, 2017)</ref> and based on similar test re-test studies investigating individual differences in perceptual inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pálffy et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Waltmann et al., 2022)</ref>. To account for potential dropout and exclusion, we initially recruited 62 participants who completed the first testing session. The final sample consisting of 37 participants who completed both testing sessions (29 female, 6 male, 2 non-binary, age range = 18-56, M = 21.87, SD = 6.72). Participants completed the second testing session 12-17 days after the first session (M = 14.22, SD = 1.80), with the aim of averaging two weeks between testing sessions.</p><p>Participants were recruited through the University of Melbourne research experience program. Participants were at least 18 years of age and had corrected to normal vision. They were asked about their highest level of education, left or right handedness, whether English was their first language, how many years they had been speaking English if not, vision impairments, previous diagnosis of serious neurological conditions and/or emotional or psychological disorders, and any other conditions that might affect performance. All participants gave informed consent and received credit towards a university subject completion for participation. The study was approved by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (Ethics ID: 20592).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants were recruited through a university online system (SONAR) that allowed completion of both testing sessions online, on their own laptops. Participants initially provided demographic details via Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com), and were then directed to Pavlovia TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 6 (www.pavlovia.com) to complete the behavioural task. The paradigm that participants completed at the second timepoint was the same as the paradigm at the first timepoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coin Task</head><p>Participants performed a decision-making task where they were asked to guess the position of a hidden target on a screen, requiring them to integrate both noisy sensory evidence and prior expectation of the target's location. More specifically, participants were told a coin was being thrown into a pond and were asked to guess where the coin had fallen. Likelihood and prior variance were manipulated with a two-by-two factorial design with narrow and wide variance respectively.</p><p>On each trial, five blue dots denoted "splashes" produced by the coin falling in. The variance of these splashes changed on each trial as an index of either narrow or wide likelihood conditions. The position of these splashes was drawn from a Gaussian distribution centred on the (hidden) location of the coin, with standard deviation of either 6% of the screen width (SD = 0.096; narrow likelihood trials) or 15% of the screen width (SD = 0.24; wide likelihood trials). An example trial is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Participants were also informed that the person throwing the coin changed between blocks, and one thrower was more accurate than the other. They were told that both throwers aimed at the screen centre (indicating the mean of the prior). Although they were not explicitly told which thrower was better or worse, this could be inferred through the distribution of previous coin locations from trial-to-trial. The location of the coin was drawn from a second, independent Gaussian distribution centred on the middle of the screen, with a standard deviation of either 2.5% of the screen width (SD = 0.04; narrow prior blocks) or 8.5% of the screen width (SD = 0.136; wide prior blocks). The four conditions are visually depicted in splashes of the location of a coin being thrown into a pond. They are then asked to move the blue bar/net to where they estimate the coin's location to be, after which the coin's true location is revealed, and they move onto the next trial. B) Task design as adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Vilares et al. (2012)</ref>: the four conditions of the task are visually depicted including two types of likelihood as manipulated through the distribution of splashes on each trial (Ln = narrow likelihood; Lw = wide likelihood) and two types of prior as manipulated through the accuracy of the thrower on each block (Pn = narrow prior; Pw = wide prior).</p><p>While the variance of the likelihood changed pseudorandomly from trial-to-trial (counterbalanced across all trials), the variance of the prior changed from block to block, with the order (thrower A vs thrower B) also counterbalanced across participants. Thus, there were four conditions: narrow prior and narrow likelihood (PnLn), narrow prior and wide likelihood (PnLw), wide prior and narrow likelihood (PwLn), and wide prior and wide likelihood (PwLw). For each trial, participants were instructed to move a net (blue bar) horizontally across the screen to indicate where they thought the coin had landed. The true position of the coin (represented as a yellow dot) was then shown for 1500 ms. Scoring was tallied across each trial, with a point earned each time any part of the coin lay within the net. Participants were provided with two blocks of two practice trials before completing the main task. The main task consisted of two blocks per thrower, with each block containing 75 trials each (resulting in 300 trials total).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Likelihood only task</head><p>Prior to completing the coin task, participants completed the likelihood-only estimation task as a measure of subjective likelihood variance or sensory noise. The setup of this task was similar to the main task, without the incorporation of the prior condition. This provided an estimation of how participants perceived the centre of the splashes on their own, without prior knowledge.</p><p>Participants were asked to estimate where they thought the true coin location was, which was always the centre of the displayed splashes, by moving the net horizontally across the screen. The true coin location (represented as a yellow dot) was revealed at the end of each trial, providing feedback on participants estimations. This task consisted of 100 trials, with an even number of wide and narrow likelihood distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural Analysis</head><p>Successful performance of the task required participants to move the net to the most likely location of the hidden coin. Using Bayes rule, we can determine what the optimal estimate of the position of the coin would be on each trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Körding &amp; Wolpert, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Vilares et al., 2012)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= 2 2 + 2 + 2 2 + 2 (1)</formula><p>where is the estimated position of the coin (i.e., participants responses on each trial), <ref type="bibr">( , )</ref> represent the prior and likelihood means and ( 2 , 2 ) represent the prior and likelihood variances, respectively. In our experiment, the mean of the prior was kept constant (the centre of the screen, TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 9 ), while the mean of the likelihood was determined by the centre of the five blue dots in each trial ( ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance</head><p>Performance in the likelihood-only task was characterised by the average distance between participants estimates of the coin location (net location) and the true centre of the splashes (i.e., mean estimation error). Similarly, performance in the coin task was characterised by the average distance participants estimates (net location) and the true location of the coin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall sensory weight (likelihood vs prior reliance)</head><p>To estimate participants reliance on likelihood relative to prior information, we fitted a linear regression to participants' estimates of the coin's position for each trial ( ) as a function of the centre of the splashes (i.e., the likelihood mean, ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= 2 2 + 2 (2)</formula><p>where is the slope of the linear regression, which indicates how much each participant relies on likelihood information. A slope closer to one indicates a greater reliance on the likelihood information, while a slope closer to zero indicates greater reliance on prior information. A slope between zero and one indicates that participants integrate both likelihood and prior information in their estimates. This was calculated overall, for each condition, and for each block.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11</head><p>In this equation, 2 can be assumed to be the objective likelihood variance (i.e., the variance of the splashes by design), or alternatively, this can be estimated from participants subjective likelihood variance, 2 (as calculated in equation 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>Firstly, mean estimation error was used as a criterion to detect poor performance or low effort, with 4 participants excluded in the likelihood only task, and 2 participants excluded in the main task (z score greater than ± 3). To determine differences in key parameters across the two timepoints, t-test and ANOVAs were calculated. Test re-test reliability was then analysed with Spearman's rank order correlations and intraclass correlations, ICC(2, k), using a two-way mixed effects model based on absolute agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Koo &amp; Li, 2016)</ref>. The general formula for the traditional ICC can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">= 0 2 0 2 + 2<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where 0 2 refers to between-person variance and 2 refers to within-person variance. ICCs with values of &lt;0.5 were interpreted as poor, 0.5-0.75 as fair, 0.75-0.90 as good, and &gt;0.90 as excellent reliability (as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koo &amp; Li, 2016)</ref>. Additionally, split-half reliability was analysed for trial-bytrial estimates of estimation error and sensory weight at each timepoint separately. This was done using a permutation-based split-half approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Parsons, 2021)</ref>, in which data is repeatedly split into two halves and the reliability estimate is calculated for each split, then averaged to provide a more stable estimate of reliability. We used 5,000 random splits as recommended by Parsons <ref type="formula">2021</ref> </p><p>where refers to the th individual, 0 2 refers to between-person variance, 0 represents the average of individual variances, and 1 represents individual departures from the fixed group effect.</p><p>This model computes person-specific ICC, allowing us to determine which (and how many) individuals belong to the common variance ICC model (as describe in equation 6). All visualisations and analyses were performed in R (version 2022.02.2).</p><p>TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 13</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective likelihood uncertainty (likelihood-only task) showed weak test re-test reliability between timepoints 1 and 2</head><p>Subjective likelihood variance was calculated in the likelihood-only task as a proxy of how much participants perceived uncertainty in likelihood information (i.e., distribution of the five blue dots) to vary across the task. Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference between average scores of subjective likelihood variance in the narrow condition, compared to the wide condition at both timepoint 1 (t(30) = 0.165, p = .869) and timepoint 2 (t(30) = 1.99, p = .066).  Considering the lack of difference in subjective likelihood variance observed between narrow likelihood and wide likelihood conditions (from the likelihood-only task), the objective likelihood variance was instead used to calculate subjective prior variance (see equation 5). This, along with overall sensory weights, were utilised as a proxy to determine how much participants were perceiving uncertainty in the prior information (i.e., accuracy of thrower) to vary across the task. A comparison of subjective prior variance across conditions revealed a main effect of prior across both timepoints (Pw&gt;Pn; Timepoint 1: F = 6.08, p = .015; Timepoint 2: F = 7.46, p = .007). This shows that participants were more likely to perceive uncertainty in prior information when it was objectively more uncertain (i.e., in the wide prior condition). However, we also unexpectedly found a main effect of likelihood (Lw&gt;Ln; Timepoint 1: F = 12.54, p = 5.7 x10 -4 ; Timepoint 2: F = 15.28, p = 1.6</p><p>x10 <ref type="bibr">-4</ref> ), suggesting that the likelihood condition was also influencing perceived uncertainty in prior information. Overall subjective prior variance was also calculated for each participant, in which we found no significant difference between timepoint 1 (M = 0.021) and timepoint 2 (M = 0.020, t(32) = 0.011, p = .92). We found high test re-test reliability (ICC(2, k) = 0.84, 95%CI [0.69, 0.92]), with a positive correlation between timepoint 1 and timepoint 2 (r = 0.69, p = 9.73 x10 -6 , bootstrapped 95%CI [0.48, 0.92]; see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). However, the relatively low variance between individuals on this parameter (as depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) suggests that these results should be interpreted with caution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of the present study was to determine whether individual differences in the precision weighting of prior to likelihood information remain temporally stable over two testing sessions. This was to empirically examine the assumption that this measure acts as a phenotypic, trait-like characteristic of Bayesian information integration. Precision weighting was measured with a behavioural paradigm that parameterizes the weighting afforded to prior and likelihood information via orthogonal manipulation of uncertainty across trials. Our data demonstrated high internal consistency and good test re-test reliability in individuals' average sensory weight across the task, as well as good to moderate test re-test reliability in individuals' average sensory weight across conditions. At the individual level, exploratory analyses investigating individually varying ICCs across conditions suggested high homogeneity with a common variance model, indicating good to moderate test re-test reliability of trial-by-trial sensory weights amongst individuals. Thus, sufficient temporal stability of this parameter at both the average and individual level demonstrates its suitability as a cognitive marker of individual differences in perceptual decision making in the general population . This has important implications for the empirical utility of Bayesian belief updating in clinical applications of this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Parsons et al., 2019)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Deserno et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schlagenhauf et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Weilnhammer et al., 2020)</ref> and autism spectrum disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kreis et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Randeniya et al., 2021)</ref>, as well as their non-clinical trait-like correlates <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goodwin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kreis et al., 2020)</ref>. Mounting evidence for the reliability of distinct perceptual phenotypes across task-based measures of cognition support an important development in the translation of computational measures to clinical practice, particularly as a diagnostic tool in psychiatric research <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gibbs-Dean et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Leeuwen et al., 2020)</ref>. For this translation to be effective, the reliability of such measures of perceptual inference should also be established in clinical populations before empirical use. The utility of computational psychiatry is growing, not only as a tool to investigate mechanisms underlying cognition and behaviour, but also to inform techniques in therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pott &amp; Schilbach, 2022)</ref>, predict treatment response <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hauke et al., 2022)</ref>, predict transitions from 'at risk' states <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hauke et al., 2022)</ref>, and the potential retraining of perceptual priors in clinical disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lyndon &amp; Corlett, 2020)</ref>. This demonstrates the importance of generating robust and reliable tools to formally assess beliefs, how they change over time, and how they relate to observable behaviour.</p><p>Furthermore, although sufficient temporal stability of the precision weighting of prior to likelihood information was demonstrated, the subjective uncertainty of likelihood information was found to have poor test re-test reliability in our task. Practice effects could hinder the reliability of this parameter, as exposure to the likelihood-only task (from which this parameter is calculated) in the second testing session is no longer naïve <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Randeniya et al., 2021)</ref>. In the first testing session, the coin task is initially presented without manipulating prior information (i.e., the likelihood-only task), in order to yield a proxy for participants unbiased estimates of the subjective uncertainty associated with likelihood information. In the second testing session, the likelihood-only task is again presented before the main task, however participants' previous experience with the main task might bias their responses, due to a carryover of prior information from the first testing session to the second. Thus, TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 24 following up this study with further testing sessions would provide insight into whether practice effects impact the strategy being used (indicative of individuals' subjective likelihood uncertainty) in the likelihood-only task. Alternatively, increasing the timeframe between testing sessions might provide further insight into the trade-off between practice effects and stability in responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Karvelis et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zech et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, although subjective prior variance also found to have good to moderate temporal stability, there was little variance between participants estimates (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), implicating that this should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, this parameter may not be a sufficient measure of individual differences. One potential reason for the limited variability in participants' estimates of prior uncertainty is that the actual uncertainty associated with prior information remained stable within each block. In other words, the subjective uncertainty associated with prior information seemed to resemble accurate estimates of the imposed prior uncertainty within each block. To evaluate this further, future tasks designs could incorporate periods of volatility, whereby the uncertainty associated with prior information changes rapidly within blocks, as well as periods of stability (i.e., prior uncertainty remains stable within blocks; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mathys et al., 2011)</ref>. This may yield a more ecological representation of prior uncertainty, allowing diversity in responding to be characterizable as an individual difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Waltmann et al., 2022)</ref>. Additionally, it would be interesting to determine whether individual deviations from the average estimates of subjective prior variance could be explained by other cognitive or personality characteristics, and whether larger deviations in individual differences are expressed in clinical populations such as patients with schizophrenia.</p><p>Although our findings provide support for robust individual differences in the precision weighting of likelihood to prior information in single task-based measures, the generalisability to cross-modal examinations have, so far, yielded contradictory findings. In attempts to understand state vs trait alterations in predictive processing, previous research have utilised different methods TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 25 of prior induction to determine whether a single factor could explain performance (such as a relative reliance on priors) across multiple tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andermane et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Koblinger et al., 2021)</ref>. For example, Tulver and colleagues (2019) investigated whether the tendency to rely on priors across multiple paradigms with noisy or ambiguous perceptual input could co-explain performance, and whether this was linked to autistic or schizotypal traits in non-clinical populations. Surprisingly, they found no single factor to explain individual differences or a common reliance on priors across four tasks with visual illusions. This might suggest that different methods of prior induction may recruit distinct neural mechanisms that operate at different levels of the visual hierarchy. Similarly, Andermane and colleagues (2020) investigated whether a general tendency to see the expected is general, or method specific with different facilitatory effects of perceptual priors. Whilst they found that individual differences in expectation-based biases are closely related to attentional ability, test re-test reliability is required to decisively measure whether this operates as a consistent phenotypic difference. Whilst these computational cognitive models are often context-specific, it is yet to be verified whether measures of perceptual inference in the coin task can also predict performance across other, similar tasks. One limitation of our task design was that the order in which participants observed narrow versus wide uncertainty in prior information was not counter balanced across testing sessions.</p><p>Ensuring that each participant received a different version of the task on the two days could potentially improve expectation-based biases in responding and further limit practice-effects.</p><p>Additionally, to ensure robust replicability of the online-version of this task, future research should verify the test re-test reliability across online and in-person testing sessions, to ensure the consistent performance of psychometrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zech et al., 2022)</ref>. While online testing has many resourceful benefits, an advantage of in-person cognitive-behavioural testing is that extraneous environmental factors can be more stringently controlled. Although cognitive processes will inevitably fluctuate across testing sessions, controlling for the time of day (i.e., circadian rhythm; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bedder et al., 2020)</ref> and assessing mood-related fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Eldar et al., 2018)</ref> could provide insight into state-related TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 26 differences across testing sessions that might impact measurement reliability. Future research should include more sensitive investigations of state-like fluctuations, as these could provide insight into deviations from homogenous common variance models which may in fact be clinically meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Karvelis et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sullivan-Toole et al., 2022)</ref>. Despite this, testing perceptual inference in clinical settings might also lack this stringent stability and have inevitable fluctuations, suggesting that our research might hold better generalisability to clinical testing than a strictly controlled lab-based setting. To further aid generalisability, these findings should be replicated in a more age and demographically diverse sample, to ensure translational value to clinical populations.</p><p>This study demonstrated good internal consistency and sufficient average and individual estimates of test re-test reliability in the precision weighting of prior to likelihood information in a perceptual decision-making task. This provides evidence that individual differences in task-based measures of Bayesian information integration perform as a stable trait-like or phenotypic characteristic. These results support the characterisation of a latent computational measure as a means to capture potentially clinically relevant individual differences in computational psychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Karvelis et al., 2022)</ref>. This verification of psychometrics of cognitive-behavioural tasks should be standard practice before exploring their relationship with symptoms in clinical disorders and traitlike correlates in the general population. Note. Internal consistency of trial-by-trial sensory weights was measured with a spearman-Brown correction, split-half permutation approach. Split-half reliability was calculated for each condition, at each timepoint, along with a 95% confidence interval. Test re-test reliability was calculated for average sensory weights at each condition, using ICC2 which reflects absolute agreement between measurements, as well as the 95% confidence interval for this measure. Spearman-ranked correlation of individuals' average sensory weight between timepoint 1 and 2 are also shown in the final column.

This indicates that participants relied more on likelihood information when the prior was more uncertain but relied less on likelihood information when the likelihood was more variable, as expected. Despite this, Wilcox ranked tests showed that median sensory weights across three of the four conditions were significantly different from Bayesian optimal scores at each timepoint (excepting PwLw condition; see supplementary S1). Although participants generally deviated from Bayesian optimal, their patterns of performance were verging towards optimality across each condition, as shown inFigure 2.</figDesc></figure>

The wide prior wide likelihood condition (PwLw) demonstrated the most homogeneity in test re-test estimates, whereby all participants belonged to the common variance model (as depicted in red). Whilst the wide prior narrow likelihood condition (PwLn) demonstrated the most heterogeneity, only 8 participants fell outside what was described by the common variance model (as depicted in blue). In other words, there was not a large degree of heterogeneity in individually varying ICC calculations across each condition, suggesting that the common variance model is an accurate descriptor of test re-test reliability across the majority of individuals in this sample. Additionally, these analyses show that confidence intervals around point estimates fall within a wide range of poor to excellent test re-test reliability depending on the individual, which demonstrates variable interpretability across the sample.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Importantly, the reliability of the precision weighting of prior to likelihood information in this study(ICC2 = 0.75, 95%CI [0.56, 0.87]) is comparable to similar performance-based indicators of perceptual inference in other task designs. For example, a recent study investigated the influence of cross-modal auditory priors in the perception of bistable visual stimuli, revealing high temporal stability in individual differences of perceptual inference (median ICC = 0.83, 95%CI [0.61, 0.95]; Pálffy et al., 2021). Similarly, behavioural measures of cognitive flexibility in a probabilistic reversal learning task were also found to have excellent reliability (derived from mixed-effects models over two testing sessions; Waltmann et al., 2022). This provides evidence for the generalisability of reliable individual differences in behavioural measures of perceptual inference in healthy TEMPORAL STABILITY OF BAYESIAN BELIEF UPDATING 23 populations.
