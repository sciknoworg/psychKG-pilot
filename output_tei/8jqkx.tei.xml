			<abstract>
				<p>People usually give priorities to same-race over other-race individuals in cognition, emotion, and behavior. Reducing the racial biases requires understanding of their psychological and brain mechanisms. To investigate the functional role of people&apos;s racial identities in racial ingroup favoritism in social emotion and prosocial behavior, we examined whether monoracial adults&apos; racial identities may be shifted toward a differen one to reduce their racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making. We developed a short-term training procedure to shift Chinese adults&apos; racial identities from Asian toward White by inducing visual-motor-tactile synchrony between a participant&apos;s body and a wearing White facial disguise. In seven behavioral, EEG, and fMRI experiments we showed converging evidence that the training procedure shifted Chinese adults&apos; racial identities from Asian toward White and the shifted identity was associated with increased medial prefrontal activity involved in self-reflection. Moreover, racial (vs. personal) identity shift led to increased electrophysiological responses to perceived pain expressions of White faces, enhanced right premotor/inferior frontal/insular responses to perceived painful stimulation applied to Whites, and decreased Asian favoritism in altruistic decisionmaking. Our findings highlight the malleability of monoracial adults&apos; racial identities, which establishes a basis for interventions of racial discrimination in social emotion and prosocial behavior.</p>

From a psychological perspective racial discrimination manifests outcomes of interactions between an observer's belief of his own racial identity and perceived racial identities of others. While previous studies have largely focused on psychological and neural processes of perceived race of others, the role of an observer's own racial identity in race-related cognition, emotion, and behavior has not been fully understood. If racial identity is socially constructed and develops across the lifespan in response to social contexts and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Moya &amp; Markus, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Smedley &amp; Smedley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Williams et al., 2020)</ref>, a successful intervention of racial discrimination may take advantage of the malleability of individuals' racial identities to modulate interactions between an observer's own racial identity and perceived racial identities of others. The present study sought to provide a new perspective on the key role of beliefs of one's own racial identity in racial discrimination by testing whether a short-term training procedure may shift monoracial adults' racial identities and, if yes, whether racial identity shift in monoracial adults may lead to reduced racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making.</p><p>In the following sections of introduction, we first review behavioral and brain imaging studies of race perception and recognition that have disclosed distinct processes of same-race and other-race faces and provide operational estimations of observers' racial identities. We then review behavioral and brain imaging findings regarding racial ingroup biases in empathy and prosocial behavior which manifest social emotional and behavioral consequences of observers' racial identities. These are followed by an introduction of empirical and theoretical research on development of racial identity. Finally, we present a new approach to intervention of racial ingroup biases by explaining our behavioral and brain imaging methods that induced and tested racial identity shift in monoracial adults and relevant changes of racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making. Our work empirically tested the hypotheses regarding racial identity shift and its influences on racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making. Our findings contribute to understanding of the psychological and neurobiological nature of racial discrimination and cast a new light on development of efficacious interventions of racial biases in social emotion and prosocial behaviors.</p><p>Perception and recognition of same-race and other-race faces Because faces provide the most useful information about individuals' social attributes including racial identities, one line of research on race perception focused on distinct behavioral and brain responses to faces of different races. A greater sensitivity to information of other-race than same-race faces was observed in different tasks requiring face categorization, identification, and recognition. For example, in a race classification task to sort faces into different racial groups, White participants responded faster to Asian than White faces whereas Asian participants responded faster to White than Asian faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Valentine &amp; Endo, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>. In a task to classify morphed faces that contained different proportions of pixels of parent White or Black face pictures, non-Black adults (mainly White and Asian) showed a psychophysical threshold less than 50% for seeing a mixed-race face as Black <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Krosch &amp; Amodio, 2014)</ref>. Morphed faces were also used in an individual identification task that required judgments of whether a prototype face and a morphed face were the same person <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Walker &amp; Tanaka, 2003)</ref>. White participants in this task were more accurate at discriminating White than Asian faces, whereas an opposite pattern was observed in Asian participants. In a face recognition task, which required discrimination between a previously shown subset of faces and a subset of novel faces, people show a greater difficulty (e.g., higher false alarm rates) in recognizing other-race than same-race faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Meissner &amp; Brigham, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Valentine &amp; Endo, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Zhou et al., 2020)</ref> and faster responses to recognize individual faces of a samerace than an other-race sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ge et al., 2009)</ref>. Together, these studies unraveled opposite patterns of behavioral responses during face perception and recognition in two samples of different races who performed the same tasks on the same set of stimuli. The findings indicate that the relationships between racial identities of perceived faces and observers' own racial identities provide a basis for the observed distinct processes of other-race and same-race faces during perception and recognition.</p><p>Brain imaging research has employed different paradigms to examine neural underpinnings of distinct processes of same-race and other-race faces. One line of research focused on brain activities that differentially respond to same-race and otherrace faces. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of Black and White participants found evidence for modulations of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals during perception of Black and White faces in the fusiform gyrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Golby et al., 2001</ref>), amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Lieberman et al., 2005)</ref>, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Richeson et al., 2003)</ref>. A study of Chinese participants observed enhanced fusiform activity in response to Black/White faces compared to Asian faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Zhou et al., 2020)</ref>. Similarly, electroencephalography (EEG) research compared event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to faces of different races. EEG studies of White participants found that viewing Black compared to White faces increased an early negative activity (N1) peaking at about 100 ms after face onset and a following positive activity (P2) peaking at 150-200 ms over the frontal region <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Ito &amp; Urland, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kubota &amp; Ito, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Wiese, 2012)</ref>. EEG studies of Chinese participants showed that viewing Black faces compared to Asian faces enlarged the N1 amplitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Zhang &amp; Han, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Zhou et al., 2020)</ref> and that viewing White compared to Asian faces increased the P2 amplitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Sheng &amp; Han, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sheng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Zhang &amp; Han, 2021)</ref>. The neuroimaging findings suggested enhanced brain responses to other-race relative to same-race faces and highlight the neural basis for coding interracial differences that contribute to racial categorization.</p><p>Another line of neuroimaging research examined neural coding of intragroup similarities during perception of same-race and other-race faces using a repetition suppression paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Zhang &amp; Han, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Zhang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Zhou et al., 2020)</ref>. In this paradigm participants viewed faces of only one racial category in a repetition condition or faces of two racial categories in an alternating condition. The neural processing of intraracial similarity of different individual faces of the same racial group was assessed by quantifying repetition suppression of brain activities in response to same-race or other-race faces in the repetition (vs. alternating) condition. By recording ERPs to face stimuli, it was found that, while Chinese participants showed significant repetition suppression of the P2 amplitude in response to White faces, White participants exhibited significant repetition suppression of the P2 amplitude in response to Asian faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Zhang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Zhou et al., 2020)</ref>. Similar stimuli and paradigms used in fMRI experiments unraveled repetition suppression of neural responses to other-race faces in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate, and left frontal cortex whereas repetition suppression of neural responses to same-race faces occurred in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Zhou et al., 2020)</ref>. These neuroimaging results corroborate the findings of behavioral studies by showing evidence that how the brain responds to faces of different races also depends on the interracial relationships between observers' own racial identities and perceived racial identities of others. Taken together, the paradigms and findings of the previous behavioral and brain imaging studies provide practicable operational estimations of observers' racial identities.</p><p>Racial ingroup biases in empathy and prosocial behavior Perception and categorization of others in terms of perceived race have produced profound consequences in attitude, emotion, and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amodio &amp; Cikara, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Freeman &amp; Johnson, 2016)</ref>. One line of laboratory research related to the current study has revealed consistent evidence for racial ingroup bias in prosocial behaviors and its underlying psychological and neural mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Krosch &amp; Amodio, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Telzer et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, people tended to donate less money <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Krosch &amp; Amodio, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Mathur et al., 2010)</ref> and time <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Mathur et al., 2010)</ref> to help other-race than same-race individuals. Moreover, people tended to give less medical assessment and treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Drwecki et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hoffman et al., 2016)</ref> but harsher punishment to other-race than same-race targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Johnson et al., 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Because empathy provides a basis of prosocial behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Batson et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Batson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Decety et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Eisenberg &amp; Fabes, 1990)</ref>, the findings of racial ingroup bias in prosocial behaviors have inspired research on discrepant empathic brain responses to perceived pain in same-race and other-race individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Han, 2018</ref>). An early fMRI study found that White adults showed stronger activations in the ACC, supplementary motor area (SMA), and bilateral inferior frontal cortices (IFC) when viewing painful (vs. non-painful) stimulations applied to White than Asian faces whereas a reverse pattern of brain activations was observed in Chinese adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. ERP research also revealed larger P2 amplitudes in response to painful (vs. neutral) expressions of same-race than other-race faces in both White and Chinese students <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Sheng &amp; Han, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sheng et al., 2016)</ref>. Racial ingroup biases in empathic neural responses were also identified in other brain regions involved in empathy for pain, including the anterior insula (AI), sensorimotor area, IFC, mPFC, and TPJ, and were replicated in different racial samples (e.g., White, Black, and Asian) from different countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Avenanti et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Azevedo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cheon et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Contreras-Huerta et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fourie et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Mathur et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Sheng et al., 2014)</ref>. These findings indicate that neural responses to others' suffering in both cognitive and affective components of the empathy network <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Decety &amp; Jackson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fallon et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lamm et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lamm et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Zaki &amp; Ochsner, 2012)</ref> are modulated by the interracial relationship between an empathizer and an empathized target.</p><p>Given the negative social consequences of racial ingroup biases in face perception and empathy, there have been increasing interests in investigation of whether sociocultural experiences may reduce the racial ingroup bias in empathic brain activity. It was found that short-term experiences of building ingroup relationships with other-race individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Sheng &amp; Han, 2012)</ref> or being primed with a different cultural value <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Wang et al., 2015)</ref> reduced observers' racial ingroup favoritism in empathic neural responses. Similarly, long-term experiences of living in a different sociocultural environment that increased interracial contact augmented empathic brain activities in response to other-race pain and resulted in reduced racial ingroup bias in empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zhou et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Zuo &amp; Han, 2013)</ref>. Despite these findings, the specific cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying variations of racial ingroup bias in empathy remain unclear. As mentioned above, the interracial relationship between an observer and a perceived target, which is constructed based on both perceived race of targets and observers' racial identities, plays a fundamental role in generation of racial ingroup biases in empathy. Damping perceived interracial relationships may be critical for interventions of racial ingroup biases in empathy and prosocial behaviors. However, it is unlikely to change perceptual features (e.g., skin color, facial configuration) that mediate empathized targets' racial identities. A possible way to weaken perceived interracial relationships is to shift observers' own racial identities. The present study sought to test this approach by conducting systematic behavioral and brain imaging experiments.</p><p>Development of racial identities across the lifespan Racial identity is a part of self-concept that focuses on one's own association with a specific racial group and background <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Rowley et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Williams et al., 2020)</ref>. Racial identity and ethnic identity are different in the ways of being defined and studied. Ethnic identity refers to the collective identity of a group of people who have a common ancestry, shared history, traditions, and cultural traits, whereas racial identity denotes the collective identity of a group of people who are believed to share physical characteristics such as skin color, facial features, and other hereditary traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cokley, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Phinney, 1996)</ref>. Studies of racial identity have focused on responses to racial discrimination and its internal constructs, whereas ethnic identity has been used to refer to one's sense of belonging to an ethnic group defined by one's cultural heritage <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Helms, 2007)</ref>. Our paper uses the term 'racial identity' since both the stimuli and manipulations in our study focused on perceptual identities of observers and perceived targets related to racial discrimination in behaviors.</p><p>Early research has revealed that, as a concept about one of an individual's social attributes, racial identity develops from infancy to adolescence in which individuals continuously explore the meaning of racial identities and finally commit to a particular definition of their own racial identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cross, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Phinney, 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Phinney, , 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Phinney &amp; Ong, 2007)</ref>. For example, though unable to report their own racial identities, infants by nine months started to show deficits in recognition of faces from unfamiliar relative to familiar racial groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Timeo et al., 2017)</ref>. Research based on interview showed that, by 4-5 years, children not only labeled their own ethnic/racial identities but also reported beliefs that their ethnic/racial identities do not change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Serrano-Villar &amp; Calzada, 2016)</ref>, consistent with a common belief of constancy of an individual's racial identity.</p><p>However, behavioral studies of biracial individuals and adoptees have shown results suggesting that individuals' racial identities may vary due to social experiences or contexts. A study of White-Black biracial adults showed that, in a visual search task, priming the participants with Black identities resulted in faster responses to Black than White faces, whereas priming with White identities led to faster responses to White than Black faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chiao et al., 2006)</ref>. Another study tested adults of Korean origin who were adopted by European White families at the ages of 3-9 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Sangrigoli et al., 2005)</ref>. It was found that, in a face recognition task, the adoptees performed similarly to White adults but differently from native Korean adults by showing better recognition of White than Asian faces. These findings imply that sociocultural experiences may shift individuals' racial identities that produce impacts on face perception and recognition.</p><p>In line with these empirical findings, a recent lifespan model of ethnic-racial identity has proposed that people's racial identity can be reconstructed across the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Williams et al., 2020)</ref>. This model disentangles five dimensions of individuals' ethnic-racial identities, including ethnic-racial awareness (i.e., perceptions of ethnic-racial categories), ethnic-racial affiliation (i.e., sense of belongingness to one or more ethnic-racial groups), ethnic-racial attitudes (i.e., evaluation of ethnic-racial groups and their members), ethnic-racial behaviors (i.e., actions or performances reflecting values and attitudes), and ethnic-racial knowledge relevant to one's ethnic-racial group. It is posited that although the processes to construct ethnic-racial identity begin early in infancy, these processes continue to unfold throughout the lifespan until late adulthood such that identity-relevant experiences may trigger identity reconstruction. Several factors contribute to shape individuals' identity-relevant experiences, including individuals' developmental capacities (e.g., perceptual and cognitive capacities), local contexts (e.g., family, neighborhood, and schooling), and individual factors (e.g., social class, gender, ethnicity/race). Most importantly, the lifespan model of ethnic-racial identity posits that shifts in self-labeling of ethnic-racial identity may occur during adulthood in response to social contexts and experiences.</p><p>Despite the theoretical hypothesis regarding lifespan development of ethnicracial identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Williams et al., 2020)</ref>, to our knowledge, there has been little empirical research on whether monoracial adults' racial identities can be shifted from their original race toward a different one. In particular, no research has examined whether behavioral or neural indices of monoracial adults' racial identities can be shifted via laboratory manipulations. To date, it remains unknown whether the original racial identity of a monoracial adult constructed during early experiences can be shifted toward a different racial identity so as to reduce his/her racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic behaviors.</p><p>Previous studies relevant to this issue have investigated whether bodily illusions may reduce biases against other-race individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Maister, Slater, et al., 2015)</ref>.

These findings suggest that increasing perceived similarity in skin color between observers and perceived targets may change observers' attitudes toward targets and their brain responses to targets' suffering. However, owning different skin colors does not necessarily change a person's racial identity (e.g., changing skin color from white to tan after spending a summer on beach does not alter one's own racial identity). New paradigms beyond bodily illusions are required for testing racial identity shift in monoracial adults and relevant changes in empathy and prosocial behaviors.</p><p>A new approach to racial identity shift in monoracial adults Human faces provide rich information about individuals' social identities, including race, gender, and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Freeman &amp; Johnson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hugenberg et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Zebrowitz &amp; Montepare, 2008</ref>) and a person's face provides a basis for recognition of his/her own social identities. Therefore, it is likely to shift an individual's racial identity by changing his/her face to an other-race face via experimental manipulations. Previous work found that touching the face of a participant who was viewing simultaneous touches on a partner's face enhanced feelings of more self than other in morphed images produced from faces of oneself and the partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Sforza et al., 2010)</ref> and led to a remapping of own peripersonal space onto the body of another person <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Maister, Cardini, et al., 2015)</ref>. These findings suggest that personal identities may be shifted by incorporating others' facial features into the representation of one's own face. Following studies reported that shared interpersonal multisensory stimulation experiences with an other-race face led to feelings of owning the observed face <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Estudillo &amp; Bindemann, 2016)</ref> and facilitated correct responses to tactile stimulations delivered on one's own face <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Fini et al., 2013)</ref>. These findings suggest possible shift of personal identities but do not provide direct empirical evidence for racial identity shift in monoracial adults due to a few methodological limitations.</p><p>First, previous research focused on visual-tactile interpersonal experiences that incorporated others' facial features into perceived own face in an observer but may not generate a sense of owning a different identity in the observer. Our daily experiences of watching the self in a mirror and perceived visual-motor synchrony between one's own body and face are pivotal for creating a sense of own identity. A recent study, which employed virtual reality technology to induce synchronous movements of an observer's head and a perceived robot face, found that such visualmotor synchrony prompted feelings of being incorporated into the robot and increased positive attitudes toward robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Ventre-Dominey et al., 2019)</ref>. This finding suggests a possibility of shifting an observer's racial identity through visual-motor synchrony between one'w own head/body and a perceived other-race face. Second and more importantly, incorporating an other-race face with one's own body, if successful, may shift both personal and racial identities, which are the two key components of selfconcept <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Tajfel, 1981)</ref>. Previous research, however, did not disentangle the effects of shifting personal and racial identities on following behaviors. This can be realized by comparing effects of visual-motor synchrony of an observer's head/body with a perceived same-race or other-race faces that are both different from the observer's personal identity whereas only the other-race face may shift the observer's racial identity. Third, previous work did not provide separate evidence for racial identity shift and its following effect on social emotion and behavior. Separate estimations of racial identity shift and its effect are required to provide a causal interpretation of the relationships between racial identities and social emotion and behavior. Finally, there was little objective assessment of racial identity shift in previous research. This can be complemented by collecting behavioral and brain imaging measures of cognitive and neural representations of shifted racial identity and its relationship with neural underpinnings of following social emotion and behavior.</p><p>Taken together, a new approach to shifting racial identities in monoracial adults should go beyond the methodological limitations of previous studies and provide empirical tests of effects specifically reflecting racial identity shift. In addition, this new approach should facilitate investigation of modulation effects of racial identity shift on following social emotion and behavior. In the present study we sought to develop such a new approach to address two important issues: (1) whether the original racial identity of a monoracial adult can be shifted toward a different racial identity and, if so, (2) whether shifting an individual's racial identity may reduce his/her racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making. To address these issues would open a new avenue to intervention of racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the present study</head><p>The present study tested two hypotheses based on the implications of the previous theoretical model of lifespan development of ethnic-racial identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Williams et al., 2020)</ref> and relevant empirical findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chiao et al., 2006)</ref>. First, we hypothesized that the racial (i.e., Asian) identity of a monoracial Chinese adult can be shifted toward a different racial identity (i.e., White) via a short-term experience that links his/her own body to a White face. To test this hypothesis, we developed a facial mask training procedure (MTP) that aimed to associate an observer's body with another person's face by asking the observer to wear a White facial disguise (WMTP group as an experimental condition) or an Asian facial disguise (AMTP group as a control condition, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>). Participants underwent WMTP or AMTP in pairs which consisted of four phases that produced experiences of visual-motor-tactile synchrony to promote awareness of the association between the self and the identity of the wearing facial disguise and to strengthen feelings of affiliation with a racial group. While WMTP might shift both racial identities (i.e., from Asian toward White) and personal identities (i.e., from the original self to the wearing facial disguise) of Chinese participants, AMTP shifted their personal but not racial identities. Such a between-subjects design allowed us to quantify the effects of racial identity shift by comparing self-report, behavioral, and EEG/fMRI measures in various tasks in the two samples of Chinese participants who underwent WMTP and AMTP, respectively. Previous studies of ethnic/racial identity mainly depend on questionnaire measures that, however, are confronted with concerns about reliability and validity of scores generated from different versions of scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cokley, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Phinney, 1996)</ref>. We employed various measures, in Experiments 1-3, including self-report, reaction times (RTs) in a perceptual matching task <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Sui et al., 2012)</ref>, and RTs in a racial categorization task <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>, to assess shift of personal and racial identities. These measures were relatively more implicit than questionnaire measures and would reduce potential influences of beliefs of racial constancy to a minimum degree. Our results in Experiments 1-3 showed evidence that, while both WMTP and AMTP shifted participants' personal identities, WMTP but not AMTP led to shift of racial identities from Asian toward White. In Experiment 4 we integrated fMRI with a self-referential task that has revealed increased activity in the mPFC during reflection of one's own personality and social attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kelley et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Lieberman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Macrae et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Northoff et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Qin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Zhu et al., 2007)</ref>. We focused on whether shifted racial identity is represented in the mPFC which has been shown to code one's own social identities including race <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Ma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Mathur et al., 2012)</ref>. If WMTP shifted Chinese adults' racial identities from Asian toward White, we expected that reflection on the self when viewing the facial disguise that had been linked to oneself would induce stronger mPFC activity after WMTP (vs. AMTP).</p><p>It is now known that empathy includes both bottom-up processing of others' emotional states and top-down modulations by observers' motivation, intention, and beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cui et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Decety, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Decety &amp; Meyer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lamm et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Wu &amp; Han, 2021)</ref>. Because previous findings suggest that an observer's racial identity plays a key role in generation of the racial ingroup bias in empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Avenanti et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Han, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>, we raised the second hypothesis that shifting Chinese adults' Asian identities toward White may result in decreased racial ingroup (Asian) biases in empathy by increasing empathic neural responses to perceived pain in Whites. In addition, since empathy provides a motive for altruistic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Batson et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Batson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Decety et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Eisenberg &amp; Fabes, 1990)</ref>, we further predicted that shifting Chinese adults' racial identity from Asian toward White may reduce their racial ingroup biases in altruistic decision-making.</p><p>We tested the second hypothesis in Experiments 5-7 by collecting EEG, fMRI, and behavioral data. In Experiment 5 we recorded EEG signals in response to painful and neutral expressions of Asian and White faces from Chinese adults who had experienced WMTP or AMTP. Because previous research on Chinese has revealed larger P2 amplitudes in responses to painful (vs. neutral) expressions of Asian than White faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Sheng &amp; Han, 2012)</ref>, we expected that WMTP compared to AMTP would reduce Asian favoritism in the P2 responses to painful expressions by enhancing P2 responses to painful expressions of White faces. Based on our EEG results in Experiment 5, in Experiment 6, we further localized brain regions in which empathic responses to White faces were increased after WMTP by recording fMRI signals in response to video clips showing painful or non-painful simulations to Asian or White faces. Because affective (e.g., experience sharing) and cognitive (e.g., perspective taking) processes involved in empathy are mediated by distinct neural networks (e.g., premotor/inferior frontal/insular cortices and TPJ, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fallon et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lamm et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lamm et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Zaki &amp; Ochsner, 2012)</ref>, we examined whether WMTP increases responses to perceived pain in White faces in the cognitive or affective empathy network. Finally, in Experiment 7, we employed a monetary donation task and an implicit association test to estimate implicit racial ingroup biases in altruistic decision-making and social attitudes. We predicted that WMTP (vs. AMTP) would decrease racial ingroup (Asian) favoritism in altruistic decision-making and attitudes in monoracial Chinese adults.</p><p>Taken together, our study provided consistent self-report, behavioral, EEG, and fMRI evidence that monoracial adults' racial identities can be shifted during a shortterm training procedure. Moreover, shifting adults' racial identities resulted in reduced racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making. Our findings highlight the malleability of adults' racial identities and open a new avenue to potential interventions of racial discrimination in social behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A mask training procedure</head><p>We designed a facial mask training procedure to shift a Chinese adult's racial identity from Asian toward White. WMTP using White facial disguises consisted of four phases, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>. In phase 1 (1 minute) two same-gender participants who had not known each other before the study were recruited at the same time. Two same-gender White facial disguises were randomly assigned to the participants. Phase 2 (10 minutes) aimed to build perceptual associations between a participant's body and own facial disguise. After putting on own facial disguise, the participants were seated in two separate rooms and each was asked to move his/her head/body while looking in a mirror to create visual-motor synchrony between own body and the wearing facial disguise. Phase 3 (1 minute) sought to strengthen participants' feelings of affiliation with White by asking each participant to examine the other through a window and oneself in a mirror. This manipulation also helped each participant to build a new personal identity of own facial disguise, which was different from that of other facial disguise. Phase 4 (5 minutes) further strengthened the association between each participant and own facial disguise by performing a selforiented task that required visual-motor-tactile synchrony. On each trial, an image of own or other facial disguise with a red dot on its eyes, cheeks, ears, or nose was presented on a computer monitor. The participant was asked to point to the corresponding locations on his/her own facial disguise using the index finger only when viewing the image of own facial disguise.</p><p>The four-phase procedure was the same for AMTP except that Asian facial disguises were used. We tested two independent samples of Chinese adults who were randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP in all the following experiments. To compare self-report, behavioral, and brain imaging measures in the two samples allowed us to disentangle effects of racial and personal identity shift on the tests in Experiments 1-7 in which all measures were collected from participants without wearing facial disguises. Moreover, all facial disguises were used in the own and other conditions across all participants and this design controlled for effects of unspecific factors of perceived faces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WMTP and AMTP shift personal identity</head><p>To test whether WMTP and AMTP shift an individual's personal identity, in Experiment 1, we tested Chinese adults who were randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP groups (N = 80, 40 in each group). Before and after MTPs, the participants were asked to rate the degree to which they shared personal identity of the wearing facial disguise by answering the question "To what degree you identify yourself as the facial disguise?" on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely identify). Rating scores were subject to a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Time (before vs. after MTPs) as a within-subjects variable and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable. The results showed a significant main effect of Time (F(1, 78) = 171.05, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .69, 90% CI = [.59, .75], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1A</ref>), indicating greater degrees of self-identification as the wearing facial disguise after than before MTPs (4.81 vs. 2.08). However, there was no significant interaction of Time  Group (F(1, 78) = 0.60, p = .440, ηp² = .01, 90% CI = [.00, .07]), providing no evidence for differences in effects of WMTP and AMTP on personal identity shift.</p><p>In Experiment 2 we further assessed MTP effects on personal identity shift by quantifying behavioral responses in a perceptual matching task that revealed a selfprioritization effect (i.e., faster and more accurate responses to associate a shape with the self than others) as a behavioral index of self-specific processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Sui et al., 2012)</ref>. If own facial disguise was identified as the self, RTs and response accuracies to own (vs. other) facial disguise would exhibit the self-prioritization effect after (but not before) MTPs. We tested an independent sample of Chinese adults who were randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP groups (N = 60, 30 in each group) and performed the perceptual matching task before and after MTPs. The participants first learned correct associations between each (own and other) facial disguise and a shape (e.g., triangle or square) and then had to judge correct (the match condition) and incorrect (the mismatch condition) associations by pressing two different keys. We expected shorter RTs and higher accuracies to the association between a shape and own (vs. other) facial disguise after WMTP and AMTP. However, no such effects would be observed before MTPs due to lack of associations between oneself and the wearing facial disguise.</p><p>To test these predictions, we conducted ANOVAs of RTs and response accuracies (arc-sin transformed) in the perceptual matching task before MTPs with Identity (own vs. other facial disguise) and Congruency (match vs. mismatch) as within-subjects variables as well as Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable. There was not any significant effect before MTPs (ps &gt; .209, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1C</ref>-D and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1B</ref>), providing no evidence for difference in responses to own and other facial disguises before the association between oneself and the wearing facial disguise was built.</p><p>However, ANOVAs of RTs and response accuracies after MTPs revealed significant two-way interactions of Identity and Congruency on both RTs (F(1, 58) = 26.24, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .31, 90% CI = [.15, .44]) and accuracies (F(1, 58) = 19.29, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .25, 90% CI = [.10, .39]). Simple effect analyses showed that participants responded faster and more accurately to the association between a shape and own (vs. other) facial disguise in the match condition (RTs: 647 vs. 692 ms, F(1, 58) = 28.13, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .33, 90% CI = [.17, .46], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1E</ref>-F and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1B</ref>; Accuracies: 0.80 vs. 0.76, F(1, 58) = 16.93, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .23, 90% CI = [.08, .36])), whereas no such effects were observed in the mismatch condition (RTs: 713 vs. 712 ms, F(1, 58) = 0.04, p = .840, ηp² = .00, 90% CI = [.00, .04], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S2</ref>; Accuracies: 0.77 vs. 0.77, F(1, 58) = 0.00, p = .958, ηp² = .00, 90% CI = [.00, .00]). Moreover, these effects did not differ significantly between the WMTP and AMTP groups (F(1, 58) = 0.34, p = .560, ηp² = .01, 90% CI = [.00, .07]). These results provided further behavioral evidence that both WMTP and AMTP shifted personal identity from the original self toward own facial disguise and this effect did not differ significantly between WMTP and AMTP groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WMTP but not AMTP shifts racial identity</head><p>Next, we tested the hypothesis that WMTP but not AMTP shifts a Chinese adult's racial identity from Asian toward White. To this end, before and after MTPs, we asked the participants in Experiment 1 to report their racial identities by answering two questions "To what degree you identify yourself as Asian (or White)?" on a 7point Likert scale (1 = not at all, and 7 = extremely identify). The rating scores were first subject to ANOVAs with Racial Identity (White vs. Asian) and Time (before vs. after MTPs) as within-subjects variables and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable. The results first showed a three-way interaction of Racial Identity × Time × Group (F(1, 78) = 67.65, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .46, 90% CI = [.33, .56]), suggesting distinct patterns of self-identified racial identities before and after WMTP and AMTP. Separate analyses revealed that all participants identified themselves as Asians before MTPs (F(1, 78) = 1204.27, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .94, 90% CI = [.92, .95], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  2A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1C</ref>). This effect did not differ significantly between WMTP and AMTP groups (F(1, 78) = 0.67, p = .416, ηp² = .01, 90% CI = [.00, .07]). Nevertheless, the participants who had undergone WMTP reported comparable Asian and White identities (3.78 vs. 3.80, F(1, 78) = 0.00, p = .951, ηp² = .00, 90% CI = [.00, .00]), whereas those who had undergone AMTP still recognized themselves as Asian but not White (6.18 vs. 1.20, F(1, 78) = 149.09, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .66, 90% CI = [.55, .72], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  2A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1C</ref>). This group difference was quantified by a significant interaction of Racial Identity × Group after MTPs (F(1, 78) = 75.30, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .49, 90% CI = [.36, .59]). These results indicate that Chinese participants consciously identified themselves to be Asian and White to a similar degree after WMTP, whereas selfidentified Asian identities remained unchanged after AMTP. In Experiment 3 we further tested racial identity shift due to WMTP by collecting behavioral responses in a racial face categorization task that has revealed faster responses to White than Asian faces in Chinese but a reverse pattern in White participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>. Because the response pattern in the racial face categorization task is determined by observers' racial identities rather than perceived faces, we measured RTs to White and Asian faces in this task from an independent sample of Chinese adults, who were randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP groups (N = 94, 47 in each group), to assess racial identity shift across MTPs. We predicted that the participants would respond faster to White than Asian faces before MTPs. However, if WMTP shifted Chinese adults' racial identities from Asian toward White, they might respond faster to Asian than White faces. Before and after MTPs, the participants were presented with upright or inverted White faces and Asian faces and were asked to classify each face as Asian or White by pressing one of two keys as fast and accurately as possible (see Methods for details). Inverted faces were used to control potential effects of low-level perceptual features of faces on RTs.</p><p>ANOVAs of RTs before MTPs with Perceived Race (White vs. Asian face) and Orientation (upright vs. inverted faces) as within-subjects factors, and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects factor revealed faster responses to White than Asian faces (F(1, 92) = 9.24, p = .003, ηp² = .09, 90% CI = [.01, .19]), and this effect did not differ significantly between WMTP and AMTP groups (ps &gt; .615, <ref type="figure">Fig</ref> . There was also a significant Group × Perceived Race interaction on RTs to inverted faces (F(1, 92) = 4.94, p = .029, ηp² = .05, 90% CI = [.003, .14], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S3</ref>), as the participants responded faster to White than Asian faces after AMTP (596 vs. 619 ms, F(1, 92) = 9.07, p = .003, ηp² = .09, 90% CI = [.02, .19]) but not after WMTP (622 vs. 621 ms, F(1, 92) = 0.02, p = .894, ηp² = .00, 90% CI = [.00, .02]). The RT results before MTPs replicated previous findings of faster responses to White than Asian faces in Chinese <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref> and indicate faster categorization of other-race than same-race faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Zhou et al., 2020)</ref>. The RT variations across WMTP lend support to the hypothesis that WMTP shifted Chinese adults' racial identities from Asian to White. The pattern of RTs to inverted faces after WMTP suggested that faster responses to upright White than Asian faces after WMTP were not due to low-level perceptual features of faces.</p></div>

We recruited an independent sample of Chinese adults who were randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP groups (N = 80, 40 in each MTP group).

The participants had to judge whether the adjective described own facial disguise linked to the self or other facial disguise as a condition to control for nonspecific processes (e.g., linguistic processing and motor responses). The participants also completed the perceptual matching task and a memory task after scanning and the results showed behavioral evidence for identity shift toward own facial disguise in both WMTP and AMTP groups ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S4 and Fig. S5)</ref>.</p><p>We predicted that, if participants' personal identities shifted across MTPs, the mPFC activity during trait judgments on own (but not other) facial disguise would increase after relative to before MTPs. Moreover, the increased mPFC activity in response to own facial disguise would be more salient across WMTP than AMTP because WMTP shifted both personal and racial identities whereas AMTP only shifted personal identities. To test these predictions, we conducted a region of interest (ROI) analysis by extracting BOLD signals from the mPFC that was engaged in reflection of one's own social attributes including race (MNI coordinates: -6/45/3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Ma et al., 2014)</ref>. One-sample tests of BOLD signals revealed that the mPFC activity during judgments on own facial disguises significantly increased after than before both WMTP (t(39) = 4.57, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 0.72, 95% CI = [.37, 1.07]) and AMTP (t(39) = 2.57, p = .028, Cohen's d = 0.41, 95% CI = [.08, .73], false discovery rate (FDR) corrected, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3A</ref>). However, the mPFC activity to other facial disguises did not differ significantly before and after WMTP (t(39) = 0.58, p = .567, Cohen's d = 0.09, 95% CI = [-.22, .40]) and AMTP (t(39) = 2.02, p = .067, Cohen's d = 0.32, 95% CI = [-.001, .64], FDR corrected). These results lend support to the first prediction.</p><p>To further assess distinct patterns of mPFC variations across WMTP and AMTP, differential BOLD signals in the mPFC (after vs. before MTP) were subject to an ANOVA with Identity (own vs. other facial disguise) as a within-subjects variable and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable. The results showed a significant interaction of Identity × Group (F(1, 78) = 6.72, p = .011, ηp² = .08, 90% CI = [.01, .19]), providing evidence for distinct patterns of changes of mPFC activities across WMTP and AMTP. Simple effect analyses verified that judgments on own compared to other facial disguise increased the mPFC activity more strongly across WMTP (0.23 vs. 0.03, F(1, 78) = 13.79, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .15, 90% CI = [.05, .27]) but not across AMTP (0.10 vs. 0.10, F(1, 78) = 0.00, p = .962, ηp² = .00, 90% CI = [.00, .00], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3A)</ref>. Moreover, the mPFC activity to own facial disguise increased to a greater degree across WMTP than AMTP (0.23 vs. 0.10, F(1, 78) = 4.57, p = .036, ηp² = .06, 90% CI = [.002, .15]), providing evidence for the second prediction. To further corroborate the results of ROI analyses, we conducted a whole-brain ANOVA analysis with Identity (own vs. other facial disguise) and Time (before vs. after MTP) as within-subjects variables for WMTP and AMTP groups, respectively. The results revealed a significant mPFC activation in WMTP group (-12/50/2, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.  3B</ref>; voxel-level threshold p &lt; 0.001, cluster-level p &lt; 0.05, Family-wise error (FWE) corrected) but not in AMTP group, though the mPFC showed activation during judgments on own (vs. other) facial disguise after AMTP at a lenient threshold <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig.  S6)</ref>. Together, the results of ROI and whole-brain analyses provided converging evidence that shifted racial identity was associated with enhanced activity in the mPFC that supports neural representations of one's own social attributes.</p></div>

Specifically, we examined whether WMTP relative to AMTP reduces racial ingroup favoritism in EEG response to painful (vs. neutral) expressions, which has been shown in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Li &amp; Han, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Sheng &amp; Han, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sheng et al., 2016)</ref>. We recorded EEG signals in response to painful and neutral expressions of Asian and White faces from Chinese adults who were randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP groups (N = 60, 30 in each MTP group). While viewing White and Asian faces with neutral and painful expressions, the participants judged racial identity of each face (Asian or White) by a button press (see Methods for details, see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> for behavioral results), similar to the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Sheng &amp; Han, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Because previous EEG research has identified a greater neural response to painful (vs. neutral) expressions of same-race than other-race faces at 150-200 ms over the frontal-central region (i.e., the P2 component) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Li &amp; Han, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Sheng &amp; Han, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sheng et al., 2016)</ref>, we focused on whether the racial ingroup bias in the P2 amplitudes to painful (vs. neutral) expressions was reduced by WMTP (vs. AMTP). The P2 amplitudes were subject to an ANOVA with Target Race (White vs. Asian) and Expression (painful vs. neutral) as within-subjects variables and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable.

Separate analyses revealed that the P2 amplitude significantly increased to painful (vs. neutral) expressions of White faces in WMTP group (4.75 vs. 3.78 μV, F(1, 58) = 24.18, p &lt; .001, ηp² = .29, 90% CI = [.14, .43]) but not in AMTP group (4.43 vs. 4.08 μV, F(1, 58) = 3.10, p = .084, ηp² = .05, 90% CI = [.00, .16]). However, the increased P2 amplitude to painful (vs. neutral) expressions of Asian faces did not differ significantly between WMTP and AMTP groups (F(1, 58) = 0.71, p = .403, ηp² = .01, 90% CI = [.00, .09]). These results provide EEG evidence that WMTP (vs. AMTP) reduced the racial ingroup bias in empathic neural responses by enhancing neural responses to perceived pain in White faces. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial identity shift increases brain activity in the affective empathy network to perceived pain in White</head><p>In Experiment 6 we further localized the brain regions in which empathic neural responses to White faces were enhanced by WMTP. An independent sample of Chinese adults was randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP groups (N = 80, 40 in each group). The participants were scanned twice before and after MTPs using fMRI while viewing video clips, adopted from previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Luo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Wu &amp; Han, 2021)</ref>, in which a White or Asian model received a painful stimulation (syringe penetration) to the left or right cheek that induced a painful expression or received a non-painful stimulation (cotton-bud touch) and showed non-painful expressions. The participants had to make judgments on racial identities (White or Asian) of perceived targets (see Methods for details, see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref> for behavioral results). Our data analyses focused on brain regions in the empathic network in which BOLD signals in response to perceived pain in White were increased by WMTP (vs. AMTP).</p><p>We first conducted a whole-brain analysis of BOLD responses to identify the empathic network in response to painful vs. non-painful stimuli before MTPs (combined both White and Asian models and WMTP and AMTP groups).

We also conducted a whole-brain analysis to examine racial ingroup biases in empathic brain responses by calculating the difference in BOLD signals in response to painful (vs. non-painful) stimuli between perceived Asian and White models before MTPs. The results identified stronger activations in the bilateral IFC, right insula, right premotor cortex, superior temporal cortex, and TPJ (voxel-level threshold p &lt; 0.001, clusterlevel p &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5B</ref>, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S4</ref>), similar to previous findings of racial ingroup biases in empathic brain activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Avenanti et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Azevedo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cheon et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Contreras-Huerta et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fourie et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Han, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Mathur et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Sheng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. Next, we conducted ROI analyses to examine whether WMTP compared to AMTP increased neural responses to White models' pain in two networks that showed racial ingroup biases and have been associated with different processes involved in empathy. The ROIs were identified in the whole brain analysis of BOLD signals in response to painful vs. non-painful stimuli before MTP. Network 1 consisted of the right IFC (MNI coordinate: 56/28/6), right premotor cortex (48/6/50), and right insula (40/0/-16), which are activated during imitation of others' emotions and allow automatic sharing of others' affective experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carr et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lamm et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lamm &amp; Majdandzic, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Weisz &amp; Zaki, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Zaki &amp; Ochsner, 2012)</ref>. Network 2 consisted of the bilateral TPJ (-64/-40/34 and 62/-28/34) and superior temporal sulcus (50/-16/-8), which support cognitive processes such as perspective taking during empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hein &amp; Singer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lamm et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lamm et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Shamay-Tsoory, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Zaki &amp; Ochsner, 2012)</ref>. Each brain region was defined as a sphere with a 6-mm radius centered at a peak coordinate identified in the whole-brain analysis (voxel-level threshold p &lt; 0.0001, FWE corrected). Contrast values in response to painful vs. non-painful stimulations to White models after MTPs were calculated from the two networks, respectively. ANOVA of contrast values in Network 1 with Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable and ROI (right IFC, premotor cortex, insula) as a within-subjects variable showed a significant main effect of Group (F(1, 78) = 6.91, p = .010, ηp² = .08, 90% CI = [.01, .19], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.  5C</ref>), indicating enhanced empathic responses to White models' pain after WMTP compared to AMTP. However, this effect did not vary significantly in the three brain regions in this network (F(1, 78) = 0.46, p = .616, ηp² = .01, 90% CI = [.00, .06]), Similar analyses of neural responses in Network 2 failed to find any significant effect (ps &gt; .076). These results provide evidence that shifting the participants' racial identities from Asian toward White enhanced their brain activities supporting affective sharing of perceived pain in White models.</p><p>To reinforce the results of the above univariate analyses, we conducted a multivariate pattern analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hebart et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Norman et al., 2006)</ref> of neural responses in Network 1. This analysis applied a classification algorithm on spatially distributed (multivoxel) patterns of activities in the three regions in Network 1 to infer perceived painful or non-painful stimulations to White models (see Methods for details). Based on the results of our univariate analyses, we predicted that the patterns of neural activities in Network 1 would be able to decode perceived painful versus non-painful stimulations to White models after WMTP but not after AMTP. Indeed, the results of this analysis showed that the decoding accuracy for painful (vs. nonpainful) stimulations to White models based on the response patterns in the right IFC, premotor, and insula was significantly higher than the chance level (50%) after WMTP (59.79%, t(39) = 4.04, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 0.64, 95% CI = [.30, .98], FDR corrected) but not after AMTP (53.96%, t(39) = 1.65, p = .144, Cohen's d = 0.26, 95% CI = [-.06, .57], FDR corrected). Thus the results of the univariate and multivariate analyses consistently support that WMTP enhanced the right IFC, premotor, and insula responses to perceived pain in Whites (also see the results of whole brain analyses in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table S5</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. S7</ref>).</p><p>Given the findings in Experiment 4 that the mPFC mediated the shifted racial identity, we further tested a neural model that, while viewing White models' pain after WMTP, the mPFC modulated empathic neural responses in the brain regions showing racial ingroup biases. We conducted dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses which focused on bidirectional connectives from the mPFC to the right premotor cortex (Model family 1), right IFC (Model family 2), and right insula (Model family 3), respectively (see Methods and <ref type="figure">Fig. S8 for details)</ref>. The White models' pain was defined as visual inputs and modulators for each model family. A Bayesian model selection procedure was employed to compare the three model families by computing the exceedance probability. The results identified Model family 1 as the winning family model with a family exceedance probability of 94.59%. This winning model was characterized by the driving visual input (White models' pain) from the right premotor cortex and bilateral intrinsic connectivity between the mPFC and right premotor cortex <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5D</ref>). Further estimation of the model parameters in Model family 1 revealed a significant intrinsic connectivity from the mPFC to the premotor cortex (t(39) = 2.87, p = .007, Cohen's d = 0.45, 95% CI = [.13, .78]) but not along the opposite direction (t(39) = 0.79, p = .433, Cohen's d = 0.13, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-.18, .44]</ref>). In addition, perceived painful stimulations to White models enhanced the connectivity from the mPFC to the premotor cortex (t(39) = 2.43, p = .020, Cohen's d = 0.38, 95% CI = [.07, .69]), but decreased the connectivity in the opposite direction (t(39) = -2.08, p = .044, Cohen's d = -0.33, 95% CI = [-.64, -.02]). Similar DCM analyses of fMRI data in AMTP group did not find a winning family model (i.e., the three model families' exceedance probabilities are 46.01%, 24.41%, and 29.58%). These results suggest a potential neural model that WMTP-induced racial identity shift in the mPFC modulated the premotor activity when viewing White models receiving painful stimulations.</p><p>Because Experiments 4 and 6 tested the same group of participants, we examined whether participants with stronger mPFC activities underlying the shifted identity in Experiment 4 would exhibit greater premotor responses to White (vs. Asian) models' pain after WMTP. Indeed, a Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive association between the increased mPFC activity in response to own (vs. other) White facial disguise across WMTP in Experiment 4 and the right premotor activity in response to perceived painful (vs. non-painful) stimulations to White models after WMTP in Experiment 6 (r = .35, p = .027, 95% CI = [.15, .54], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5E</ref>). These results provide further evidence that a stronger neural representation of the shifted identity may contribute to greater empathic neural responses to White models' suffering after racial identity shift.</p></div>

We tested this prediction in Experiment 7 by asking Chinese adults to perform an altruistic decisionmaking task before and after WMTP or AMTP (N = 80, 40 in each MTP group). This task was designed to assess how altruistic decision-making was sensitive to racerelated information in faces who were supposed to receive helps. We created a set of morphed faces which varied systematically in racial identity (from Asian to White) and expression (from non-painful to painful). On each trial the participants were presented with two morphed faces to the left and right of a fixation. The percentage of pixels that contribute to perceived racial identities and painful expressions of the two faces varied independently from 10% to 90%. After being informed that these faces were patients who were suffering from COVID-19, the participants were asked to donate ¥10 to one of the two faces (see Methods for details).</p><p>Participants' decisions (coded as 1 = choice of the left face; 0 = choice of the right face) were fitted to a generalized linear mixed-effect model. The full model was described using Wilkinson notation as:</p><p>Altruistic decision~Race * Expression * Time * Mask +(1 + Race + Expression|Participant) The fixed-effect regressors included Race (a continuous variable: the difference in the amounts of Asian pixels between the left and right faces in each trial), Expression (a continuous variable: the difference in the amounts of painful pixels between the left and right faces in each trial), Time (a category variable: before vs. after MTPs), Group (a category variable: WMTP vs. AMTP), and their interactions. Following the maximal principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barr et al., 2013)</ref>, random effects were incorporated with Race and Expression as by-subject random effect slopes. If the participants' choices favored Asian and painful faces, the coefficients of Race and Expression would be significantly larger than zero in the model. Furthermore, if WMTP reduced participants' Asian favoritism in altruistic decisions, the coefficient of Race would be decreased after (vs. before) WMTP. As expected, the coefficients of Race (b = 0.32, p &lt; .001) and Expression (b = 1.19, p &lt; .001) were significantly larger than zero. Furthermore, the results showed a significant interaction of Group × Time × Race (b = 0.19, p = .005). Post hoc analyses revealed that the Race coefficient was significantly decreased after compared to before WMTP (b = -0.11, p = .021) whereas AMTP (after vs. before MTPs) failed to produce a significant effect on the coefficient of Race (b = 0.07, p = .101, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6A</ref>). These results suggest decreased Asian favoritism in altruistic decision-making due to WMTP. Finally, we estimated whether WMTP reduced implicit attitudes toward White faces by asking the participants in Experiment 7 to perform a race version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Greenwald et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Greenwald et al., 2003)</ref> before and after MTPs. The participants were asked to classify Asian/White faces and positive/negative words by pressing one of two keys as fast and accurately as possible. A D score was calculated based on RTs and accuracies to estimate negative attitudes toward White faces (as indexed by a D score larger than zero, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Greenwald et al., 2003)</ref>. Similar to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Banakou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Peck et al., 2013)</ref>, we calculated the difference in D scores (ΔD score) obtained after (vs. before) MTPs in WMTP and AMTP groups, respectively. If WMTP decreases negative attitudes toward White faces, the ΔD score would be significantly reduced across WMTP. As predicted, the ΔD score was significantly reduced in WMTP group (t(39) = -2.83, p = .007, Cohen's d = -0.45, 95% CI = [-.77, -.12]) but not in AMTP group (t(39) = -0.47, p = .641, Cohen's d = -0.07, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-.39, .24]</ref> <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">, Fig. 6B</ref>). These results provide evidence for reduced negative attitudes toward White faces across WMTP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study investigated the malleability of monoracial adults' racial identities and the effects of racial identity shift on empathy and altruistic decisionmaking. By integrating a short-term training procedure with self-report, behavioral, EEG, and fMRI measures in seven experiments, we showed convergent evidence suggesting that the training procedure shifted Chinese adults' racial identities from Asian toward White and that the shifted identity was mediated by enhanced mPFC activity. Moreover, our work provided EEG, fMRI, and behavioral evidence that racial identity shift reduced racial ingroup biases in both empathic neural responses and altruistic decision-making. Our findings shed new light on the malleable nature of monoracial adults' racial identities and their functional significance in racial ingroup biases in social emotion and behavior.</p><p>Four innovations characterize the training procedure developed in our study for inducing racial identity shift and disclosing its influences on empathy and altruistic decision-making. First, to generate a sense of ownership of another person's identity, our MTPs built associations between a facial disguise to a participant's body by integrating multisensory information via visual-motor-tactile synchrony, which was voluntarily generated and controlled by the participant. This is different from the paradigm used in previous studies in which participants passively observed visualmotor or perceived visual-tactile synchrony between oneself and an observed target to generate feelings of ownership of others' hands or faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Farmer &amp; Maister, 2017)</ref>. The visual-motor-tactile synchrony in our MTPs generated a link between one's own body and the wearing facial disguise and a sense of possessing the disguise's identity. Second, our MTPs tested two participants simultaneously who were able to view both oneself wearing a facial disguise and the other participant who wore a different facial disguise with the same racial identity. This manipulation strengthened feelings of affiliation with a racial group that were particularly novel for the participants who underwent WMTP. Third, we tested two samples of participants who went through WMTP and AMTP, respectively. This design allowed us to disentangle the effect of racial identity shift from that of personal identity shift because both WMTP and AMTP led to personal identity shift whereas only WMTP produced racial identity shift from Asian toward White in Chinese participants. Finally, as all the facial disguises were used as own and other facial disguises across the participants, our designs that compared behavioral and brain responses to own and other facial disguises controlled for nonspecific factors, such as attractiveness and familiarity of faces, that may affect feelings of ownership of others' faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Sforza et al., 2010)</ref>. Together, the MTPs developed in our work provide a novel paradigm that is specific for shifting racial identities and possible intervention of racial biases in social emotion and behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial identity shift in monoracial adults</head><p>Our systematic behavioral and brain imaging findings have two theoretical contributions to our understanding of racial identity and its functional significance in human empathy and altruistic behavior. The first contribution regards the concept of racial identity constancy. While racial identity encompasses multiple processes and contents that construct a sense of being related to a specific racial group <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Williams et al., 2020)</ref>, a common ground of existing theories regarding racial identity is that an individual's racial identity does not change over time and the belief of racial identity constancy emerges in early childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aboud, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bernal et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Pauker et al., 2010)</ref>. Although it has been posited that racial identity shift may occur during adulthood in response to individual factors and social contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Williams et al., 2020)</ref>, to our knowledge, there has been no empirical research that sought to shift monoracial adults' racial identities. The current work provides the first empirical evidence that challenges the proposition of racial identity constancy in monoracial adults. Our findings support our first hypothesis that racial identity of a monoracial adult can be shifted toward a different racial identity via a short-term laboratory training.</p><p>Our self-report measures in Experiment 1 and RT measures in the perceptual matching task in Experiment 2 provided evidence that both WMTP and AMTP promoted subjective feelings and behavioral indices of sharing personal identity of one's own wearing facial disguise. The personal identity shift from the original self to another person took place regardless of the racial identity of the wearing facial disguise. However, our results in Experiments 1 and 3 showed evidence that only WMTP induced shift of racial identities in monoracial Chinese adults. Self-report measures in Experiment 1 showed that all the participants identified themselves as Asian but not White prior to MTPs. Nevertheless, they reported increased feelings of being White and decreased feelings of being Asian after WMTP (but not AMTP), resulting in self-labeled Asian and White identities to a similar degree. While the shift of racial identities in self-reports appears novel, the patterns of the self-report measures do not manifest a qualitative change of racial identities across WMTP. Our RT measures in the face categorization task in Experiment 3 showed that, while the participants responded faster to White than Asian faces before WMTP and AMTP, the participants undergoing WMTP (but not AMTP) responded faster to Asian than White faces. The pattern of response times before WMTP in our work replicated previous observations in studies of Chinese adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>. By contrast, the pattern of RTs after WMTP was similar to that observed in previous studies of White adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chiao et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Levin, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Sangrigoli et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Valentine &amp; Endo, 1992)</ref>. Our results in the face categorization task before and after WMTP in Experiment 3 echoed previous findings in Asian and White participants, respectively. Note that the effects of WMTP on self-report and RT estimations of racial identities were not observed in the participants who underwent AMTP. Therefore, our results cannot be attributed to personal identity shift or other nonspecific factors and provide consistent evidence supporting our first hypothesis regarding shift of Chinese adults' racial identities from Asian toward White via WMTP.</p><p>Our fMRI results in Experiment 4 further unraveled the neural substrate underlying shifted racial identities. The results of the memory test after the selfreferential task during scanning suggested priorities in memory of trait adjectives related to own (vs. other) facial disguise. This result was similar to previous findings of the self-advantage in memory retrieval of self-related information <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Symons &amp; Johnson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Zhu et al., 2007)</ref>. Moreover, we found that, after MTPs, reflection on own (vs. other) facial disguise also activated the mPFC. This result replicated the previous fMRI findings that the mPFC is engaged in neural representations of one's own personality and social attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kelley et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Macrae et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Zhu et al., 2007)</ref>. Importantly, we found that WMTP compared to AMTP even induced greater mPFC activations during reflections on own (vs. other) facial disguise. Because both WMTP and AMTP shifted personal identities whereas WMTP but not AMTP shifted racial identities, as supported by the results of self-report and RT measures, our fMRI results further highlight the mPFC as the neural underpinning of shifted racial identities.</p><p>Together, our self-report, behavioral, and fMRI results provide converging evidence suggesting that a short-term training procedure linking a White facial disguise to a monoracial Chinese adult's body led to shift of his/her racial identity from Asian toward White with a neural imprint in the mPFC. As a part of an individual's self-concept regarding racial group memberships, one's own racial identity is constructed from one's experiences during development and is supposed to be stable and does not change since early childhood (Serrano-Villar &amp; Calzada, 2016; <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Williams et al., 2020)</ref>. Skin tone and facial shapes provide a perceptual basis for establishment of one's own racial identity as well as perceived racial identities of others, relying on the specific neural processes mediating spontaneous encoding of these perceptual properties to distinguish two different racial groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Ito &amp; Urland, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kubota &amp; Ito, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Sheng &amp; Han, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Wiese, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Zhang &amp; Han, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Zhou et al., 2020)</ref> and to identify similarity of different individuals from the same racial group <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Zhang &amp; Han, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Zhang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Zhou et al., 2020)</ref>. However, a person's racial identity provides an abstract concept of one's own relationship with a specific racial group and effects of this concept on social emotion and behavior take place in most cases when own face is not perceived. Similarly, our self-report, behavioral, and fMRI measures were collected after WMTP or AMTP when the participants did not wear any facial disguise. Our results manifested shift of racial identity as an abstract concept represented in the brain region (i.e., mPFC) that mediated encoding of abstract self-concept in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kelley et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Lieberman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lieberman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Macrae et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Northoff et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Qin et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings challenge the view of racial identity constancy by showing that linking a monoracial adult's body to an other-race face in a short period of time was able to shift his/her concept of racial identity to a different race. Such racial identity shift occurs independently of perceived stimuli, as demonstrated by the comparison of the results from WMTP and AMTP groups, and reinforces the notion that racial identity is a psychological construct that is derived from sociocultural experiences and environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Moya &amp; Markus, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Smedley &amp; Smedley, 2005)</ref>. Most importantly, racial identity can be shifted even during adulthood. Our findings indicate that, rather than being innate and inflexible, monoracial adults' racial identities are dynamic and malleable and can be shifted even by a short period of social experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial identity shift reduces racial ingroup bias in empathy and altruistic decision-making</head><p>The second contribution of our work to the understanding of racial identity is to provide empirical evidence for a causal relationship between individuals' racial identities and empathy and altruistic behavior. Findings of previous studies of empathy for same-race and other-race pain provided implications of the function of observers' racial identities in racial ingroup bias in empathy and prosocial behaviors but did not gain direct empirical evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Han, 2018)</ref>. The current study employed objective measures of empathy by recording EEG signals in response to painful or neutral expressions of same-race and other-race faces and fMRI signals in response to video clips of painful or non-painful stimulations applied to same-race and other-race targets. Our EEG results obtained from AMTP group replicated previous findings of the typical racial ingroup bias in empathy by showing greater neural responses (i.e., the P2 amplitudes) to painful (vs. non-painful) expressions of same-race (vs. otherrace faces) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Han, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Li &amp; Han, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Sheng &amp; Han, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sheng et al., 2016)</ref>. More importantly, our EEG results showed evidence that shifting Chinese adults' racial identities from Asian toward White via WMTP decreased racial ingroup (Asian) biases in empathy by increasing P2 empathic neural responses to perceived pain in White targets. However, the P2 amplitudes recorded in Chinese adults who went through AMTP remained enlarged to painful (vs. non-painful) expressions of Asian than White faces. Thus personal identity shift and other race-irrelevant factors cannot explain the results of WMTP group. The P2 component occurred within 200 ms after stimulus onset and its amplitude increased to painful (vs. non-painful) expressions of same-race faces independently of task demands requiring attention to others' emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Sheng &amp; Han, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sheng et al., 2016</ref>). In the current study WMTP increased the P2 amplitudes to White models' pain even when the task demand encouraged top-down attention to perceived race rather than a painful emotional state. This finding demonstrates modulations of automatic empathic responses to White models' pain by racial identity shift from Asian toward White in Chinese adults.</p><p>Our fMRI data collected prior to MTPs revealed greater responses to perceived painful stimulations applied to same-race than other-race individuals in several brain regions, including the bilateral IFC, right insula, right premotor cortex, and bilateral TPJ. The modulations of empathic neural responses by perceived race cover both the affective and cognitive networks underlying empathy for pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Fan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lamm et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lamm &amp; Majdandzic, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Weisz &amp; Zaki, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Zaki &amp; Ochsner, 2012)</ref> and replicated previous fMRI findings of empathic brain responses that favor same-race over other-race individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Azevedo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Contreras-Huerta et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fourie et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Han, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Mathur et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Sheng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. Critically, we showed evidence that WMTP compared to AMTP significantly increased neural responses to perceived pain in White targets in the right premotor, IFC, and insula. In addition, the results of our DCM analyses suggest that perceived painful stimulations to White individuals promoted connectivity from the mPFC to the premotor cortex. This is consistent with the result that participants with greater mPFC activity underlying the shifted racial identity uncovered in the self-referential task showed stronger activity in the premotor cortex in response to perceived pain in White after WMTP. These results not only suggest a causal influence of shifted racial identity represented in the mPFC on empathic neural responses to White models' pain but also outline a potential neural model of racial ingroup bias in empathy, that is, an observer's racial identity can be activated spontaneously in the mPFC during interracial interactions when viewing others' suffering. The activated racial identity mediated by the mPFC may operate as a topdown modulator to facilitate premotor empathic responses to those who share the same racial identity with the observer.</p><p>Because empathy serves as a psychological basis of altruistic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Batson et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Batson et al., 2015)</ref> and WMTP enhanced empathic brain responses to Whites' pain in Chinese adults, one may expect that racial identity shift due to WMTP would reduce racial ingroup bias in altruistic behavior. Indeed, our measures of choices for monetary donations in the altruistic decision-making task showed evidence that, while Chinese adults were more likely to donate money to faces with more information of parent Asian (vs. White) faces, this racial ingroup bias in altruistic decision-making was significantly reduced after than before WMTP. These effects were observed using implicit measures of racial ingroup favoritism in prosocial behavior and thus made prominent the effect of racial identity shift on altruistic decision-making by controlling influences of social desirability to a minimum degree. The WMTP effects on empathic brain activities were consistent with its effects on altruistic decision-making and these effects together illustrate dynamic changes of prosocial behaviors and brain underpinnings due to racial identity shift in adults.</p><p>Finally, we showed behavioral evidence that monoracial Chinese adults' implicit negative attitudes toward White faces were weakened by WMTP whereas such attitude bias was not affected by AMTP. These results are consistent with previous findings that White participants' negative attitudes toward Blacks were modulated by hand and body illusions that increased perceived similarity between observers and targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Maister et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Peck et al., 2013)</ref>. Our results also indicate that shifting an individual's personal identity via AMTP may not influence his/her attitudes toward other-race individuals. It appears that shifted racial identities via WMTP may produce broad modulations of adults' attitudes, emotions, and behaviors that may bring novel consequences in interracial interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Replication, implication, and limitation</head><p>The current study employed different paradigms, tasks, and measures to repeatedly test our hypotheses regarding racial identity shift and its effects on empathy and prosocial behavior. Self-report measures, though being sensitive to influences of social contexts and expectations, revealed shift of both personal and racial identities due to WMTP and AMTP. RT measures afforded implicit assessment of personal and racial identity shift due to AMTP and WMTP and showed evidence consistent with the self-report results. fMRI provided objective estimations of racial identity shift and uncovered its neural underpinnings. Our EEG, fMRI, and behavioral measures also provided converging evidence that highlighted how racial identity shift affected altruistic decision-making and its empathic neural substrates. Our findings based on multiple modality measures regarding racial identity shift and its impact on empathy and altruistic decision-making fit the asymmetric race processing model that emphasizes the functional role of group/racial identity of both observers and empathized targets in prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Han, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The findings of our current work have notable implications for potential interventions of racial discrimination. While there has been evidence that long-term sociocultural experiences may reduce racial ingroup bias in empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zhou et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Zuo &amp; Han, 2013)</ref>, researchers also explored short-term laboratory manipulations that may eliminate racial biases in cognition and emotion. A novel approach is the minimal group manipulation that includes other-race individuals in an observer's own social group <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Van Bavel et al., 2008)</ref>. The minimal group manipulation reduced racial ingroup bias in empathy by enhancing empathic brain responses to perceived pain in other-race individuals who were assigned to an observer's own team during intergroup competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Sheng &amp; Han, 2012)</ref>. However, both long-term sociocultural experiences and short-term minimal group manipulation diminished empathy biases in favor of same-race individuals by modulating how an observer perceives a limited number of other-race individuals. Our current work may open a new avenue toward intervention of racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making by modulating how an observer perceives his/her own racial identity. While recent research has developed several strategies for regulation of empathy for non-specific targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Weisz &amp; Cikara, 2021)</ref>, our findings suggest that shifting one's own racial identity via a short-term training procedure may specifically facilitate empathy for other-race individuals to reduce racial ingroup biases in empathy and prosocial behavior. Future research should test whether and how shifting racial identity via MTPs developed in our work may weaken racial discrimination broadly in human cognition, emotion, and social behavior.</p><p>Our findings cast a new light on the malleability of monoracial adults' racial identities but not without limitations. For example, our work only tested MTP effects in Chinese young adults. If racial identities develop across the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Williams et al., 2020)</ref> and racial identity plays a critical role in racial ingroup bias in empathy observed in different sociocultural environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Han, 2018)</ref>, we would expect that racial identity can be shifted in adults of different ages and in different sociocultural environments. Social identity has been implicated in various dimensions of discrimination and prejudice related to not only race but gender and age as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chow &amp; Crawford, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Madera et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Packer &amp; Chasteen, 2006)</ref>. While the present study provides evidence for reduction of racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making due to racial identity shift, it remains unclear whether other social identities, such as gender and age, can be similarly shifted to influence social behaviors in other domains via the training procedure developed in this study. Future research is required to test MTP effects on biases in other domains and other cultural samples to deepen our understanding of the nature of social identities in humans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The present study showed converging evidence that racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decision-making are reduced by shifting monoracial adults' racial identities via a short-term training procedure that induces visual-motor-tactile synchrony between an observer's body and a wearing facial disguise. We testified racial identity shift in monoracial adults and its effects by comparing self-report, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures in WMTP and AMTP groups by controlling nonspecific influences. Our findings based on multimodal measures demonstrate racial identity shift in monoracial adults via a short training procedure and verify the key role of racial identity in racial ingroup biases in empathy and altruistic decisionmaking. These findings shed new light on the flexibility of racial identity in monoracial adults, which may provide a basis for future interventions of racial discrimination in cognition, emotion, and behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 80 Chinese young adults for Experiments 1 and 7 (age = 20.5 ± 1.99, 40 females), 60 for Experiments 2 and 5 (age = 21.5 ± 3.12, 30 females), 94 for Experiment 3 (age = 20.8 ± 2.33, 47 females), and 80 for Experiments 4 and 6 (age = 20.8 ± 2.32, 42 females). The sample size for each experiment was pre-determined by G*Power 3.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Faul et al., 2007)</ref>. The power analysis required 54 participants to achieve a power of 0.95 with a medium interaction effect of 0.25 in our mixed design. To allow for potential dropouts, we recruited at least 60 participants for each experiment. All participants identified themselves as Asian with Asian parents. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and had no neurological or psychological disorders. All signed a written informed consent form and were paid for their participation. In all experiments half participants were randomly assigned to WMTP group and half to AMTP group. This study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee of the School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mask training procedure</head><p>In all experiments of this study we tested two independent samples of adults who went through WMTP or AMTP, respectively. The between-subjects design allowed us to control for effects irrelevant to personal identity shift and to disentangle the effects specific to racial identity shift by comparing multimodal measures obtained from the two samples.</p><p>Eight facial disguises were made of photos of faces of real persons (4 Asian and 4</p><p>White young adults selected from the MR2 face database <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Strohminger et al., 2016)</ref>) and were used in the current study. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1A</ref> illustrates WMTP using facial disguises from two volunteers who gave permission of using their photos in this paper. WMTP and AMTP were the same except that Asian facial disguises were used and were given different names. WMTP consisted of four phases and took about 17 minutes. Two same-gender participants who had not known each other before this study were recruited simultaneously. In phase 1 (1 minute) the two participants were randomly assigned with two same-gender White facial disguises to put them on. The participants were informed of names of these faces (i.e., "Philip" and "Jay" for male faces; "Sarah" and "Linda" for female faces who were supposed to be students from a European country). To enhance participants' perceptual awareness of the associations between their bodies and own facial disguises, in phase 2 (10 minutes), the two participants were asked to wear own facial disguise and moved to two rooms separated by a window covered by a curtain. Each participant was asked to look in a mirror, to move freely to feel synchrony of his/her body and the wearing facial disguise, and to imagine to be the facial disguise. To further generate feelings of affiliation with White, in phase 3 (1 minute), the curtain was removed and each participant examined the other through the window and the self in a mirror. This manipulation also helped each participant to identify his/her own personal identity that was different from the other facial disguise and enhanced the feeling of associations with White that was shared by own and other facial disguise. To further strengthen the association between each participant and own facial disguise, in phase 4 (5 minutes), each participant performed a self-oriented task that required visualmotor-tactile synchrony. During this task, images of the two White facial disguises were presented on a computer monitor for 200 ms following an 800-1400 ms interstimulus interval in a random order. A red dot was presented randomly on the eyes, cheeks, ears, or nose of each facial disguise. Each participant wearing own facial disguise was asked to point to the corresponding location on his/her own face using the index finger as accurately and quickly as possible only when viewing his/her own facial disguise presented on the monitor. There were three blocks with 40 trials (20 own and 20 other facial disguises) in the self-oriented task. All measures in the following experiments after WMTP or AMTP were collected from participants after taking off their facial disguises.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, we employed self-report measures to test the hypothesis that WMTP shifts both personal and racial identities while AMTP shifts personal but not racial identity. We collected self-reports from Chinese adults who were randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP, respectively. Before and after the MTPs, the participants were asked to rate the degree to which they shared personal and racial identities of own facial disguise by answering the questions "To what degree you identify yourself as the facial disguise?" and "To what degree you identify yourself as Asian (or White)" on 7-point Likert scales (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely identify). Rating scores of personal identities were subject to a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Time (before vs. after MTPs) as a within-subjects variable and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable. Before and after MTPs rating scores of racial identities were subject to ANOVAs with Race (White vs. Asian) as a within-subjects variable and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable, respectively. Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon correction was applied to adjust the degree of freedom when the sphericity assumption was violated. Post hoc comparisons were corrected by applying the Bonferroni procedure. 90% confidence intervals (CI) of partial eta squared values (ηp²) were reported to assess effect sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>To further assess whether own facial disguise induced personal identity shift by WMTP or AMTP, we measured reaction times (RTs) and response accuracies in a perceptual matching task that revealed faster and more accurate responses to associate a shape with the self than others (i.e., a self-prioritization effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Sui et al., 2012)</ref>. Participants were randomly assigned to WMTP or AMTP groups and performed the perceptual matching task before and after MTPs. During this task participants first learned correct associations between own (and other) facial disguise and a shape (e.g., triangle or square). The associations between shapes and facial disguises were counterbalanced across the participants. Thereafter, the participants conducted a judgment task in which a facial disguise was displayed above a white fixation and a shape was presented below the fixation for 100 ms on each trial. This was followed by an interstimulus interval that varied randomly from 800 to 1200 ms. The participants had to judge whether the perceived face-shape pair was a correct (matched) or incorrect (mismatched) association by pressing one of two buttons (the 'F' or 'J' key on a keyboard) using the left or right index finger as accurately and quickly as possible. A white feedback stimulus (tick or cross) appeared for 500 ms to inform participants of their correct or incorrect responses and was followed by a 500 ms interval before the next trial started. The participants were finally informed of their response accuracies at the end of the experiment. There were three blocks of 80 trials with 20 trials in each condition (i.e., own or other facial disguise with the match or mismatch shape), which were presented in a random order. The relationships between response hands and match/mismatch conditions were counterbalanced across the participants. RTs and response accuracies (arc-sin transformed) obtained before and after MTPs were analyzed separately by conducting ANOVAs with Identity (own vs. other facial disguise) and Congruency (match vs. mismatch) as within-subjects variables as well as Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>To test WMTP effects on racial identity shift, we adopted a racial face categorization task <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>. Face stimuli used in the categorization task were adopted from the MR2 face database but excluded the faces used for making the facial disguises. On each trial a face was presented for 200 ms and followed by an interstimulus interval varied from 800 to 1400 ms. Participants judged racial identity (White or Asian) of each face by pressing one of two buttons ('F' or 'J' key on a keyboard) with the left or right index finger as accurately and quickly as possible. The relationship between response fingers and racial identity was counterbalanced across the participants. There were two blocks of 80 trials in four conditions (20 upright White faces, 20 upright Asian faces, 20 inverted White faces, and 20 inverted Asian faces), which were presented in a random order. The participants performed the categorization task before and after MTPs. Trials with incorrect responses were removed from RT analyses. RTs recorded before and after MTPs were analyzed separately by conducting ANOVAs with Race (White vs. Asian faces) and Orientation (upright vs. inverted faces) as within-subjects variables, and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4</head><p>To examine neural correlates of shifted racial identity, we adopted a selfreferential task <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kelley et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">, Zhu et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ma et al., 2014)</ref>. Three sets of 144 trait adjectives (each adjective consists of two Chinese characters) were selected from a personality trait adjective pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Liu, 1990)</ref>. Each set consisted of 72 positive and 72 negative adjectives. The first two sets of trait adjectives were used in the selfreferential task conducted before and after MTPs. The third set of adjectives was used as new words in a surprising memory test after participants completed the selfreferential task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. S5)</ref>. A block design with two functional sessions was used for fMRI scanning. Each session consisted of 6 blocks (3 blocks for own facial disguise and 3 blocks for other facial disguise) of 12 trials (6 positive and 6 negative adjectives presented in a random order). Two successive blocks were separated with a 15-s fixation. On each trial a trait adjective (2.0° × 1.0°) was presented for 2 s on a screen below own or other facial disguise that subtended a visual angle of 2.72° × 1.28° (width × height) at a viewing distance of 80 cm. The adjective was then removed from the screen while the facial disguise stayed on for 1 s. The participants had to make yes/no judgments on whether the adjective describes the facial disguise by pressing a button with the right index or middle finger. Each session began with 3-s instruction followed by the 36-s judgment task. During scanning prior to MTPs, the participants were asked to judge whether an adjective describes each face. During scanning after MTPs, the participants were asked to judge whether an adjective describes own or other facial disguise. The order of facial disguises presented and the relationships between response fingers and trait judgments were counterbalanced across participants. Participants were also asked to complete the perceptual matching task after MTPs to examine their personal identity shift <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. S4)</ref>.</p></div>

Six movement parameters (x, y, and z for translation; pitch, roll, and yaw for rotation) were extracted for further analyses. The anatomical image was coregistered with the mean realigned functional image. The co-registered functional images were normalized to a 2 × 2 × 2 mm 3 Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and then spatially smoothed with a 4 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The fixed-effect model was conducted by applying a first-level general linear model (GLM) for each participant. All conditions (i.e., own and other facial disguise), as well as the movement parameters, were contained in the GLM to account for any residual movement-related effect. A box-car function was selected to model the hemodynamic convolution. Random-effect analyses were conducted based on statistical parameter maps from each participant to allow population inference. Whole-brain analysis was conducted to examine personal and racial identity shift in WMTP and AMTP groups. Contrast values involved in own versus other facial disguise were examined before and after MTPs, respectively. Paired t-test was performed for the contrast values (own vs. other facial disguise) of after vs. before MTPs in WMTP and AMTP groups, respectively.

The electrode FCz was used as the online referenced electrode, and the electrode AFz was used as the ground. Electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded via an additional electrode below the right eye to detect blinks and eye movements. The EEG and EOG signals were amplified and digitalized with a Brain Products amplifier (BrainAmp DC, Brain Products) at a sampling rate of 500 Hz with a band-pass filter of 0.01-100 Hz. Electrode impedances were maintained under 5 KΩ throughout during EEG recording.</p><p>EEG data were analyzed with MATLAB 2020b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), EEGLAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004)</ref>, and ERPLAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Lopez-Calderon &amp; Luck, 2014)</ref> toolbox. Trials with wrong responses to racial identity were removed from data analysis. The correct response data were re-referenced offline to the mean activities of the left and right mastoids and were filtered with a band-pass of 0.1-30 Hz (roll-off 6 dB/octave). The filtered data were extracted from -500 to 1200 ms relative to face onset with the activity from -200 to 0 ms serving as the baseline. Artifacts (e.g., spikes, drifts, and nonbiological signals) were rejected automatically. Cleaned data were subjected to an infomax independent components analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004)</ref> and blink components were semi-automatically selected and rejected according to the IClabels algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019)</ref>. To remove additional artifacts, epochs containing a voltage difference of more than 50 μV between sample points, a voltage difference exceeding 100 μV within a trial, or a maximum voltage difference less than 0.5 μV within 100-ms intervals were automatically rejected. Finally, ERPs were averaged separately for White and Asian faces as a function of face expressions (painful vs. neutral). The percentage of accepted trials was above 69.0%. Using an orthogonal selection approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Luck &amp; Gaspelin, 2017)</ref>, measurement parameters were determined by collapsing ERP waveforms and topographic maps over all conditions. Specifically, the P2 component was defined as the mean activity from 150 to 200 ms over frontocentral areas <ref type="bibr">(FC1,</ref><ref type="bibr">FCz,</ref><ref type="bibr">FC2,</ref><ref type="bibr">C1,</ref><ref type="bibr">Cz,</ref><ref type="bibr">and C2)</ref>. The P2 amplitudes were subject to ANOVA with Race (White vs. Asian face) and Expression (painful vs. non-painful) as within-subjects factors and Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 6</head><p>We used fMRI to localize the brain regions in which empathic neural responses to White faces were enhanced by WMTP. The stimuli used during fMRI scanning were video clips of Asian and White models receiving painful or non-painful stimulations on their faces which were adopted from our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Luo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Wu &amp; Han, 2021)</ref>. Each stimulus subtended a visual angle of 21°×17° at a viewing distance of 80 cm. Each trial consisted of a 3-s video clip of a White or Asian model who received a painful stimulation (syringe penetration) to the left or right cheek and then showed a painful expression or received a non-painful stimulation (cotton-bud touch) and showed a neutral expression. There was a 9-s interstimulus interval in which the participants made a judgment on each model's racial identity by pressing a button with the right index or middle finger. There were 4 blocks of 20 trials with 5 trials in each condition (White or Asian models receiving painful and non-painful stimulation) delivered in a random order. The relationships between response fingers and racial identities were counterbalanced across the participants. This procedure was conducted before and after MTPs for each participant. fMRI recording and univariate analysis fMRI data recording and preprocessing were the same as those in Experiment 4. The first-level GLM modeled five regressors, including painful stimulation to White models, painful stimulation to Asian models, non-painful stimulation to White models, non-painful stimulation to Asian models, and incorrect responses to racial identity, for each participant. The GLM also included the movement parameters to account for any residual movement-related effect. Random-effect analyses were conducted based on statistical parameter maps from each participant to allow population inference. Next, whole-brain analyses were conducted to examine: 1) empathic networks by contrasting BOLD responses (combined White and Asian models) in the painful vs. non-painful conditions before WMTP and AMTP (combined WMTP and AMTP groups), 2) racial ingroup bias in empathic brain responses by calculating the difference in BOLD signals in the painful (vs. nonpainful) conditions between perceived Asian and White models before WMTP and AMTP (combined WMTP and AMTP groups), and 3) empathic brain activities in response to White or Asian faces by contrasting BOLD responses in the painful vs. non-painful conditions after WMTP or AMTP. Significant brain activations were reported in the whole-brain analyses using a combined voxel-level threshold of p &lt; 0.001, and cluster-level threshold of p &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected.</p><p>ROI analyses were conducted to examine whether WMTP (vs. AMTP) increased empathic brain activations to White models' pain in two networks that have been associated with different processes involved in empathy.

ROIs (spheres with 6-mm-radius centered at the peak coordinates) in Network 1 (right IFC: 56/28/6; right premotor cortex: 48/6/50, right insula: 40/0/-16) and Network 2 (bilateral TPJ: -64/-40/34 and 62/-28/34 and right superior temporal sulcus: 50/-16/-8) were identified in the wholebrain analysis of BOLD responses in the painful vs. non-painful conditions before MTPs (a voxel level threshold of p (FWE) &lt; 0.0001) and also showed Asian biases in empathic neural responses before MTPs. The contrast values (painful vs. non-painful stimulations) of each network were analyzed separately by conducting an ANOVA with Group (WMTP vs. AMTP) as a between-subjects variable and ROI (the three brain regions in each network) as a within-subjects variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROI-based multivariate pattern analysis</head><p>The multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) considers multivoxel patterns rather than single voxel-based values in different conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Norman et al., 2006)</ref>. To examine whether multivariate patterns of perceived pain in White faces (painful vs. non-painful stimulation) were distinguishable between WMTP and AMTP, we performed an ROI-based MVPA within the network 1 (IFC: 56/28/6, right premotor cortex: 48/6/50, and right insula: 40/0/-16) using the Decoding Toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hebart et al., 2015)</ref>. We first constructed a new first-level GLM with two regressors, including painful and non-painful stimulation to White models, and the movement parameters for each participant in WMTP and AMTP groups, respectively. The resulting beta values within ROIs were z-scored and classified using a standard linear support vector machine (SVM) based on a leave-one-run-out cross-validation approach. Specifically, the beta values from 3 of 4 runs were used to train the SVM classifier to distinguish between painful and non-painful stimulation to White faces and then applied to the test run. Finally, we obtained classification accuracies from the test run in WMTP and AMTP groups separately and examined whether the classification accuracies were higher than the chance level (50%) using a one-sample t-test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic causal modeling analysis</head><p>We also conducted dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses to test whether the mPFC engaged in a representation of shifted White identity might modulate empathic neural responses to White models' pain <ref type="figure">(Fig. S8</ref>). The DCM estimated: 1) intrinsic connectivity between brain regions in the absence of experimental perturbations, 2) modulatory parameters imposed on the intrinsic connectivity induced by experimental perturbations, and 3) input parameters on brain regions by experimental perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Friston et al., 2003)</ref>. To examine directional connectives between the mPFC and right premotor cortex (Model family 1), right IFC (Model family 2), and right insula (Model family 3) when participants were viewing White models' pain, volumes of interest (VOI) were extracted from these brain regions after WMTP. The mPFC VOI was extracted within a 6-mm sphere centered at the peak voxel observed in Experiment 4 whereas the VOIs of empathic neural responses were defined as clusters in the empathy network (painful vs. non-painful stimuli) combined White and Asian models before WMTP and AMTP. Each VOI was adjusted for the session averaged and their time series were incorporated in the DCM models.</p><p>In each model family, White models' pain was defined as the modulatory effect on each intrinsic connectivity ( <ref type="figure">Fig. S8</ref>). Because these brain regions were obtained from the contrast of the painful versus non-painful conditions in response to White faces, White models' pain was also used as visual input for each model. Bayesian model selection procedure was conducted to compare the three model families by computing exceedance probability. The family with an exceedance probability above 90% was defined as the winning family model <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Seghier &amp; Price, 2009</ref>). The winning model (Model family 1) was then used to examine the parameters of intrinsic connectivity between the mPFC and right premotor cortex and the modulatory effects. Similar DCM analyses of the same VOIs were also conducted after AMTP to assess whether personal identity shift might modulate empathic neural responses to White models' pain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 7</head><p>We conducted an altruistic decision-making task to investigate whether WMTP compared to AMTP would reduce racial ingroup (Asian) bias in altruistic decisionmaking. To assess how the participants' altruistic decision-making was sensitive to perceived racial identity, we created morphed faces that varied in both racial identity (from Asian to White) and expression (from neutral to painful) using faces of 10 Asian (5 females) and 10 White (5 females) models adopted from our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Sheng &amp; Han, 2012)</ref>. Each neutral face was first morphed with the corresponding painful face with a step of 10% increment to create a set of nine morphed faces (from 10% to 90% painful pixels). This set of morphed faces was then further morphed with a different set of nine morphed faces created from another face with a different racial identity (e.g., a 30% painful Asian face was morphed with a 30% painful White face to create nine morphed faces from 10% to 90% Asian pixels). This procedure produced 10 (9 × 9) face matrices in which racial identity and expression varied independently. Each matrix of 81 face stimuli was divided into three levels of race dimension (i.e., 10%-30% White; 40%-60% White; 70%-90% White) and three levels of expression dimension (i.e., 10%-30% pain; 40%-60% pain; 70%-90% pain). The race and expression levels were combined into nine alternatives.</p><p>Two morphed faces were randomly selected from two of the nine alternatives for each trial and racial identity and expression of the two faces varied independently from 10% to 90%. The two morphed faces appeared horizontally at the center of the screen for 2000 ms followed by an intertrial interval of 500-1500 ms. The participants were informed that these faces were from patients who were suffering from COVID-19 and they had to choose one of the faces for monetary donation by contributing ¥10 from their participation payments. The participants were informed that one of their donations would be randomly selected and endowed to one of the patients. The participants had to choose the left or right face by pressing the corresponding button with the left or right index finger.This task consisted of two blocks of 72 trials and was repeated twice before and after WMTP or AMTP.</p><p>Participants' choices (coded as 1= choice of the left face; 0 = choice of the right face) were fitted to a generalized linear mixed-effect model with a binomial link function using lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>. Trials without responses (&lt; 25%) were excluded from the following analyses. The fixed-effect regressors included Race (a continuous variable: the difference in the amounts of Asian pixels between the left and right faces in the same trial), Expression (a continuous variable: the difference in the amounts of painful pixels between the left and right faces in the same trial), Time (a category variable: before vs. after MTPs), Group (a category variable: WMTP vs. AMTP), and their interactions. The continuous regressors were z-scored within participants before fitting the mixed-effect models. The category regressors were contrasted coded (Time: -0.5 for before MTP and + 0.5 for after MTP; Group: -0.5 for AMTP and +0.5 for WMTP). Following the maximal principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barr et al., 2013)</ref>, the random effect was incorporated with Race and Expression as the by-subject random effect slopes. The final model was described using Wilkinson notation defined as:</p><p>Altruistic decision~Race * Expression * Time * Mask +(1 + Race + Expression|Participant) Inspection of Q-Q plots for violations of normally distributed residuals and variance inflation factors did not find multicollinearity between regressors.

Participants in Experiment 7 were asked to complete the IAT before and after WMTP or AMTP. They were asked to classify Asian/White faces and positive/negative words by button press as fast and accurately as possible. Face stimuli used in the IAT were adopted from the MR2 face database but excluded the faces used for making facial disguises. On each trial the paired faces and words (i.e., White/positive, White/negative, Asian/positive, and Asian/negative) were displayed on the screen until participants made a response. There were 2 blocks of 60 trials containing 20 trials for practice. We calculated the D score based on the response latencies and accuracies of participants, which indicated implicit attitudes toward other-race members. In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Banakou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Peck et al., 2013)</ref>, our interest focused on the variation of D scores across MTPs (i.e., ΔD score = D score after MTPs minus D score before MTPs). If WMTP (but not AMTP) mitigates negative attitudes toward White individuals, ΔD score would be negative and significantly less than zero after WMTP (but not AMTP).

Trait adjectives were used during scanning and the same number of new trait adjectives were presented in a random order. Each trait adjective was displayed on a screen until participants made a response followed by an 800-1200 ms interstimulus interval. Participants were asked to identify each adjective as a new versus old word and whether they remember (i.e., consciously recollect specific details of the word) or simply know (i.e., a feeling of knowing or familiarity) the words.
