			<abstract>
				<p>Knowing when to trust and incorporate the advice from artificially intelligent (AI) systems is of increasing importance in the modern world. Research indicates that when AI provides confidence ratings, human users often correspondingly increase their trust in such judgments, but these increases in trust can occur even when AI fails to provide accurate information on a given task. In this piece, we argue that measures of metacognitive sensitivity provided by AI systems will likely play a critical role in (1) helping individuals to calibrate their level of trust in these systems, and (2) optimally incorporate advice from AI into human-AI hybrid decisionmaking. We draw upon a seminal finding in the perceptual decision-making literature which demonstrates the importance of metacognitive ratings for optimal joint decisions and outline a framework to test how different types of information provided by AI systems can guide decisionmaking.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Article</head><p>Research on artificial intelligence has entered a new era. The last decade has seen remarkable breakthroughs in large language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kasneci et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Wei et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Zhao et al., 2023)</ref>, healthcare and medical-related AI <ref type="bibr">(Alowais et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Rong et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Sherani et al., 2024)</ref>, automated navigation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aizat et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Onyekpe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Thombre et al., 2022)</ref>, and many other fields. The ability of AI to perform specific tasks which meet or exceed human performance spans a range of domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jones, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Silver et al., 2017)</ref>, but there are plenty where performance is still suboptimal, stressing the possibility that, at least for now, collaboration with humans represents a reasonable strategy to make the best possible decisions, given noise and uncertainty in available information <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cai et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Jain et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Puranam, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>How might optimal decision-making between humans and AI be achieved? In order to effectively utilize the information supplemented by AI, one issue that must be addressed is whether humans properly calibrate their degree of trust in the information coming from systems and agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahn et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Alvarado, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bedué &amp; Fritzsche, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Troshani et al., 2021)</ref>. When the mechanisms and reliabilities of AI's decision-making processes are unknown, it can become difficult for individuals to decide whether or not they should trust the outputs of such systems, especially since many AI systems still err in specific judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agudo et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chanda &amp; Banerjee, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Russell et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, a challenge remains: to optimize human decision-making, it may need to be supplemented (if not ultimately supplanted) by AI as individuals incorporate advice from AI systems, but if humans fail to properly discern when to trust those systems, they are unlikely to make the best possible use of their advice.</p><p>In this piece, we propose that reports of metacognitive sensitivity are a key component for two related issues: (1) calibrating trust in AI systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bacciu et al., 2021)</ref>, and (2) optimally incorporating information in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Rahnev &amp; Denison, 2018)</ref>. As others have noted, to foster successful collaboration, what is needed is the capacity for AI to selectively share relevant states with humans to facilitate coordination and cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Deroy et al., 2024)</ref>. Drawing upon insights from the field of perceptual metacognition, we propose that AI must report performance on not only "Type 1" tasks (e.g., choosing or discriminating between choice alternatives) but also "Type 2" tasks (e.g., reporting metrics of how correct and incorrect judgments are "correctly" endorsed with high and low confidence, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Clarke et al., 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Galvin et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012)</ref> to facilitate trust and optimal decisionmaking. Building on recent proposals in the AI literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fleming, 2023)</ref>, and literature exploring optimal decision-making in multiple human observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bahrami et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Barrera-Lemarchand et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fusaroli et al., 2012)</ref>, we outline a framework that can be exploited to test how to calibrate human trust in AI's decisions, and how to explore whether those decisions are reaching the best possible outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collaboration with AI can be beneficial, but trust issues remain</head><p>Across several domains, hybrid decisions made by humans interacting with AI have proven to be an especially powerful approach to enhance decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Rastogi et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, AI-based support for skin cancer diagnoses has been shown to be superior to AI or human decision-making alone <ref type="bibr">(Tschandl et al., 2020)</ref>, as have diagnoses for radiologists' decisions supplemented by AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Patel et al., 2019)</ref>. In medicine and health care, the possibility of AI aiding in tasks such as improving the accuracy of diagnosis or defining new preventions or treatments has been areas identified by doctors as being especially promising <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Göndöcs &amp; Dörfler, 2024)</ref>. In K-12 education, teacher-AI partnerships have been shown to improve test performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Holstein &amp; Aleven, 2022)</ref>, and AI can be successfully used to aid in deception detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lai &amp; Tan, 2019)</ref>. However, hybrid human-AI performance is not always better than human or AI performance alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Buçinca et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Green &amp; Chen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lai et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lai &amp; Tan, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lundberg et al., 2018)</ref>, and appears to often be most beneficial when AI and human accuracy on a given task is comparable <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bansal et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Incorporating and accepting AI input in decisions is contingent on trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Choung et al., 2022)</ref>. How AI is represented (e.g., robot, virtual, or embedded) and its level of machine intelligence (i.e., capabilities and capacities) are factors which influence humans' trust in such systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Glikson &amp; Woolley, 2020)</ref>. Trust can increase when AI provides explicit information about its reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Vössing et al., 2022)</ref>. However, situations can arise where explanations from AI increase human trust in its advice, but fail to improve accuracy, providing evidence that trust and accuracy can dissociate <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Shekar et al., 2024)</ref>. Preliminary work shows that having AI rate confidence in its judgments and advice can also change human trust in its outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bruzzese et al., 2020)</ref> even if accuracy is unchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Rechkemmer &amp; Yin, 2022)</ref>, but importantly, confidence ratings alone are not necessarily enough to ensure proper usage of AI's advice, showing that trust calibration does not always translate into improvement in AI-assisted decision outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Zhang et al., 2020)</ref>. We argue that what has been missing in most studies to date is for AI to report its metacognitive sensitivity, or the correspondence between its confidence judgments and accuracy on specific tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Maniscalco et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012)</ref>, and that these reports will be key to knowing when to trust AI, and how to efficiently and accurately incorporate its advice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defining Metacognition in Humans and AI</head><p>Before discussing metacognitive sensitivity, it is first important to define what metacognition is. Researchers in cognitive psychology have long been interested in individuals' ability to effectively evaluate or oversee their own cognitive processes, an ability that is known as "metacognition" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gigerenzer, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Henmon, 1911;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Peirce &amp; Jastrow, 1884)</ref>. This oversight has been identified as being critical for implementing effective student learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lumpkin, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Serra &amp; Metcalfe, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Stanton et al., 2021</ref>) (such as evaluating one's state of knowledge to decide what to study), monitoring the accuracy of perceptual decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Fleming et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fleming &amp; Dolan, 2012)</ref>, and understanding social context <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Pescetelli et al., 2016)</ref>. Modern conceptions of metacognition have been shaped by Flavell, who proposed that cognitive monitoring could be broadly distinguished by four classes of phenomena: metacognitive knowledge (knowledge of how variables and factors interact to influence cognitive outcomes), metacognitive experiences (conscious reflections about cognitive processes), metacognitive goals (objectives of a cognitive enterprise), and metacognitive actions (strategies employed to achieve cognitive goals) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Flavell, 1979)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, Fleming (2024) specifically defined metacognition as the set of processes that enable us to develop beliefs about various mental functions and operations. According to this account, judgments that are "metacognitive" in nature have ways of taking into account uncertainty. Uncertainty could take the form of noisy estimates of sensory properties in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ernst &amp; Banks, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Körding et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Rohde et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Shams &amp; Beierholm, 2022)</ref>, assessments of how well material has been learned <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Metcalfe &amp; Finn, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Rhodes, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Rhodes &amp; Tauber, 2011)</ref>, precision in controlling motor actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(van Beers et al., 2002)</ref>, and many other perceptual and cognitive domains. The key idea is that the representation of certainty is coded with respect to a self-centered frame of reference; uncertainty is transformed into some type of propositional assessment (such as a confidence judgment), and this judgment is globally broadcast in the system for widespread availability in guiding behaviors and updating current self-knowledge. To provide a more concrete example, according to this account, any estimate of a sensory property or attribute in the environment is encoded with some degree of noise, and we form beliefs about how likely it is that certain features of the world are present. Those beliefs can be converted into propositional confidence in our estimates (which are also subject to noise).</p><p>This description provides one way to link confidence judgments and real-world metacognition; humans have an ability to assess whether self-evaluative judgments match up with the reality of cognitive or physical performance, which is central to adaptive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Fleming, 2024)</ref>. Similarly, AI also has the capacity to reflect on the degree to which its selfevaluative judgments line up with reality in the long run. Thus, drawing upon insights from human perceptual decision making, an opportunity arises to explore how metacognitive sensitivity can be exploited to calibrate human trust with artificial systems. In the following sections, we define metacognitive sensitivity and explain its importance for human-AI interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measuring and quantifying metacognitive sensitivity</head><p>Metacognition can be measured via different types of reports about the fidelity of cognitive processes. Historically, confidence judgments have provided one useful form of report about introspection <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Henmon, 1911;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Nelson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Peirce &amp; Jastrow, 1884;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Schraw, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Schwarz, 2015)</ref>. Confidence reports lead to two different metacognitive quantities: metacognitive bias, and metacognitive sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014)</ref>. While metacognitive bias is reflected in long-run averages of over-or under-confidence in judgments of task performance, metacognitive sensitivity is reflected in the confidence-accuracy correlation, or more specifically, how effectively confidence judgments distinguish between correct and incorrect answers <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mazancieux et al., 2020)</ref>. High metacognitive sensitivity reflects a strong correlation (responding with high confidence when correct, and low confidence when incorrect), and low metacognitive sensitivity reflects more irregular or haphazard confidence ratings on a trial-by-trial basis.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, we outline the types of reports that AI can provide as it makes decisions. Essentially, there are four things AI could potentially report: (1) its decision about a given perceptual (or cognitive) process, or (relatedly) its long-run accuracy in a specific task; (2) a subjective estimate about a specific decision (such as how confident it is in a particular judgment); (3) a report about its long-run metacognitive sensitivity for making these types of judgments (i.e., the correspondence between confidence ratings and accuracy for a specific task or type of decision); (4) more complex and intricate introspection regarding the different stages of its decision-making process, to explicate on why it made specific "Type 1" and "Type 2" decisions ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. This framework could be tested empirically to determine how different types of information from AI systems influence (1) the calibration of trust for these systems, and (2) incorporation of information from AI into joint human-AI decisions. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Possible types of reports from AI about its decisions. Panels from left-right: (A) Type 1 reports about behaviors. One possibility is that AI may only report the outcome of a specific decision it has chosen to make, or how frequently it is correct for a particular type of decision. In the example shown here, the AI agent determines which stimulus contains an oriented Gabor and reports its overall accuracy across trials on this task. (B) Subjective (e.g., confidence) reports. Potentially, AI could report how confident it is in a specific decision, or some other "Type 2" subjective rating. Depending on the algorithm used, this report could be based on something akin to distance from a decision or classification boundary using Signal Detection Theory, Support Vector Machines, or some other algorithm. (C) Reports of metacognitive sensitivity (schematic from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014)</ref>. AI systems may also be able to summarize their metacognitive sensitivity, or how effectively their confidence judgments distinguish between correct and incorrect judgments over long-run averages. In this sense, observers could gain insights into the degree to which they could use/trust the metacognitive or subjective ratings offered by a system on a given trial. (D) Finally, AI models could also try to introspect on their decision-making process to identify why or how they reached specific Type 1 or Type 2 decisions. Critically, these insights could be about the mechanisms or functions that led to specific Type 1 or Type 2 decisions. Interestingly, these types of introspections can sometimes lead to increased trust, but not accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Zhang et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Quantifying task performance and metacognitive sensitivity has been facilitated using tools from Signal Detection Theory. In Type 1 SDT, the measure d' quantifies the subject's ability to discriminate between signal and noise, with higher d' values indicating better performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005)</ref>. Response bias for selecting one option over another (in two-choice tasks) is captured by the perceptual criterion, c, which indicates the level of sensory evidence needed to make a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref>. In contrast, Type 2 SDT focuses on metacognitive processes, evaluating how well participants can distinguish between their own correct and incorrect responses. Metacognitive sensitivity, measured by meta-d', estimates how effectively confidence judgments distinguish between correct and incorrect responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012</ref>. Participants who are more confident in correct responses and less confident in incorrect ones will have higher meta-d' scores. Since this measure of metacognitive sensitivity scales with task performance, an additional measure, metacognitive efficiency (given by the M-ratio (meta-d'/d')), adjusts meta-d' for task performance level, recognizing that participants with higher d' have a higher potential for meta-d' <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Rahnev, 2023)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Rahnev, 2023)</ref>. In this sense, measures of metacognitive sensitivity and metacognitive efficiency may both prove important for facilitating human trust in AI; quantifying metacognitive sensitivity gives information about the correspondence between metacognitive ratings and task accuracy, but quantifying metacognitive efficiency incorporates considerations of task performance, and since this value can be directly compared against an optimal value of 1, it may be more easily interpreted by users when evaluating whether to trust AI's judgments and recommendations.</p><p>Literature on perceptual decision-making provides examples of paradigms that can be used to assess metacognitive sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014)</ref>. Many tasks where researchers measure meta-d' follow a specific format: on each trial, observers make a perceptual judgment (such as the presence or tilt of a Gabor) and rate their confidence in that judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Maniscalco et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Maniscalco et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2015)</ref>. Since animals cannot explicitly provide confidence ratings, adding the option of choosing "bets" of different values can be substituted for confidence ratings in perceptual and memory paradigms, facilitating measurement of meta-d' in monkeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cai et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Miyamoto et al., 2018)</ref>. Further, waiting times for rewards in rats can also be taken as a proxy for confidence ratings, allowing estimates of meta-d' in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Stolyarova et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, across a range of tasks and paradigms, different systems and organisms capable of metacognition can have their metacognitive sensitivity quantified.</p><p>One challenge that will need to be addressed moving forward involves extending measures of metacognitive sensitivity to more complex and naturalistic tasks. In the scientific literature, the current precedent for measuring metacognitive sensitivity (with measures such as meta-d') comes from well-controlled designs in which Type 1 and Type 2 decisions are clear and straightforward. In more naturalistic environments (such as drone navigation, where automation and user control might trade-off at different time points), multidimensional decisions such as which routes to select, the elevation height of travel, the speed at which to proceed, and other factors might make it more difficult to quantify metacognitive sensitivity (and efficiency). Thus, more complex models of metacognitive processes <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>, Option 4) may be necessary to more fully assess metacognition in AI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metacognition (and metacognitive sensitivity) is key for optimal joint decision making</head><p>Most previous tasks to assess metacognitive sensitivity have evaluated this trait in single observers. However, previous work on optimal decisions in multiple (two) observers provides insights into how metacognitive ratings can aid joint decision-making. In seminal work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bahrami et al. (2010)</ref>, the authors noted that within a single mind, there are rules which govern how multiple senses are optimally combined into a coherent percept: when discrepant estimates of a quantity must be reconciled, observers weight each sense's estimate (e.g., visual and auditory estimates about spatial position) by their reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alais &amp; Burr, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ernst &amp; Banks, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ernst &amp; Bülthoff, 2004)</ref>. Similarly, when multiple (two) observers must make decisions about ambiguous sensory information, Bahrami et al. found something interesting: for two observers with similar perceptual sensitivities, the optimal rule was to combine their two estimates in a manner similar to the optimal rules previously found in studies of multisensory integration, but when one observer was substantially better than another, combining estimates comes with a cost, rather than a benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ernst, 2010)</ref>. In their perceptual task, on each trial, two participants each observed two intervals with Gabor patches, and had to judge whether the first or second stimulus contained the "oddball" Gabor with higher contrast. Across four experiments, the authors manipulated noise levels in the stimuli, whether or not communication was allowed, and whether feedback was provided.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bahrami et al. (2010)</ref>. On each trial, two human observers viewed two displays, and had to judge which contained a Gabor with increased contrast. In the first experiment, individual decisions were shown on the screen, and if the observers disagreed, they were allowed to communicate to reach a joint decision. Feedback was shown for each observer's judgment (blue, yellow) and the joint decision (white) (B). Four models were fitted to the data from experiment 1 (blue squares; each blue square is one pair), and the collective benefit (sdyad / smax) was plotted on the x-axis. Results showed that a model that assumed confidence accurately reflected the probability of being correct (Weight Confidence Sharing model, WCS) and a model that assumed that mean and standard deviations of sensory responses are shared (Direct Signal Sharing model, DSS) fit the data equally well. (C) In a second experiment, extra noise was added to the Gabor patches of either one, both, or neither participant's displays. Results showed that a model that incorporated confidence judgments (WCS) provided the best account of the data.</p><p>How would one observer know whether to incorporate another mind's estimate, or keep it separate? The authors found that communication about confidence in the estimate was key. The authors compared four possible models about what could be communicated: a coin flip (CF) model (essentially resolving disagreements by flipping a coin), a behavior and feedback (BF) model (where participants cannot communicate anything besides their choice during the trial), a weighted confidence sharing (WCS) model (where participants communicate their confidence in their judgment), and a Direct Signal Sharing model (where the mean and standard deviation of the sensory responses are shared). Results showed that the weighted confidence model best fit the data from the task and demonstrated the benefits of multiple minds sharing confidence judgments in joint decision-making.</p><p>What are the insights that can be gleaned from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bahrami et al. (2010)</ref>, and how does this relate to trust and optimal decision making in AI? Several key ideas emerged: first, it was only optimal for one observer to incorporate advice from another when performance was at similar levels, something that has been shown previously in the AI literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bansal et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, we posit that for humans to trust AI, it needs to report not only Type 1 judgments about what it chooses, but also: (1) how confident it is in that judgment, and (2) how often it is correct in a given task it performs <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Pescetelli et al., 2016)</ref>. Second, trial-by-trial confidence judgments proved key for the collective benefit in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Wahn et al., 2018)</ref>, but feedback did not impact decision-making. Thus, this finding supports the idea that when a second observer provides a Type 2 report of confidence, it can help observers make an optimal decision. However, we argue that for confidence decisions to be meaningful, they must differentiate (at least to some degree) between correct and incorrect judgments. Without a reasonable degree of metacognitive sensitivity, the confidence judgments would be of little help. As the observers in Bahrami et al. presumably possessed adequate metacognitive sensitivity, a benefit in communication was found; therefore, even though reports of metacognitive sensitivity were not included, it still played a role in the metacognitive benefit that was observed.</p><p>Critically, we note that even if confidence judgments (with proper metacognitive sensitivity) might help humans calibrate when to trust AI systems, it is not a guarantee that they will optimally incorporate that information <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bahrami et al., 2012)</ref>. The rules governing optimal decision-making will vary depending on the types of tasks that are involved. Further, as noted in previous studies of joint decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Wahn et al., 2018)</ref>, how task demands are distributed, how the information is exchanged and integrated, and whether feedback is provided are all factors that can influence outcomes. Despite these factors playing a role, having a meaningful degree of metacognitive sensitivity is key for collective benefits in joint decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Mahmoodi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Pescetelli et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can humans use measures of metacognitive sensitivity to enhance joint decisions with AI?</head><p>One issue that inevitably arises is the following: if AI reports its metacognitive sensitivity, how should it report this metric, so that humans understand what the measure means, and can use it effectively? Moving forward, researchers will need to explore how observers utilize both quantitative and qualitative information about metacognitive sensitivity in joint human-AI decision-making. A range of measures for metacognitive sensitivity exist, with pros and cons for different methods of quantifying the correspondence between confidence and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Rahnev, 2023)</ref>. Moving forward, it will be critical to explicitly test whether metacognitive sensitivity provides benefits over and above reporting percent correct on a task, and how measures of metacognitive sensitivity should be presented. For example, telling a human observer that AI has a meta-d' value of "3.2" doesn't provide an immediate heuristic for most observers to know whether or not to trust its judgment on a given trial. In order to know how to incorporate quantitative measures of metacognitive sensitivity effectively, some experience with the AI system on a specific task will likely be required. Further, testing whether combined reports of metacognitive bias and metacognitive sensitivity provide additional benefits is worth testing in experiments.</p><p>It is also an open question of whether metacognitive sensitivity should be reported by the system that performs the task itself, or an additional program or system that can monitor longrun performance of a given system or agent. Since AI systems can show biases in their confidence judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Rechkemmer &amp; Yin, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Silva et al., 2023)</ref>, it is an open question whether one could also trust metacognitive sensitivity reports in such systems, or whether a more reliable protocol would be to outsource such monitoring to an external source.</p><p>Further, combining quantitative and qualitative metacognitive reports may be most effective in optimally combining information in real-world tasks. For example, AI may be particularly effective at optimizing routes of drones for real-world navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Hodge et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Joshi et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Pokhrel, 2018)</ref>, but in order to understand why AI is making a specific decision about its speed, route, altitude, or other factors during a task, a combination of quantitative and qualitative descriptions of how different factors were weighted in the decisionmaking process may be necessary for a human to trust a given decision for whether to override, supplement, or approve a given navigation plan. In this sense, we argue that joint decision making between AI and humans may need large language models for real-world tasks, as the need to make real-world decisions extends beyond the simplified paradigms used for perceptual metacognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metacognitive Sensitivity and LLMs</head><p>Work has already begun to explore metacognitive capacities in LLMs. Preliminary research indicates that LLMs tend to exhibit overconfidence in some reasoning tests, in a manner similar to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Singh et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Xiong et al., 2023</ref>). Yet, in easy tasks (such as identifying the "best" answer), LLMs show metacognitive sensitivity comparable to humans, with less tendency towards overconfidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Zhou et al., 2024)</ref>. In more complex tasks, their sensitivity can surpass human performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Pavlovic et al., 2024)</ref>. Metacognitive sensitivity may depend on the type of judgment that is made: while LLMs and humans are similar in prospective confidence judgments, LLMs show lower metacognitive accuracy in retrospective judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cash et al., 2024)</ref>. This difference is attributed to LLMs' reliance on training data for confidence ratings, which are not adjusted based on task experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cash et al., 2024)</ref>. This lack of calibration contributes to "hallucinations" or "confabulations," often seen in LLMs exhibiting metacognitive myopia <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Scholten et al., 2024)</ref>. To help calibrate human trust in AI systems, recent studies have proposed various strategies for aligning AI confidence and response accuracy through metacognitive learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Scholten et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tao et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Yang et al., 2024)</ref>. Once model confidence and accuracy were made consistent, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Steyvers et al. (2024)</ref> found that further metacognitive alignment between the model and user may be facilitated via the LLM reporting its internal model confidence. Therefore, it appears that building in training to assist AI systems in aligning their confidence and accuracy may be key to providing benefits in human-AI collaboration. LLMs provide a tool to explain their decisionmaking processes to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Zytek et al., 2024</ref>), but we posit that as LLMs are increasingly incorporated into joint decisions, it will be critical not only for them to explain their decisionmaking process <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, Option 4)</ref>, but incorporate assessments of metacognitive sensitivity <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, Option 3)</ref> as the functions underlying decision-making are explicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Zytek et al., 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Research provides evidence of possible benefits when observers interact with one another before making joint decisions. This benefit has been observed not only in joint human decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bahrami et al., 2010)</ref>, but in human-AI interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Göndöcs &amp; Dörfler, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Holstein &amp; Aleven, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lai &amp; Tan, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Patel et al., 2019)</ref>. Preliminary evidence exists that metacognition can be a critical component in the benefits of these interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bahrami et al., 2010)</ref>, but since evidence shows that metacognitive ratings can lead humans astray when incorporating advice from AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Zhang et al., 2020)</ref>, how will we know when to trust and incorporate its advice? In this piece, we have argued that a critical component is likely to be found in reports from AI about its metacognitive sensitivity. When AI is able to faithfully report on the correspondence between its confidence and accuracy, this information can be utilized by humans to evaluate whether to incorporate its estimates and advice into joint human-AI decisions. Challenges remain in training humans to make use of quantifications of this ability, as well as extending existing measures of metacognitive sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012</ref> to more complex and naturalistic tasks. But as the world increasingly relies on the use of AI to make decisions in health care, finance, and education, we think research to explore the importance of reporting both Type 1 and Type 2 sensitivity will be critical, as we look to make the best possible use of information from AI.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>(A) Task paradigm from</figDesc></figure>
