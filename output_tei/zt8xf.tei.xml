				<p>Background: Anxiety disorders often emerge in adolescence and are associated with risk aversion. Risk aversion is at odds with the typical adolescent propensity for heightened sensation-seeking and can interfere with learning and contribute to further anxiety development. Methods: We investigated the neural and behavioral correlates of risk avoidance in 137 diverse early adolescents (MAge=11.3, SDAge=1.41; 61 girls) during a decision-making task involving risk-taking and cognitive control during fMRI. Voluntary cautious choice was compared to successful response inhibition to isolate the neural systems underlying risk avoidance and identify their relation to risk-taking and anxiety in adolescents. Results: Risk-taking frequency was not related to anxiety severity; however, higher anxious youth spent relatively longer making voluntary cautious choices than inhibiting when instructed. All youth showed widespread neural activation in decision-making and salience network regions when making cautious choices. Greater recruitment of the left inferior frontal gyrus during cautious choice was associated with greater risk-taking in high anxious youth and greater risk avoidance in low anxious youth, while greater striatal connectivity during cautious choice was associated with heightened risk-taking in those with low anxiety and risk avoidance in those with high anxiety. Conclusions: Relative to non-anxious adolescents, anxious adolescents take longer to make decisions in the face of approach-avoidance conflict and demonstrate unique brain-behavior associations during decision-making. Together, results from this study identify a unique role of fronto-striatal circuitry in risky decision-making among adolescents who struggle with anxiety.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Anxiety disorders commonly emerge during adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> and demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in presentation and symptom course <ref type="bibr">(3 8)</ref>. A cardinal symptom of anxiety is behavioral avoidance which contributes to much of the interference of these disorders.</p><p>Avoidance conflicts with the normative adolescent propensity for heightened approach behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(9)</ref> and is linked to risk aversion in anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(10)</ref>. Nonetheless, relations between risk aversion, risky decision-making, and the behavioral decision to avoid are poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(11)</ref>. This gap is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying one of the most defining features of anxiety disorders for both youth and adults. Here, we examined the neural correlates of inhibitory behaviors in 137 adolescents to elucidate the mechanisms driving avoidance and their implications for adolescent-onset anxiety.</p><p>Avoidance can be adaptive in situations with clear threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(12)</ref>, such as braking at a red light to avoid a crash (e.g., response inhibition). Conversely, avoidance can prove maladaptive in situations with uncertain outcomes, such as choosing to stop or go at a yellow light (e.g., risky decision-making). Risk-taking, or the ability to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, is important for learning and exploration in adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(13)</ref>. However, the uncertainty of risk can spur approach-avoidance conflict where the ability to engage in goal-directed behavior becomes difficult for anxious youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(14)</ref>, contributing to impaired functioning <ref type="bibr">(15 18)</ref> and risk aversion in anxious adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(19)</ref>. Interestingly, it is precisely the uncertainty of risk that appeals to typical adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(20)</ref>, which may explain why studies have found both decreased <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22)</ref> and increased <ref type="bibr">(23 25)</ref> risk-taking among anxious youth.</p><p>Approach-avoidance conflict has been explained neurobiologically by the Triadic model in which approach (ventral striatum; VS), avoidance (amygdala), and regulatory <ref type="bibr">(prefrontal)</ref> neural systems interact and compete to influence response to positive and aversive cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(26)</ref>.</p><p>When appetitive and aversive stimuli are pitted against each other in adolescence, this model posits that regulatory systems will bias behavior towards approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(26)</ref>. While the striatum functions to promote approach behavior in neurotypical adolescents, anxious youth may exhibit a different phenotype. Increased striatal response and reduced fronto-striatal connectivity during peer feedback has been linked to impaired recall of positive feedback in adolescents with social anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(27)</ref>, suggesting that fronto-striatal mechanisms may bias learning in anxiety. This bias may then contribute to avoidance, as research has identified a fronto-striatal circuit that controls anxious avoidance behaviors in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(28)</ref> and striatal response during avoidance correlates with anxiety in adult humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(29)</ref>. Despite work implicating the VS <ref type="bibr">(30 33)</ref>, amygdala <ref type="bibr">(34 36)</ref>, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) <ref type="bibr">(36 38)</ref> in risk for anxiety, the role of anxiety on neural functioning during approach-avoidance conflict in adolescents is still poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">39)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we measured anxiety, risk-taking, and response inhibition in 137 adolescents <ref type="bibr">(9-</ref>13y/o) as they played the Driving Game, a decision-making task, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were instructed to lights, and choose whether to stop or go at yellow lights, thereby measuring response inhibition (stopping a prepotent response when the light turns red) and risky decision-making in the same design. Participants ranged across a spectrum of normative anxiety levels with over-sampling from those at the cusp of clinical diagnosis who are most at risk for developing anxiety in adolescence. Given work linking anxiety to risk avoidance <ref type="bibr">(19,40 42)</ref>, we hypothesized that anxiety would correlate negatively with risk-taking. Given work reporting no differences in response inhibition ability in anxiety (43), we predicted anxiety would not affect false alarm rate.</p><p>As anxiety can sharpen inhibitory ability (12,44), we hypothesized that higher anxious youth would demonstrate faster response time (RT) during response inhibition. As approach-avoidance conflict can interfere with decision-making in anxiety <ref type="formula">14</ref>, we predicted that faster RT during response inhibition would be paralleled by longer RT during cautious choice. Given the role of approach-avoidance conflict and the VS in risk-taking and anxiety, we predicted that greater activity in areas linked to approach-avoidance conflict (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus; IFG) (45) and fronto-striatal connectivity during risk avoidance would explain the behavioral differences between high and low anxious youth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and Materials</head><p>Participants 171 youth were recruited from the Los Angeles area to complete a clinical interview and an fMRI scan. Participants were recruited to capture the full spectrum of anxiety symptom severity as measured by the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(46)</ref>. They were eligible if they were ages 9-13, right-handed, free of metal, had no medical or psychiatric conditions contraindicating study participation (e.g., suicidality, head trauma), did not currently use psychotropic medication, and were not claustrophobic. Informed consent and assent were obtained from all legal guardians and study participants in accordance with the Institutional Review Board. Youth were compensated $100 and could win an additional $10 during the fMRI tasks. Participants completed the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule-IV (ADIS-IV) (47) with a clinician trained to criterion.</p><p>Of the 171 enrolled youth, 25 did not complete the scan: 13 visits were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 12 youth were uncomfortable with the MR environment. Data from 7 participants were unusable due to too few trials, and data from 2 participants were unusable due to technical errors during data collection. Data were excluded if the participant exceeded 1 mm mean relative motion during the task <ref type="bibr">(</ref>   ) for yellow lights. A jittered inter-trial (ITI) stimulus followed each event. All trials began with 2-4 green lights and ended with either a red or yellow light (50/50 chance). A false alarm at a red light was followed by a crash. A risky choice at a yellow light was followed by either a reward (50% chance), getting to the finish line faster and earning more money, or a crash (50% chance), adding a 6 s delay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>fMRI acquisition</head><p>A 20-channel head coil was used for scanning on a 3-Tesla Siemens Trio MRI machine.</p><p>Participants completed a mock scan to acclimate them to the scanner and were screened with a metal detector before entering the scanner. The task was presented on E-Prime, which collects responses and RTs. A Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Gradient-Echo (MPRAGE) scan (TR=1900ms, TE=2.26ms, FOV=250 mm, slices, slice thickness 1 mm, in-plane voxel size 1.0x1.0 mm, interleaved) was used for registration. For B0 distortion correction, participants received 2 T2*-weighted gradient-echo field map scans with opposite phase encoding directions (AP, PA; TR=8000 ms, TE=66 ms, FOV=208 mm, 72 slices, slice thickness 2 mm, in-plane voxel size 2x2 mm, interleaved). Two runs of the T2*-weighted task fMRI sequence (TR=800 ms, TE=37 ms, FOV=208 mm, 72 slices, slice thickness 2 mm, in-plane voxel size 2x2 mm, interleaved) were acquired while participants played the task. A single-band reference (SBRef) image was acquired immediately before each run. Rad/s and magnitude images were used for B0 unwarping in FEAT. Each participa data was registered to their SBRef, then to the MPRAGE, and finally to Montreal Neurological nonlinear registration method FNIRT. One run for one participant exceeded 1 mm mean relative motion as determined using FSL motion parameters and was excluded. FSLMotionOutliers (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLMotionOutliers) detected timepoints corrupted by a high degree of motion using the box-plot cutoff = P75+1.5*IQR. The resulting confound matrices were entered as regressors of no interest in the general linear model (GLM), removing the effects of these timepoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral analysis</head><p>A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) in SPSS was used to compare average task behavior with anxiety, sex, and age as covariates. RTs for each condition were compared using paired samples t-tests. Cautious RT and Inhibition RT were compared to anxiety to assess the impact of anxiety on RT across inhibitory contexts.</p><p>Before use in neuroimaging analyses, participant responses at all lights were entered into a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) in SPSS to reduce dimensionality and determine overall behavioral metrics for each participant. Responses were correlated, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Statistical maps were projected onto a standard MNI brain; group activation maps were visualized using MRIcron software (http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Striatal connectivity</head><p>Beta series correlation analyses (53) were conducted in FSL to examine differences in VS functional connectivity across task conditions. For each run, one GLM was defined for Cautious trials and another for Inhibition trials. Trials of interest were separated into their own regressor (resulting in n regressors for n trials). Trials of no interest were represented by one regressor per trial type to preserve the original task design. Parameter estimates for each trial were combined within conditions, registered to standard space, and extracted from a bilateral VS seed (Harvard-Oxford subcortical probabilistic atlas, 50% probability). The resulting timeseries was correlated with every other voxel in the brain and Fisher transformed using 3dTcorrelate in AFNI (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dTcorrelate.html). Z-transformed correlation maps for Inhibition were subtracted from Z-transformed correlation maps for Cautious and combined across participants for group analysis. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral results</head><p>Anxiety SCARED scores ranged from 0-52 (MAnx=19.27, SDAnx=11.48; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>), with higher scores indicating greater anxiety severity. In community samples, a score 25 has been found to indicate the presence of an anxiety disorder, suggesting that 26.3% of participants showed signs of an anxiety disorder when using self-report to describe their symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">55)</ref>. An independent samples t-test revealed a significant sex difference in anxiety (t(135)=2.07, p=.04) with girls reporting a mean score of approximately 4 points higher than boys. Anxiety was not associated with age (r(137)=.13, p=.15).    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 4</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>).   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S1</ref>).</p><p>We found a significant interaction between risk-taking and anxiety on left IFG pars opercularis activation: greater IFG recruitment during Cautious&gt;Inhibition was associated with increased risk-taking in higher anxious youth and decreased risk-taking in lower anxious youth ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>), as revealed with a whole-brain analysis for the Cautious&gt;Inhibition contrast. A) The interaction between anxiety and risk-taking frequency on wholebrain activation for the Cautious&gt;Inhibition contrast revealed a cluster encompassing the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis and extending into the anterior insula that showed opposing associations with risk-taking frequency in youth with high vs. low anxiety. B) Visual depiction of the interaction between anxiety and risk taking on left IFG activity in a peak voxel. More IFG recruitment is associated with greater cautious behavior in low anxious youth and more risky choices in higher anxious youth. Note: for visualization purposes only. Cluster-corrected at Z&gt;3.1, p&lt;.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Striatal connectivity</head><p>Beta series correlation analysis of the Cautious&gt;Inhibition contrast revealed main effects of risk-taking and response inhibition, as well as a significant interaction between anxiety and risk-taking, on VS functional connectivity. More cautious behavior was associated with greater connectivity between the VS and the right IFG pars triangularis, suggesting that regulation of the VS by the IFG promoted risk avoidance in this sample ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 6</ref>). Worse inhibition ability was associated with greater connectivity between the VS and a cluster in the left parietal lobe encompassing the LOC, superior parietal lobule, and supramarginal and angular gyri during Cautious&gt;Inhibition, extending the activation results and highlighting the role of the LOC in instructed inhibition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S2</ref>). There were no significant main effects of anxiety on striatal functional connectivity.</p><p>However, there was a significant interaction between anxiety and risk-taking on striatal connectivity during Cautious&gt;Inhibition: VS connectivity with a range of regions including the amygdala, putamen, OFC, hypothalamus, thalamus, medial PFC (mPFC), and insula was positively associated with risk-taking in low anxious youth and negatively associated with risktaking in high anxious youth, suggesting that the VS may contribute differently to adolescent behavior depending on youth anxiety <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Figure 7</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We examined the neural mechanisms underlying inhibitory behaviors across risk and cognitive control contexts in adolescents across the anxiety continuum. As expected, anxiety was unrelated to response inhibition rate, but anxious youth were faster at inhibiting when instructed than when voluntarily avoiding risk. While anxiety was not linked to risk-taking frequency, the neural mechanisms driving risk-taking differed by anxiety such that greater left IFG recruitment was associated with greater risk-taking in high anxiety, while heightened striatal connectivity was associated with greater risk-taking in low anxiety. We also identified a circuit between the VS and the right IFG that promoted risk avoidance regardless of anxiety levels. Together, results point to a unique role of fronto-striatal circuitry in risk-taking in anxious adolescents.</p><p>Anxiety was neither related to risk-taking frequency nor response inhibition ability in this sample. Nonetheless, youth with more anxiety spent relatively longer making cautious choices than inhibiting when instructed, while youth with less anxiety showed the opposite pattern. This provides initial support for the idea that avoidance can be adaptive when negative outcomes are certain: higher anxious youth responded quickly when instructed. However, decisions involving uncertainty like risk-taking can spur approach-avoidance conflict and impair decisionmaking, which could explain the longer RT during cautious choice. There was also a nonlinear trend in which youth with the highest anxiety struggled with response inhibition (longer RT during instructed versus voluntary inhibition), suggesting that anxiety may interfere with response inhibition once it becomes severe. The VS translates evaluative signals from the amygdala (62) into value-based action (e.g., approach or avoid) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(63)</ref>. Here, greater VS-amygdala connectivity was associated with greater risk-taking in low anxious youth and greater risk avoidance in higher anxious youth, suggesting that amygdala signaling to the VS may be interpreted differently in adolescents with taking in low anxious adolescents but is perceived as threatening in higher anxiety. While VS response has been associated with increased risk-taking <ref type="bibr">(64 66)</ref>, it also plays a role in risk avoidance. In rodents, the striatum is necessary for scaling fear to degree of threat (67) and</p><p>amygdala-striatal and fronto-striatal circuits control avoidant behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">68)</ref>. In human adults, degree of VS responding during avoidance is dependent on anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(29)</ref>. The considerable development of amygdala-VS and fronto-striatal connections in adolescence may help explain both the emergence of anxiety and the refinement of motivated behavior.</p><p>These findings should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, these analyses are cross-sectional and lacked experimental manipulation, limiting the ability to make causal inferences about the effects of anxiety on risk-taking or neural functioning. Second, participants did not provide information regarding why they made their decisions. Finally, while we did uncover effects of task on brain functional connectivity, we did not measure effective connectivity and therefore cannot speak to the direction or causality of these effects.</p><p>Nonetheless, this study sheds light on the neural mechanisms driving avoidance in early adolescents at risk for developing anxiety. Although we did not find brain or behavioral differences based on anxiety, the findings suggest that anxious youth show altered associations between fronto-striatal functioning and risk-taking, highlighting the importance of a focus on these circuits in the study of adolescent-onset anxiety. Future longitudinal work will elucidate how these brain-behavior associations impact the development of anxiety in adolescence and adulthood.</p></div>

Events were modeled with a canonical double-gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF) for a variable duration dependent on participant behavior. Rest periods and ITIs were not explicitly modeled and therefore served as the implicit baseline of interest. Temporal derivatives for all regressors, standard and extended motion parameters (6 standard motion parameters, their temporal derivatives, and squares of the above), and motion outliers were included as covariates of no interest. Individual-level models were defined with contrasts: Inhibition vs. Baseline, Cautious vs. Baseline, and Cautious vs. Inhibition, chosen with the aim of identifying the neural correlates of inhibitory behaviors across conditions. First-level analyses were conducted using fixed-effects modeling with FLAME-1. Both runs were combined using a fixed effect voxel-wise second-level model in FEAT. Group-level activation analyses were performed using FMRIB Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (51). Anxiety, risk-taking, response inhibition, and the interaction between anxiety and risk-taking were included in the design matrix as covariates of interest.

Anxiety and behavior Anxiety was neither associated with response inhibition ability (r(137)=.08, p=.33) nor risk-taking frequency (r(137)=-.09, p=.29). However, anxious youth took longer on Cautious choice (voluntary choice to inhibit; r(137)=.24, p=.005) and were faster at Inhibition (successfully inhibiting when instructed; r(137)=-.20, p=.017; Figure 3). These associations remained when controlling for age and sex (rCautious(110)=.22, p=.012, rInhibition(110)=-.18,p=.043), suggesting that while anxiety can improve inhibitory control, it may impede decisionmaking when faced with approach-avoidance conflict.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Participants showed widespread activation in salience network and decision-making regions such as the dACC, PCC, precuneus, angular gyrus, and anterior insula during Cautious&gt;Inhibition, while activity in regions such as the left IFG pars triangularis and LOC was greater for Inhibition&gt;Cautious. IFG pars triangularis is thought to mediate response inhibition through bottom-up and top-down reprogramming of action plans (56), while occipital activity may demonstrate visual attention to switching task demands. Activation was modulated by response inhibition, with greater activation of the occipital pole, intracalcarine cortex, and SMA to Cautious&gt;Inhibition linked to better inhibitory ability, and greater LOC activation associated with worse inhibitory ability. This aligns with work implicating IFG and SMA in response inhibition (57) and work correlating LOC activation with RT to a planned stimulus (58). Crucially, the regions modulated by risk-taking were dependent on anxiety. Regulatory systems in the left IFG pars opercularis played opposing roles in risk-taking depending on anxiety: more IFG engagement was associated with more risk avoidance in low anxious youth, but more risk-taking in high anxious youth. Previous work has identified dysregulation of the left IFG in clinical anxiety associated with weaker connectivity between the IFG and the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) where the IFG evaluates stimulus meaning and informs the vmPFC in inhibiting the amygdala (59). It is possible that increased IFG recruitment in higher anxious youth was compensatory and served to inhibit the amygdala, promoting risk-taking. Alternatively, perhaps bottom-up mechanisms drive risk-taking in neurotypical adolescents, while top-down processes guide risk-taking in anxious youth. Risk-taking and risk avoidance have both been linked to functioning of the VS, which is also implicated in anxiety. Here, striatal functional connectivity with the right IFG was associated with more cautious behavior in youth, regardless of anxiety severity. This is consistent with previous research implicating the right IFG in inhibition (56): stimulation of the right IFG diminishes impulsive behavior (60) and IFG connectivity has been associated with adolescent self-control (61). The IFG is also implicated in approach-avoidance conflict (45), further highlighting its relevance for studies of decision-making and anxiety. Consistent with the activation results, connectivity between the VS and the LOC was associated with poorer response inhibition ability, suggesting that occipital regions exert influence on inhibitory control through connections with the rest of the brain.More VS connectivity with a range of brain regions including the amygdala, putamen, OFC, hypothalamus, thalamus, mPFC, and insula was associated with greater risk-taking in lower anxious youth and risk avoidance in higher anxious youth. In lieu of behavioral differences based on anxiety, these results suggest that individual differences in subclinical anxiety may not show strong effects on adolescent behavior and may even involve the same brain regions, but these regions influence behavior in opposing ways. Future longitudinal work will probe how these mechanisms contribute to anxiety development over adolescence, and whether more pronounced behavioral differences emerge when anxiety reaches a clinical level.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
