<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the three-year period between 2020 and 2022, researchers published more than four times as many scholarly articles on emotion and decision making than were published in the thirty years from 1962 through 1992. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> What was once a dormant field now burgeons with promise (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lerner, Li, Valdesolo &amp; Kassam, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Keltner &amp; Lerner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dorison, Klusowski, Han, &amp; Lerner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dukes et al., 2021)</ref>. Consistent with this increase, researchers' guiding assumptions have changed as well. While B.F. <ref type="bibr">Skinner (1953, p. 160</ref>) and many mid-20 th -century psychologists considered emotion a "fictional cause" to which people attribute behavior, most researcherseven those with diverging perspectives on emotion --now agree that emotions constitute powerful drivers of decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrade &amp; Ariely, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bechara, Damasio, &amp; Damasio, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fridman, Feldman Barrett, Wormwood, &amp; Quigley, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Haidt, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lerner et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, &amp; Welch, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Naqvi, Shiv, &amp; Bechara, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Phelps, Lempert, &amp; Sokol-Hessner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Winkielman, Berridge, &amp; Wilbarger, 2005)</ref>. This chapter reviews how the field of emotion and decision making has evolved and where it stands today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Historical approaches to emotion and decision making</head><p>Although many disciplines have touched on the subject of emotion and decision making, scientific research on this topic has blossomed primarily within economics and psychology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Historical approaches within economics</head><p>Modern decision theory per se emerged primarily in the field of economics during the 18 th and 19 th centuries. While the classical economic models of decision making may seem to concern purely cognitive rationality ("homo-economicus"), notable exceptions addressed emotion. For example, Adam <ref type="bibr">Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">/2002</ref> included an informal yet important role for sympathy in moral decision-making. Additionally, Jeremy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bentham's (1879)</ref> original conception of utility emphasized happiness as "the greatest good."</p><p>However, most neoclassical economists found emotion too unpredictable and difficult to formalize. Consequently, they instead adopted ordinal utility as an index of preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1944;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Samuelson, 1948)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, contemporary economic theories have also paid limited attention to emotion (for notable exceptions, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Elster, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Frank, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Keynes, 1936</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Keynes, /1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Loewenstein, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Loewenstein, , 2000</ref>. For example, consider the rational choice model (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). This model suggests that people should consider the expected outcomes of their decision alternatives (e.g., expected profits when investing vs. not investing; <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Line A) and select the option with the highest expected utility (e.g., investing; <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Line D). While this model assumes that characteristics of the decision makers (e.g., risk tolerance) or those of the options (e.g., attractiveness of the investment options) may enter into this evaluation <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>, Lines B and C), it does not address how decision makers' current feelings (e.g., anger, fear) may influence this process. In fact, this model accounts for emotion simply as an element of "expected utility" (e.g., expected happiness from investing vs. not investing) rather than as a direct, independent input. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. A traditional rational choice model. Emotions may appear in such a model as one form of "utility." Adapted from "Emotion and decision making," by J.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lerner, Y. Li, P. Valdesolo, and</ref><ref type="bibr">K.S. Kassam, 2015, Annual Review of Psychology, 66, p. 815 (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115043)</ref>. Copyright 2015 by Annual Reviews.</p><p>As far back as 1983, Nobel Laureate Herbert <ref type="bibr">Simon (1983, p. 29)</ref> argued for the importance of incorporating emotion into decision theory: "[I]n order to have anything like a complete theory of human rationality, we have to understand what role emotion plays in it." Building on Simon's challenge to the field, recent decades have witnessed major developments (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Loewenstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Rick &amp; Loewenstein, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akerlof &amp; Shiller, 2010)</ref>, some of which we detail later in this chapter. It is still the case, however, that much work remains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Historical approaches within psychology</head><p>As compared to the field of economics, empirical psychology is a younger discipline.</p><p>Wilhelm Wundt founded the first psychology laboratory in 1879, but it took another full century before empirical research on emotion took hold. Many factors contributed to a dearth of emotion research, including the dominance of behaviorism from approximately 1920 to 1960 as well as its countermovement, the "cognitive revolution" in the 1960s. Revolting against the Pavlovian and Skinnerian ideas that only observable (and not mental) events could be studied scientifically, cognitive science in the 1970s inserted the concept of cognition between behaviorism's famous stimulus-response pairing. This cognitive focus dominated psychological science for decades and remains strong today (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baars, 1986</ref>)although it is no longer the exclusive lens for studying decision making (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gilovich &amp; Griffin, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The early 1980s marked an important change due to the publication of several landmark papers involving feelings and decision making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Zajonc (1980)</ref> demonstrated that "preferences need no inferences"-that is, one's preferences or feelings about choice options do not require cognitive processes and may even precede cognition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schwarz &amp; Clore (1983)</ref> as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Johnson &amp; Tversky (1983)</ref> documented that feelings, which they could manipulate in the laboratory or measure in the field, have widespread effects on behavior (discussed later in more detail), often without a decision maker's awareness. Coupled with neuroscientific advances (for review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Phelps, Lempert &amp; Sokol-Hessner, 2014)</ref>, such papers catalyzed shifts in foundational assumptions about emotion and decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdisciplinary approaches to emotion and decision making</head><p>With few exceptions across history, most theories of decision making up until the late 20 th century were discipline specific. Economists wrote for, and were read by, fellow economists; psychologists wrote for, and were read by, fellow psychologists. By the year 2000, this changed. Many contemporary theories of emotion and decision making have become explicitly interdisciplinary. For example, economist George Loewenstein along with psychologist colleagues Elke Weber, Christopher Hsee, and Ned Welch proposed the influential Risk-as-Feelings Theory as a way to elucidate divergences between cognitive and affective evaluations of risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, &amp; Welch, 2001</ref>). This theory predicts that factors such as vividness, immediacy, and background mood influence one's feelings, which in turn influence risk behavior beyond the impact of cognitive evaluations. In line with this idea, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001)</ref> found that the affective content of a risk (i.e., its hedonic goodness or badness) determines one's degree of sensitivity to changes in the likelihood of the risk. Importantly, the risk-as-feelings framework now figures prominently in papers across a broad range of disciplines (e.g., psychology, economics, neuroscience, anthropology, finance, law, etc.), which actively engage in the study of emotion and decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contemporary terminology and methodology regarding emotion (in decision research)</head><p>Given that the interdisciplinary field of emotion and decision making has only recently emerged, it is useful to propose common terminology. Researchers may rightfully disagree on how best to define the concepts listed below. To the extent that the field seeks to develop into what <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kuhn (1962)</ref> terms "normal science," however, there is value in proposing terminology for key constructs and inviting researchers to test the validity of such constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Terminology</head><p>Affect. In judgment and decision making (JDM) research, affect typically describes the overarching, superordinate umbrella of feeling-related constructs, including mood, emotion, and affective traits. There are multiple categories of affect.</p><p>Integral affect refers to feelings arising from the judgment or decision at hand. For example, one's feelings about a romantic partner would be integral to the decision to marry the person. Rational choice models typically consider integral affect as a valid input to consider when making a decision (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lerner et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the popular view that emotion inherently biases decisions, researchers have convincingly documented that integral affect can serve as an important input (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Loewenstein et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Van Kleef, 2009</ref>) so long as the intensity of the integral affect does not crowd out other considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Loewenstein, 1996)</ref>. Moreover, studies have discovered that the absence of emotional input can be severely detrimental. For example, injuries to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain structure that facilitates integration of emotion, leads decision makers to select suboptimal choices when evaluating risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Damasio, 1994</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr">Dunn, Dalgeish, &amp; Lawrence, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Incidental affect refers to unrelated feelings one happens to have at the time of a judgment or decision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Johnson and Tversky (1983)</ref> and others have demonstrated how incidental affect exerts causal effects on people's risk perceptions. Specifically, participants who read a newspaper story eliciting positive (or negative) affect offered more optimistic (or pessimistic) estimates of fatality frequencies for various potential causes of death, including those unrelated to the emotion-eliciting story. Such effects can also manifest in important real-world contexts.</p><p>For example, in the legal domain, anger/frustration elicited in one situation can carry over to shape decisions to blame others in unrelated legal contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Lerner, Goldberg, &amp; Tetlock 1998)</ref>, posing problems for the fair administration of justice. Moreover, such emotional carryover often occurs without conscious awareness (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Han, Lerner, &amp; Keltner, 2007)</ref>. Most models of rational choice do not consider incidental affect a valid decision input, although the weight of empirical evidence makes clear that both integral and incidental affect pervasively influence decision making (see <ref type="bibr">Lerner et al., 2015, for review)</ref>.</p><p>Both foregoing affective constructs relate in one way or another to experienced feelings.</p><p>There is, however, another category of affect that appears in studies of decision making: Anticipatory (or expected) affect. This construct is not technically affect per se, but rather thoughts about future feelings. A rich literature examines how people expect they will feel if they were to experience such events as achieving tenure, dancing to funky music, etc. Such expectations drive present choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dorison, Minson, &amp; Rogers, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, &amp; Wheatley, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Knutson, Adams, Fong, &amp; Hommer, 2001</ref>) and reflect the desire to maximize positive, or minimize negative, anticipated affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Luce, Bettman, &amp; Payne, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Mellers, Schwartz, Ho, &amp; Ritov, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Constituent feeling-related constructs. Regardless of whether the affective-state is integral, incidental, or anticipatory, a small set of constituent feeling-related constructs can be distinguished.</p><p>A Mood is a diffuse state without a specific triggering target <ref type="bibr">(Davidson &amp; Ekman, 1994, p. 94-96;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Scherer, 2005</ref> for a more in-depth discussion of component process models of emotion). Typically, moods arise from affective traits (to be discussed later), such as dispositional anxiety. Given that moods have no specific triggering target, they are often considered incidental to the decision at hand. Moods can be: (a) measured using a variety of selfreport scales or (b) induced using a more global version of the sequence described in Section 3 for emotion.</p><p>Emotion, or "immediate emotion" in JDM research, typically refers to a reaction to an internal or external event that one experiences at the time of a judgment or decision. Most researchers regard emotion as subjective experiences involving multi-modal responses, including feelings, cognitive and biological changes, facial and/or bodily expressions, motor behavior, and action tendencies (see Section IV). Compared to moods or affective traits, an emotion has limited duration. Emotion can be integral or incidental to the decision at hand.</p><p>Affective traits refer to heightened frequency and intensity of experiencing corresponding emotions across time and situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Davidson &amp; Ekman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Larsen &amp; Diener, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Rothbart &amp; Ahadi, 1994)</ref>. Affective traits are driven partially by genetic factors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hariri &amp; Holmes, 2006)</ref> and partially by accumulated experiences, the two often reinforcing each other <ref type="bibr">(cf. Ekman &amp; Davidson, 1994)</ref>. Typically, JDM researchers consider emotion states and affective traits as "two sides of the same coin" <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lazarus, 1994)</ref> in terms of their impact on decision making. For example, trait anxiety and state fear both increase perceptions of risk, whereas trait anger and state anger both decrease perceptions of risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, 2001</ref>). Many valid and reliable scales can be found in the literature for assessing affective traits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Shiota, Keltner, &amp; John, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodological tips for identifying causal effects of emotion on decision making</head><p>It may also be important to agree upon certain methodological paradigms, especially as the broader field of psychology is undergoing a renaissance in methodology. For example, reflecting the emphasis on replicability in the social and behavioral sciences, it is now important to recruit large samples with sufficient statistical power and to pre-register studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Nosek, Ebersole, DeHaven &amp; Mellor, 2018)</ref>. Given our chapter's focus, we do not address the myriad emerging paradigms or the robustness of the methods and results in previous research. Instead, we seek to synthesize some of the best methods for studying causal effects of emotion on decision making. Some emotion researchers intentionally resist the imposition of standardized methods, noting that study-specific methods should arise from, and be tailored to, the nature of each theoretically-driven research question (P. Ellsworth, personal communication, January 29, 2019).</p><p>Others, particularly those conducting meta-analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Weidman, Steckler, &amp; Tracy, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ferrer et al., 2020)</ref>, highlight the need to work toward a cumulative science by decreasing ambiguity and unwarranted heterogeneity in methods. Attempting to balance these two legitimate goals, we offer one example of a four-part decision research procedure, which could be tailored to individual research questions yet help solidify methodological benchmarks in emotion science.</p><p>Baseline measure of emotion. Participants complete a pre-validated and reliable selfreport scale of emotion terms, indicating the extent to which they feel the target and/or non-target emotions at the beginning of the experiment. Such scales (1) allow experimenters to check for failures of random assignment, (2) provide potential control variables for individual differences, and (3) help assess the exact degree of change on the target or non-target emotions. However, baseline measures also have a downside: they may inform participants that researchers are interested in emotion and hence influence participants' responses to subsequent treatments.</p><p>Emotion induction. Participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions to experience the target and/or the non-target emotions. The content of the emotion induction itself varies. One example combines video and writing inductions. Specifically, participants watch a video clip designed to induce the corresponding emotion (e.g., a clip about unfair treatment of a victim to induce anger) and then write about the content of the video (e.g., how they felt watching the victim). While the writing serves to deepen the effects of the stimulus by engaging the participants, it also has a downside: verbalizing/writing about an emotional experience may change the nature of that reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Pennebaker, 2018)</ref>. In all cases, it is important to minimize experimental confounds by matching the emotion stimuli on all other dimensions (e.g., length of the video, difficulty of the writing task) across the different emotion conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent variable(s).</head><p>Participants complete the outcome measures tailored to address the research question. Decision researchers care deeply about whether participants' choices reflect their true preferences. Therefore, in addition to using such techniques as reducing demand characteristics, researchers typically diminish the likelihood that participants will "game" responses by designing dependent variable(s) that are incentive-compatible (for discussion, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lerner, Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Post-induction measure of emotion. Participants complete the pre-validated and reliable self-report scale of emotion again, but this time indicating how they felt during the induction or as they complete the scale. Such measures allow researchers to assess whether the emotion inductions successfully increased the corresponding emotional experiences, both in terms of the magnitude (i.e., whether the target emotion condition elicited a higher level of the target emotion compared to the baseline) and the specificity (i.e., whether the condition elicited a higher level of the target emotion than of the non-target emotions). Ideally, these should appear after the dependent variables to avoid influencing responses to the outcome measures. Researchers can also consider conducting such manipulation checks in a separate pilot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valence-based theories of emotion and decision making</head><p>Theories within the interdisciplinary field of emotion and decision making can be divided into two main categories: those that emphasize valence distinctions and those that emphasize specific emotions. Distinctions between these categories are not meant to be rigid. Rather, the distinctions help cluster theories for organizational purposes.</p><p>Many valence-based, or mood-congruent, theories of decision making originated from seminal research on mood and memory by Gordon Bower and colleagues (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bower, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Results revealed a "mood-dependent recall" effect: Recall of a list of words was best when the mood state during recall matched that during learning of the list (happy or sad, induced via hypnosis), and worst when the mood during recall differed from that during learning. In recent decades, numerous valence-based theories have contrasted the effects of positive (i.e., pleasant) versus negative (i.e., unpleasant) feeling states on JDM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, &amp; Johnson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983)</ref>. Many of the most-influential papers fit within this category, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Johnson &amp; Tversky's (1983)</ref> studies of emotion and risk and studies conducted within the affect-heuristic framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Slovic et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Models emphasizing a valence-based approach tend to hypothesize either direct effects of emotionwhat <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schwarz and Clore (1983)</ref> call "affect as information"or indirect effects of emotion -what <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Forgas (1995)</ref> refers to as "affect priming."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effect models</head><p>Affect-as-information theory, a dominant approach to studying direct affective influences, posits that when making evaluative judgments, people rely directly on their feelings, i.e., they ask themselves, "How do I feel about it?" and use those feelings to form the judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Clore, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, 1996</ref>. The extent to which such affect directly influences judgments depends on whether the feelings are considered relevant to the object of judgment (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Clore, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yap et al., 2017)</ref>. As depicted below, current weather has direct informational value for people when they are asked about overall wellbeing/life satisfaction on a given day. As shown in the top pathway, sunny weather predicts not only a positive mood but also an elevated positive evaluation of one's overall life well-being.</p><p>By contrast, as shown in the bottom pathway, cloudy weather predicts a not only a negative mood but also an elevated negative evaluation of one's overall life well-being. In both cases, people are consulting their current feelings when asked about overall wellbeing and not sufficiently attributing their feelings to transient weather. Importantly, the middle circle ("asked about weather") highlights the fact that such direct effects of mood diminish if people are asked about the current weather. According to the theory, being asked about the weather allows people to correctly identify the source of their current moodi.e., the weather. Once they identify the source, its carryover to judgments of well-being is diminished <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. An example of the affect-as-information framework applied to weather effects. This framework predicts a direct effect of emotion unless the decision maker is prompted to consider the incidental source of present feelings (in this case, the weather).</p><p>Relatedly, the affect heuristic predicts that people form judgments based primarily on valenced (positive or negative) subjective impressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Finucane et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">, Slovic &amp; Peters, 2006</ref>. For example, those who have a positive impression of a particular technology (e.g., nuclear power) tend to believe, erroneously, that it has high benefits and low risk. In reality, technologies that have the potential to provide high benefits often tend to involve high risks (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Finucane et al., 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect effect models</head><p>Some valence-based models posit an additional indirect role for affect on JDM. As depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baron, 1987)</ref>, this research predicts that people consider mood-congruent thoughts (e.g., regarding causes, attributes, or outcomes) more applicable or likely than comparable non-mood-congruent thoughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Mayer, Gaschke, Braverman, &amp; Evans, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, being in a particular mood enhances the retrieval of mood-congruent information, which forms the basis of future JDM. Several studies have now shown that, as compared to people in negative moods, people in positive moods rate positive events as more likely <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Wright &amp; Bower, 1992)</ref> and report higher self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kavanagh &amp; Bower, 1985)</ref>. Despite evidence of mood-congruent predictions, early research raised questions about the reliability of this approach, including why mood-state dependent memory effects did not always replicate (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 1994)</ref> and why feelings sometimes even lead to mood-incongruent recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Parrott &amp; Sabini, 1990)</ref>. In response, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Forgas (1995)</ref> proposed the affect-infusion model, which integrated findings. Specifically, the model predicts general conditions under which affect will infuse judgments via indirect effects: when the judgment target features are unfamiliar, atypical, and complex; when the judge has limited cognitive capacity to form an accurate impression; and when the situation provides few objective criteria and little need for accuracy. Such conditions likely trigger "constructive processing," which involves generating new thoughts and seeking out information about the available target details, hence affording the infusion of affect. For example, Forgas (2011) predicted that participants' induced mood (positive versus negative) influences the degree to which participants evaluated a philosophy essay as positive versus negative. Evaluating such an essay is a difficult and complex task, fitting exactly the kind of situation where affect infusion could occur. Forgas also predicted that participants' mood (positive versus negative) would influence the degree to which they relied on a picture of the philosopher who wrote it (either a stereotypically wise person or a stereotypically naïve person). Negative moods should predict relatively greater scrutiny of the essay's content and diminished impact of the picture; positive moods should predict the opposite.</p><p>Consistent with predictions, evaluations of the philosophy essay showed clear interactions between participants' mood and the type of picture. Participants in a positive mood relied more on the accompanying picture when evaluating the essay than did participants in a negative mood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The pros and cons of valence-based models</head><p>Valence-based models have had a path-breaking effect on the field of emotion and decision making, producing at least four major discoveries: (a) even incidental emotions carry over to shape JDM in powerful ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Finucane et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Forgas, 1995)</ref>; (b) such carryover can occur without awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983)</ref>; (c) the effects of emotion carryover in a general rather than specific way <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Johnson &amp; Tversky, 1983)</ref>; and (d) emotions may mediate fundamental decision processes (De <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Martino, Kumaran, Seymour, &amp; Dolan, 2006)</ref>. The emphasis on valence can, however, create significant opportunity costs if dimensions of valence and arousal are considered the only dimensions of interest. In 1998, a review of JDM research in the Annual Review of Psychology noted the insufficiency of valence and arousal in predicting JDM outcomes: "Even a two-dimensional model seems inadequate for describing emotional experiences. Anger, sadness, and disgust are all forms of negative affect, and arousal does not capture all of the differences among them . . . A more detailed approach is required to understand relationships between emotions and decisions" <ref type="bibr">(Mellers, Schwartz, &amp; Cooke, 1998, p. 454)</ref>.</p><p>Importantly, while the foregoing theories/frameworks have emphasized valence for distinguishing between positive and negative moods, they need not be limited to doing so. For example, predictions from affect-as-information theory could hold if one sought to contrast emotions within the same valence, e.g., fear versus sadness. Thus, while the foregoing theories arose from emphasizing valence, they could accommodate more granular distinctions among emotional categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emotion-specific theories of decision making</head><p>Drawing on the assumption that specific emotions allow individuals to quickly tackle problems and address opportunities (Ekman &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Davidson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Keltner &amp; Gross, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Levenson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Tooby &amp; Cosmides 1990</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Keltner (2000, 2001)</ref> proposed the Appraisal Tendency Framework (ATF), the first overarching framework for the effects of specific emotions on JDM. In particular, responding to the Annual Review paper by Mellers and colleagues, they sought to specify the conditions under which emotions of the same valence would exert opposing influences on JDM while still retaining reasonable parsimony. This framework is agnostic when it comes to the etiology of emotion. It merely assumes that an emotion, once elicited, can be characterized by associated appraisals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Appraisal Tendency Framework</head><p>The ATF <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, 2001</ref> takes an explicitly multidimensional approach to predicting effects of emotion on JDM, arguing that valence is only one of at least six cognitive dimensions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985)</ref> useful for predicting effects on JDM (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003)</ref>. The ATF draws heavily on cognitive appraisal theories (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith and Ellsworth, 1985)</ref>, which identify at least six cognitive dimensions that define the underlying appraisal patterns of different emotions: certainty, valence/pleasantness, attention, control, anticipated effort, and responsibility/agency (for an expanded list, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cowen &amp; Keltner, 2017)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Tiedens &amp; Linton, 2001</ref>). Therefore, happiness resembles anger more than fear does in these two respects.</p><p>Appraisal tendencies. The ATF predicts that an emotion, once activated, can trigger a cognitive predisposition to assess future events in line with the central appraisal dimensions that triggered the emotion. Appraisal tendencies are goal-directed processes through which emotions exert effects on judgment and choice until the emotion-eliciting problem is resolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, 2001</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lerner, Goldberg, &amp; Tetlock, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Oveis, Horberg, &amp; Keltner, 2010</ref>). 2 Each emotion is believed to be characterized by a central appraisal theme (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lazarus, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985)</ref> that shapes which judgments and decisions the emotion is likely to influence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATF matching principle.</head><p>The ATF suggests that research should compare emotions that are highly differentiated on the appraisal themes "matched" to the present judgments or decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000)</ref>. This "matching principle" (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Han et al., 2007)</ref> can be illustrated in a study comparing the effects of anger and sadness on causal attributions. Because appraisals concerning control share a conceptual affinity (or "match") to causal attributions, researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Keltner et al., 1993)</ref> selected anger (high on appraisals of individual control) and sadness (high on appraisals of situational control) to test the hypothesis that differences in the control appraisal would lead angry and sad individuals to make different attributions of causality. Supporting this hypothesis, anger increased attributions of causality to individual factors (e.g., effort, ability), whereas sadness increased attributions of causality to situational circumstances (e.g., fate).</p><p>Differences in the control appraisal mediated the effects. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dunn and Schweitzer (2005)</ref> found that incidental emotional states were more likely to be misattributed when the appraisals of the emotion were consistent with the judgment task than when they were inconsistent.</p><p>Specifically, the researchers expected and found that incidental emotions with other-person control appraisals (e.g., anger and gratitude) would be more frequently misattributed for judgments about other people (specifically, trustworthiness) than would emotions with personal or situational control appraisals (e.g., guilt and sadness, respectively).</p><p>Newer versions of the ATF delineate three mediational mechanisms through which emotions drive JDM outcomes: content of thought, depth of thought, and goal activation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dorison, Klusowski, Han, &amp; Lerner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ferrer, Klein, Lerner, Reyna, &amp; Keltner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Han et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lerner et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lerner &amp; Tiedens, 2006)</ref>. Content of thought. As described above, each emotion is associated with heightened activation of particular appraisal themes. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> compares and contrasts anger and fear, two useful examples, along the six cognitive appraisal dimensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lazarus, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Roseman &amp; Smith, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985)</ref>. Although similar on the dimension of valence, anger and fear differ strikingly on thoughts (more specifically, appraisals) about certainty and about individual control, as described earlier. The row "Appraisal tendency"</p><p>shows the prediction that each emotion is associated with a cognitive predisposition to assess future events in line with its central appraisal dimensions. The bottom row shows the prediction that anger, high in appraisals of control and certainty, should lead to reduced perceptions of risk, whereas fear, low in appraisals of control and certainty, should have the opposite effect. The conceptual "match" arises from an extensive literature on risk perception revealing that two cognitive meta-factors, associated with perceptions of control and certainty, drive risk estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Slovic, 1987)</ref>.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Comparison between anger and fear. Updated from "Beyond valence: Toward a model of emotionspecific influences on judgement and choice" by J.S. <ref type="bibr">Lerner and D.

Copyright 2000 by Psychology Press Ltd.</p><p>Note: The appraisal dimensions listed above and the relative values for anger and fear draw from <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith &amp; Ellsworth's (1985)</ref> seminal paper on cognitive appraisal. Newer literature substitutes novelty/attention for attentional activity, valence for pleasantness, goal conduciveness/effort for anticipated effort, agency for others' responsibility, and control for individual control.</p><p>Indeed, growing research has found that anger is associated with a tendency to perceive fewer risks and thus take greater risks, whereas fear is associated with opposing tendencies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lerner, Gonzalez, Small, &amp; Fischhoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Lu, Xie, Zhang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">She, Eimontaite, Zhang, &amp; Sun, 2017)</ref>. In addition, research finds that anger heightens appraisals of control and certainty, whereas fear does the opposite and that those appraisal differencesi.e., the content of thoughtsignificantly mediate JDM outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2001</ref>). The aftermath of September 11 th tragically provided an opportunity to put these hypotheses to a strong test. Would such diverging patterns for anger and fear appear even when the nation was stunned by the shocking loss of life? Using a nationally-representative sample that matched census figures for the U.S. as a whole, <ref type="bibr">Lerner and colleagues (2003)</ref> found that experimentallyprimed anger globally reduced risk estimates relative to experimentally-primed fear. Such anger also decreased intentions to take precautionary measures relative to fear and altered corresponding policy preferences. Moreover, in a follow up study <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Fischhoff, Gonzalez, Lerner, &amp; Small, 2012)</ref>, the researchers examined the evolution of cognitive and emotional responses to terror risks for the same sample of Americans between late 2001 and late 2002. An angerinducing manipulation once again decreased risk estimates, whereas a fear-inducing manipulation increased them-both in respondents' predictions (as previously observed) and in respondents' memories and judgments of past risks (as a novel finding). Thus, priming emotions shaped not only perceptions of an abstract future and preferences about how to cope with it, but also perceptions of a concrete past that they themselves lived. 3</p><p>Depth of thought. This pathway refers to the degree to which a decision maker uses a shallow (i.e., fast, undemanding) versus a deep (i.e., slow, effortful) mode of thought (for review, see <ref type="bibr">Chaiken &amp; Trope, 1999)</ref>. Researchers found that emotions associated with the appraisal of certainty (e.g., anger, happiness) implicitly trigger shallow thought, while those associated with uncertainty (e.g., fear, sadness) led to deeper processing. In a set of studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Tiedens and Linton (2001)</ref> found that individuals primed with anger or happiness implicitly believed that they already understood a situation and did not need to exert more cognitive effort. As a result, they were more likely to rely on stereotypes and superficial cues when judging others. Other experiments have demonstrated that even emotions of the same valence, if they are opposite on underlying appraisals of certainty, can have opposite effects on depth of thought and thus decision making. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Small and Lerner (2008)</ref> found that sad individuals were more likely to allocate aid to welfare recipients than were angry individuals, presumably because they took situational causes of poverty into account. Placing sad decision makers in a condition of cognitive load that discouraged deep thinking eliminated this difference, suggesting that depth of thought underpinned the original effect.</p><p>Goal activation. Many theorists have proposed that emotions serve an adaptive coordination role, triggering a set of responses (e.g., behavior, experience, communication, and physiology) that enable individuals to address problems and opportunities quickly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 2000)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">Frijda and colleagues (1989)</ref> have argued that emotions trigger action readiness (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Zeelenberg and colleagues (2008, p. 21)</ref> go so far as to argue that "the emotional system is the primary motivational system for goal-directed behavior." Several studies lend evidence to the idea that emotion-specific action tendenciesi.e., implicit goalsarise from appraisal themes. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Raghunathan and Pham (1999)</ref> found that incidental sadness (characterized by a theme of loss) increased tendencies to favor highreward, high-risk options in hypothetical gambling and job-selection decisions, whereas incidental anxiety (characterized by a theme of uncertainty) increased preferences for lowreward, low-risk options. Sad decisions makers presumably sought to replace loss whereas anxious decision makers sought to reduce uncertainty. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Lerner and colleagues (2013)</ref> found that sadness increases impatience in financial decisions, even when immediate rewards are much smaller than later rewards. In the same vein, <ref type="bibr">Dorison and colleagues (2020)</ref> found that sadness, but not all negative emotions, heightened addictive substance use in the form of cigarette use among active smokers.</p><p>In a related series of studies on implicit goals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lerner et al. (2004)</ref> examined the endowment effectthe tendency for decision makers to set higher selling prices for a commodity they already own than they would pay to purchase the same commodity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kahneman, Knetsch, &amp; Thaler, 1991)</ref>. Although the endowment effect is typically very robust, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lerner et al. (2004)</ref> found that sadness, associated with the appraisal themes of loss and misfortune, reversed this phenomenonit increased buying prices and decreased selling prices. In contrast, disgust eliminated the endowment effect, reducing selling prices among participants who owned the object and concurrently reducing buying prices among participants who did not. Disgust, which revolves around the appraisal theme of being too close to a potentially contaminating object <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lazarus, 1991)</ref>, presumably evoked an implicit goal to expel current objects and avoid taking in anything new <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Rozin, 2008</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Horberg, Oveis, Keltner, &amp; Cohen, 2009)</ref>. Importantly, Shu and Peck (2011) used different commodities but still replicated the diverging effects of sadness and disgust on buying and selling prices, providing much-needed depth to this nascent literature (see also Han and colleagues, 2012, for related work on disgust and economic behavior).</p><p>The view that specific emotions trigger specific implicit goals is also consistent with the feeling-is-for-doing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Zeelenberg et al., 2008)</ref>. This framework asserts that the adaptive function of emotion is defined by the behaviors that specific states motivate. According to Zeelenberg and colleagues, these motivational orientations derive from the experiential qualities of such emotions (rather than the appraisal tendencies giving rise to their experience), but the predictions from each perspective may overlap. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Martinez, Zeelenberg, and Rijsman (2011)</ref> predicted and found that regret, which triggers "reparative" actions, would reduce selling prices and increase buying prices (to give their counterparts a better deal), eliminating the endowment effect. They also predicted and found that disappointmentwith its underlying feelings of loss and ensuing goal of changing one's circumstanceswould, like sadness, reverse the endowment effect. To date, the ATF and the feeling-is-for-doing models have concentrated on different types of emotion: the former has mostly examined incidental emotion, whereas the latter has examined integral emotion. Studies with similar emotions are needed to disentangle the frameworks' respective predictions for goal activation.</p><p>Emerging research on positive emotions. Most research on specific emotions and JDM has contrasted the effects of specific negative emotionslikely because negative emotions appear to be more differentiated than positive emotions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ellsworth &amp; Smith, 1988)</ref>. That said, a few recent papers, complementary with the ATF approach, have demonstrated positive emotion specificity. For example, DeSteno et al. (2014) hypothesized and found that gratitude, but not happiness, increased financial patience even when real money was at stake. Another study demonstrated the effects of awe on prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Piff, Dietze, Feinberg, Stancato, &amp; Keltner, 2015)</ref>. This study found that participants in the awe condition made more generous allocations in an economic game, offered more help to the experimenter, and exhibited marginally greater ethical tendencies than did participants in another positive or a neutral emotion condition (see <ref type="bibr">Rudd, Vohs, and Aaker, 2012, for related work)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The pros and cons of emotion-specific models</head><p>A growing number of studies demonstrate the value of studying specific emotions when examining decision behavior. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of experimental emotion elicitations on JDM finds greater support for a specific emotions approach than a purely valence-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lench, Flores, &amp; Bench, 2011)</ref>. While the emotion-specific models can enhance predictive power and precision within the field of JDM, they suffer from their own weaknesses.</p><p>Notably, emotion-specific models lack the parsimony of valence models. Moreover, scholars disagree about whether key assumptions of specific-emotion models (e.g., that emotions are separable) rest on sufficient empirical support (for discussion, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cowen &amp; Keltner, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barrett, Khan, Dy, &amp; Brooks, 2018)</ref>. Although much work remains on the etiology of emotion, etiological questions should not be blurred with questions about how best to model effects of emotion on decision making. Regardless of the degree to which emotions are socially constructed versus biologically evolved, the JDM literature reveals that greater predictive precision can often be obtained when distinguishing between emotions of the same valence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toward a unified model of emotion and decision making</head><p>Although the field is still at a nascent stage, it now produces hundreds of scholarly publications annually. To organize such findings at a meta-level, the field would benefit from a superordinate model that can accommodate a variety of complementary and competing microlevel theories. Such a framework would incorporate similarities across models to help organize it into a cumulative science. In an effort to provide such a framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lerner et al. (2015)</ref> proposed the emotion-imbued choice (EIC) model of decision making ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>). It intentionally aims to incorporate both normative (i.e., rational actor) and descriptive approaches. It also incorporates valence-based and emotion-specific approaches.</p><p>Largely agnostic to micro-mechanisms like appraisal tendencies, the EIC attempts to account for both traditional inputs found in neoclassical economic models of choice (see <ref type="figure">Figure   1</ref>) and newly-evident emotional inputs. Drawing inspiration from prior models-especially the risk-as-feelings model (see <ref type="bibr">Loewenstein et al., 2001, Figure 3: 270)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Loewenstein and Lerner's review (2003,</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 31</ref>.1: 621)-the EIC proposes broad ways in which emotion permeates decision processes.</p><p>The EIC adds emotions both within and beyond the scope of traditional rational choice models. Pathways shared with normative, rational choice models of decision making such as expected utility and discounted utility theories appear as black, solid lines in the figure (overlapping with <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Pathways unique to the EIC appear as grey, dotted lines. As depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, traditional decision theory assumes that people make decisions by evaluating the expected utility of each decision outcome. This evaluation is influenced by the characteristics of the decision maker and the options. In addition, the EIC model accommodates decision makers' current emotions (e.g., anger), which arise from the following sources: (1) characteristics of the decision maker (e.g., dispositional anger; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, Line B'); (2) characteristics of the options (e.g., undesirable choice options; framing of options; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, Line C'); (3) expected outcomes (e.g., negative prospects; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, Line F); (4) evaluation of the options (e.g., complex trade-offs; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, Line G'; <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Luce et al. 1997)</ref>; and (5) incidental influences (e.g., bad weather; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, Line H). As described earlier, such feelings can influence the decision makers' evaluation of the options <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 5</ref>, Line G) by alternating the content they consider, the level of processing they utilize, or the implicit goals they pursue. The emotions can also influence decision making by changing the expected utility of the possible decision outcomes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, Line I; <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The following example illustrates the EIC model in action. Imagine that someone experiencing sadness due to loss of her job during the COVID-19 pandemic is offered an intertemporal choice: She can receive $300 now or $600 in 1 month. As noted above, her decision could be affected by personal characteristics; for example, if she tends to be an impatient person, she would be less likely to choose the delayed amount <ref type="figure">(Figure 2, line B)</ref>. Her decision would also likely be influenced by how well off she expects to be financially as a function of when she receives the money <ref type="figure">(Figure 2, line E)</ref>; for example, if she received her annual bonus just before being laid off, she may be more likely to choose the delayed amount. In accordance with the ATF, current dismal winter weather, though incidental to the decision <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>, line H), would increase her motivation to attain rewards immediately, even at the expense of longer-term gains <ref type="figure">(Figure 2, line G)</ref>. However, the anticipatory influences of expected positive outcomes might mitigate her sadness by triggering a positive feeling in the future, such as excitement over the prospect of what she could do with the money <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>, line F). Conversely, current sadness might also temper such expectations, making both outcomes seem less rewarding <ref type="figure">(Figure 2, line I)</ref>. Finally, frustration about waiting for a time-delayed reward (line C′) and anxiety about the size of the discrepancy between the rewards (line G′) may further color her current emotions. The ultimate decision will be predicted by the combination of her sadness-modified impatience, her monetary goals, her current emotions, and how she values the potential rewards <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>, line D).</p><p>In sum, it is possible to incorporate newer psychological pathways into traditional rational choice models and create a far more descriptively accurate model-one that offers a bridge between emotion science and a rational choice approach. Another example involves risk preference. A rational choice model assumes that people calculate the expected values of risky options and make the decision based on their risk tolerance and the attributes of their optionsan analysis that leaves out their feelings at the time of the decision. The EIC would incorporate their feelings, such as the anger mentioned in the above example, and predict that the anger would make them more likely to choose a risky option than expected under the rational choice model <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, 2001</ref>. Hopefully, with this overarching model in hand, researchers from competing theoretical perspectives can contribute scientific findings that answer long-standing questions concerning emotion and decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Future Directions</head><p>After nearly a century of neglect, the volume of research examining emotion and decision making has increased dramatically. A plethora of theories have been proposed with a focus on valence-based and/or emotion-specific distinctions. As the field grows toward becoming a cumulative science, three overarching themes merit special attention.</p><p>The first involves continuity across research endeavors. To advance understanding of emotion and decision making, research can benefit from adopting common terminology, even as researchers propose competing theories for mechanisms of action. Our proposed terminology is an attempt to establish such common ground. Even more important, research can benefit from a common conceptual architecture for emotion and decision making, much like economics has historically embraced models of expected utility calculation. Our EIC model, which is agnostic to particular mechanisms and theories, will hopefully be useful in this regard.</p><p>A second theme for future research involves scaling across units of analysis. We have reviewed research ranging from analytic units as small as brain structures to those as large as nations experiencing terrorist attacks. Indeed, recent research even examines patterns of emotional response across continents <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dorison et al., 2022)</ref>. In most cases, however, research has taken either a relatively more micro focus or a relatively macro focus without intentionally examining the extent to which emergent emotional phenomena may change at different levels (for discussion of the possibility of unity across levels, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wilson, 1998)</ref>. For example, does an individual's anger influence decision making the same way that a group's anger would?</p><p>Relatedly, are the effects of shared anger (e.g., in crowds or online communities) additive or multiplicative in terms of decision processes and outcomes?</p><p>A third theme for future research involves bridging across disciplines. To date, research on emotion and decision making has been dominated by the disciplines of economics and psychology. As decisions become increasingly transmitted, aided, and perhaps eventually performed by machines, more bridges to computer science are needed (for early work in this vein, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Gratch &amp; Marsella, 2001)</ref>. Similarly, it is crucial to incorporate anthropological theories that elucidate cultural factors; sociological theories that explore interactions between emotion and structural/demographic factors; political theories that examine how nation states propagate sentiments around election decisions, and so on. Thus, the field of emotion and decision making needs stronger roots as much as it needs broader branches.</p><p>Inasmuch as heated debates have long characterized the field of emotion, it is likely that this chapter on emotion decision making will spark debate. We welcome disagreement and hope that the review, especially the emotion-imbued choice model, helps organize promising developments for the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>An example of the affect-priming process.

For example, certainty and control are the central dimensions that distinguish anger from fear. Anger is associated with appraisals of certainty about what happened and individual control of negative events. Fear, by contrast, is associated with appraisals of uncertainty about what happened or what might happen and situational control of negative events. Like anger, happiness (although of positive valence) is associated with an elevated sense of certainty and individual control</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">Appraisal tendencies are conceptually similar to whatFrijda (1986, p. 70) calls "action tendencies." Whereas action tendencies are "states of readiness to execute a given kind of action," appraisal tendencies are the perceptual processes through which emotions color the interpretation of stimuli.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">Notably, some studies showed gender differences in such patterns-which may merit future research. In response to the terrorist attacks, males predominantly experienced more anger than fear whereas females showed the opposite pattern. In addition,<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ferrer et al. (2016)</ref> found that anger elicited in one situation carried over to drive risky behavior in financial decisions, but only among males and not females.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">Note that cognitive appraisal theorists would not predict a difference between the experiential qualities of emotions and the experiential qualities of patterns of appraisals. Future work in clarifying the feeling-is-for-doing model may demonstrate where the predictions differ.</note>
