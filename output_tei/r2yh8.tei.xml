			<abstract>
				<p>On June 23 rd 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union. The period leading up to the referendum was characterized by a significant volume of misinformation and disinformation. Existing literature has established the importance of cognitive ability in processing and discounting (mis/dis) information in decision making. We use a dataset of couples within households from a national representative UK survey to investigate the relationship between cognitive ability and the tendency to vote Leave / Remain in the 2016 UK referendum on European Union membership. We find that higher cognitive ability is strongly linked to a preference for Remain at the individual level, that partners cognitive ability influences the respondent&apos;s preferences and lastly, that having a cognitive ability advantage over one&apos;s partner increases the likelihood of voting Remain. An important question then becomes how to improve individual and household decision making in the face of increasingly unmanageable amounts of (mis/dis) information.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>On June 23 rd 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union in a seemingly simple 'Remain in the European Union / Leave the European Union' referendum 1 . Voter turnout was 72.2% of the electorate with 51.9% voting to <ref type="bibr">Leave and 48.1% voting to Remain (Electoral Commission, 2023)</ref>. The result is generally considered to have been a surprise with 10 Nobelprize winning economists making the case in the days leading up to the vote for Remaining in the EU <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asthana &amp; Treanor, 2016)</ref> and polling firms and bookmakers predicting the Remain side's win <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Becker, Fetzer &amp; Novy, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arnorsson &amp; Zoega, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alabrese, Becker, Fetzer, Novy, 2019)</ref>. On June 24 th 2016, the British Pound Sterling and FTSE markets suffered one of their largest single day losses, indicating that the referendum result was similarly a shock to the markets. Not surprisingly, the UK's withdrawal process from the EU has not been simple.</p><p>The UK formerly began the withdrawal process in March 2017 and completed the negotiation process in March 2019 at which point it entered the transition phase which came to an end in December 2020. At the time of writing, the Northern Ireland Protocol-which governs the unique trading relationship between Northern Ireland and Ireland-continues to be unresolved and a source of friction between the UK and EU. Over this complicated period, there have been suggestions that a substantial proportion of Leave supporters have since come to regret their vote <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Statista, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Keegan, 2023)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Given the surprise result alongside the economic and political significance of the UK leaving the EU, a substantial and growing academic literature has emerged which seeks to understand the referendum result by analyzing the correlation between voter socioeconomic, sociodemographic, and psychological characteristics and a vote to Leave or Remain <ref type="bibr">(Becker at al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arnorsson &amp; Zoega, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Garretsen, Stoker, Soudis, Martin &amp; Rentfrow, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alabrese et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast, the role of cognitive ability in explaining the referendum result has attracted little attention by academics. This is perhaps surprising given that the topic often arises in social media debates between Leave and Remain voters. Indeed, there are theoretical reasons to think that cognitive function may be associated with voting behavior in the referendum.</p><p>Firstly, there has been a burgeoning interest-largely as a consequence of the referendum and to some extent the U.S. elections in 2016-regarding individual vulnerability to misinformation and disinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pantazi, Hale &amp; Klein, 2021)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The proper functioning of democracies requires that citizens are well informed about the decisions at stake <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Banducci, Giebler &amp; Kritzinger, 2017)</ref>. Whilst political ignorance, or uninformedness may be harmlessas individual errors tend to cancel other out in the electorate <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Stimson, 2015)</ref>-political action based upon misinformation can lead to substantial decision errors, distorting the outcomes of electoral processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hochschild &amp; Einstein, 2015)</ref>. At the extreme, wide-spread misinformation can lead to collective preferences that are far different from those that would exist if people were correctly informed <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kuklinski, Quirk, Jerit, Schwieder &amp; Rich, 2000)</ref>. The information provided to the public, in the months leading up to the referendum on the UK's membership in the EU, has been characterized as contradictory, false, and often fraudulent.</p><p>This has been found to be especially true regarding the pro-Leave campaign <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Höller, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Simpson &amp; Startin)</ref>. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Höller (2021)</ref> found that misleading information was even shared by leading UK politicians, especially the politicians who were arguing the case for a vote to Leave the EU. In contrast, pro-Remain politicians analysed in Höller (2021) were found to stick more closely to the facts (although some of their points were found to be speculative).</p><p>Additionally, recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Simpson &amp; Startin (2023)</ref> examined the influential role that the British Tabloid Press (BTP) had in shaping the pro-Leave campaign. In a content analysis of BTP headlines leading up to the referendum, Startin &amp; Simpson (2023) categorise almost all of the headlines as 'Questionable' or 'Speculative' with respect to their interpretation of underlying evidence or lack thereof. Indeed, Partheymüller, Kritzinger and Plescia (2022) find that misinformedness is strongly associated with a preference to Leave the EU, while the wellinformed prefer to Remain. This is consistent with van Kessel, Sajuria and van Hauwaert (2020) who find that misinformedness is positively related to support for right-wing populist parties, and van Prooijen and Krouwel (2020) who find that low knowledge tends to predict anti-establishment voting. In addition to the evidence of significant misinformation, the pro-Leave campaign has also been found to have dominated the day-to-day volume of tweets by a factor of four-especially in the three weeks leading up to the vote <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauchowitz &amp; Hänska, 2017)</ref>. Whilst media outlets have always circulated some amounts of misleading information, the rise of social media and the internet has sharply increased the scale and accessibility of (mis/dis) information and of more divisive messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lazer et al., 2018)</ref>. As recently revealed by the whistleblower Frances Haugen, social media algorithms consciously privilege the most divisive content to amplify traffic on the networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fortunato &amp; Pecoraro, 2022)</ref>. This is consistent with the strong relationship between exposure to online political activity and Euroscepticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allcott &amp; Gentzkow, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Galston, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fortunato &amp; Pecoraro, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fortunato and Pecoraro (2022)</ref> this relationship was only evident amongst individuals with relatively low levels of education. The argument here is that education captures an individual's cultural capital, that is, the knowledge, skills and experience that are accumulated over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hainmueller &amp; Hiscox, 2007)</ref>. Those with low education and therefore low cultural capital are more likely to be receptive to divisive ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rydgren, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The literature on how cognitive function influences people's interaction with (mis/dis) information (see Pantazi, Hale and Klein 2021 for a review), suggests that higher cognitive ability and analytical thinking are linked to an increased propensity to detect and resist misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pennycook &amp; Rand, 2019</ref>. Those with lower cognitive ability are also found to be less likely to adjust their judgment after they learn that important information on which their initial evaluation was based is incorrect (De keersmaecker &amp; Roets, 2017) and are more susceptible to false memories arising from exposure to fabricated news stories <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Greene, Nash &amp; Murphy, 2021)</ref>. Specific to Brexit, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Greene, Nash and Murphy (2021)</ref> also show that individuals with better knowledge about the referendum showed better discrimination between true and false stories. Further empirical evidence on the link between false memories and cognition is provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Murphy et al. (2019)</ref> from the Irish abortion referendum. They find that those who reported voting in favor of legalizing abortion were more likely than "no" voters to "remember" a fabricated scandal about the campaign to vote "no", whilst "no" voters were more likely than "yes" voters to "remember" a fabricated scandal about the campaign to vote "yes." This relationship, where respondents formed false memories for fake news that aligned with their beliefs, was found to be particularly important for those lower in cognitive ability.</p><p>Cognitive function may also be associated with voting behavior in the referendum indirectly, that is, via a third variable. The standard omitted variable bias problem. Here, the literature points to two potential candidates. Firstly, there is reason to believe that cognitive ability is associated with voting behaviour through its correlation with personality traits. There is a growing literature on the relationship between the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism) and attitudes toward the EU (see for e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakker &amp; de Vreese, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nielsen, 2016)</ref>. More specifically with respect to the referendum, recent work has shown that Openness (to new experiences) is correlated with support for Remaining in the EU <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Garretsen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sumner et al., 2018)</ref> and</p><p>Conscientiousness with support for Leaving the EU <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sumner et al., 2018)</ref>. Here, Openness is relevant as it influences whether individuals see EU integration as an opportunity or threat.</p><p>Alongside this research, within social psychology there exists a broad literature on the relationship between cognitive ability and personality, with studies finding a positive relationship between general intelligence and Openness (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zeidner &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matthews, 2000 for a review and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">McCrae, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Curtis, Windsor &amp; Soubelet, 2015</ref>) and a negative relationship with Conscientiousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Moutafi, Furnham &amp; Paltiel, 2004)</ref>. Secondly, research has also found that lower cognitive ability predicted higher Right-Wing Authoritarian (RWA) scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Deary, Batty, &amp; Gale, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Heaven, Ciarrochi, &amp; Leeson, 2011</ref>) and a higher incidence of prejudice <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dhont &amp; Hodson, 2014)</ref>. Specific to the EU, support for Brexit and fear about the EU has also been associated with authoritarian and nationalistic orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sumner et al., 2018)</ref>, which has been found to be associated with less cognitive flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zmigrod, Rentfrow &amp; Robbins, 2018)</ref> and reduced strategic information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Zmigrod et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Using a nationally representative sample of 6,366 individuals from 3,183 heterosexual couples from the UK Understanding Society panel survey and controlling for a complete set of socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics motivated by the previous literature, we investigate the relationship between cognitive ability-as measured by a broad range of cognitive skills, including memory, verbal fluency, fluid reasoning and numerical reasoningand the propensity to vote Leave / Remain in the referendum. As our interest is in the direct relationship between cognitive ability and a vote to Leave / Remain as a function of processing referendum campaign (mis/dis) information, we include variables for the Big Five personality traits and political preferences to control for the potential indirect relationships discussed above. Our empirical strategy includes three parsimonious estimation techniques. In the first instance, treating individuals within couples as individual units, we estimate baseline coefficients for the impact of cognitive ability on voting behaviour. In the second stage of our analysis, we control for couple interdependence and couple characteristics on voting behaviour.</p><p>In the final stage, as our strictest test, we control for household fixed-effects, that is, restricting all variation to within couples. This final test is our most significant contribution to the literature. For instance, cognitive ability is likely to be associated with heterogeneous exposure to information sets and/or experiences of living in the UK which are both likely to be highly informative for individual political decision making. However, within couples these differences are likely to be equalized, and, in the spirit of assortative mating, individuals within couples are likely to be similar to each other in other unobservable ways. Across all models, we find statistically, and economically significant evidence that those with higher cognitive ability (and higher cognitive ability partners) are associated with a large increase in their propensity to vote Remain.</p><p>Two other papers look at the relationship between cognitive ability and the referendum on the EU. In Sumner et al., <ref type="formula">(2018) 5</ref>, who use a sample of participants recruited from Facebook advertising, they find that those who intended to vote leave in the referendum had lower levels of numeracy. Carl (2018) also focuses on voting intentions and finds a small positive correlation between average IQ and four measures of political attitudes (including voting intention in the referendum) at both the UK regional and local authority level. Our paper is therefore the first, as far as we are aware, to focus on the relationship between individuals' cognitive ability and actual voting behaviour in the referendum. Our paper is further distinguished from Carl (2018) which uses aggregate level data and is therefore potentially subject to the concern of ecological fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Becker et al. 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data and descriptive statistics</head><p>To understand the correlation between voting behavior in the referendum and cognitive ability, we use data from Understanding Society (USoc) 2009 to 2020 (Waves 1-12). USoc is a British, nationally representative annual longitudinal survey of approximately 40,000 households, funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The survey instrument is a questionnaire involving a household section and individual sections, which cover a broad range of subjects including labor market activity, household dynamics, attitudes and opinions, amongst others. The analytic sample includes data from all households in which there was a heterosexual couple and who both gave valid responses to the dependent, independent and control variables used in the subsequent analysis. This yields a final analytic sample of 6,366 individual respondents from 3,183 heterosexual couples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.1.Dependent variable</head><p>In Waves 10, 11 and 12 of USoc, participants were asked: "Did you vote in the EU referendum held on June 23rd, 2016?". Participants who reported voting were then asked: "How did you vote?" [Remain a member of the European Union; Leave the European Union].</p><p>Some respondents were asked this question in multiple Waves; for these people we recorded their first given response. 6 Across the sample, 56.6% of our sample report voting to Remain in the EU. This is moderately higher than the outcome of the referendum on the EU (i.e., 48.11% to Remain). Responses within couples were highly correlated, with 85.5% of couples voting in the same direction in the referendum. This highlights the importance of using an analytic technique which can account for the relationship between respondent and partner responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.Cognitive ability</head><p>In Wave 3 of USoc, prior to the referendum held on June 23rd, 2016, cognitive function measures were collected through five cognitive tasks. The first task assessed respondents' memory, using an immediate and delayed word recall task. In short, participants were read a series of 10 words and were then asked to recall (immediately afterwards and then again later in the interview) as many words as possible, in any order. The scores from the immediate and delayed word recall task are then summed together resulting in a measure of cognitive function which we refer to as 'Word Recall'. The second task assessed semantic verbal fluency, where participants were given one minute to name as many animals as possible. The final score on this item is based upon the number of unique correct responses. This provides us with another measure of cognitive function which we refer to as 'Verbal Fluency'. The third task assessed <ref type="bibr">6</ref> A small sample of individuals report inconsistent responses to the question on voting behaviour in the referendum across the three Waves of data (i.e., Waves 10, 11 and 12). As a robustness check we delete these individuals from the sample. Our results with this slightly smaller sample are quantitively and qualitatively similar to our main analysis. respondents' working memory. Here, participants were asked to give the correct answer to a series of subtraction questions. There is a sequence of five subtractions, which started with the interviewer asking the respondent to subtract 7 from 100. The respondent is then asked to subtract 7 again, and so on. The number of correct responses out of a maximum of five was recorded, giving us a measure of cognitive function, referred to here as 'Subtraction Test'. The fourth task assessed respondents' fluid reasoning where participants were asked to write down a number sequence-as read by the interviewer-which consists of several numbers with a blank number in the series. The respondent is asked which number goes in the blank.</p><p>Participants were given two sets of three number sequences, where performance in the first set dictated the difficulty of the second set. The final score is based on the correct responses from the two sets of questions-whilst accounting for the difficulty level of the second set of problems-giving us a measure of cognitive function, 'Fluid Reasoning'. The final task assessed practical numerical knowledge. Participants were asked up to five questions that were graded in complexity. The type of questions asked included: "In a sale, a shop is selling all items at half price. Before the sale, a sofa costs £300. How much will it cost in the sale?" and "Let's say you have £200 in a savings account. The account earns ten percent interest each year.</p><p>How much would you have in the account at the end of two years?". Based on performance on the first three items, participants are then asked either two additional (more difficult) questions or one additional (simpler) question. The final score is a count measure based on the number of correct responses. This provides us with our final measure of cognitive function referred to as 'Numerical Reasoning'. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> For the analysis that follows, we residualized the individual scores from each of the five cognitive tasks scores on a third-order polynomial of age. The procedure is necessary as cognitive function is highly dependent on age <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Whitley et al., 2016)</ref>    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.3.Control variables</head><p>There are many factors that may predict voting behavior in the referendum. We included a comprehensive set of controls that were measured in Wave 6 of USoc, just prior to the referendum. These controls included age (in cubic form); gender; ethnicity, education; labour force status; interview mode; the number of sources used for information about news and current affairs; type of newspapers used for information about news and current affairs; political party supports/most aligned to; self-assessed general health; whether the respondent suffers from long-term health problems; personality traits-openness, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness-measured using the short 15-item Big-Five inventory (BFI-15); the logarithm of deflated household income (adjusted by the OECDmodified equivalence scale); marital status; the number of dependent children in the household; the square root of household size; housing tenure; whether the respondent is the household financial decision maker; whether the respondent lives in an urban location as well as a set of region of residence dummy variables. These factors have been shown to be strong predictors of voting behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Becker et al, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arnorsson &amp; Zoega, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alabrese et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Simpson &amp; Startin, 2023)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Empirical analysis and results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1.Main results</head><p>To determine our baseline estimated relationship between cognitive ability and voting behavior in the referendum, we treat our 6,366 individuals within 3,183 couples as individual units. As the dependent variable is binary, we estimate a pooled logistic regression, where we include as a key predictor our composite measure of cognitive function, 'Cognitive Ability', whilst controlling for our full set of control variables. Whilst our primary interest is our composite measure of cognitive ability, we also estimate separately the relationship between scores on each of the five cognitive function tasks and voting behaviour, as certain aspects of cognitive function may be more important than others in explaining voting behaviour. All cognitive function measures in the analysis that follows were standardized to ease interpretation of effect sizes. Column 1 of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> reports the estimated coefficients. We report marginal effects and t-statistics, where the standard errors are clustered to control for intra household correlation. The standardized composite measure of cognitive function and the standardized scores on each of the five cognitive tasks are all highly correlated with voting to Remain a member of the EU. These effects are not small; for instance, a one-unit standard deviation increase in 'Cognitive Ability' increases the likelihood of voting to Remain a member of the EU by 8.5 percentage points. Relative to the mean level of voting Remain in the sample, this relates to an increase of approximately 15%. It is also important to note, all aspects of cognitive function were separately important for voting behaviour in the referendum.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated whether the estimated coefficients presented in Column 1 were similar when we expanded our sample to include all respondents who were not part of a couple.</p><p>This expands the sample size to 9,879 respondents. Here, the results are almost identical to those presented in Column 1, suggesting that there is nothing statistically unusual about our subsample of heterosexual couples.</p><p>We then repeat the analysis but now our focus is on the relationship between cognitive ability and voting behavior conditional on household effects. Initially, to account for the interdependence between members of a couple, we constructed multilevel logistic models (analogous to random-effects estimation) to estimate the actor-partner interdependence model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kenny, 1996)</ref>. Here, the model treats the actor as the Level 1 unit and the couple as the Level 2 unit. Second, using the actor-partner interdependence model, we also estimated the extent to which spouses' cognitive ability predicted actors' voting behaviour above and beyond the actor effects. The estimated coefficients from these procedures are reported in Column's 2 and 3 of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, respectively. We again report marginal effects and t-statistics, where the standard errors are clustered to control for intra household correlation. The results presented in Column 2 confirm our baseline estimates. The marginal effects are slightly smaller than those presented in Column 1; however, the effect sizes are still large and economically significant. In Column 3, we also find that partner cognitive ability predicted voting behaviour of the actor. For instance, a one-unit standard deviation increase in partner's 'Cognitive Ability' increases the likelihood of the actor voting to Remain a member of the EU by 6.7 percentage points.</p><p>Whilst the previous multilevel strategies control for household random-effects, our third and final strategy controls for household fixed-effects. Specifically, using a conditional (fixed-effect) logistic estimator, we focus on the 926 respondents, from 463 couples where the actor and partner voted in a conflicting manner. This approach allows us to estimate the relationship between cognitive ability and voting behaviour purely from the variation that occurs within households. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> we plotted a histogram of actor-partner differences in 'Cognitive Ability' to illustrate the substantial identifying variation for this final estimation approach, where the actor and partner voted in a conflicting manner. In the context of voting behaviour and cognitive ability, the introduction of household fixed-effects is important. For instance, it enables us to control for the possibility that variation in cognitive ability is strongly correlated with heterogeneous experiences of living in the UK, such as living in a neighbourhood with a high concentration of EU migrants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abreu &amp; Öner, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ivlevs &amp; Veliziotis, 2018)</ref>, which may be important for voting behaviour. More than this, variation in cognitive ability may also be strongly correlated with heterogeneous exposure to misinformation and disinformation, which has been shown to be correlated with voting behaviour in the referendum <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Partheymüller, Kritzinger &amp; Plescia, 2022)</ref>. However, individuals within couples are likely to share and debate their information sets, and therefore by controlling for household fixed-effects we can control for information (dis)advantages. In short, we compare the effects of cognitive ability on voting behaviour for individuals exposed to the same contextual factors and information sets. Household variation in cognitive ability and voting behaviour is therefore likely to expose variation in how individuals process information sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pennycook &amp; Rand, 2019</ref> and interact and interpret their geographical context <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abreu &amp; Öner, 2020)</ref>. Column 4 of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> reports the estimated coefficients of this procedure. We report average semi-elasticities for our conditional (fixed-effect) logistic approach and t-statistics, where the standard errors are clustered to control for intra household correlation. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Our results continue to hold. For instance, a one standard deviation 'Cognitive Ability' advantage over one's spouse increases the likelihood of voting to Remain in the EU by 17%. Whilst the memory task, 'Word Recall', 'Verbal Fluency' and the 'Subtraction Test' measures of cognitive function are no longer statistically significant at the conventional levels, we find highly statistically significant effects for the other measures of cognitive function. That is, 'Numerical Reasoning'-processing numerical patterns logically-and 'Fluid Reasoning' which measures the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations.</p><p>We briefly describe other significant Remain effects, revealed in the other covariate coefficient estimates that are incidental to the main themes of the paper. These full covariate estimates are reported in <ref type="table">Table S2</ref> in the Supplemental material. Most notably, from Column 1 and relative to not being a political supporter, supporting Labour, Greens and other liberal political parties increases the chances of voting Remain by 21.2, 19.3 and 25.2 percentage points, respectively. Conversely, and consistent with the previous literature, supporting nationalist parties reduced the probability of voting Remain by 24 percentage points <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zmigrod et al. 2018)</ref>. These results were robust to the inclusion of household fixed-effects (Column 4 of <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>). The newspapers people use for their information about news and current affairs, consistent with previous research, also had a large effect on voting behavior as evidenced in Column 1 of <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Simpson &amp; Startin, 2023)</ref>. Specifically, relative to those who don't read newspapers, the tabloid newspapers-regarded as sensationalist outlets-reduced the probability of voting Remain by between 14 and 20 percentage points, depending on the type of tabloid newspaper. Consistent with the previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hobolt, 2016)</ref>, higher levels of education are associated with an increased likelihood of voting Remain. In Column 1 of <ref type="table">Table   S2</ref>-and to put the effect size of education in the context of cognitive ability-a movement in cognitive ability from minus to plus one standard from the mean has the same effect on the probability of voting Remain as having a University or College degree relative to having no formal education. In short, both education and cognitive ability mattered for the referendum result.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper, using nationally representative data and a barrage of control variables, assessed the link between cognitive function and voting behavior in the referendum. Three key findings are produced. Firstly, cognitive ability mattered for voting behavior in the UK's 2016 referendum on its membership in the EU. Secondly, couples within households are highly interdependent, so much so, that spouse's cognitive ability is found to be strongly related to  Taken together, these findings challenge the ideas that political behaviours are solely a function of socioeconomic issues. The idea that cognitive ability mattered for the referendum is consistent with the literature on cognitive ability and vulnerability to (mis/dis) information.</p><p>It is suggestive that erroneous reporting surrounding the referendum might have complicated personal decision making, especially for those with low cognitive ability. It is also possible that those with lower levels of cognitive ability-rather than just lower levels of education-are more receptive to divisive ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rydgren, 2007)</ref> or that that those lower in cognitive ability had less knowledge about the referendum which tends to predict anti-establishment voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(van Prooijen &amp; Krouwel, 2020)</ref>. These ideas, taken together, do present some future challenges, most noticeably, how to improve decision making in the face of increasingly unmanageable amounts of (mis/dis) information, and more generally, the impact of (mis/dis) information on democratic processes. Of course, political action based upon misinformation can lead to substantial decision errors, distorting the outcomes of electoral processes by the 'active misinformed' <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hochschild &amp; Einstein, 2015)</ref>. If those lower in cognitively ability are more vulnerable to misinformation, then political campaigns based on (mis/dis) information may prevail depending on the ability distribution of the electorate.</p><p>It is possible the adverse effects of misinformation may be mitigated by those with lower cognitive ability having a lower propensity to turnout and vote <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Denny &amp; Doyle, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>However, in unreported results, we fail to find evidence of a significant relationship between cognitive function and the likelihood of voting in the referendum on the EU. This may be influenced in some way by the particularly high voter turnout-72.2% of the electorate. This</p><p>gives the rather severe option to democratic countries-who often limit or deny the voting rights of its citizens based upon cognitive impairments (Barclay, 2013)-of restricting voting based on cognitive function. Perhaps though, a less severe restriction, especially when it comes to complex decisions like EU membership, is leaving it to the experts.</p><p>Lastly, there are, however, some limitations to our study. Most noticeably, the positive correlation between cognitive ability and voting to Remain in the referendum could, as always, be explained by omitted variable bias. Although we control for political beliefs and alliances, personality traits, a barrage of other socioeconomics factors and in our preferred model, household fixed-effects, the variation of cognitive ability within households could be correlated with other unobservable traits, attitudes and behaviours. The example which comes to mind is an individual's trust in politicians and government. Then Prime Minister of the UK David Cameron publicly declared his support for remining in the EU, as did the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The UK Treasury published an analysis to warn voters that the UK would be permanently poorer if it left the EU (2016). In addition to this were the 10 Nobel-prize winning economists making the case in the days leading up to the referendum. Whilst cognitive ability has been linked with thinking like an economist <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Caplan &amp; Miller, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caplan, 2011)</ref>, Carl (2018) also finds evidence of a moderate positive correlation between trust in experts and IQ.</p><p>Moreover, work on political attitudes and the referendum have shown that a lack of trust in politicians and the government is associated with a vote to leave the EU <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hobolt, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the positive relationship between cognitive ability and voting Remain could be attributable for those higher in cognitive function to place a greater weight on the opinion of experts. A final note is that our dependent variable is self-reported which may induce bias, for instance, social desirability bias. Against that, the majority (75.6%) of responses were recorded through a self-completion online survey and we do control for interview mode, which produces no statistically significant effects. </p></div>

This composite measure standardizes and then combines the residualized scores from each of the five cognitive tasks. The level of internal consistency across the five items appears to be high: Cronbach's alpha is 0.71. Scores of 'Cognitive Ability' within couples were moderately correlated ( = 0.317, &lt; 0.001).</figDesc></figure>

This is important as research typically considers political behaviour as an individual-level variable and has largely ignored the role of partners in shaping behaviour. Thirdly, when individuals within couples vote in a conflicting manner, cognitive ability remains an important factor in explaining referendum voting behavior. Specifically, having a one standard deviation cognitive ability advantage over one's spouse increases the likelihood of voting to Remain in the EU by 17%. Across all econometric models, this relationship is in large, driven by the lowest deciles of the cognitive ability distribution.</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">For completeness, we acknowledge the literature on cognitive ability and behavioural biases which provides empirical support to the complementary idea that those with lower cognitive ability are more likely to succumb to judgemental biases when making decisions<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Stanovich &amp; West, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bruine de Bruin, Parker &amp; Fischhoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Oechssler, Roider &amp; Schmitz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999)</ref>. In this view, Sumner et al., (2018) using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)-which measures analytical thinking and the propensity to reflect on and override intuitive (but incorrect) solutions-find that Leave voters were the most reliant on System 1 thinkingthe fast, automatic, unconscious, and emotional decision system-rather than System 2 thinking-the analytical, deliberate and rational decision system. Indeed, for the substantial proportion of Leave supporters that have since come to regret their vote, the vote to Leave may be classified as a decision error.</note>
