<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In many domains in the social sciences and particularly in psychology, participants provide responses to questions for which correct answers are not known or not defined.</p><p>For instance, researchers may elicit probability judgments of future events <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders et al., 2014)</ref> or ask whether one agrees or disagrees with a set of statements about a certain topic such as beliefs about the contagiousness of AIDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Trotter et al., 1999)</ref>. Cultural consensus theory (CCT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Romney et al., 1986</ref>) is a method for aggregating the responses from several informants to estimate the shared knowledge of a group. Essentially, the model infers the latent cultural consensus of a group while considering variance both in the competence of informants and in the difficulty of items. This is achieved by assuming that the experts in a domain are those informants who provide "correct answers' ' in the sense that their responses consistently reflect the shared cultural beliefs.</p><p>The fact that normatively correct answers are unknown complicates the aggregation of informants' responses because it is not clear which of the informants are most competent in the sense that they provide judgments close to the unknown cultural truth. As a remedy, CCT allows researchers to infer the latent cultural truth as well as the competence of each informant simultaneously. The main principle of CCT is that informants with more cultural knowledge are likely to show similar answer patterns across the set of questions asked because their judgments consistently reflect the shared cultural truth <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Romney et al., 1986)</ref>. Based on the correlation of the observed answer patterns, the method jointly estimates the cultural truth at the group level and the informants' competence at the individual level. This requires that multiple informants provide judgments to a set of items from the same knowledge domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Weller, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Applications and Extensions of Cultural Consensus Theory</head><p>CCT was first developed in anthropological research for questionnaires about cultural topics with a dichotomous response format <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Romney et al., 1986)</ref> and has also been described as "test theory without an answer key" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Batchelder &amp; Romney, 1988)</ref>. For CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL <ref type="bibr">LOCATION JUDGMENTS 5</ref> instance, one of the first applications investigated the intracultural variability of beliefs about whether illnesses are contagious <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Romney et al., 1986)</ref>. The method has since been applied in various contexts such as aggregating eyewitness reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Waubert de Puiseau et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Waubert de Puiseau et al., 2012)</ref>, obtaining forecasts for various events <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Merkle et al., 2020)</ref>, or estimating social networks where individuals provide information about social relations among different people <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Batchelder et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Batchelder, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The original version of CCT was applicable only to dichotomous data and assumed that all informants belong to a single shared cultural truth. As it may be possible that not all informants share a common consensus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anders and Batchelder (2012)</ref> extended CCT to multiple cultural truths (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Aßfalg &amp; Klauer, 2020)</ref>. Essentially, such extended models assume that informants belong to separate latent classes which differ with respect to the assumed cultural truth. For instance, medical professionals and lay people may differ with respect to medical beliefs resulting in two cultural truths which are latent if group membership is unknown.</p><p>CCT has also been extended to response formats other than binary answers.</p><p>Extensions have been developed for continuous data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders et al., 2014;</ref>, ordinal responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anders &amp; Batchelder, 2015)</ref>, and mixed response formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Aßfalg, 2018)</ref> in order to aggregate ratings about the grammatical acceptability of English phrases or to measure shared beliefs about the importance of various health behaviors. Statistical inference for such extended CCT models has often relied on hierarchical Bayesian modeling in which parameter estimates are obtained via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Aßfalg &amp; Klauer, 2020)</ref>. Overall, these extensions have enabled researchers to adapt the CCT approach to various types of data while assuming a certain structure of cultural truths underlying informants' answers.</p><p>CCT is also applicable to scenarios in which correct answers are not known during the time of data collection but may become available later. Such forecasting applications CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 6</p><p>are especially interesting because the performance of different aggregation methods including CCT can be directly compared against each other once the correct answers become available. If factually correct answers are available, it is also possible to check whether the expertise estimates of CCT correlate with the accuracy scores of individuals.</p><p>In judgment and decision making, it is well known that the aggregation of independent individual judgments (e.g., by computing an unweighted average) results in highly accurate group estimates, a phenomenon referred to as wisdom of crowds <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hueffer et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Larrick &amp; Soll, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Steyvers et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Surowiecki, 2005)</ref>. This high level of accuracy across various tasks and contexts is surprising given that all judgments are weighted equally without considering informants' competence (or incompetence)</p><p>regarding the domain of interest.</p><p>The accuracy of wisdom of crowds can be improved by weighing individual judgments by the expertise of informants. For instance, Budescu and Chen (2015) relied on prior judgments of participants to estimate the competence of each individual relative to the crowd. Using the estimated expertise as weights improved the accuracy of the aggregate estimates. CCT also weighs judgments by expertise, but it does not rely on informants' performance on previous items. Instead, CCT relies on a statistical model to simultaneously estimate individuals' expertise while using these estimates as weights for the aggregation of judgments. With respect to forecasting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Merkle et al. (2020)</ref> showed that such a CCT-inspired aggregation mechanism does indeed outperform unweighted averaging. Similarly, the accuracy of aggregated eyewitness testimonies increases when using a CCT model since it infers the witnesses' competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Waubert de Puiseau et al., 2017)</ref>. Overall, CCT is thus a useful tool for the aggregation of judgments when the ground truth becomes available only at a later time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Geographical Data and Location Judgments</head><p>CCT has been adapted to several types of response formats and applications, but an extension for two-or higher-dimensional judgments has not been developed yet. One important type of two-dimensional continuous data are geographical judgments which CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 7</p><p>arise whenever individuals locate sites on a map (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Friedman, Kerkman, et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mayer &amp; Heck, 2022)</ref>. In such scenarios, the actual locations are usually unknown to the informants, either because of a lack of precise knowledge (e.g., for cities) or because there is no factually "correct' ' location (e.g., when asking for preferences or beliefs). Extending CCT to location judgments provides a principled method of inferring the common consensus of a group about the location of the sites of interest.</p><p>A CCT model for two-dimensional location judgments can be beneficial in various contexts and tasks, both in psychology and beyond. First, CCT is a useful tool for aggregating subjective judgments even when the actual locations of sites can in principle be known. For instance, Friedman and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Friedman et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Friedman et al., , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Friedman, Kerkman, et al., 2002)</ref> examined the role of individuals' place of residence on their geographical knowledge and representation.</p><p>Several studies showed that there are considerable differences in location judgments for individuals living in Canada, Mexico, and the United States when it comes to locating cities in all three countries. However, participants in these studies only provided one-dimensional judgments of the latitude of cities as this facilitated the statistical</p><p>analysis. An extended CCT model for two-dimensional continuous data would allow researchers to collect and aggregate location judgments with respect to both latitude and longitude. Moreover, a CCT model could be used to explain variance in judgments by informants' expertise, or to compare model-based location estimates between different manifest groups or cultures. Note that location judgments of cities have also been used to compare the performance of different approaches of judgment aggregation in online collaborative projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mayer &amp; Heck, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Second, an extension of CCT for two-dimensional continuous data is especially useful for the aggregation of individual location judgments when the factually correct or optimal locations are unknown. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Surowiecki (2005)</ref> describes how a lost submarine was found by aggregating the judgments of experts on its most likely location.</p><p>Similar applications are in principle possible when selecting optimal locations for CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 8 park-and-ride facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Faghri et al., 2002)</ref>, suitable areas for ecotourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mahdavi et al., 2015)</ref>, or uncovering ancient archaeological sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Casana, 2014)</ref> and natural resources (e.g., water harvesting sites, Al-shabeeb, 2016). However, a statistical aggregation of location judgments based on CCT is only applicable in scenarios where several informants provide location judgments for multiple sites. If these requirements are met, CCT is ideally suited to infer the shared, common consensus about the unknown locations.</p><p>In the following, we develop a new CCT model for two-dimensional location judgments based on <ref type="bibr">Anders et al.'s (2014)</ref> CCT model for one-dimensional continuous responses. We check the validity and performance of the proposed CCT model and its</p><p>Bayesian implementation in JAGS <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Plummer, 2003)</ref> by investigating parameter convergence and recovery in a Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, we use simulations to examine under which conditions the weighting of judgments by individuals' competence improves the accuracy of location estimates at the group level. Empirically, we apply the new model to reanalyze location judgments of European cities on maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mayer &amp; Heck, 2022</ref>) and compare the accuracy of the aggregate location estimates to those obtained with unweighted averaging. Thereby, our work contributes to prior research showing that wisdom of crowds can be improved by weighing judgments by expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Budescu &amp; Chen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Merkle et al., 2020)</ref>. Overall, the results of our simulation studies and the empirical reanalysis show that the weighting of individual location judgments by informants' competence improves estimation accuracy of CCT compared to weighting all judgments equally.</p><p>The proposed extension of CCT for two-dimensional continuous responses is specifically tailored to geographical data where informants provide location judgments.</p><p>Of course, two-dimensional continuous data are also collected in other tasks and contexts in psychology. For instance, participants may have to rate items with respect to two features such as the valence and arousal of images <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Funke &amp; Reips, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Reips &amp; Funke, 2008)</ref> or facial images for their attractiveness and trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008)</ref>. The proposed CCT model may not be directly applicable to such data because of CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 9 certain assumptions that are specific to location judgments (e.g., assumptions about the dimensionality of informants' competence or the correlation of errors across dimensions).</p><p>In the Discussion, we elaborate on how the model can be adapted to multidimensional, continuous judgments in other tasks and contexts besides location judgments.</p><p>2 Model extension for two-dimensional continuous responses</p></div>

Similar to all CCT models, the new model requires that multiple informants provide location judgments for a set of items from the same competence domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Weller, 2007)</ref>. For instance, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure   1A</ref>, several informants could be asked to locate different European cities such as London on geographic maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mayer &amp; Heck, 2022)</ref>. Locations can be measured in different units depending on the application. For instance, one may use pixels of the presented image as in our empirical study below or geographical coordinates such as longitude and latitude, but other two-dimensional judgments are also feasible.</p><p>CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 10</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Model specification</head><p>The CCT model for two-dimensional judgments (CCT-2D) assumes that all respondents share a single latent cultural truth T k for each item k. In our empirical example, the latent-truth parameters refer to the group's consensus knowledge about the location of London and other European cities on a map. Note that our example concerns a case where the true locations are in principle available, but of course, the model also applies to scenarios in which this is not the case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 11</head><p>As displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>, we assume that the observed judgments Y ik can be modeled by two additive components, the shared cultural truth and an unsystematic judgment error,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y ik = T k + ε ik .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This additive structure of a true score and an error term is very common for CCT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders et al., 2014;</ref> and can also be found in classical test theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lord et al., 1968)</ref>. Similar to other CCT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders et al., 2014)</ref> and item response theory in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Embretson &amp; Reise, 2000)</ref>, we assume that the errors ε ik are conditionally independent given the informant competence E i and the item difficulty λ k .</p><p>Conditional independence of errors means that judgment errors are assumed to be uncorrelated once competence and difficulty are accounted for by the model, whereas errors may still be correlated when ignoring the clustering by person and item. Moreover, since judgments are continuous, we assume a bivariate normal distribution of errors,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(ε ik | E i , λ k ) iid ∼ MV-Normal (µ = 0, Σ = Σ ik ) .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The covariance matrix Σ ik of judgment errors is modeled as a function of informant competence and item difficulty. The error variances in the x-and y-direction (i.e., the diagonal elements of Σ ik ) are assumed to be smaller for persons with higher cultural competence and for items that are easier, meaning that in such cases the observed judgments are closer to the cultural truth. For instance, when asked to locate cities in the United Kingdom, informants with high competence will position these cities closer to the shared cultural knowledge about the location. Formally, this idea is implemented by defining the person competence E i and the item difficulty λ kd as multiplicative factors which jointly determine the standard deviation of informants' judgments around the cultural truth in the d-th dimension,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">σ ikd = E i λ kd<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Essentially, smaller values of E i reflect a higher competence since judgments are closer to CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 12 the cultural truth. 1 <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref> illustrates how the parameter E i affects the variance of the distribution of errors. Since cultural competence is modeled as a multiplicative factor affecting the standard deviation, the parameter E i is restricted to be positive (E i &gt; 0).</p><p>Recent versions of CCT (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anders et al., 2014)</ref> also assume that items vary in difficulty such that more difficult items result in a larger variance of judgments around the cultural truth. For the present case of location judgments, we define a vector-valued item-difficulty parameter λ k for each item with two components λ k1 &gt; 0 and λ k2 &gt; 0 for the x-and y-dimension, respectively. We model the difficulty of each item with two instead of only one value because the x-and y-dimension may differ in difficulty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Model assumptions specific to location judgments</head><p>Two-dimensional location judgments have some unique features which require special consideration in model development. Imagine that informants are asked to locate London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, and Dublin on a map of the United Kingdom and Ireland similar to <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>. The CCT-2D model outlined above accounts for such two-dimensional continuous responses by assuming that all informants answer according to the same underlying cultural truth. Here, the latent truth T k refers to the group's shared knowledge about the positions of city k on the map. The model assumes that the location judgments of an informant are closer or further away from the shared consensus knowledge depending on their competence level. Importantly, the parameter E i refers to the general competence of an informant irrespective of the x-or y-direction. Hence, when an informant knows that London is located in the south of the United Kingdom, it is also likely that they know whether it is located more to the west or to the east. This restriction simplifies the interpretation of the competency parameter E i as a one-dimensional trait or construct.</p><p>Whereas competence is modeled as a one-dimensional parameter, the model assumes that each item has separate and possibly different difficulties λ k1 and λ k2 in the CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 13</p><p>x-and y-direction, respectively. Due to geographical features of a map such as borders, lakes, coasts, or other anchor points, informants may be naturally restricted in positioning a site in the vertical direction but not in the horizontal direction or vice versa. For instance, when positioning Liverpool and Dublin, informants are limited by the coastline to the West and the East, respectively, which may in turn result in a reduced variance of judgments in the x-direction (longitude) compared to the y-direction (latitude).</p><p>More generally, certain features of geographic maps such as coastlines may also lead to spatially correlated errors of location judgments. For instance, a positive correlation may emerge when positioning cities on a map which are closely located to a "diagonal" coastline (e.g., Aberdeen which is located close to a coast going from South-West to North-East). In other cases, however, informants are not restricted by nearby coasts (e.g., Birmingham), meaning that judgment errors in x-and y-direction may be uncorrelated. Overall, these considerations lead us to allow for a stochastic dependence of the judgment errors ε ik1 and ε ik2 in the x-and y-direction, respectively.</p><p>We thus assume that, for each item k, the normally-distributed errors may correlate between the two dimensions with correlation ρ k (as illustrated by the tilted red ellipses in <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>). This results in the following covariance matrix of the two-dimensional judgment errors in Equation 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Σ ik =     (E i λ k1 ) 2 ρ k E 2 i λ k1 λ k2 ρ k E 2 i λ k1 λ k2 (E i λ k2 ) 2     .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Hence, the errors may be correlated between the two dimensions within each item for each informant, which does, however, not imply that the errors are correlated across items or informants. Therefore, the CCT-2D model still satisfies the conditional-independence assumption with respect to the two-dimensional vector of errors ε ik .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Model simplifications</head><p>Compared to the CCT model for one-dimensional continuous data developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anders et al. (2014)</ref>, we simplified the CCT-2D model for two-dimensional judgments with respect to several aspects. First, we do not assume multiple cultural truths. In our example of positioning cities on a map of the United Kingdom and Ireland, multiple CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 14 cultural truths would imply that there are two or more latent classes of informants with each group having a different consensus of where the cities are located . When inferring the position of unknown locations such as natural resources, missing victims, or ancient archaeological sites, we assume that informants often use similar information and background knowledge to form their judgment. Thus, a multimodal distribution of distinct patterns of location judgments is possible but rather unlikely. In other scenarios such as the city-location task, a single correct position on the map does exist but is not available to the informants. In such cases, CCT is most useful when it provides a single, competence-weighted group-level estimate for each item which can then be compared to the accuracy of other aggregation approaches such as unweighted averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Merkle et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Waubert de Puiseau et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we do not consider systematic biases of location judgments which were included in the model by Anders et al. <ref type="formula">2014</ref> individual bias shifting all location judgments in a certain direction by a fixed distance (e.g., horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). However, such a general shift of location judgments for all sites of interest seems to be unlikely given that certain cues provided by the map (e.g., borders, coasts, or other geographic features) constrain the possible responses for each item in a different way. For instance, when positioning cities on a map of the United Kingdom and Ireland, a bias to the east would simply result in slightly biased judgments for some cities (e.g. London, Birmingham, and Manchester) but to judgments located in the ocean for others (e.g., Glasgow and Dublin). Hence, the CCT-2D model does not assume a shifting response bias.</p><p>The CCT-2D model does also not assume a scaling response bias. For one-dimensional continuous data, a scaling bias refers to a multiplicative bias (i.e., a CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 15 "stretching factor") for each informant which is assumed to affect the judgments for all items <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders et al., 2014)</ref>. Thereby, the model accounts for the fact that individuals differ in their preference for providing extreme judgments at the lower or upper end of the response scale (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Plieninger &amp; Heck, 2018)</ref>. For location judgments, a scaling bias would imply that informants' judgments are scaled by a multiplicative factor on each axis and for all items. The effect of such a bias depends on the location of the origin of the coordinate system since judgments closer to the origin are less affected by a multiplicative factor compared to judgments further away. However, whereas the midpoint corresponds to a natural origin for one-dimensional judgments on a continuous response scale, location judgments on a map do not necessarily have a natural origin. This is due to the fact that location judgments can simply be rescaled by choosing a different origin (i.e., by defining that the vector (0, 0) corresponds to the lower left corner of the map, the center of the map, or the center of the geographical region of interest). Since we do not have any theoretical or empirical justification for a specific type of scaling bias, we did not implement such a bias in the CCT-2D model for location judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Hierarchical Bayesian modeling</head><p>To fit the CCT-2D model to data and estimate its parameters, we adopt the hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anders et al. (2014)</ref>. Hierarchical modeling allows researchers to specify a population distribution for a set of model parameters such as person abilities or item difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lee &amp; Wagenmakers, 2014)</ref>. This provides many benefits such as a partial pooling of the information between the individual and the group level, which in turn results in shrinkage of the estimates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Heck, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Singmann &amp; Kellen, 2019)</ref>. In our case, we assume separate population distributions of the competence parameters E i across informants and of the item difficulty parameters λ k across items Besides specifying hierarchical distributions, the Bayesian framework also requires to define prior distributions. In the following, we adopt the common notation of distributions of the software JAGS <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Plummer, 2003)</ref> which is used to fit the CCT-2D model below. The normal distribution is thus not parameterized by the mean µ and the CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 16 standard deviation σ, but rather by the mean µ and the precision parameter τ = 1/σ 2 (i.e., the inverse of the variance). Similarly, for the t distribution, the second parameter refers to the precision and not to the scale parameter.</p><p>Often, normal distributions are assumed as hierarchical group-level distributions.</p><p>Concerning the latent truth for each item k, we assume that the cultural truth coordinates T kd (with dimension index d = 1, 2) are located on the real line and are normally distributed across items,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T kd ∼ Normal(µ = µ T,d , τ = τ T,d ).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In contrast, the parameters E i and λ kd are constrained to be positive.

Since we are not interested in testing hypotheses with theoretically informed prior distributions (e.g., via Bayes factors, Heck et al., 2022), we rely on default prior distributions that are only weakly informative. Nevertheless, for some parameters such as the cultural-truth locations, it is important that the scaling of the priors aligns with that of the judgments Y ik . In our simulation, this was ensured by selecting data-generating parameters in the range of the default prior distributions. In our empirical example, we first standardized all judgments in order to align the data with the default priors.</p></div>

However, correlations of data-generating and estimated parameters of log λ kd and log E i were more strongly affected by varying levels of N and M respectively with correlations just above .80 for both parameters.

However, increasing sample size was more beneficial for unweighted averaging than for CCT estimates. Furthermore, estimates obtained with unweighted averaging became worse the larger the variance in informants' competence became. This was expected since increasing the heterogeneity of informants' competence yields larger variation in judgments, which in turn results in larger Euclidean distances to the correct position. The CCT model accounts and corrects for this additional variance in the observed location judgments, thereby resulting in a better recovery of the latent truth.</p><p>Even in the absence of differences in competence (first row in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>), CCT-2D resulted in more accurate location estimates than unweighted averaging. At first sight, this result might be surprising since there are no true differences in expertise which could be exploited by the weighting mechanism of the CCT model. However, the higher accuracy of CCT-2D can be explained by shrinkage of parameter estimates in hierarchical Bayesian models. The CCT-2D model assumes a hierarchical group-level distribution of the cultural-truth parameters T k across items which is not the case for unweighted averaging. Shrinkage of the random-effect parameters generally results in estimates closer to the mean µ T,d compared to estimates based on independent item parameters (i.e., fixed effects, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Heck, 2019)</ref>. As a consequence, extreme estimates are avoided especially when there are only few judgments for each item (i.e., if the sample size N is small). In our simulation study, the benefit of shrinkage was especially large since the CCT-2D</p><p>perfectly represented the data-generating process with respect to all (hyper-)prior distributions of the parameters. However, even when the hierarchical distributions are not accurately specified, shrinkage generally results in increased overall accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Efron &amp; Morris, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Stein, 1956)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, shrinkage results in a higher accuracy of CCT-2D compared to unweighted averaging even in the absence of differences in competence. This benefit becomes larger as variance in item difficulties increases due to a stronger effect of shrinkage on the (random) item effects. However, with increasing numbers of judgments per item (i.e., for larger N ), shrinkage is reduced as the item CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 26 parameters can be estimated more precisely. In turn, this results in a similar accuracy for CCT-2D and unweighted averaging. Overall, our comparison shows that CCT-2D can increase the accuracy of aggregated location judgments by accounting for heterogeneity in competence and item difficulty.</p></div>

For unweighted averaging, we simply aggregated the independent location judgments for each city by taking the mean in the x-and the y-direction. For the CCT-2D model, we extracted the posterior-mean estimates of the two-dimensional cultural-truth parameters T k . We then computed the accuracy of the estimated locations by the Euclidean distance to the actual location of the presented cities.</p><p>The CCT-2D model implemented in JAGS assumes prior distributions that are tailored to standardized judgments. For instance, the mean µ T,d of the distribution of truth-parameters T k follows a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of four. However, the x-and y-coordinates of participants' judgments are measured in pixels with values between 0 px and 800 px. Besides distorting parameter estimates, such a misalignment between the scale of the priors and that of the data results in very long computation times of the JAGS sampler. As a remedy, we standardized the judgments before fitting the model based on the mean and SD of the x-and y-coordinates across all participants and items. In practice, it is easier to standardize the responses as opposed to aligning all prior distributions of the CCT-2D model to the measurement scale of the raw data. For the presentation of our results, the posterior-mean estimates of T k are transformed back to pixels, thereby allowing for a comparison to unweighted averaging. accurate estimates than unweighted averaging for four of the five cities (i.e., Birmingham, Dublin, Glasgow, and London) and an equally accurate estimate for one city (Liverpool).</p><p>Notably, for some cities such as London, the distance between the true and the estimated location is approximately half as large for CCT-2D compared to unweighted averaging.</p><p>The supplementary material provides plots of all seven European maps used in the study, each displaying the location estimates obtained with unweighted averaging and CCT-2D</p><p>as well as the cities' actual positions (see https://osf.io/jbzk7/).</p><p>The descriptive patterns shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 6 and 7</ref> were also supported by a statistical analysis. A paired-sample t-test showed that the accuracy of the CCT-2D</p><p>estimates was significantly higher than that of estimates obtained with unweighted averaging (t(56) = 10.51, p &lt; .001). Notably, Cohen's d indicated a large effect size of d = 1.39. Across all cities, estimates were on average 12.24 pixels closer to the correct position, resembling the improvement for Glasgow in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> which was 15.63 pixels.</p><p>To further examine the validity of the CCT-2D model, we computed the correlation between the estimated competence parameters log E i and the education level of the participants. Individuals with a higher education level should have more geographic knowledge and thus provide more accurate judgments which are closer to the cultural truth. Since smaller values of the competence parameter indicate higher individual competence (i.e., reflecting a smaller variance of judgments around the cultural truth), we expect a negative correlation between the estimated competence and education level. When encoding the education level as an ordinal variable, a Spearman rank correlation indeed showed a medium negative correlation of −.35 (p &lt; .001), thus strengthening the validity of the CCT-2D model and the log E i parameters.</p><p>We also fitted two alternative versions of CCT-2D to test whether certain assumptions for two-dimensional continuous data hold. The models differed in details of the specification of the parameters. The first alternative model assumed that the correlation ρ k of judgment errors between the x-and y-dimension is zero for all items.</p><p>This model resembles the CCT model for one-dimensional continuous data <ref type="bibr">(Anders et al.,</ref> CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 30 2014) because the location parameters T k are estimated independently for the x-and y-coordinates. However, this simplified model (DIC = 31, 999) showed a worse performance than the original model (DIC = 30, 187) with respect to the deviance information criterion <ref type="bibr">(DIC, Plummer, 2008)</ref>, for which smaller values indicate better model performance. This result is in line with our finding that for 35 of the 57 cities used in the empirical study (61.4%), the 95% credible interval of the correlation of errors between the two dimensions did not include the value zero. We also examined another CCT model version assuming that the item difficulty λ k does not differ between x-and y-direction. Instead, the model assumes a single, one-dimensional difficulty parameter for each city. Even though the item difficulties for the x-and y-direction showed a substantial correlation in the original CCT-2D model (r λ = 0.85; 95% credible interval = [0.77, 0.92]), the simplified model version assuming a one-dimensional item difficulty showed a worse performance (DIC = 32, 881) than the original model <ref type="bibr">(DIC = 30,</ref><ref type="bibr">187)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>We proposed a novel model of Cultural Consensus Theory for two-dimensional location judgments (CCT-2D). The model is based on the hierarchical Bayesian CCT model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anders et al. (2014)</ref> for one-dimensional data. The CCT-2D model estimates the latent cultural truths of the presented items, that is, the group's consensus knowledge concerning the (unknown) positions of the items. To do so, the model infers the informants' competence based on the distance of their response patterns to the shared consensus, as well as the difficulty of the items. To account for the spatial structure of the two-dimensional data, the model assumes that judgment errors are correlated between the two dimensions for each item.</p><p>We successfully applied the new model both to simulated and empirical data.</p><p>Using simulations, we showed that the CCT-2D model has a very good parameter recovery for a large range of numbers of informants and numbers of items. Moreover, the simulations showed that the CCT-2D group-level estimates for the latent truths of the CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 31</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 7</head><p>Estimated versus actual locations of five cities. CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 32 locations were more accurate in terms of the Euclidean distance to the true locations than the estimates obtained with unweighted averaging of individual judgments. This is due to the fact that the CCT-2D model considers additional information obtained by inferring differences in the items' difficulty and the informants' competence. Furthermore, a reanalysis of an empirical study in which informants located 57 European cities on seven different maps showed a large effect concerning an increase in accuracy of CCT-2D compared to unweighted averaging. These findings conceptually replicate the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Merkle et al. (2020)</ref> who found that a CCT-inspired mechanism of weighting informants' judgments by their expertise outperformed unweighted averaging for one-dimensional forecasting judgments (i.e., for point spread forecasts of the Australian Football League).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Limitations and future model developments</head><p>While our results provide preliminary evidence for the usefulness of the proposed CCT-2D model, the model has several limitations that should be addressed in the future.</p><p>First, it is possible that response biases may lead to a general shift of location judgments away from the borders into the interior regions of the presented maps. A similar effect may also occur due to certain geographic features such as coastlines or national borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Friedman et al., 2005)</ref>. Note that a simple, additive shift of all location judgments into a certain direction by a certain distance similar as in the one-dimensional CCT model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anders et al. (2014)</ref> cannot describe such a complex, nonlinear bias towards inner regions. However, it may generally be difficult to disentangle complex, item-independent response biases from distortions of the latent consensus knowledge about the locations of specific items both empirically and conceptually. Second, our model assumes that all informants share a single latent cultural truth across all items. This assumption is appropriate for applications similar to our example where we used CCT-2D to aggregate location judgments of a homogeneous group of informants when all items are from a single domain. However, the assumption may be violated in other applications. For instance, Friedman and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Friedman et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Friedman et al., , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Friedman, Kerkman, et al., 2002)</ref> demonstrated CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 33 that geographical location judgments vary depending on the geographical region participants live in. In this example, different cultural truths can be modeled separately for each group. However, an informant's group membership may be latent, for instance, when their cultural background is unknown or when a person moved from one geographical region to another. In such cases, CCT-2D can be extended to multiple latent cultural truths by assuming different consensus locations and item difficulties for each latent group <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders et al., 2014)</ref>. If the presented items are from qualitatively different domains (e.g., informants have to locate cities in their home country and in a foreign country), the assumption that informants have the same competence for all items may be violated. As a remedy, one can fit separate CCT-2D models for different domains of items or extend the CCT-2D model while estimating multiple competence parameters per person.</p><p>Third, the proposed CCT-2D model assumes bivariate normal distributions of the observed location judgments and of the latent truths concerning the positions of the presented items. However, locations on maps are naturally constrained by the borders of the map and by geographic features such as coasts or national borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Friedman et al., 2005)</ref>. It is thus likely that our assumption that location judgments and latent truths follow bivariate normal distributions with unbounded support is violated. As a remedy, the CCT-2D model of location judgments may be improved by implementing a truncation of the support in the two-dimensional space by respecting geographic features of the map. For instance, when estimating the location of Dublin, one may exclude observed judgments that position the city in the Atlantic Ocean, while also implementing a corresponding truncation for the support of the bivariate normal distribution of observed judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gelfand et al., 1992)</ref>. For the application of our model to empirical data, we simply excluded participants who positioned more than 10% of their judgments outside the highlighted countries of interest to more adequately fulfill this assumption.</p><p>In principle, it is also possible to truncate the support of the bivariate distribution of latent truths to landmasses only. Thereby, one ensures that all posterior samples of the CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 34 inferred locations in MCMC sampling are actually located on land and away from the sea.</p><p>However, implementing complex, nonlinear, two-dimensional truncations in JAGS or other software is not straightforward. Even when considering only a set of simple, linear order constraints, tailored MCMC algorithms are usually required to ensure that all posterior samples satisfy the constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Heck &amp; Davis-Stober, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, these methods often assume that the truncated parameter space is convex which is not the case for landmasses on geographic maps. Thus, we leave it to future research to implement the truncation of distributions in the CCT-2D model.</p><p>Besides aggregating location judgments on geographic maps, our extension of CCT to two-dimensional continuous data can also be applied to other types of judgments such as continuous ratings of both the emotional arousal and valence of pictures on two visual analogue scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Funke &amp; Reips, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Reips &amp; Funke, 2008)</ref>. Moreover, the CCT-2D model can also easily be extended to d-multivariate responses on an arbitrary number of judgment dimensions for continuous responses. Such an approach could be useful, for instance, when rating facial images with respect to several dimensions such as trustworthiness, attractiveness, and symmetry on continuous scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008)</ref>. However, depending on the application, it is necessary to adjust the model with respect to the dimensionality and dependence of the parameters. For instance, when eliciting judgments on several dimensions (e.g., subjective arousal and valence of pictures), it is more suitable to assume separate competence dimensions E i,1</p><p>and E i,2 as opposed to a single dimension as for geographical expertise. Moreover, response errors could be assumed to be uncorrelated across dimensions since our empirical example only provided evidence that correlated errors are required for modeling location judgments. When using visual analogue scales or sliders for eliciting judgments, it may also be necessary to include a shifting and a scaling response bias similar as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anders et al. (2014)</ref>. Before relying on the estimates of such alternative CCT-2D versions in other domains, it is of course necessary to test the fit and the validity of the model. In doing so, one should consider that averaging the judgments of all group members is only one among many possible aggregation mechanisms (for alternatives such as selecting a CULTURAL CONSENSUS THEORY FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION JUDGMENTS 35 smaller crowd, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Galesic et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Goldstein et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Conclusions</head><p>The proposed CCT-2D model extends the scope of applications of cultural consensus theory to two-dimensional continuous data. Researchers can now analyze and aggregate geographical location judgments consisting of x-and y-coordinates or longitude and latitude to infer the group's cultural knowledge about the unknown locations. In doing so, the model weighs the observed judgments both by the informants' competence and by the items' difficulty. Concerning the study design, it is necessary to recruit multiple informants who provide judgments for multiple items from the same knowledge domain. We showed that the CCT-2D model provides good parameter recovery and, in cases where the factual truth is known, provides aggregate group-level estimates that are more accurate than those obtained by the unweighted averaging of location judgments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>for one-dimensional judgments. For rating judgments, a shifting response bias implies that each informant shifts all of their answers up or down on the response scale by a certain amount. Anders et al. modeled this by an idiosyncratic, additive component for each individual. When positioning cities on a map of the United Kingdom, a response bias would imply that each informant exhibits an</figDesc></figure>
