			<abstract>
				<p>Episodic memory helps facilitate navigation of the social world. Yet, whether social content is prioritized when making decisions involving episodic memory is unclear. Testing whether social elements are prioritized when retrieving multi-element episodes used for social and non-social decision-making, online volunteers encoded episode triplets comprising a location, activity, and a clique (i.e. social group) that related to a decision cue that was either a person or an object. Subsequent associative memory tests in all tasks revealed enhanced recall for activity pairings with cliques. Additionally, social decision task contexts further boosted recall of social event content linked to the same decision cue. Computational modeling of retrieval response times revealed that these effects were consistent with more holistic pattern completion-like retrieval of event triplets when recalling social content. These results imply that social content holds a privileged role over other event details in episodic memory, while offering a putative mechanism for social prioritization in episodic memory processes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Certain details tend to stand out more than others when remembering an event. The question of why individuals are predisposed to recall some types of event content has been addressed by a growing body of literature. For example, episodic recall is known to be biased towards retrieving event elements that contain heightened levels of novelty, emotion, or reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bisby and Burgess, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Murty et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zajonc, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Phelps and Sharot, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Madan et al., 2014)</ref>. Nevertheless, the influence of social information, a key aspect of everyday experience, on episodic memory remains a mystery. Recent work has theorized that episodic memory helps guide navigation of the social world and facilitates formation of social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arzy and Kaplan, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schafer and Schiller, 2018)</ref>, lending support for the idea that episodic memory and social cognition processes could be intimately linked. Furthermore, memory for past events putatively help reduce uncertainty about social situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mar and Spreng, 2018)</ref> and inform social decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Murty et al., 2016</ref>). Yet despite the apparent utility of using episodic memory and social cognition processes together, it is unclear whether social content holds a privileged role in decisions guided by episodic memory.</p><p>Due to the essential role that social interactions play in survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Atzil et al., 2018)</ref>, social contextual details are thought to influence a variety of cognitive processes including selective attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dalmaso et al., 2020)</ref>, learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hackel et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Leblanc and Ramirez, 2020)</ref>, and affective <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adolphs, 1999)</ref> processes. Studies in recognition memory offer further clues about why the human brain might be biased towards encoding social event content, where work has observed enhanced recognition for fa-miliar faces versus other cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gomez et al., 2020)</ref>. Similarly, recognizing scenes from videos where people are featured is easier than scenes without people <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jimenez and Meyer, 2024)</ref>. Emerging neuroscientific evidence shows the hippocampus, the key brain region in episodic memory processes, also plays an important role in social learning <ref type="bibr">(Tavares et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kaplan and Friston, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Park et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">FeldmanHall et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arzy and Kaplan, 2022)</ref>. This evidence points to the possibility of an inherent cognitive predisposition for retrieving social details from episodic memory. However, testing enhanced retrieval of social details is complicated due to a lack of psychological tasks that control for the depth of cognitive demands or the manner by which social content is embedded in events comprising more than two elements, a necessity to study uniquely episodic memory cognitive processes such as pattern completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Horner et al., 2015)</ref>. Incorporating the aforementioned design elements in an experimental paradigm could help determine if the priority of social in episodic memory-guided decision making affects the retention of other event elements in a manner similar to spatial contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Robin and Olsen, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Multi-element event encoding paradigms are well-positioned to test whether some details are remembered better than others in episodic memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Horner and Burgess, 2013)</ref>. Unlike encoding binary associations, encoding stimulus triplets(e.g., a person, location, and an object) as a coherent event engages hippocampal-dependent episodic memory mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Horner et al., 2015)</ref>. One prominent episodic memory computation that is captured through retrieving event triplets is pattern completion, where elements belonging to the same event are bound together into a holistic memory representation. Retrieval of more salient episodic elements is more likely to trigger enhanced retrieval of entire episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rouhani and Niv, 2021)</ref>, which could serve as a mechanism underlying how saliently remembered stimuli promote more holistic recall. Notably, event triplets can flexibly incorporate different types of content like affective stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bisby and Burgess, 2017)</ref>, subsequently offering a framework for studying whether social details are prioritized during episodic memory retrieval. Furthermore, this task design allows the study of a key untested feature of whether social event content provokes more holistic pattern completion mechanisms using computational models like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Horner et al. (2015)</ref>. Consequentially, an additional strength of the multi-element event paradigms is that it can be adapted to have different encoding and retrieval demands, where different event triplets(events) can be linked to the task cue. Therefore, whether enhanced recall for social event content persists under higher cognitive demands can be tested.</p><p>Using a multi-element episodic decision-making paradigm, participants in the context of a decisionmaking task learned event triplets that consisted of an activity, a clique (i.e. social group), and a location. We test the hypothesis that social event details are more memorable than non-social details when making decisions. We gauged the robustness of a potential social memory recall bias through varying retrieval demands. To manipulate retrieval demands, while ensuring participants were encoding triplets as episodes, participants were linked to two unique event triplets with a decision cue used to inform choices in a decision making task. We define this set of a decision cue with two triplets as a "decision set". After encoding the five decision sets linked to the five decision cues, participants made decisions based on the relative suitability of a decision cue for planning specific tasks, namely organizing a fishing expedition or a birthday party. Participants were then presented with a surprise associative recall task. This experimental design allowed us to determine whether recall biases were retained after a decision-making task, while also assessing whether decision performance plays a role in these biases.</p><p>Here, we present data from three preregistered episodic memory-guided choice experiments using the aforementioned paradigm, with Experiment 1 using a social decision cue (faces), featuring two replication studies (Experiment 1.1 and 1.2), and Experiment 2 where the decision cues were changed to non-social elements (objects). In the instructions, participants were informed about the decisionmaking task they would perform after episodic encoding, but not the associative memory test. In other words, participants were instructed to encode an decision cue represented by a person partaking in a presented activity with a clique (social group) in a presented location for Experiment 1.1 and 1.2, or encode an decision cue represented by an object being used for an activity with the clique (clique) at a presented location in Experiment 2. Crucially, the activity was the only informative element for making decisions. Participants subsequently performed the decision-making task and were then presented with a surprise associative memory test in the form of a two-alternative forced-choice(2AFC).</p><p>Due to the choice saliency of activity elements and their ambiguity for whether they were social or non-social, they were used as recall cues for associative memory task with either non-social <ref type="bibr">(location)</ref> or social (cliques) elements. Recall trials were divided into two levels of retrieval demand-whether the two social or non-social event triplets are both from the same decision set, or from different decision sets. When foil elements are from the same decision set, we refer to the associative recall trial as more demanding (i.e., the two elements are from two distinct triplets that share a decision cue). Similar to previous findings of reduced interference when recalling items from different compared to the same time periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ezzyat and Davachi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">DuBrow and Davachi, 2013)</ref> and for experiments manipulating pattern separation demands in both recognition and associative memory <ref type="bibr">(Zeineh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kirwan and Stark, 2007)</ref>, associative recall of triplet items from the same decision set theoretically requires increased pattern separation demands compared to event triplets from different decision sets. Early literature indeed supports the notion that the shared decision cue between the triplets in a decision set may cause associative interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Primoff, 1938)</ref>.</p><p>We were also interested in whether prioritization of irrelevant social episodic content invoked details of other elements in an event during recall. Content biases could occur in episodic memory because that prioritized content could drive more holistic pattern completion of all elements in an episode compared to non-prioritized content <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Horner and Burgess, 2014)</ref>. This was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bisby et al. (2018)</ref>, where they authors presented triplets to participants comprising a person, an object, and a location, then tested the participants' recognition ability for these triplets. Half of the triplets had a negative emotional element to them. They found that negative emotional content inhibits the ability to form coherent associations from episodic memory. Notably, they also found that negative emotional content impaired pattern completion as determined by an attractor network model <ref type="bibr">(Wills et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Inspired by this work, we developed a computational model to test how social elements affected multi-element event encoding and retrieval. The model simulation featured both encoding and recall phases. These phases were adapted to a signal detection model, as we were interested in the participants' overall ability to recall social or non-social content overall, rather than each item individually like a context maintenance retrieval model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Polyn et al., 2009)</ref>. We then tested the hypothesis that social recall weighs information of other triplet elements uniformly during recall, thereby resembling a more holistic pattern completion process than single item associative recall. The model also allows an assessment of the downstream computational consequences of social content prioritization on other episodic content. Consequently, we can determine whether associative memory recall involving social elements provoked more or less holistic pattern completion of event triplets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, we asked if social content was prioritized in episodic memory-guided social decisions. Experiments 1.1 and 1.2 were ran in two replication studies to test priority of social content in a social decision-making task <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. A minimum recruitment criterion of 55 participants was needed to achieve statistical power of 95% given a moderate effect size of f 2 = 0.15 for testing single predictors in a multiple regression model as according to the G*Power software <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Erdfelder et al., 1996)</ref>. All task stimuli were presented using PsychoJS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Peirce et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Peirce, 2007)</ref> via the Pavlovia platform (PsychoPy Team, 2017). The task consisted of three phases as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A</ref>. Each experiment had 2 runs of the task corresponding to a certain planning tasks, namely organizing a birthday party or fishing expedition. Due to a technical error in Experiment 1.1, all participants were presented the two runs in the same order. In Experiment 1.2, the replication study, participants were presented runs in the opposite order. At the end of each experiment, we asked participants which role was most familiar to them for each run.</p><p>Native English speaking participants between 18 and 40 years old (31.77±11.4) were recruited from Figure 1: Experiment 1. (A) An example trial from each part of Experiment 1. In encoding trials, participants are asked to create stories using a triplet comprising a location (non-social), group/clique (social) and activity element shown at the bottom of the screen with person shown at the top of the screen. Instructions demanded participants make stories in order to make accurate judgments related to organizing a certain scenario-either a birthday party or a fishing expedition depending on the run. There are 5 people in each run, and each person has two unique associated event triplets, forming a decision set as seen in (B). Unbeknownst to participants, only the activity element was relevant for ranking choices. After encoding, a role assignment decision task is then performed where participants ranked the unique 1st and 2nd place likelihood that an encoded individual can fulfill a listed role. After the ranking decision task, participants were then asked to recall which clique (social) or location (non-social) element was associated with an activity cue (ambiguous). (C) Shows examples of recall trials with target items in the decision set in (B). A more demanding recall trial would test association recall when the foil (orange) element is drawn from a triplet in the same decision set as the target (green) (C top), while a less demanding recall trial would comprise a foil element (no box) drawn from a triplet element in a different decision set (green) (C bottom). Decision sets were randomly generated for each participant.</p><p>the Prolific platform (Prolific Academic Ltd., 2014). All study participants were compensated and gave informed written consent for their participation. The study was approved by the local research ethics committee (Application number CEISH/29/2022). The study was conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki protocols. Gender ratios were ensured to be evenly split between people identifying as male or female for each experiment. Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were excluded if they had previous neurological or psychiatric disorders, or had already participated in one of the three studies. There were participants in Experiment 1.1, while there were 60 participants for Experiment 1.2. The five additional participants for Experiment 1.2 were collected due to a lower participant dropout rate than anticipated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Encoding</head><p>The first block of the experiment comprised an encoding phase where the participants were presented one of five decision cues. For Experiments 1.1 and 1.2, decision cue were social (fictitious faces generated by the ThisPersonDoesNotExist website: https://thispersondoesnotexist.com, see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A</ref> and B). P Each decision cue was associated with 2 triplets, forming a decision set (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B</ref>). One of two possible triplets in a decision set was presented at each encoding trial lasting ten seconds.</p><p>The triplets contained a location, clique, and activity element. Each encoding trial had an inter-trial interval(ITI) of two seconds. Triplet elements were randomized for their position in the left, center, and right position on the bottom of the screen. The participants were given the following instruction: "You'll now view sets of 3 images comprising locations, groups and activities corresponding to an individual. When viewing the 3 images, please imagine the listed person performing the given activity in the displayed location with the presented group of people. Please try to remember these events that you imagine. You will later need to accurately assign specific roles to the individuals seen for a TASK." , where TASK would either be a birthday party or a fishing expedition. At the beginning of the experiment, participants were provided an unrelated example decision set with a story we created to help guide them in performing the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Decision Making Task</head><p>Participants then performed a drag-and-drop role assignment task, where they needed to decide which role to assign to a person. Precisely, participants were told: "Based on the set of images you have just seen for each individual, please rank which individual would be the first and second best for each role in a TASK. To rank the individual for a role, you'll need to click the photo of an individual and drop them to the rank placeholder for the role. Please rank them as quickly and accurately as possible. You can always overwrite an assigned rank for a role by dragging a person from the right column to the ranking. Also, note that individuals can be ranked first or second only once.", where TASK was either a birthday party or a fishing expedition. The activity elements presented during the encoding phase were the only salient elements in event patterns for accurately making decisions. The role assignment phase was allowed to last as long as necessary for the participant, with an attention control for a maximum one minute idle time before kicking participants out of the experiment and excluding them from analysis. After the role assignment phase, the participant is prompted for their confidence of their role assignment choices on a continuous scale between 1 and 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">2AFC Recall Task</head><p>An associative memory retrieval test was then administered. Participants were presented with 40 trials where they needed to discriminate between which of either two social elements or two non-social elements were associated with a cued activity element. The associative memory test had a 2x2 factorial design comprising a memory demand factor-controlled by trials with target and foil items associated to the same or different decision set (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1C</ref>)-and social factor-whether targets and lures were social elements or non-social elements. Recall trials with items from the same decision set allows testing more demanding, pattern separation-like, memory retrieval computations. Each recall trial was self-paced and could last a maximum of 10 seconds before registering an incorrect recall and zero confidence and skipping to the next trial. After participants made their recall choice, they are prompted to rate their recall confidence on a continuous scale between 1 and 7. After each confidence rating, a fixation cross was presented for 2 seconds, representing an ITI. In each run, the 40 recall trials in the associative memory retrieval task were evenly split between social and non-social recall trials, whether the recall trial is more or less demanding, which of the two triplet events the activity cue and target elements are drawn from, and which of the 5 decision cues the target element and activity cue are associated with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Exclusion Criteria</head><p>Participants were excluded from the online study and subsequent analysis if they idled for more than a minute during the planning task, or if they didn't respond within 10s for three consecutive memory retrieval trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5">Statistical Analysis</head><p>To study the priority of social versus non-social event content during associative memory retrieval, we used a linear mixed effects model, with random intercepts for participants and runs to account for variability of baseline performance for each participant and run, to predict associative memory performance. In this model, illustrated in eq. 1, the main effects evaluated were a categorical variable (S) for whether social or nonsocial elements needed to be discriminated, a categorical variable (E) for whether the foil item was from the same or from a different decision set, and a continuous variable (R) for role assignment performance bounded between 0 and 1-in other words, the probability of choosing the correct role for a person in either the first or second rank.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P erf ormance ∼ (1|P articipant : Run) + S * E * R RT ∼ (1|P articipant : Run) + S * E * R Conf idence ∼ (1|P articipant : Run) + S * E * R (1)</formula><p>We hypothesized that social recall had no interactions with whether the foil element is from the same (more demanding) or different (less demanding) decision set. Confirming this hypothesis would highlight recall biases for social content regardless of recall demand. Further interactions were modeled between S, E, and R to investigate the effect whether biases depended on how well they performed to the decision-making task, with an expectation that increased decision-making performance should positively correlate with recall performance. These same models were also used to the determine the factors that predict the confidence ratings and response times (RT) of participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Results</head><p>Figure 2: Behavioral results. Linear mixed effects analysis results for the social decision-making task(Experiments 1.1 and 1.2). Participants (n=115) were given surprise associative memory recall tests after viewing face decision cue-event triplet pairings in an encoding phase and making decisions on the fictitious people. These raincloud plots, showing the distributional spread and quartiles of effects, demonstrate better recall for clique regardless of whether decision cues were the same. Better recall was observed in trials where foil elements were draw from different decision sets. This, in conjunction with lower response time (RT) for trials with recall elements from different decision sets, highlight the lessened cognitive demand of such trials. Specifically, these less demanding trials presented faster RTs than more demanding trials when recalling social elements. In all figures, *** indicates p &lt; 0.001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Behavioral Results</head><p>Memory Recall In Experiments 1.1 and 1.2, we examined the behavior of participants during the associative memory test to confirm our main hypothesis that social content is prioritized in episodic memory when learned during a social memory-guided decision-making task. We also ensured that this effect is replicable. We expected enhanced recall for social vs non-social event elements, in line with the hypothesized privileged role of social content in episodic memory. In Experiment 1.1, average recall performance for social content was 75.8% ± 0.013 and was significantly higher than for nonsocial content (74% ± 0.012, Z = 2.37, p = 0.018). The hypothesized effect of enhanced recall for social content was replicated in Experiment 1.2, where social content was correctly recalled 77.9% ± 0.013 of the time and non-social content recalled 74.5%±0.013 of the time (Z = 2.51, p = 0.012). To investigate the effect of episodic retrieval demands, we assessed whether recall performance increases when the foil element is associated with a different (less demanding) decision set compared to the same (more demanding) decision set. In Experiment 1.1, there was higher recall performance for less demanding trials (84.3% ± 0.014) compared to demanding trials(65.4% ± 0.013, Z = 10.4, p &lt; 0.001). This effect was replicated in Experiment 1.2 where less demanding trials were better recalled (85.9% ± 0.014) than more demanding trials, (66.4% ± 0.014, Z = 11.1, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>We next determined whether there are potentially different cognitive processing strategies by assessing retrieval RTs. Experiment 1.1 participants responded faster in trials they recalled correctly (0.974 ± 0.03s) compared to incorrect trials (1.13 ± 0.039s, T = 7.67, p &lt; 0.001). This was replicated in Experiment 1.2, where participants similarly responded faster for correct trials (0.91 ± 0.029s) compared to incorrect trials (1.04 ± 0.043s, T = 4.76, p &lt; 0.001). We then expected RTs to be quicker in less demanding recall trials vs more demanding recall trials. In Experiment 1.1, more demanding trials had longer RTs (1.06 ± 0.034s) than less demanding trials (0.95 ± 0.030s, T = 3.90, p &lt; 0.001). This was replicated in Experiment 1.2; participants took 0.98 ± 0.032s in more demanding trials compared to 0.88 ± 0.031s in less demanding trials (T = 4.91, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, we explored whether there were social vs non-social recall RT differences to identify potentially distinct retrieval processes. In Experiment 1.1, participants didn't spend significantly more time (T = 0.94.54, p = 0.35) recalling social content (1.02 ± 0.032s) compared to non-social content (0.99 ± 0.031s). Nonetheless, the interaction between social content and memory demand was significant (T = 4.23, p &lt; 0.001), where there were higher retrieval RTs for more demanding trials. In Experiment 1.2, we observed no main effect of social content recall having higher RTs(0.95 ± 0.032s) compared to non-social content recall(0.91 ± 0.031s, T = 1.39, p = 0.116). Additionally, there was no significant interaction between memory demand and social content recall accuracy(T = 1.692, p = 0.166). Despite retrieval of social content generally tending to exhibit longer RTs compared to non-social content recall, quicker RTs for correct recall persisted, indicating a heightened intercept effect produced by social content. In Experiment 1.1, participants took 0.99 ± .03s when correctly recalling social content compared to 1.16 ± 0.045s when incorrectly recalling social content (T = 3.34, p = 0.001). This was replicated in Experiment 1.2, where participants took 0.93 ± 0.03s when correctly recalling social content compared to 1.08 ± 0.048s when incorrectly recalling social content (T = 2.65, p = 0.008).</p><p>We also studied participants' subjective confidence ratings to provide further evidence alongside RTs and recall for distinct cognitive processing for social recall. First, we expected confidence to be higher for correct trials. Indeed, in Experiment 1.1, participants responded with higher confidence (5.06 ± 0.11) in correct trials vs incorrect trials (3.88 ± 0.11) (T = 14.6, p &lt; 0.001). This was replicated in Experiment 1.2, where participants responded with higher confidence (5.07 ± 0.11) in correct trials vs incorrect trials (3.97 ± 0.11) (T = 12.24, p &lt; 0.001). We further expected more demanding trials to decrease confidence ratings. Accordingly, more demanding trials evoked less confidence in participants (4.54 ± 0.11) than less demanding trials (5.04 ± 0.12) in Experiment 1.1 (T = 3.31, p &lt; 0.001). This was replicated in Experiment 1.2, where participants rated their confidence lower (4.606 ± 0.10) in more demanding trials and higher (5.05 ± 0.12) in less demanding trials (T = 2.21, p = 0.027). In Experiment 1.1, participants generally reported higher confidence when recalling social (4.87 ± 0.11) vs non-social (4.72 ± 0.12) content (T = 2.43, p = 0.015). This effect was replicated in Experiment 1.2, where social content (4.93 ± 0.10) evoked higher participants confidence than non-social content (4.72 ± 0.12) (T = 2.74, p = 0.006).</p><p>Having replicated results of retrieval priority for social content in Experiments 1.1 and 1.2, we then aggregated data from the two experiments to obtain comprehensive statistics, with results for performance and RTs seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>. Average recall performance for social content was 76% ± 0.009, while non-social content recall rate was 74% ± 0.009. The difference in recall performance for social and non-social content was statistically significant (= 3.45, p = 0.005). We further confirmed recall trial demands were consistent with the replication experiment results (T = 15.15, p &lt; 0.001), where demanding trials were remembered correctly 66% ± 0.009 of the time and less demanding trials were correctly recalled 85% ± 0.01 of the time. Furthermore, participants responded faster when performing correct recall (0.94 ± 0.02s) compared to when incorrectly recalling of event elements (1.09 ± 0.03s) (T = 9.89, p &lt; 0.001). Social content didn't take significantly longer (0.99 ± 0.02s) to recall than non-social (0.95 ± 0.02s) content(T = 0.287, p = 0.774). However, when investigating the interaction with more demanding recall trials, there was significantly higher RTs for retrieving social content(T = 4.14, p &lt; 0.001, <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). Notably, correctly remembered social content trials were recalled faster (0.961 ± 0.02s) than incorrectly remembered social content (1.12 ± 0.03) trials(T = 4.23, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Generally, participants reported stronger recall confidence for social content (4.90 ± 0.08) compared to non-social content (4.72 ± 0.08) (T = 3.66, p &lt; 0.001).

More demanding trials associated with foil elements drawn from the same decision set evoked lower subjective confidence (4.57 ± 0.08) than less demanding trials (5.05 ± 0.09) (T = 3.87, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Decision Task Ensuring that the randomized activity-person element pairings were indeed valid for accurate decision-making, we assessed participant first-rank choice behavior.

Our study builds on recent findings highlighting general preferences for social content in both associative <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stewardson et al., 2023)</ref> and recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jimenez and Meyer, 2024</ref>) memory with older adults being more biased to use familiarity judgments when making decisions about others <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lempert et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>It remained unclear how social content is bound to other event elements in episodic memory. Our observation of better recall for irrelevant social event elements raises the question of why social information holds a privileged role in episodic memory. In addition to the enhanced recall for social content, we observed longer RTs when recalling social elements, especially when the target and foil recall element are drawn from the same decision set. Longer RTs could represent different cognitive computations when processing social elements. A particularly interesting computation is holistic pattern completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Horner et al., 2015)</ref>, a process which can indeed relate to longer <ref type="bibr">RTs (Vieweg et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tang et al., 2018)</ref>.

In the follow-up Experiment 2, we manipulate the task demanding participants make choices on objects, not people, to resolve this potential confound. Taking Experiment 1's results together, however, we present evidence that enhanced social recall is present when making decisions involving people, i.e. when choices are social.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>Figure 3: Experiment 2. (A) An example trial from each part of Experiment 1. In encoding trials, participants are asked to create stories using a triplet comprising a location (non-social), group/clique (social) and activity element shown at the bottom of the screen with an object shown at the top of the screen. Instructions prompted participants to construct events to infer the purpose of the object. There are 5 objects in each run, and each person has two unique associated event triplets, forming a decision set as seen in (B). Unbeknownst to participants, only the activity element was relevant for ranking choices. Unlike Experiment 1, activities couldn't be randomized with respect to decision cues, leaving only cliques and locations randomized. After encoding, participants ranked the unique 1st and 2nd place likelihood of an object being used for an associated purpose. After the ranking decision task, participants were asked to recall which clique (social) or location (non-social) element was associated with an activity cue (ambiguous). (C) Shows examples of recall trials with target items in the decision set in (B). A more demanding recall trial would test association recall when the foil (orange) element is drawn from a triplet in the same decision set as the target (green) (C top), while a less demanding recall trial would comprise a foil element (no box) drawn from a triplet element in a different decision set (green) (C bottom). Decision sets were randomly generated for each participant.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we tested retrieval biases for social stimuli over non-social stimuli when encoding for social decisions. However, it's possible that encoding scenarios in a social decision context provides an implicit bias to attend to social information. To control for this effect, we developed Experiment asking if prioritization of social content generalizes across episodic memory-guided decisions. To that extent, we changed decision cues to non-social objects representing semantic labels (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3C</ref>).</p><p>Otherwise, the protocol was identical to Experiment 1 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3A and 3B)</ref>. Run order for Experiment was randomized and counterbalanced across the participant pool. We recruited 56 participants (29.2 ± 11.6 years old) for this study to achieve the same statistical power as Experiments 1.1 and 1.2. The task was identical to Experiment 1 with the exception of replacing fictitious faces by objects, thus changing the decision making task from role assignment to inferring purposes. Task instructions changed subsequently to reflect this change for non-social decision-making. Namely, before encoding, participants were told: "You'll now view sets of 3 images comprising locations, groups and activities corresponding to an object. When viewing the 3 images, please imagine how the object would be used for a given activity in the displayed location with the presented group of people. Please try to remember these stories that you imagine. You will later need to accurately assign specific purposes to the objects." Then, before decision making, participants were told: "Based on the set of images you have just seen for each object, please rank which would be the first and second likely purpose for the object. To rank the purpose of the object, you'll need to click on the photo of the object and drop it to the rank placeholder for a possible purpose. Please rank them as quickly and accurately as possible.</p><p>You can always overwrite an assigned rank for a purpose by dragging an object from the right column to the ranking. Also, note that objects can be ranked first or second only once."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choices</head><p>By manipulating the decision-making task in Experiment 1 to be non-social in Experiment 2, we were able to demonstrate that social content still has higher recall priority than non-social content regardless of whether the choices are guided by potentially social elements in the decision cue. Experiment 2 instead uses object cues that are inherently non-social. However, social content's priority comes with the caveat of cognitive demand. Although at high cognitive demands we observe a higher effect size for retaining social content, it is not significant. This may suggest that greater cognitive demands decreases the sensitivity of pattern completion when given social elements if the decision task is not socially oriented as in Experiment 1. This alludes to particular priming caused by the social nature of the decisions demanded by the participants. Yet, the sensitivity for pattern completing social elements persist when cognitive demands are not as high, suggesting that reduced semantic similarity between event elements does not annul any potential prioritization effects for social content.</p><p>Similar to Experiment 1, we find longer RTs when recalling elements in trials with greater cognitive demand, i.e. when the foil is drawn from the same decision set. However, though the social content has longer RTs than non-social content, this isn't significant. The aforementioned social priming caused by the nature of the social decisions in Experiment 1 could potentially explain this difference.</p><p>Nonetheless, we investigated this further using computational modeling in the following section 4 to ascertain whether putative holistic pattern completion mechanisms significantly explain the longer RT for social recall in these experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Computational Model</head><p>To account for the discrepancy between participants' longer RTs and higher performance in recalling social content, we hypothesized that the prioritization of social content provoked more holistic pattern completion of event triplets during episodic memory retrieval. This account dictates that social content acts as a prominent scaffold between the diverse elements encoded in an episodic event. Hence, social content would provoke retrieval of the full event triplet. To test this mechanism, we model an agent whose recall is a function of two independent processes-a baseline encoding process where a covariance matrix describes how various elements of episodic events contribute to marginal a posteriori recall likelihoods. The second process is a RT dependent function describing how longer RTs correspond to increased weight of evidence contribution for a certain element towards recalling the target item.</p><p>Encoding We used a Bayesian encoding mechanism to explain how event triplet elements interact during episodic memory encoding. For a background on Bayesian cognitive models, we direct readers to previous reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Griffiths et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ma, 2019)</ref>. In the present model, the agent starts without any stored episodic memory at a initial state (Prior: P (Recall)), undergoes an encoding session (Likelihood: P (Encoding|Recall)), then can finally recall association between event elements a posteriori (Posterior:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (Recall|Encoding)).

In the following equations, we refer to a recall item with subscript i and a triplet element with s.

To ascertain the strength the common rubric provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jeffreys (1998)</ref>. Weak or anecdotal model evidence ratio has a Bayes factor less than 3.16. Moderate evidence has a Bayes factor between 3.16 and 10. Strong evidence has a Bayes factor greater than 10. In supplementary material C.1, we perform simulations of a social decision-making task using the cognitive model and perform parameter recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Nilsson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson and Collins, 2019)</ref> to demonstrate the reliability of the inference procedure. In supplementary material C.2, we perform the same simulations using a Hopfield network model and perform inferences using our cognitive model to assess the validity of the model. In all conditions, activity cues provide more information towards social recall distributions than non-social recall distributions, illustrating how social-recall is linked to holistic attention of full event information more than non-social recall. In (B) a graph of the expected value of information flow for each trial type(social or non-social recall) and for each decision-making task is shown. Dotted arrow borders refer to hidden element contributions in a memory trial. In all conditions, arrows directed towards recall of cliques have the highest values. (C) displays 2D posterior distribution plots demonstrating how varying information flow from triplet items to non-social recall(y-axis) affects the likelihood of information flow of triplets items in social recall(x-axis). When holistic pattern completion for location recall goes to zero, there is still high likelihood for pattern completion processes in social recall. However, when pattern completion for social recall goes to zero, there is similarly low probability for pattern completion in location recall. This result is especially emphasized in the social decisionmaking task.</p><p>Given that we observed enhanced recall and higher retrieval RTs, we wanted to confirm with a computational model whether our results were consistent with more holistic pattern completion mechanisms when recalling social event content. Notably, these findings are similar to what's been observed for recalling emotionally salient event content <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bisby et al., 2018)</ref>. We also check whether these results are also present during episodic memory encoding. In the ensuing results, we provide an account of longer RTs being due to more holistic pattern completion mechanisms when recalling social event content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Encoding and Multi-Element Interactions</head><p>One way which social content may be prioritized in episodic memory is during the encoding phase,</p><p>where encoding social content in memory provokes increased attention to other elements in an event. To assess the extent of full event attention during encoding, we decompose choice accuracy in the decisionmaking tasks into marginal attention strengths of activity, location, and clique elements. With these marginal attention signals for each element, we then model how participants a posteriori update their memory distributions from a memoryless initial condition using Bayes rule. Facilitative and inhibitory interactions between triplet elements are modeled in the posterior updates. Then, to quantify the extent in which event elements were attended to a posteriori, we calculate the KL divergence to determine how well activity interactions may either approximate cliques interactions in location recall, or location interactions in clique recall. The interpretation is that the higher the KL divergence is, the more activity elements contribute unique information during encoding of social elements (P <ref type="bibr">[G,L]</ref> is different than P[G,A]) or location elements (P[G,L] is different than P[A,L]) respectively.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">fig. 5A</ref>, we observe that for both the factor of social and non-social decision-making tasks as well as the factor of memory recall demand, encoding of social content provokes more holistic storage of the triplets in an event than non-social content, where the expected value of the posterior distribution of KL divergence U (A,L)→G is consistently greater than the expected value of the posterior distribution U (A,G)→L . For the non-social decision-making task, the expected value of the posterior distribution for social-encoding gain was 3.07 (BF 10 = 3.16) for demanding recall trials, and 4.15 (BF 10 = 9.24)for easier recall trials. In social decision-making tasks, this expected value was 2.68 (BF 10 = 2.99) for demanding recall trials and 3.96 (BF 10 = 6.34) for easier recall trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">RTs and Recall</head><p>The second possible explanation for why social content may be prioritized in episodic memory is due to retrieval biases. Longer RTs and better recall in the behavioral results already indicate the possibility of a different underlying mechanism for retrieval of social elements vs non-social elements. We hypothesize that the longer RTs correspond to enhanced recollection of all event elements, implicating more holistic pattern completion of event elements. Consequently, we model the extent that other event elements contribute to recall as a function of RT.</p><p>During recall, computational modeling ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">fig. 5B</ref>) uncovered a more holistic retrieval of triplet elements when recalling social content regardless of decision task. For the social-decision-making task, social recall PCG during demanding trials was 3.80 (BF 10 = 13.17) and 2.02 (BF 10 = 6.13) during less demanding trials. In the non-social decision-making task, the PCG was 4.32 for more demanding trials (BF 10 = 15.19) and 2.14 during less demanding trials (BF 10 = 6.5). These RT-based model results indicate that independent of decision-making task context, social content provokes more holistic pattern completion during multi-element episodic retrieval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">General Discussion</head><p>Using episodic memory-guided social and non-social decision-making tasks, we find evidence for prioritization of social content during episodic memory retrieval. Furthermore, we find that social decisionmaking contexts further facilitate disambiguation of retrieved social event content related to the same individual. A Bayesian model determined that our behavioral results were consistent with more holistic pattern completion of event triplets when retrieving social content. In what follows, we speculate why social content is prioritized in episodic memory-guided choice and explore potential influences of social content on episodic memory processes in general.</p><p>We curiously observed enhanced social recall in conjunction with longer RTs. These results suggests that social content promotes more holistic hippocampal-dependent pattern completion-like recall of event triplets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bird, 2017)</ref>, even when the association between only two elements are being tested during retrieval. Our experimental design included multi-element events linked to a specific fictitious person or object in the context of a decision-making task; this was intended to evoke episodic memory computations related to multi-element episodic binding to disambiguate events linked to the same person or object decision cue (pattern separation). Crucially, although social content had slower retrieval RTs than non-social content, correctly recalled social content was still recalled more quickly than incorrect retrieval of social content. These findings nicely mesh with evidence accumulation accounts predicting that extensive deliberation during memory-guided decisions preferentially engages episodic memory retrieval mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shadlen and Shohamy, 2016)</ref>. Notably, this account also aligns with previous findings showing that longer RTs reflect more demanding pattern completion <ref type="bibr">(Vieweg et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tang et al., 2018</ref>).</p><p>An account for higher RTs involving greater pattern completion process would implicate social content as a prominent scaffold for recalling an episodic event. In context, the preferential recall of social content compared to spatial content is especially surprising when prior work has instead shown location as a prominent scaffold for recalling episodic events <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Robin and Olsen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Robin et al., 2016)</ref>. In these works, it was shown that being cued with locations offered greater recall of other event element items than person cues. This allowed studying scaffolding by determining whether locations or people invoke more event recall. Our work approaches this question with an inverted design by giving an ambiguous cue (activity) and testing recall for social or non-social items. In other words, does the ambiguous activity cue better complete social or non-social patterns. The rationale to use an ambiguous activity cue was to determine whether recollection of social content was greater than non-social content apropos of nothing. Notably, our experimental design limits our ability to claim that social items in isolation (i.e., without spatial features) like cliques may provide prominent scaffolds for episodic events.</p><p>Nonetheless, we aimed to use a computational model to determine if the social target item preferentially invoked pattern completion, as observed in our RT results in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>  To demonstrate the scaffolding mechanics of spatial contexts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Robin and Olsen (2019)</ref> showed eyetracking results where there was longer attention for spatial elements during encoding compared to objects, providing evidence for the binding effects of spatial elements. However they noted there was no differences between attention for people vs spatial scenes. In their task, there was only one person in each encoded event. On the other hand, our task comprised encoding episodic events comprising social elements in the form of cliques, i.e. a multitude of people. The greater facial representation driven by the multitude of people comprising a social content may consequentially yield greater attention for the social elements we presented in the task. This additional processing of social content due to the flurry of people and faces may, through the arguments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Robin and Olsen (2019)</ref> for location as a locus for episodic scaffolding, yield social elements as particularly effective event scaffolds. Faces are an innate feature of social contexts, not a disadvantage of the task design. To capture this effect would demand a sensory modality like vision, as we present in our task, instead of words that eliminates a fundamental aspect of social elements.</p><p>Similarly, social content naturally contains elements such as emotional valence that spatial contexts do not. The increased semantic relatedness of emotional content with other kinds of elements could provide another mechanic explaining the preference for social recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Talmi and Moscovitch, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, research showing that event elements with greater value and emotional valence are more easily retrievable from episodic memory hints that social elements might be preferentially valued <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bisby and Burgess, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Murty et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zajonc, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Phelps and Sharot, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Madan et al., 2014)</ref>.

(1996)</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 5A</ref>). These results fit well with previous theories of attention and encoding, where there's evidence that as participants divide their attention for elements items in a free recall list during encoding, their recall performance decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Craik et al., 1996)</ref>. This is effectively what we see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 5A</ref> when we interpret results in the context of recall performance results in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1C</ref>. These results suggest that participants attend to social elements in event triplets in concert with other triplet items, while non-social elements are attended to on their own. On a related note, a constraint on generality in our study is that healthy adult online participants are the targeted population of our findings and future work is necessary to see assess how these results extend to other populations. To this end, eye tracking research, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Robin and Olsen (2019)</ref>, can further corroborate what event elements participants encode and then subsequently relate the result to recall performance and model predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We find that social content is prioritized during an episodic memory retrieval component of a memoryguided decision-making tasks. Subsequent computational modeling revealed that these results are consistent with social content retrieval provoking more holistic pattern completion of all event elements in an event triplet. Our observation of prioritization of social content in episodic memory-guided decisions more generally underlines the importance of social information in learning and memory processes. Notably, it is still unclear whether social content has a greater priority over other types of prioritized mnemonic content like memories associated with explicit rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Talmi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Murty et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">FeldmanHall et al., 2021)</ref> or emotional valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Madan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bisby et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>To resolve this issue, future work can unpack the relative prioritization of event details and how that changes over the lifetime of an episodic memory.</p><p>Tanner <ref type="bibr">Jr, W.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendices A Bayesian Encoder</head><p>Following similar context maintenance models <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Polyn et al., 2009)</ref>, we model an agent who remembers associations between items in a triplet set from an initial memoryless state. In a signal detection model, this memoryless state refers to an agent with zero separation (d ′ = µ s − µ n = 0) between signal (S) and noise (N ) distributions with equivalent variances. We assume initial standard normal distributions for signal and noise, with zero mean and a unit covariance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Signal ∼ N (µ s = [0, 0, 0], Σ s =       1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1       ) Noise ∼ N (µ n = µ s , Σ n = Σ s )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The off-diagonal components of the covariance matrix Σ s correspond to how, a priori, two elements would facilitate (positive value) or interfere (negative value) with encoding triplet items comprising an activity (A), a location (L), or a clique (G). A priori we assume this to be null, meaning each a priori recall of the item is associated with its own context <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Polyn et al., 2009)</ref>. This initial distribution acts as the prior in the Bayesian encoder. We then describe a normal likelihood referring to how the agent attended to the element during encoding:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Encoding ∼ N (µ a = [A A , A L , A G ], Σ a =       σ 2 AA B AA,AL B AA,AG B AL,AA σ 2 AL B AA,AG B AG,AA B AA,AG σ 2 AG       )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The off-diagonal components of this covariance matrix (B) describe the strength of encoding interference (negative covariance) or facilitation (positive covariance) between elements.</p><p>We use the choice accuracy (R) during the decision-making task as an encoding attention signal.</p><p>Thus, we decompose R to obtain the marginal attention strengths for activity elements, location elements, and clique elements, with a constraint that the sum of factor weights (γ) equals 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R = γ 1 A A + γ 2 A L + γ 3 A G 1 = 3 i=1 γ i<label>(10)</label></formula><p>For the sake of computational simplicity, we work with precision matrices (Λ = Σ −1 ) to calculate posterior likelihood functions. For trials with two elements from the same decision set, the posterior signal and noise distributions, given an equivalent variance model is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">µ s|a = −µ n|a = (Λ s + Λ a ) −1 (Λ s µ s + Λ a µ a ) Σ s|a = Σ n|a = (Λ s + Λ a ) −1<label>(11)</label></formula><p>For trials with foil elements from a different decision set, we treat signal and noise distributions with unequal variances, describing variable attention between triplet sets. We denote noise attention parameters as µ ′ a , Σ ′ a , Λ ′ a .:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">µ ′ n|a = (Λ s + Λ ′ a ) −1 (Λ s µ s − Λ ′ a µ ′ a ) Σ ′ n|a = (Λ s + Λ ′ a ) −1<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Considering associative memory recall trials sample both signal evidence and noise evidence in the same trial, the testing distribution at recall is the difference between signal and noise distributions <ref type="bibr">(Tanner Jr and Swets, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hautus et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Smith and Duncan, 2004)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Recall|Encoding = Signal|Encoding − N oise|Encoding (13) ∼ N (µ r = µ s|a − µ n|a , Σ r = Σ s|a + Σ n|a )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>We can rescale this encoded recall distribution to obtain a unit variance distribution and obtain the posterior encoded d ′ r used at recall:  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: The conditional likelihoods of making the correct first-rank choice for each decision cue during the post-encoding decision-making task [P (Choose = C|Correct = C)].

In supplementary table 1, we illustrate a table of conditional likelihoods of selecting a fictitious person (social decision-making task) or object (non-social decisionmaking task) for a role given that the role is the correct choice. Participants chose the correct first choice above chance cross all scenarios and experimental conditions. Not only were these decisions above chance, but they were also the most likely choice to be made by participants.</p></div>

We use the parameter distributions in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> to simulate plausible participant (N participants = 50, N Runs = 2) data for experiments 1.1 and 1.2. Crucially, in these parameter distributions, we reflect the RT behaviors seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, where social trials uniquely longer RTs in social trials, with still plausible effects for this phenomenon being present in less demanding trials with much lower effect size. Furthermore, we made precision distributions such that the simulated participants had a preference to better encode cliques than all other event elements, with subsequent distributions to allow activity distributions to be more congruent with non-social interactions through the correlation parameter ρ.</p><p>From these simulations, we indeed were able to recover the effect of pattern completion gain for social elements (eq. 7), where pattern completion gain was 1.0 in demanding trials (BF = 3.5) and 1.5 in less demanding trials (BF = 4.88). Similarly, we were able to recover the social pattern separation gain (eq. 3 were recovered as well, where demanding pattern separation gain was 0.066 (BF = 4.2) and less demanding pattern separation gain was 0.052 (BF = 3.34). These results similarly follow the results we found in the social decision-making task, which we explicitly tried to simulate with the parameters in Tab 2 for this parameter recovery analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.2 Hopfield Network Model</head><p>To further validate whether the proposed computational model recovers parameters that align with the pattern completion mechanism of interest, we simulated a Hopfield network model with synaptic weights learned through Hebbian learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hopfield, 1984)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">dx j dt = − x j τ + k T jk g(x k ) + I j<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Here, x j is the j th neuron potential, T is the synaptic weight matrix, g is a function transforming potential to firing rate, I j is the injection current at the neuron j. In our model, we have 35 neurons:</p><p>5 neurons for the 5 decision cues, and 30 neurons for the 10 triplets (10 cliques, 10 locations and 10 activities). The encoding emulates the encoding a participant performs in this experiment, where the 4 elements of a decision set are activated at the same time, thus through Hebbian learning their synaptic weights are reinforced. We further model noise during the encoding, where there is a 30% chance a neuron from the previous encoding trial is still activated. For recall, we set the injection current I to 1 during location recall trials, and 1.1 during social recall-this provokes the ground truth of greater pattern completion for social recall trials. We model recall probability for a recall trial as the inverse logit function of the difference between the target and foil item:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P (recall) = logit −1 ( x target − x f oil λ element )<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The parameter λ element represents a temperature parameter to adjust the baseline recall rate for either a clique (0.1) or location element (0.12). The lower the temperature, the greater the baseline recall rate is.</p><p>We simulated 50 participants performing 2 runs of the experiment. In our analyses, we only consider the pattern completion gain (PCG, eq. 7) metric for evaluating enhanced pattern completion for social elements in these simulations, as the Hopfield model has no consideration for the decision making task like our Bayesian model does.</p><p>From these simulations we observed greater PCG for social elements in both the different decision set (1.605, BF = 4.93) and within decision set condition (1.32, BF = 3.6). These Bayes factors indicate that our inference strategy would evaluate moderate evidence for enhanced pattern completion for social elements. These results confer with what we simulated in the previous parameter recovery results and what we observe in the experimental results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>428</head><label></label><figDesc>posterior recall distribution seen in equation 2 after standardization (see supplementary methods, 429 equation 15). d ′ is the separation between the signal and noise distribution for the recall distribution 430 (see supplementary methods, eq. 15).</figDesc></figure>

We observed prioritized associative recall of social event content that reflects more holistic pattern completion of event triplets. In parallel, social elements linked to the same person provoked more holistic recall of event triplets compared to recall of social elements linked to the same object (seefig. 5B-C), suggesting that social task contexts have an additive effect on promoting pattern completion of multi-element episodic recall. Admittedly, though the model suggests greater pattern completion and scaffolding processes of social content, future experiments may directly address the scaffolding hypothesis by testing social items and spatial items as cues for recalling episodic event elements.</figDesc></figure>
