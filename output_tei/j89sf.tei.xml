			<abstract>
				<p>Opinions of others influence behavior and decision-making, with important consequences for health. An unaddressed question is whether and how social influence can generalize across different situations or decisions. From a learning perspective, generalization is the transfer of previously acquired information to new stimuli and can be based on both perceptual and conceptual similarity. Here, we test whether social influence generalizes to new choices based on shared conceptual features, such as the healthiness and tastiness of different food items. We conducted three studies (total N = 468), in which healthy participants rated how much they would like to eat different food items and were subsequently presented with the ratings of several other people (&apos;social ratings&apos;). Unbeknownst to our participants, they were randomly assigned to social ratings that either reflected a mainly health-driven valuation of food items (&apos;health group&apos;) or to social ratings that reflected a taste-driven valuation of food items (&apos;taste group&apos;). The results in all three studies showed that participants&apos; food ratings became more influenced by healthiness in the &apos;health group&apos; than in the &apos;taste group&apos;. In one study, these effects further transferred to food choices in a naturalistic supermarket task. Our findings provide first evidence of generalization of social influence effects based on inferred social health norms. Futures studies could test conceptual generalization of other types of social and non-social learning and characterize the brain mechanism underlying these effects.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social influence effects on food valuation generalize based on conceptual similarity</head><p>Human behavior is strongly influenced by social and cultural context. A prominent example are food choices and eating behavior. Some of these social norms are relatively stable and strict. We are likely used to eat beef if we have grown up in Argentina or in Japan, but we would be repelled by the idea if we were Hindu. Other social norms may be more subtle, evolve over time, and vary between different subcultures or even smaller groups. For example, even if we usually like to eat steak with fries, we might choose something different if we go to the restaurant with a new group of friends that are health-conscious and/or concerned about climate change. How do humans learn about and adapt their behavior to implicit social norms?</p><p>Many experimental studies show that food choices are influenced by the observed behavior of other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Higgs, et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, when people eat together with someone eating a large amount, people are more likely to consume more than when they eat alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cruwys et al., 2015)</ref>. Food preferences are influenced by the ratings of even anonymous peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nook &amp; Zaki, 2015)</ref>, and even non-human primates have been shown to choose food in line with observed group norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Van de Waal et al., 2013)</ref>. Social influence effects are thus an important factor when making food choices and may interact with other factors known to be important, such as taste and health considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rangel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sobal et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Steptoe et al., 1995)</ref>. Further, epidemiological and social network studies have shown that a person's chance of becoming obese increases with the number of social contacts who are obese <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Christakis &amp; Fowler, 2007)</ref>, and that social influence is the strongest driver of changes in diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eker et al., 2019)</ref>. This suggests that, over time, even small social and cultural influences on food choices may have important consequences for health <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fischler &amp; Masson, 2008</ref>).</p><p>An important but unaddressed question is whether and how social influence may generalize across different situations and across different foods that share common features.</p><p>Previous studies have typically tested whether people's behavior is influenced by specific observation of others' behavior, such as whether they become more likely to choose the salad over the steak if others have chosen the salad. However, social and cultural influences likely operate in more general and abstract ways. For instance, we might not choose the same salad but something else that is also in line with the inferred values and norms of the group-such as a vegetable soup. Here, we test the idea that social influence can generalize across food choices based on abstract conceptual dimensions such as healthiness and tastiness of food items.</p><p>From a learning perspective, generalization can be defined as the transfer of previously acquired information to new stimuli and situations, based on the similarity between the original and a new situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guttman &amp; Kalish, 1956)</ref>. Generalization was already noticed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pavlov (1927)</ref> in his classic conditioning experiments with dogs where he associated food with the sound of a bell and noticed that the animal's reaction generalized to other similar sounds.</p><p>Subsequently, other scientists have obtained empirical "stimulus generalization gradients", which relate the probability, speed, or strength of a learned response to the difference between the test and training stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guttman &amp; Kalish, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shepard, 1987)</ref>. Generalization does not necessarily reflect a lack of discrimination between learned and new stimuli. Instead, generalization can be seen as an active process of associating a stimulus to a more general underlying pattern or rule, which is adaptive in a world where situations are often similar but rarely identical <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Shepard, 1987)</ref>. Accordingly, generalization follows both perceptual similarity gradients as well as conceptual relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dunsmoor &amp; Murphy, 2015)</ref>. Thus, generalization allows people to learn not only about specific stimuli but to infer more general norms and apply them to novel contexts to adapt <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Behrens et al., 2018</ref>).</p><p>Here, we tested whether similar conceptual generalization mechanisms could apply to social influence effects. Recent brain imaging studies suggest parallels between social influence and reinforcement learning, demonstrating that agreeing with others evokes activity in reward-related brain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Klucharev et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Zaki et al., 2011)</ref>. Disagreeing with others is associated with activity in brain areas related to error processing and cognitive conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Klucharev et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Koban et al., 2014)</ref>, leading to subsequent adjustments in behavior and decision-making to reduce this kind of social conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Klucharev et al., 2009)</ref>. If social influence is based on partially similar mechanisms as reinforcement learning, then it may also generalize based on perceptual and conceptual features.</p><p>Food choices naturally lend themselves for testing this idea. As other types of decisions, valuation of food items can be described as a function of different attributes and the importance (weight) of these attributes for any given individual. Two of the most important attributes when evaluating food are its tastiness and its healthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rangel, 2013)</ref> and the importance of these attributes varies substantially across individuals and situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hare et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schmidt et al., 2018)</ref>. We hypothesized that social influence on food choices can generalize by shifting how much people weight health and taste attributes. Thus, we predicted that, during observation of other people's food ratings, people implicitly infer underlying social norms regarding the importance of health and taste, which then influence their own food choices.</p><p>For this purpose, we developed a novel social influence task in which participants rated how much they would like to eat different food items, first during a baseline phase without social information, then during a social influence phase ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A)</ref>. During the social influence phase, they were presented with the ratings of several other people ('social ratings') after their own food rating. For each food item, two sets of social ratings were selected to create two different experimental groups ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. One group of participants (the Health group) was presented with social ratings that reflected a preference for healthy food items (i.e., ratings were selected based on high weights of health and low weights of taste). The other group was presented with social ratings that reflected a low weighting of health and a high weighting of taste aspects of the food (Taste group). If participants generalize from the social ratings, then participants in the Health group should increase the importance (or weight) of health attributes compared to the Taste group in the social influence phase ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C)</ref>.</p><p>Participants in the Taste group in contrast should increase the importance of taste attributes compared to the Health group. We tested these hypotheses in three different studies, with different food stimuli and across two different countries. Further, in order to investigate the possible transfer of generalized social influence to another task, we implemented an additional online supermarket task <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lai et al., 2020)</ref> in Study 2 and 3, providing a measure of participants' food preferences closer to how they make food choices in the real world ( <ref type="figure">Figure    1A</ref>). We expected that participants in the Health group would still be more guided by food healthiness than the Taste group and thus buy healthier food products in the supermarket ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>The first experiment tested the generalization of social influences on self-reported food preference ratings in 196 adult participants of an online study. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2A</ref> illustrates the time course of participants' individual health and taste weights (i.e., beta estimates) during baseline (T0) and the five bins of trials during the social influence phase (T1-T5). Each bin consisted of 16 trials that were balanced regarding the healthiness and tastiness of the 16 food items. This allowed us to assess how participants weighted health and taste in their food ratings in each bin and in each phase (over multiple bins), by fitting a multilevel general linear model (GLM) with healthiness and tastiness of food items as predictors and food preference ratings as the outcome variable. This multi-level model yielded beta-weights for the taste and the health regressors for each participant, with larger beta-weights indicating greater importance of the regressor in predicting food preference ratings. While the two groups had similar health weights during the baseline phase, they diverged during the social influence phase (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2A-</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3A-B)</ref>. This suggests that social influence may generalize less based on the tastiness dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>The second online experiment aimed to replicate the results of Study 1 in a different data set from a different country (France, N=205) and using a different set of food items. The time courses of healthiness beta weights for the two groups are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2C</ref>.</p><p>Paralleling the findings of Study 1, the Health group (NH=103, M=5.03, STD=8.23) had significant higher healthiness weights during the social influence phase than the Taste group (NT=102, M=2.32, STD=8.69), controlling for baseline weights, t(202)=-2.00, p=0.047, Cohen's d=0.28 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2D</ref>). As in Study 1, there was no significant difference between the Taste (M=12.20, STD=7.17) and Health (M=10.71, STD=6.58) groups for the tastiness weights during the social influence phase, t(202)=1.08, p=0.28, Cohen's d=0.15 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure    3C</ref>-D).</p><p>Study 2 further tested whether the generalization of social influence would transfer to food choices in an ecological online grocery store task (Howe's Grocery https://openscienceonlinegrocery.com/), in which participants were instructed to select foods for next day's breakfast and some snacks. To measure the healthiness of participants food choices in the supermarket task, we computed the average 'health star points' (an objectively defined measure of food healthiness, as implemented in the experimental online grocery store) of selected products in participants' basket. We first tested whether participants' health preferences in the food rating task was consistent with their food choices the supermarket task. Indeed, we found a positive and significant correlation between the healthiness beta weights during the social phase and objective health score of the selected products in the online supermarket (r(203)=0.34, p&lt;.001, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4A</ref>). Thus, participants whose food ratings were more driven by the healthiness of food items during the social learning task also made healthier food choices in the online supermarket task, supporting the consistency of both measures. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, the Health group (M=0.43) did not select significantly healthier food items (i.e., items with higher health star points) in the supermarket task compared to the Taste group (M=0.49), t(203)=-0.11, p=0.913, Cohen's d=0.02 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4C</ref>). Thus, in Study 2, the learning from the main task did not significantly transfer to this second, supermarket task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENERALIZATION OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE EFFECTS ON VALUATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study</head><p>The aim of the third study was to replicate the generalization of social influence effects in an in-person laboratory study (N=64 participants). This allowed us to use willingness-to-pay (WTP) as an incentive-compatible measure of how much participants valued the food items, by using a second price auction to actually implement one of their food choices (see Methods <ref type="bibr">and Plassmann et al., 2007 for details)</ref>, thus reducing the influence of demand effects on changes in food preferences.</p><p>Time courses of health weights are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2E</ref>. As in the two previous studies, during the social influence phase (controlling for baseline), the Health group (NH=32, M=0.19, STD=0.16) put significantly greater weights on the healthiness of food items than the Taste group (NT=32, M=0.10, STD=0.16): t(61)=-2.22, p=0.030, Cohen's d=0.57 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2F</ref>).</p><p>As previously, the weights for food tastiness did not significantly differ between the Health (M=0.11, STD=0.11) and the Taste group (M=0.10, STD=0.11), t(61)=0.10, p=0.92, Cohen's d=0.03 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3E</ref>-F).</p><p>As in Study 2, participants performed the online supermarket task following the food rating task. We again found a positive and significant correlation between individual weights for food healthiness during the social influence phase and average objective health score during the supermarket task (health 'star points'), r(62)=0.44, p&lt;.001 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4B</ref>). Further and in line with our hypothesis, the Health group bought significantly healthier food items on average (i.e., items with higher objective health scores) than the Taste group, t(58)=2.43, p=0.018, Cohen's d=0.61 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4D</ref>). This suggests that the generalization of social influence effects on food choices transferred to a second, independent and more ecologically valid task in Study 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>People's behavior is influenced by how other people behave. A well-established and health-relevant example is eating behavior: Observation of other people's food choices influences both the type and amount of food we eat <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Higgs, 2015)</ref>, and such social context effects may translate into important effects on health and well-being in the long-term. Social influence is typically shown for specific observations of behavior (e.g., choosing specific food items). Less is known on how humans infer more general social norms and how this influences their behavior. Here, we tested the idea that social influence may generalize based on inferred conceptual dimensions. More specifically, we studied whether the effects of other people's food ratings can generalize based on two common conceptual attributes of food items: tastiness and healthiness. In line with our hypothesis, the results of three different experiments consistently showed such conceptual generalization of social influence, namely a change in how people's food preferences were driven by health aspects. In other words, by observation how peers rated different food items, participants inferred how much importance their peers assigned to food healthiness. This inferred importance of the healthiness of the food item for others then influenced participants' subsequent food preferences, leading to a higher or lower preference for healthy food items. We did not observe a significant change in how people weighted tastiness of foods and were only partially successful in extending this social generalization of health weighting to an independent online supermarket food choice task (discussed further below). Taken together, these findings suggest that people implicitly infer the more general social norms driving other people's opinions and adjust their own preferences accordingly-at least for knowledge-related conceptual attributes such as healthiness, but not for more subjective attributes such as tastiness of foods.</p><p>These findings build on and further inform recent frameworks of how humans learn, generalize, and represent conceptual relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Behrens et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Constantinescu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dunsmoor &amp; Murphy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Koban et al., 2021)</ref>. A long history of work has investigated the generalization of conditioned cue-stimulus association along perceptual similarity gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guttman &amp; Kalish, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shepard, 1987)</ref> and perceptual generalization also guides social decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(FeldmanHall et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">FeldmanHall &amp; Dunsmoor, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">van Baar et al., 2021)</ref>. Moreover, humans also generalize learned associations based on conceptual relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dunsmoor &amp; Murphy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tenenbaum &amp; Griffiths, 2001</ref>). For instance, humans also use categories and abstract representations to generalize learnt fear responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dunsmoor &amp; Murphy, 2015)</ref> and pain modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Koban et al., 2018)</ref>. In the context of food choices, a recent study has used an evaluative conditioning paradigm to show that pairing a few unhealthy food items with unpleasant words or pictures leads to a lower preference for other unhealthy compared to healthy food items <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bui &amp; Fazio, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our results suggest that such conceptual learning and inference processes could also be at play during social interactions and social influence. They resonate with a study that used social influence together with a hidden detection covariation design <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lewicki, 1986)</ref> to implicitly shift attractiveness ratings of faces based on one perceptual features of the rated images (namely hair length) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ivanchei et al., 2019)</ref>. Recent work has also used computational learning models to understand how people infer other agents' mental states (e.g., beliefs and desires) based on their observable actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jara-Ettinger, 2019)</ref>. For instance, theory of mind problems could be described with inverse reinforcement learning models, which allow to recover latent world models and reward functions given observed policy execution (Jara-Ettinger, 2019). In the present study, in which ratings of others were observed for different food items, a possible underlying cognitive mechanism is the identification of the latent reward function (or higher-order social norms) that best explain the variability in social ratings. Identifying the higher-order social norms and reward functions that drive other people's decision-making then allows the observer to be influenced by them and to not only conform to specific behaviors but to social norms more globally.</p><p>This perspective also aligns well with recent findings and models in neuroscience.</p><p>Several studies have suggested that humans use grid-like code to navigate not only spatial, but also perceptual and conceptual relationships between objects, allowing them to make decisions about situations and object that they have never encountered in the same configuration before <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Constantinescu et al., 2016)</ref>. Grid-like fMRI activity has been observed in hippocampal and parahippocampal areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Doeller et al., 2010)</ref>, as well as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Constantinescu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Park et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Park et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Schafer &amp; Schiller, 2018)</ref> known to be involved in abstract cognition, memory, and spatial orientation. VmPFC in particular has been suggested to guide behavior and decision-making by extracting abstract situational features and conceptual models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Koban et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Schuck et al., 2016)</ref> and has also been associated with social and non-social reward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hiser &amp; Koenigs, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Smith &amp; Delgado, 2015)</ref>, modulation of valuation by health-concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hare et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schmidt et al., 2018)</ref>, and by social influence on food preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nook &amp; Zaki, 2015)</ref>. The vmPFC would thus be a candidate region for mediating conceptual generalization processes, including generalization of social normative influence. Future studies could use brain imaging to test these hypotheses.</p><p>While social influence generalized based on the importance of healthiness of food items in all three experiments, no significant difference between the two groups was found for the importance given to tastiness. Several reasons may explain this absence of effect for taste weighting. First, how tastiness of food items is more idiosyncratic than perception of healthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Puputti et al., 2019)</ref>. It may therefore have been more difficult for participants to accurately detect the social weighting of tastiness, therefore limiting is possible generalization.</p><p>However, previous evidence also suggests that importance of healthiness is more easily modifiable than weighting of tastiness. For example, studies with different social norm interventions have failed to find an impact on taste but shown it for health <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Garcia, Hammami, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marty et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mollen et al., 2013)</ref>. While taste preferences are difficult to change, there are many studies showings social modeling of healthy food choices is a robust phenomenon in different contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ammerman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Higgs et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Li et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Robinson et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Robinson et al., , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Thomas et al., 2017)</ref>. This is consistent with a recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Melnyk et al., 2021)</ref> showing that social norms have an especially large effect on socially responsible behavior in general. Purely tastiness-driven eating is not perceived as a positive social norm which could explain why participants were less influenced by taste-related norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Higgs et al., 2019)</ref>. The timing of taste and health perception might also contribute to this difference. On average, people estimate a food's tastiness more than 450ms before its healthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sullivan &amp; Huettel, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENERALIZATION OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE EFFECTS ON VALUATION</head><p>Together, these findings are in line with the idea that health considerations are a more controlled, 'top-down' process, which may be more readily modulated by social norms than more bottom-up appetitive processes such as food preferences based on tastiness.</p><p>In the last two studies, we also tested whether generalization of social influence in our experimental task could transfer to an ecological online supermarket task. Our results in Study 3, but not in Study 2, showed such a transfer, by demonstrating healthier food choices in the online supermarket by participants in the Health-norm compared to participants in the Taste-norm group. These findings build on other recent studies that have shown transfer of learned strategies to regulate food craving across different food images and to real-life eating behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boswell et al., 2018)</ref>. Other studies have also found maintenance over time directly after the experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Higgs et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Thomas et al., 2017)</ref> or five months after . However, Study 2 did not show a significant group difference in the supermarket task and showed smaller effect size for the main social influence task as well.</p><p>Several differences between Studies 2 and 3 may explain this absence of effect. Study 2 was conducted online in France and assessed food preference ('would like to eat') ratings, while Study 3 was conducted in the laboratory in Germany and measured non-hypothetical willingness-to-pay (WTP) for food items. The incentive compatible measure of WTP and the more interactive and more controlled lab setting likely lead to higher engagement in the task and may also increase sensitivity to social norms. Further, differences between participant populations (Paris, France versus Bonn, a smaller city in Germany) and food products shown may also contribute to the different results. Demographic factors such as proportion of female versus male participants, BMI, income, and education differed slightly between the two studies. However, these factors were not correlated with the objective health score and are thus unlikely to substantially alter the results.</p><p>We note several other limitations of our study. First, the study participants were relatively young and highly educated adult population. Social influence, especially towards healthy foods, may have a greater impact in this population <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Higgs, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Li et al., 2016)</ref>, potentially due to differences in beliefs and concerns about healthy diets <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wardle et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Future studies should test whether these effects are also observed in more representative samples. Second, we used the health and taste ratings from large sample of different participants in order to not evoke these two dimensions prior to our experimental manipulation and to reduce the time spent in the online surveys. This may have reduced the size of the generalization effects, due to idiosyncratic differences in health and taste perception. Future studies could acquire participant's idiosyncratic health and taste ratings to obtain better representations of this two-dimensional conceptual space.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of our three studies showed that people infer social norms regarding the importance of healthiness when observing other people's food ratings and these GENERALIZATION OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE EFFECTS ON VALUATION implicit norms shift their own food preferences. Taste might be less susceptible to social influence due to idiosyncratic perceptions of tastiness and more automatic processing of taste, compared to health attributes. Future studies could test generalization of social influence effects in other domains and characterize the brain mechanisms underlying these effects.</p><p>Given that social norms are one of the most efficient ways to change behavior and decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Zhao et al., 2022)</ref>, better understanding how social norms are inferred and how social influence can generalize across different instances and contexts opens new possibilities for interventions to encourage healthier eating and other health-related behaviors in everyday life.</p><p>More broadly, our findings suggest a new mechanism of how human behavior can be influenced by unspoken social norms even in new instances, thus providing new insight in how human learn about and adapt to group norms and culture.</p></div>

The two groups were matched for age, BMI, and sex ratio, education, and income level (all p's&gt;0.57, see <ref type="table">Table Supplementary S1</ref>).</p><p>In all three studies, participants provided informed consent and were paid for their time.</p><p>The studies were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review board of INSEAD (Studies 1-2) and Bonn University (Study 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>During the first 16 trials of the food rating task (baseline phase), all participants rated the same 16 food items (presented in randomized order) without any social information, allowing us to control for participants' habitual weighting of health and taste considerations.</p><p>Then, during the social influence phase (80 trials in Studies 1 and 3, 64 trials in Study 2), participants were presented with the ratings of several other participants following their own rating.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups using a pseudo-random number generator of Qualtrics. In the Health group, healthier but less tasty food items were associated with higher average preference ratings of others, whereas unhealthy but tasty items were associated with lower social ratings. In the Taste group, tastier GENERALIZATION OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE EFFECTS ON VALUATION but less healthy food items received higher preference ratings from others than healthier and less tasty items (see also <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B)</ref>. See below for more details on the selection of social ratings for the different food stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and materials</head><p>Food items. In each of the three studies, participants were presented with photos of 80 different snack food items, such as chips, nuts, fruits, and chocolate bars. All items were shown on a black background and selected from INSEAD's standardized picture databases (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schmidt et al., 2018)</ref> of German (in Study 1 and 3) or French supermarket products (in Study 2). Each item i had been previously rated by independent online participants (N=105 for the German food database, N=298 for the French food database) for its healthiness (healthi), 'How healthy is this product?', tastiness (tastei), 'How tasty is this product?', willingness to pay (WTP) 'How much are you willing to pay for this product?' and familiarity ('How familiar are you with this product?'). The healthi and tastei in SocValue(i) were based on these health and taste ratings. Food cues were selected to systematically vary in healthiness and tastiness. Further, we divided the 80 food stimuli into five sets of 16 stimuli, such that each set contained four items rated high tastiness and low in healthiness, four items high in tastiness and high in healthiness, four items low in tastiness and low in healthiness, and four items low in tastiness and high in healthiness, with each of this four ad-hoc categories being matched for familiarity, and such that each set of 16 times was matched for average healthiness, tastiness, and familiarity. This allowed us to present the five matched sets in random order and to investigate the time course of social generalization effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social ratings.</head><p>During the social influence phase, we presented the ratings of ten (Studies 1-2) or seven (Study 3) previous people after participants had submitted their own rating. The social ratings were displayed as small circles on a visual analog scale that matched the VAS that participants used for their own ratings (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1A)</ref>. They were simulated (Studies 1-2) or selected (Study 3) as a function of the taste and health attributes of each food items. More specifically, for each food item i and each experimental condition, we used the following equation to simulate a mean social value (SV) for each food item i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">%&amp;(() = +, ! + +, " ℎ/012ℎ # + +, $ 20,2/ #</formula><p>Where βs0 reflects a fixed intercept (βs0=20 in Studies 1-2, βs0=1.2, to avoid values below 0), βsH reflects the weighting of health in the social ratings, and βsT reflects the taste weighting in the social ratings, with healthi describing the healthiness and tastei the tastiness of each food item. Social weighting of health and taste differed between the two experimental groups in order to create two different social influence conditions. In the Health group, health had a high weight (βsH=0.8 in Studies 1-2, βsH=0.7 in Study 3) and taste had a low weight (βsT=-0.2 in Studies 1-2, βsT=0.2 in Study 3). The opposite was the case for Taste group (βsH=-0.2 and βsT=0.8 in Studies 1-2, βsH=0.2 and βsT=0.7 in Study 3).</p><p>For Studies 1-2, in order to create ten different ratings (to reflect the ratings of ten other individuals) for each food item and each condition, we used Matlab 2018b to generate Gaussian distributions with SV(i) as the mean and a standard deviation of 15, from which we drew a random set of ten social ratings. For Study 3, we chose the seven WTP ratings in the INSEAD food database of German supermarket products that were closest to the simulated ratings. This approach added some variation around the simulated mean social values, thus leading to realistic and plausible values, as previous results have shown that people's food choices and brain valuation signals can be modeled based on taste, health, and other attributes <ref type="bibr">(Maier et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rangel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schmidt et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>Studies 1-2 were conducted online and launched in the late afternoon to early evening.</p><p>In Study 3, participants performed the tasks on computers in individual cubicles of the BonnEconLab, at the same time as several other participants in the late afternoon. This timing ensured that participants were moderately hungry (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref>) and likely interested in the snack food items presented.</p><p>The food rating task, administered via Qualtrics, consisted of 96 trials (in Study 1 and 3) or 80 trials (Study 2) that were composed of several blocks of 16 trials each ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A)</ref>.</p><p>The first block constituted a baseline, in which participants were presented 16 different food items and rated how much they would like to eat the shown item at this moment ("'How much would you like to eat this?", Study 1-2, see below) or how much they are willing to pay for this item (WTP, Study 3, see below), without any social ratings presented. This baseline block allowed us to verify that there were no group differences in food preferences before the social influence manipulation. The subsequent social influence phase was composed of five (Study 1 and 3) or four (Study 2) continuous blocks (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. During the social influence phase, participants first rated the food item and were then presented (for at least 3s and until they continued per mouse click) with what we told them were the ratings of several other people for the same food item ('social ratings').</p><p>The first four blocks during the social influence phase (T1-T4) presented a total of 64 different food items (all different from each other and different from the items shown during the baseline phase). The order of food items was randomized within blocks and the order of blocks T1-T4 was counterbalanced across participants to obtain a similar composition of health and taste features in each block. The 5th block (Studies 1 and 3 only) was composed of the same food items as during the baseline, allowing us to test the effects of social norm learning on both unseen and previously rated food items. However, due to limited statistical power, we do not compare bin-by-bin differences in our effects. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Study 1-2)</ref>. In all trials of Studies 1 and 2, participants rated the food items ('How much would you like to consume this product at this moment?') on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much) (self-paced and without time limit), which was displayed underneath the photo of the food item. Ten social ratings were subsequently presented on a similar VAS, again underneath the food picture (for at least 2s and a maximum of 8s, if participants did not click to advance the survey).</p></div>

As instructed, a random trial was selected at the end of the experiments and a price between 0-3 Euro was randomly generated by a computer algorithm. If the bid was as high or higher than the price generated by the computer, the participant had to pay the price and received the food item, otherwise they did not have to pay and did not receive any food item.</p><p>After the WTP rating, participants were presented with the WTP of previous participants, again shown on the same scale below the picture of the food item (for at least 2s and a maximum of 8s, if participants did not click to advance the survey).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supermarket task.</head><p>In Studies 2 and 3, participants performed an online supermarket task following the food choice task. We used Howe's Grocery (https://openscienceonlinegrocery.com/), an online supermarket developed for research purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Howe et al., 2022</ref>) which allows to investigate food decision-making in a naturalistic setting very similar to many real online grocery shops <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1D</ref>). Participants were asked to select several food items in the online supermarket with the following instructions: 'Imagine that you move to the US for a 3-month internship. When you arrive in your apartment you need to get some groceries for GENERALIZATION OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE EFFECTS ON VALUATION tomorrow's breakfast and some snacks for the day. Buy what you would like from the online supermarket below. Keep in mind that in total, you should spend any amount between 40-60 US Dollar.'. The participants were aware that this was a hypothetical purchasing task and that they would not pay for or receive any food ordered in Howe's Grocery Store.</p><p>Other measures. Before and after the task, participants rated how hungry they felt (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref>). They provided basic demographic measures, self-reported height and weight (allowing us to compute their body mass index / BMI), as well as general dietary habits using custom items.

All statistical tests used a significance threshold of p &lt; 0.05 (two-sided). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to examine the normality distribution of each variable. Data were analyzed using Matlab version R2020b, R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2020), and RStudio version 1.2.5001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supermarket task.</head><p>We analyzed the healthiness of products selected in the participants' shopping basket at check-out, by computing the average health star points of all the food items in participants' online basket at the time of check-out ('health star points).</p><p>Howe's Grocery store includes detailed information regarding the nutritional composition of each food item, including calories, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, sugar, protein, and other measures. Based on its nutritional composition, each food is associated with an aggregate health measure, the so-called 'health star points'. The health star points ranged from minus ten to ten, with greater values indicating more healthiness (see details in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Howe et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Food items high in vitamins, minerals, fiber, whole grains, and omega-3 have higher number of health star points, whereas foods with saturated and trans fatty acids, added sodium, added sugar and artificial colors have a lower number of health star points. <ref type="figure">Figures    Figure 1. Experimental design and hypotheses. A)</ref> Task design. During the food choice task (left and middle), participants had to rate different food items, which varied on healthiness and tastiness (healthi and tastei,) as rated by an independent sample of participants. Brighter versus darker colored bars illustrate less to more healthy (light to darker blue) and less versus more tasty (light to darker red) food items (randomized across participants). During the baseline phase (left), participants were presented with 16 food items in total without receiving any social feedback. During the social influence phase, participants were presented with 64-80 food items. For each food item, they rated how much they would like to eat it and were then presented with what we told them were the ratings of several other individuals. In Studies 2-3 and following the food rating task, participants performed a naturalistic online supermarket task. They were instructed to select several foods and drinks, as if they had to buy groceries for next days' breakfast and snacks. B) Selection of social ratings in the two experimental conditions in all three studies. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions of the food rating task. In the health group, the mean social value (SV) of each food item i was computed with a high beta weight for the item's healtiness (healthi) and a low weight for it's tastiness (tastei). In contrast, in the taste group, the mean social value (SV) of each food item i was computed with a high beta weight for the item's tastiness (tastei) and a low weight for it's healtiness (healthi). Several ratings were randomly drawn from a distribution around the mean SV to ensure plausible and variable social ratings. Thus, as illustrated on the right side, in the health group, healthy items such as vegetables or fruit would be followed by relatively high ratings, whereas unhealthy but tasty items such as chocolates or sweets would be followed by relatively low ratings. In the taste group, this relationship was the other way around. C) Hypotheses. We expected that participants in the health group would over time increase how much healthiness of food items influenced their food ratings as influenced by increased beta weights for healthi, whereas participants in the taste group would show lower influence of health considerations in their choices during the social influence phase. The opposite pattern was expected for the influence of taste on food ratings (beta weights of tastei). We further expected that this effect would transfer to a second, independent supermarket task, such that participants in the health group would select healthier food items (as measured by a higher objective health star point score) than participants in the taste group. the Health group showed significantly higher health beta weights than the Taste group during the social influence phase. C) Study 2. Time course (per 16 trial bins) of beta weights of healthiness on food ratings in the health group (in blue) and the taste group (in pink). B) Group difference (Study 2).
