			<abstract>
				<p>The dynamics of decision-making have been widely studied over the past several decades through the lens of an overarching theory called sequential sampling theory (SST). Within SST, choices are represented as accumulators, each of which races toward a decision boundary by drawing stochastic samples of evidence through time. Although progress has been made in understanding how decisions are made within the SST framework, considerable debate centers on whether the accumulators exhibit dependency during the evidence accumulation process; namely, whether accumulators are independent, fully dependent, or partially dependent. To evaluate which type of dependency is the most plausible representation of human decision-making, we applied a novel twist on two classic perceptual tasks; namely, in addition to the classic paradigm (i.e., the unequal-evidence conditions), we used stimuli that provided different magnitudes of equal-evidence (i.e., the equal-evidence conditions). In equal-evidence conditions, response times systematically decreased with increases in the magnitude of evidence, whereas in unequal-evidence conditions, response times systematically increased as the difference in evidence between the two alternatives decreased. We designed a spectrum of models that ranged from independent accumulation to fully dependent accumulation, while also examining the effects of within-trial and between-trial variability. We then fit the set of models to our two experiments and found that models instantiating the principles of partial dependency provided the best fit to the data. Our results further suggest that mechanisms inducing partial dependency, such as lateral inhibition, are beneficial for understanding complex decision-making dynamics, even when the task is relatively simple.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>For decades, decision-making researchers have proposed various concepts detailing how the state of the evidence evolves throughout the decision-making process, yet a general consensus concerning the nature of the decision-making process remains elusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carland, Thura, &amp; Cisek, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jones &amp; Dzhafarov, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ratcliff, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Teodorescu &amp; Usher, 2013)</ref>. Because decision models play such an important role in enhancing our understanding of individual differences in cognitive dynamics, uncertainty about the general architecture of evidence accumulation has produced a growing tension. We argue that one explanation for our lack of consensus is the sufficiency criterion in the model development process. The field has evolved a set of benchmarks that all models must pass in order to be considered a reasonable description of the decision-making process. For example, a standard paradigm is to present stimuli with varying levels of support for one of multiple (e.g., two) alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Erlick, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee &amp; Janke, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ratcliff, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Swensson, 1972)</ref>. Another benchmark involves the data that result from changes in the task instructions, such as emphasizing the speed or accuracy of the decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Strayer &amp; Kramer, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Vickers, Burt, Smith, &amp; Brown, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Vickers &amp; Smith, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Vuckovic, Kwantes, Humphreys, &amp; Neal, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wagenmakers, Ratcliff, Gomez, &amp; McKoon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wickelgren, 1977)</ref>. Somewhat paradoxically, due to our consensus about experimental benchmarks, all serious theoretical contenders have been optimized to pass these benchmarks with ease, ultimately creating a theoretical stalemate until other experimental benchmarks are employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tsetsos, Usher, &amp; McClelland, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In this article, we present a simple, yet nonstandard manipulation nested within the standard benchmarks across two different experiments. Specifically, the tasks include conditions with equal-evidence, variable total sums of evidence within the stimulus, and varying differences in supporting evidence between the options. This stimulus design affords a variety of conditions and patterns that must be captured simultaneously, and thus provides strong constraints on extant theoretical treatments of how stimulus evidence maps onto decision variables (i.e., choice and response time).</p><p>Although the experiments reported below are clearly valuable as a benchmark for subsequent theoretical developments, they are ultimately a means to an end. In this article, our goal is to test and evaluate the relative capabilities of different evidence accumulation architectures. We focus our analyses on three types of dependency that may exist among choice alternatives: fully dependent, partially dependent, and independent. To provide a rigorous evaluation, we designed a set of 12 models, each of which instantiate various forms of dependency among alternatives. The data alone provide strong evidence against fully dependent and independent architectures, leaving only partially dependent architectures as a reasonable explanation for our data. Although we also provide full evaluations of within-and between-trial variability, ultimately these analyses reveal that such variation cannot compensate for the architectural deficits of fully dependent and independent accumulator models.</p><p>The outline of this article is as follows. First, we review extant theoretical accounts of evidence accumulation, emphasizing their differences with respect to assumptions about dependency among choice alternatives. Second, we review various experimental paradigms that motivated our specific design. Third, we discuss previous model comparison efforts, noting the distribution of models tested as well as the experimental data used to evaluate the models. Fourth, we provide some "theoretical predictions" from the three classes of model architecture (i.e., fully dependent, independent, and partially dependent) for the types of manipulations used in our experiments. Although these evaluations are inconclusive because they do not explore the full range of possible forms of models within each class, we hope this section orients the reader to the notion that the architecture alone mandates specific predictions for the patterns in behavioral data that can be expected from the experimental designs we use in this article. Fifth, we describe our two experiments and the pattern of key variables in succession. Sixth, we provide two detailed analyses. In the first analysis, we compare the full class of models by fitting each of them to the two experiments. Evidence for each model is evaluated, and a discussion about consensus is provided. In the second analysis, we further explore the role of within-and between-trial variability in accounting for these data, because combinations of these mechanisms have been provided as explanations for similar patterns of results. The results of our analyses indicate that partially dependent accumulator models, and in particular the Leaky Competing Accumulator model, are the preferred models for fitting to these kinds of data. Subsequently, we close with a discussion concerning previous modeling efforts involving the Leaky Competing Accumulator model and speculate about other models that could potentially fit our data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extant Theories about Evidence Accumulation</head><p>The process of decision-making has been mechanistically specified via the overarching theory of sequential sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cisek, Puskas, &amp; El-Murr, 2009</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wang, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Models within this framework assume that each choice alternative is represented as an accumulator, and these accumulators race toward a decision threshold by integrating noisy evidence for their corresponding alternatives. The integration of evidence with respect to time allows evidence for a particular alternative to accumulate, where each response alternative will accumulate at a different rate based on assumptions about how the physical stimulus maps onto the psychological perception. Once one of the alternatives reaches a prespecified amount of evidence (i.e., a threshold), a decision is made corresponding to the winning accumulator. The latency between stimulus presentation and an accumulator reaching a threshold is the decision time, but due to elicitation details such as visual encoding and motor response, a nondecision time parameter is often used to (linearly) shift the decision time to an explicit prediction about the response time from an experimental task.</p><p>One way to differentiate among many sequential sampling models is by degree of linkage between the accumulators in the model. By this approach, there are three different classes of accumulator models: fully dependent, partially dependent, and independent. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates how the evidence accumulation process transpires for each class of model. The model that was used to create the first panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> was the fixed FFI model, the model for the second panel was the LCA model, and the model for the third panel was the Race model with an LCA architecture. These models will be described in more detail in subsequent sections. In fully dependent models, evidence for one option is also evidence against the other option. As illustrated in the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, full dependency among alternatives implies perfect anti-correlation in the evidence accumulation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ratcliff, 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ratcliff, , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Turner, Sederberg, &amp; McClelland, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In partially dependent accumulator models, each option is represented by a separate accumulator, but, at each timestep, the value of each accumulator is affected by the input into the other accumulators or the value of the other accumulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Shadlen &amp; Newsome, 2001</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001)</ref>. Typically, in these models, stronger evidence in support of one option creates greater suppression of the evidence supporting the other options. As illustrated in the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, partially dependent models assume each piece of evidence affects every option to some extent, but the drive to each accumulator is not perfectly anticorrelated as it is in fully dependent accumulator models. The inhibition within the evidence accumulation process was inspired by, and is often likened to, global and local inhibitory dynamics in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bogacz, Brown, Moehlis, Holmes, &amp; Cohen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Shadlen &amp; Newsome, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">van Ravenzwaaij, van der Maas, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wang, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Independent accumulator models accumulate information pertaining to the corresponding alternative with zero consultation of other accumulation occurring in the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">LaBerge, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Merkle &amp; Van Zandt, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pike, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rouder, Province, Morey, Gomez, &amp; Heathcote, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Vickers, 1970)</ref>. Importantly, as illustrated in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the evidence accumulation process of one accumulator does not explicitly depend on the state of the other accumulator. In general, sequential sampling models have successfully captured a variety of decision-making data, which includes experiments presenting participants with difficult decisions where the differences in quality between the competing options are small (potentially the most constraining for the models). Some studies have used random dot kinematograms where the direction of coherent dot movement switches mid-trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Holmes, Trueblood, &amp; Heathcote, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Tsetsos, Gao, McClelland, &amp; Usher, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Winkel, Keuken, van Maanen, Wagenmakers, &amp; Forstmann, 2014)</ref>. Other studies have included conditions in their random dot motion (RDM) task where the motion coherence is equal to zero (no coherent movement in any direction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Heekeren, Marrett, Ruff, Bandettini, &amp; Ungerleider, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Palmer, Huk, &amp; Shadlen, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Studies have also examined perceptual decision tasks with multiple alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Niwa &amp; Ditterich, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tsetsos et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2004)</ref>. Several recent studies have examined decisions between choices with equal-evidence supporting each choice and multiple levels of total evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Krajbich, Armel, &amp; Rangel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pais et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pirrone, Azab, Hayden, Stafford, &amp; Marshall, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Smith &amp; Krajbich, 2018)</ref>. In the present study, we fit multiple representatives of each class of accumulator model to similar decisions as many of those listed above to determine which model is best able to capture all of these data patterns simultaneously.</p><p>Some previous studies have compared the three classes of accumulator models directly, but with conflicting results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ratcliff and Smith (2004)</ref> fit candidates from all three classes of accumulator models to signal detection and lexical decision data. These authors found that the fully dependent candidate fit both the signal detection and lexical decision data better than the independent model and both the fully dependent and independent candidates fit the lexical decision data better than the partially dependent model. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Teodorescu and Usher (2013)</ref> found the partially dependent model fit a fluctuating brightness discrimination task better than the independent model, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teodorescu et al. (2015)</ref> found the partially dependent model fit a different fluctuating brightness discrimination task better than the fully dependent model. As we outline below, we believe our work resolves some of this conflict concerning which of the extant models provides the best account of perceptual decision-making.</p><p>Although previous studies have examined the fit of sequential sampling models to many of the patterns observed in our data, there is no study to our knowledge that has attempted to fit equal-evidence conditions, zero evidence conditions, and unequal-evidence conditions simultaneously. Thus, we contribute a 2-choice RDM task where we manipulate the proportion of coherent motion in the left direction and the proportion of coherent motion in the right direction within the same trial. Throughout the article, we will refer to the proportion of coherent dot motion as simply "coherence". To ensure that our results were not related to perceptual effects that can contaminate responses made during RDM tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anstis, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Pilly &amp; Seitz, 2009)</ref>, we also created a different perceptual task where participants perform contrast judgments on grating stimuli. Both tasks have four equal-evidence conditions with varying amounts of total evidence and 12 unequal-evidence conditions with differing amounts of disparity in the evidence supporting the choices. We hypothesized that, by including multiple equal-evidence conditions in our task, the changes in response time at differing levels of evidence would be challenging for some accumulator models to fit simultaneously with the unequal conditions. In the following section, we provide theoretical predictions of the models to identify which qualitative patterns of results from our task could potentially be challenging for a given theory of decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical predictions</head><p>Before discussing our theoretical predictions, we explain here why our response distributions throughout the article are logarithmically transformed and then summarized by calculating the mean of the distribution. Although we appreciate the rich history emphasizing the shape of the response time distribution in discriminating among models, and, in fact, all our model fits are based on the full set of responses, in the subsequent figures we report only the mean of the log-transformed response times because these statistics alone are enough to discriminate among the models, given the design of our experiments. In general, response time distributions have long tails that can shift the calculation of the mean rightward even if the shift is only based on a few slow responses rather than the slower responses making up a significant density of the distribution.</p><p>Transforming the response time distribution using the logarithmic function before calculating the mean normalizes the distribution and shifts the tail back toward the highest density region. The logarithmic transformation subsequently makes comparisons of means to be unbiased by the slow responses occupying the tail of the distribution.</p><p>We illustrate in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> the qualitative predictions of the three classes of models for the patterns of response times and accuracies observed in our RDM task. To create this theoretical predictions figure, we assumed that all accumulator architectures made the same prediction at the baseline 0.0 condition. Our task induces a wide array of model predictions because it includes conditions with equal-evidence supporting each option at various levels of coherence and is designed such that comparisons can be made between conditions at different total levels of evidence. Although all models predict chance accuracy for each equal-coherence condition (not shown), the models make divergent predictions with regard to response time. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref>, a fully dependent accumulator architecture would make the same response time prediction regardless of the coherence level in the equal-coherence conditions. This is because evidence in each direction is perfectly anti-correlated, such that evidence supporting one option is perfect evidence against the other option. In this case, the evidence does not drive the accumulation process because there is no evidence supporting either option over the alternative, and the decision boundary is only reached due to noise in the model architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Turner, Gao, Koenig, Palfy, &amp; L. McClelland, 2017</ref>). If we assume the noise is fixed across conditions, the fully dependent architecture will predict the same response times for each equal-coherence condition. To address this limitation, some researchers have proposed mechanisms that adjust the overall level of noise based on the magnitude of the inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ratcliff, Voskuilen, &amp; Teodorescu, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teodorescu et al., 2015)</ref>. In Model Analysis 2, we investigate the utility of this approach with several models that examine the effect of both between-trial and within-trial variability on the model fits.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref> for the equal-coherence conditions, independent and partially dependent accumulator theories make a prediction in the equal-coherence conditions that is distinct from the fully dependent models. Independent accumulator theories and partially dependent accumulator theories would predict faster response times as the coherence in one direction increases because the evidence becomes stronger as the coherence increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Teodorescu &amp; Usher, 2013)</ref>. In an independent accumulator architecture, the strength of one accumulator does not directly affect the other accumulator, so the response times will become faster as the evidence increases. In a partially dependent accumulator architecture, the added drive in the system is reflected in the rate of accumulation that, unlike in the fully dependent accumulator theories, is not cancelled out because each accumulator only partially inhibits the other accumulators. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref> shows the predicted proportion correct for each of the three classes of accumulator theories for conditions where one coherence is equal to 0.3 and the other coherence is equal to some value less than 0.3. As the difference in coherence between each direction becomes smaller, fully dependent and partially dependent theories predict less accurate responses due to stronger inhibition by the accumulator representing the incorrect response on the accumulator representing the correct response. Independent accumulator theories also predict less accurate responses as the difference in coherence becomes smaller, however the severity of this predicted decrease in accuracy will be smaller than that predicted by both classes of dependent accumulator theories. Because the accumulators in these theories are independent, there is no inhibition preventing the accumulator representing the correct response from crossing the threshold the majority of the time. In these theories, the decrease in proportion correct can be attributed to the accumulator representing the incorrect response crossing the threshold more often at higher levels of evidence.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>, predicted response times for correct responses are illustrated for conditions where one coherence is equal to 0.3 and the other coherence is equal to some value less than 0.3. Both partially and fully dependent accumulator theories predict slower response times as the disparity between the coherence in the two directions decreases (i.e., as the decision becomes more difficult). For example, if the coherence in the left direction is 0.0 and is 0.3 in the right direction, there is less inhibition on the correct choice (0.3) than there is when the coherence in the left direction is 0.2. Less inhibition allows the accumulator representing the correct response to cross the decision threshold faster than that accumulator could if it faced more inhibition.</p><p>Independent accumulator theories predict equal or faster response times as the disparity between the coherence in the two directions decreases. For independent accumulator theories, the predicted response time distribution for a specific choice involves a calculation of the probability of making that choice, times the probability that one has not made the alternative choice at each time point t. To see how these predictions play out in our example, suppose we are trying to compute the probability of choosing the rightward response when the coherence for right is 0.3 and the coherence for the left is 0.1. In this situation, because the difference in coherence between the two options is relatively large, it will be highly likely that the 0.3 choice will be made relative to the 0.1 condition. Essentially, because there is little chance that the leftward accumulator will win, it becomes inconsequential in predicting the response time distributions regardless of choice. However, if the evidence for the leftward response increases to say 0.2, the probability of making a leftward choice has substantially increased. Now when making predictions for the probability of any response at time t, we must seriously consider the probability that a leftward choice will be made. For small t, the probability of making a response at that time increases, and this increase for small t decreases the probability of making a response at larger t because it becomes generally more likely that, if a response is made, the response is made at an earlier time point. The result is that although a comparison between say 0.3 and 0.1 is more accurate, it may actually be slower than a comparison between 0.3 and 0.2. This phenomenon is known as statistical facilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Luce, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Raab, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Townsend &amp; Nozawa, 1995)</ref>, where, when one coherence is 0.3, the accumulator representing the direction with a coherence of 0.2 crosses the threshold more often than the accumulator representing the direction with a coherence of 0.1. This process removes winning trials from the 0.3 coherence, resulting in a slower response time distribution for the correct response of 0.3 when the other coherence is 0.2 than when the other coherence is 0.1. It is important to note that, although we are predicting the direction of effect, we are making no claim with regard to whether that effect will be significant, which depends on other factors, such as the number of trials and participants.</p><p>We test these theoretical predictions in our analyses of the data from our two experiments. Our first analysis examines the accuracy and response time patterns observed in our experiments. The second analysis examines the fits of models representing each of our three classes of accumulator dependency (independent, partially dependent, and fully dependent) to our two data sets. The representative models we selected are: the partially dependent Feed-Forward Inhibition model (FFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Shadlen &amp; Newsome, 2001)</ref>, the partially dependent Leaky Competing Accumulator model (LCA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001)</ref>, and the independent Linear Ballistic Accumulator model (LBA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008)</ref> as well as two independent accumulator variants of the LCA model and one additional fully dependent implementation of the FFI model. The fully dependent implementation of the FFI model has a similar accumulation process to the popular Diffusion Decision Model (DDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ratcliff, 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ratcliff, , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Turner et al., 2016)</ref>. In our third analysis, we examine the impact of additional sources of variability on the model fits to both the RDM and the grating data.</p></div>

Both the proportion of coherent dot movement to the left and to the right were manipulated in the same stimulus, while the remaining dots moved in random directions. The proportion of dot coherence in either direction could be either 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3. Thus, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref>, there were 16 different experimental conditions the participants could encounter, including four different conditions where the proportion of dot coherence in the left and right directions was equivalent.</p><p>Before stimulus presentation, a fixation cross was presented on screen for a random duration between 0.75 and 1.25 seconds. In each trial, the stimulus remained on the screen until the participant indicated which direction had more coherent dot movement by pressing either the "D" key for the left direction or the "K" key for the right direction. Immediately following the response, feedback was presented in the center of the computer screen. The feedback was presented for 1 second and consisted of a green check mark symbol for a correct response, a red "X" symbol for an incorrect response, or the expression "Too Fast!" if the participant answered before 100 milliseconds had elapsed after stimulus onset. In the equal-coherence trials, the green checkmark and the red "X" symbols were presented randomly, such that "D" was the correct response in exactly half of these trials. Each participant completed 8 blocks with 60 trials each for a total of 480 trials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have shown how a simple perceptual decision-making task can potentially distinguish between different theories of decision-making. In equal-coherence conditions, participants responded more quickly as the total level of evidence increased, a finding that contradicts the predictions of fully dependent accumulator theories. Fully dependent theories predict equivalent response times regardless of the total level of evidence. Independent and partially dependent theories correctly predict the pattern of response times observed in the equal-coherence conditions. However, independent theories predict slightly faster response times in unequal-coherence conditions as the difference between the two options is reduced, whereas we observed significantly slower response times in our results. Only partially-dependent accumulator theories correctly predict all the behavioral patterns. To ensure that the results in our RDM task were not caused by perceptual effects that can affect responses in these kinds of tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anstis, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Pilly &amp; Seitz, 2009)</ref>, we also collected data in a similar task that used grating stimuli instead of RDM stimuli.</p></div>

These studies discuss how motion in an RDM task can be incorrectly classified by our visual systems, resulting in evidence supporting an option that actually should have no support. In this study, we presented our participants with two grating stimuli on each screen. Each grating stimulus had either the same or a different contrast than its counterpart which allowed us to create a similar set of manipulations as in Experiment 1.</p></div>

The stimuli were generated on Windows operating systems with Nvidia graphics cards.

The key parameter manipulated in each stimulus was how similar the stimulus is to the experiment background, a parameter we will call the "contrast" for the remainder of this article. As we have defined contrast, a grating with a larger contrast is easier to discriminate from the experiment background and a grating with a smaller contrast is more difficult to discriminate from the experiment background. Each grating had a 150 pixel-length radius with a 180 degree orientation. The phase shift of the sine wave controlling the grating was 0 cycles and the frequency of the sine wave was 20 cycles per pixel.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Experiment 2 replicated the key findings of Experiment 1, providing evidence that the results from Experiment 1 cannot be fully explained by perceptual effects that could have contaminated the RDM stimuli. In Experiment 2, as in Experiment 1, we observed faster response times in the equal-contrast conditions as the contrast between the stimuli and the background increased. In the unequal-contrast conditions, we observed slower response times and reduced accuracy as the difference in contrast between the two gratings decreased which was consistent with Experiment 1. Taken together, our results from Experiments 1 and 2 indicate this task could provide sufficient constraint to discriminate between the classes of accumulator theories, with the greatest support for the partially-dependent accumulator theories, provided those classes do generally predict the patterns of behavior we illustrated in the introduction. However, as we noted above, these theoretical predictions are based on the general architecture of the models and with a single parameter setting; that is, they do not address the many types of predictions the models could produce with different parameter settings, known as model flexibility. To examine whether any of the models are flexible enough to still capture patterns in our data, in the following sections, we fit each of the models using simulation-based Bayesian methods, which are known to balance model fit with model flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Palestro, Sederberg, Osth, Van Zandt, &amp; Turner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Turner, Sederberg, Brown, &amp; Steyvers, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Turner et al., 2016;</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Analysis 1</head><p>Although our behavioral analyses provide strong evidence in support of partially dependent accumulator models, the prior analyses did not provide a thorough quantitative assessment of specific models. Our prior analyses also did not explore the influence of variability in theories of decision-making, so we explored these influences in Model Analysis 2. Thus, we fit several well-studied models that implement either independent, fully dependent, or partially dependent accumulators in the evidence accumulation process to the data from Experiments 1 and 2. We fit each of the FFI model <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Shadlen &amp; Newsome, 2001</ref>), the LCA model <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001)</ref>, and the LBA model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008)</ref> to the full choice-response time distributions for each coherence condition using a simulation-based, Bayesian approach. In addition, we fit an additional fully dependent variant of the FFI model and two additional independent variants of the LCA model to the data, giving rise to 6 total models spanning the three classes of accumulator models: independent, partially dependent, and fully dependent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Feed-Forward Inhibition (FFI) Model</head><p>We chose the FFI model because it has a parameter that can be fixed to create a fully dependent model that resembles the DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Turner et al., 2016)</ref> or can be left free to create a partially dependent model. Because only one parameter is changed in the model between the two variants, we can directly compare how the fully dependent and partially dependent versions capture the essential trends in our data.</p><p>The FFI model assumes the inhibition on each accumulator is based on the average stimulus input to the other alternatives, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dx i = (ρ i − ν C − 1 j =i ρ j ) dt τ + ξ dt τ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">ξ ∼ N (0, η),<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">x i → max(x i , 0),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ν is the FFI parameter, ρ i represents the rate of evidence accumulation for the ith alternative, dx i represents the change in the value of the accumulator x i at each timestep, ξ ∼ N (0, η) represents the within-trial variability (ξ is recalculated at each timestep), and C represents the number of choice alternatives. We fixed dt = 0.01, τ = 0.1, and η = 1. Each accumulator x i is initialized to 0. At each timestep, each accumulator value changes until one accumulator has a value greater than or equal to the threshold α. At which point, the value of the threshold-surpassing accumulator plus non-decision time t 0 (a parameter representing perceptual and motor response) represents the response time for choice c made by the participant. Note, during this accumulation process, a lower boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bogacz, Usher, Zhang, &amp; McClelland, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Diederich, 1995)</ref> is in place such that if the accumulator becomes negative, it is reset to zero.</p><p>In fitting the FFI model to the data, for each of the four ρ i parameters, we specified a prior of a truncated normal distribution with a mean of 2.5, standard deviation of 5, lower bound of 0, and upper bound of 10. For ν, we specified a prior of a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.4 altered by an inverse logit transform. For α, the prior specified was a truncated normal distribution with a mean of 2.5, standard deviation of 10, lower bound of 0, and upper bound of 30. We specified a prior for t 0 of a uniform distribution with a lower bound of 0 and upper bound of the minimum observed response (unique for each participant).</p><p>We also fit a variant of the FFI model to the data where we fixed ν to 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Turner et al., 2016)</ref>. For clarity, we will call this variant of the model the fixed FFI model and the variant with ν free the free FFI model. By our definitions, the fixed FFI model is a fully dependent model and the free FFI model is a partially dependent model. In the two-alternative case, the fixed FFI model behaves similarly to the DDM in that the evidence accumulation process is completely anticorrelated. The only discrepancy between the fixed FFI and the DDM occurs when one accumulator is pushed downward to zero evidence. In the DDM, the losing accumulator would continue to decrease (i.e., become negative), whereas in the fixed FFI, the losing accumulator would just be perpetually reset to zero. This is a subtle difference that does not affect the model predictions given that losing accumulators tend to continue losing in our paradigm, but it is worth noting that the fixed FFI is not a perfect analogue to the DDM. We specified the same priors for the fixed FFI model as the free FFI with the exception of ν.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Leaky Competing Accumulator (LCA) Model</head><p>We included the LCA model in our study because it makes a different prediction from the FFI model about how partial inhibition during the evidence accumulation process is implemented. Whereas the FFI model explains that inhibition occurs via input competition, the LCA model explains that inhibition occurs laterally or based on the total value of the accumulator at each timestep. By comparing the fit of each model to the same dataset, we can determine which mechanism provides a more satisfactory explanation of the observed patterns. Because the leak-only LCA model is simply the LCA model without lateral inhibition, we will be able to further assess the importance of lateral inhibition to the model by comparing the fits of the two models. Furthermore, we can evaluate the importance of the passive decay of evidence by comparing the leak-only LCA model and the race LCA model, because that parameter is the only difference between the two models.</p><p>The LCA model is a partially dependent accumulator model where the stimulus input to one accumulator does not directly inhibit the values of the other accumulators. Instead, at each timestep, the total value of the other accumulators inhibits each accumulator. The model accounts for the passive decay of old information with a leakage parameter. The following differential equation describes the accumulation process in the LCA model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dx i = (ρ i − κx i − β j =i x j ) dt τ + ξ dt τ ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">ξ ∼ N (0, η),<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">x i → max(x i , 0),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where κ is the leakage parameter, β is the lateral inhibition parameter, ρ i represents the rate of evidence accumulation for the ith alternative, dx i represents the change in the value of accumulator x i at each timestep, and ξ ∼ N (0, η) represents the within-trial variability (ξ is recalculated at each timestep). We again fixed dt = 0.01, τ = 0.1, and η = 1. In the LCA model, each accumulator x i is initialized to 0. At each timestep, each accumulator value changes until one accumulator has a value greater than or equal to the threshold α. At which point, the value of the threshold-surpassing accumulator plus non-decision time t 0 represents the response time for choice i made by the participant. Again, during this accumulation process, a lower reflecting boundary is in place such that the value of the accumulator cannot become negative. In fitting the LCA model to the data, we specified the same priors for each of the ρ, α, and t 0 parameters as for FFI. For β and k, we specified a prior of a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.4 passed through an inverse logit transform.</p><p>We fit two additional variants of the LCA model to the data: the leak-only LCA and the race LCA models. In the leak-only LCA model, we fixed β to 0. We fit the leak-only LCA to the data to illustrate the importance of lateral inhibition to the LCA model <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Purcell et al., 2010</ref>). In the race LCA model, we fixed β and κ to 0. This change converts the LCA model into a racing diffusion model with a lower bound where the accumulators are independent of each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bogacz et al., 2007)</ref>. Both the leak-only LCA model and the race LCA model are independent accumulator models because they both lack the lateral inhibition parameter.</p><p>The Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) Model. Unlike the other models we examined, the LBA model represents the evidence accumulation process linearly rather than with noisy samples of evidence. The LBA model also considers variability in the starting point and variability in the drift rates as parameters in the evidence accumulation process, so we can compare the fits of this model to the other models and determine if these considerations are advantageous for fitting to these data. Note, we do not consider the LBA model to be a true between-trial variability model because variability in the drift rate and variability in the starting point are required for this model to generate response time distributions, because there is no within-trial variability present in the LBA model as there is in LCA and FFI models.</p><p>The LBA model represents each accumulator independently and assumes the path of each accumulator towards the threshold is linear as represented in the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">s i ∼ U (0, z),<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">d i ∼ N (ρ i , η),<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">x i = α − s i d i ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where s i and d i are, for the ith alternative, the starting point and the drive in the accumulation process respectively, α is the threshold, and η is fixed to 1. The LBA explains variability in the data by drawing uniform random values for the starting point of each alternative and by drawing normally-distributed random values for the drive in the accumulation process of each alternative. The decision time x i is calculated from the above equation and added to non-decision time t 0 to generate the response time. In fitting the LBA model to the data, we specified the same priors for each of the ρ, α, and t 0 parameters as for FFI and LCA. For z, the prior specified was a truncated normal distribution with a mean of 2.5, standard deviation of 10, lower bound of 0, and upper bound of 30. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> Summary of free parameters in the examined models and the priors for those parameters.</p><p>The logistic operation represents the inverse logit transform.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Details of the model-fitting process</head><p>As with the behavioral analysis, responses faster than 0.2 seconds and slower than 5 seconds were excluded from the model fitting process (&lt;3.2% of all data). We fit each model individually to each participant, and we applied Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC) via the RunDEMC library (https://github.com/compmem/RunDEMC) to sample from the posterior distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Turner et al., 2013)</ref>. For the DE-MCMC procedure, we initialized 10k parallel chains, where k is the number of free parameters per participant and simulated with the procedure for 400 iterations of burn-in followed by 1000 samples from the posterior per chain. To evaluate the quality of each proposal, we used the probability density approximation (PDA) method to approximate the likelihood function for each model <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Turner &amp; Sederberg, 2014)</ref>. We chose this procedure because it efficiently generates informative proposals by harnessing information about the structure of the posterior distribution. For PDA, we simulated each parameter proposal 50,000 times to generate an approximate density function which we then used to calculate the log likelihood.</p><p>The prior distributions for each parameter that are necessary to perform Bayesian inference are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. To compare the models and their variants, we used the Bayesian Predictive Information Criterion (BPIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ando, 2007)</ref>. BPIC is more stable and penalizes for complexity more than metrics such as the DIC and has a greater scope than other model selection criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ando, 2007)</ref>. BPIC is designed such that models with smaller BPIC values are preferred over models with larger BPIC values.</p><p>For each of the model variants, we mapped each of the four coherences (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) onto their own "drift rate" parameter, denoted as ρ in the previous model descriptions.</p><p>When ordered by unique coherence pairing, all 480 of our experimental trials can be grouped into ten partitions of data. We then simulated each model variant for each of these ten partitions using the appropriate pair of these ρ parameters for the given partition (i.e. ρ 0.0 and ρ 0.1 for the partition where coherence was 0.0 in one direction and 0.1 in the other).</p><p>Consequently, when iterating toward the best-fitting sets of parameter values, each model must find the four ρ parameter values that provide the best account of ten conditions given the architecture of that model. Each of the ten conditions corresponds to a different response time distribution, which means the selection of a given ρ parameter may result in a perfect fit to one condition, but at the cost of a substantially poorer fit to another condition. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> show the mean best-fitting parameter values for each model fit to the data from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 9</ref> are the BPIC values calculated for each model variant, mean-centered for each participant. For the model fits to the data from Experiment 1, the LCA model had the lowest BPIC value for 13 participants, the LBA model had the lowest value for 2 participants, and the fixed FFI model had the lowest value for 1 participant. For the model fits to the data for Experiment 2, the LCA model had the lowest BPIC value for 16 participants, the LBA model had the lowest value for 5 participants, and the fixed FFI model had the lowest value for 2 participants. Clearly, out of these model variants, the LCA model provides the best fit to these perceptual decision-making datasets. In all participants, the LCA model fit the data better than the race and leak-only model variants. This suggests the addition of the lateral inhibition parameter to the LCA model architecture is indeed necessary to provide a good fit to this dataset.    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows, in the non-zero coherence difference conditions from both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the independent accumulator models consistently predict a lower proportion correct than we observed. The independent models have too few mechanisms to account for all of the effects in these data, so, throughout the course of the model fitting process, parameters are selected that can fit as much data as possible. In this instance, it seems the best-fitting parameter values were chosen to fit the equal-coherence  data more because most observations lie within that subset. This resulted in a poorer fit to the remainder of the proportion correct data.   For this subset of response times from Experiment 1, the Fixed FFI model produced essentially the same mean log response time for each condition. In the fixed FFI model, evidence in each direction is nearly perfectly anticorrelated. So, when evidence in both directions is equal, the drift is equal to 0 and only noise is driving the accumulation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Thus, given a sufficient number of simulations, the fixed FFI model will predict essentially the same mean log response time for each equal-coherence condition, regardless of the level of coherence. For Experiment 2, the fixed FFI model again produced essentially the same mean log response time for each equal-contrast condition. The free FFI model also produced the same mean log response time for each equal-contrast condition. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, this is because, to achieve the best fit to this dataset, the best fitting value for the input competition parameter in the free FFI model was close to 1.0. When this parameter is set to 1.0, the free FFI model is equivalent to the fixed FFI model. One question to ask is why the best fitting input competition parameter ended up being 1.0 at the end of the model fitting process for the free FFI model in this case. The fits to Experiment 1 showed that the free FFI model can capture both the progressively decreasing response times in the equal evidence conditions and the progressively increasing response times in this subset of unequal evidence conditions, but the free FFI model was unable to simulate both patterns of response times for Experiment 2. As can be observed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we did not provide a strong constraint on the input competition parameter with our choice of prior distribution. Thus, over the course of the model fitting process, the algorithm determined that an input competition parameter near one provided the best fit to the most data.</p><p>One explanation for why the algorithm estimated a value of one on average for this parameter to fit Experiment 2 but estimated the parameter to be .832 on average to fit Experiment 1 could be the differences in response times between the two tasks. In the unequal evidence conditions, response times increased as the difference in evidence decreased in Experiment 1 more than the response times increased in Experiment 2. In other words, in the unequal evidence conditions, the effect of evidence difference on response time was more pronounced in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2. Similarly, in the equal evidence conditions, response times decreased more as the total evidence present in the stimulus increased in Experiment 1 than the response times decreased in Experiment 2. In the equal evidence conditions, the effect of total evidence on response time was more pronounced in Experiment 1 than Experiment 2. To account for these differences between the conditions, the algorithm found that 1.0 was the value that could best account for the multiple patterns in the dataset rather than a value less than 1.0 which would have created less input competition.</p><p>In general, the independent accumulator models produced faster response times as the evidence increased in the equal-evidence conditions, but, in many conditions, produced slower or faster response times than we observed. In Experiment 1, the independent models closely matched the response times in the 0.1 equal-coherence condition but produced slower response times than we observed in the 0.0 condition, slightly faster response times than we observed in the 0.2 condition, and much faster response times than we observed in the 0.3 condition. In Experiment 2, the independent models matched the 0.43 condition but greatly missed the observed response times of the other three conditions.</p><p>In the conditions where exactly one coherence was equal to 0.3 in Experiment 1, the two partially dependent accumulator models provided a good fit to the mean log response     <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> and to the proportion correct data displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. The fully dependent fixed FFI model provided a good fit to the proportion correct data observed in these conditions but generated faster response times than were observed in two of the conditions displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. All of the independent models showed the opposite pattern of results for the response times than we observed in these conditions. The mean log response times simulated by the independent models decreased as incorrect response coherence approached 0.3. In other words, the independent models produced faster response times as the trials became objectively more difficult for the participants. In addition, the independent models produced much lower proportion correct than we observed in each of these three conditions.</p><p>In the conditions where exactly one contrast was the highest contrast of 0.49 in Experiment 2, each of the dependent accumulator models simulated slower response times for correct responses as the contrast difference decreased. Of the dependent accumulator models, the LCA model appears to have matched the observed response times the best. Crucially, the independent accumulator models simulated faster response times as the contrast difference decreased. In general, the dependent accumulator models correctly produced the observed subset of response times and the independent accumulator models failed to produce the observed response times. Of the six models we examined, the LCA model simulated the closest proportion correct to the observed data. The other dependent accumulator models simulated the same proportion correct for each condition, resulting in a substantially higher proportion correct than observed in two of these conditions. In each of these conditions, the independent accumulator models simulated a lower proportion correct than observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Overall, the partially dependent accumulator models, and, in particular, the LCA model, consistently provided the best account of the data from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. These models correctly simulated the faster response times with greater  evidence in the equal-evidence conditions and slower response times as the difference between the evidence in the unequal-evidence conditions decreased. In contrast, while the fixed FFI model featuring fully dependent accumulators correctly simulated slower response times as the difference in evidence increased in the unequal-evidence conditions, it failed to simulate the faster response times observed as the evidence increased in the equal-evidence conditions. Furthermore, the three independent accumulator models we examined failed to simulate the slowing of response times for the correct choice of the 0.3 coherence when the competing coherence increases from 0.0 to 0.2. The independent accumulator models also predicted less accurate responses than we observed in each of the three unequal-evidence conditions we examined here. Thus, the models with partially dependent accumulators are the preferred models for fitting to our data.</p><p>Our tasks are similar to many standard perceptual decision-making tasks that have historically supported the models we examined, but combines all of these conditions together to create a challenging set of patterns of results for extant models of decision-making to fit.</p><p>A priori, we expected the independent accumulator models to provide a good fit to the equal-evidence data and provide a poor fit to the unequal-evidence data because the accumulator for the incorrect response does not directly inhibit the accumulator for the correct response. As predicted, because the independent accumulator models have no inhibitory components by definition, the models could not generate the slower response times as the decision becomes more difficult in unequal-evidence conditions. The independent accumulator models did generate faster response times as the coherence increased in the equal-evidence conditions, but, unexpectedly, the models generated slower response times than were observed in the 0.0 equal-coherence condition and faster response times than were observed in the 0.3 equal-coherence condition from Experiment 1. The independent accumulator models also, contrary to our predictions, generated slower response times than were observed in the 0.4 equal-contrast condition and faster response times than were observed in the 0.46 and 0.49 equal-contrast conditions from Experiment 2. We suspect the multiple constraints imposed by our task design caused these misses in some conditions where the theory would suggest a more accurate fit.</p><p>Fully dependent accumulator models have difficulty matching the response times observed in equal-evidence conditions. In a two-choice decision, this is the case because fully dependent models represent the drift rate towards the decision threshold as the difference between the two drift rates. Because the drift rates for both alternatives have the same value, the difference between them is zero. With a drift rate of zero, the evidence accumulator crosses the decision threshold solely based on random noise in the signal, which, on average, is equivalent across conditions.</p><p>Partially dependent accumulator models have the mechanisms to account for the choice-response time patterns observed in both the equal-evidence and unequal-evidence conditions of our experiments. In these models, for the equal-evidence conditions, the drift rates for the accumulators representing each direction will be greater with more evidence. Now the difference between these drift rates is zero, but, since the accumulators only partially inhibit each other, the accumulators will exceed the decision threshold more quickly with more evidence and produce the patterns observed in our data. Partially dependent accumulator models also capture the unequal-evidence data because the degree of inhibition on each accumulator will increase as the coherence difference decreases. As the decision becomes more difficult, response times are slower and accuracy approaches chance. Both features are captured well in partially dependent accumulator models.</p><p>Model Analysis 1 provided strong evidence supporting partially dependent accumulator models (and, in particular, the LCA model) over both fully dependent and independent accumulator models. Recent work has examined how the mechanisms of within and between-trial variability can be implemented in decision-making models to capture magnitude effects in simple perceptual decision-making tasks similar to those presented in this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ratcliff et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teodorescu et al., 2015)</ref>. We wanted to determine if adding these additional sources of variability into our examined models would change the fits and, in particular, give the fully dependent fixed FFI model the flexibility to provide a good fit to all of the patterns observed in our data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Analysis 2</head><p>As mentioned in the introduction, one approach to accounting for the decrease in response time as evidence increases in the equal-evidence conditions is to add sources of variability that are correlated with the evidence levels. In a similar manner to our experiments, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teodorescu et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ratcliff et al. (2018)</ref> have examined the fits of the LCA model and the DDM to data exhibiting magnitude effects. <ref type="bibr">Teodorescu and colleagues (2015)</ref> found that an implementation of the DDM where processing noise in the model increases with increased input intensity fit 3 out of 6 participants worse than the LCA model in the choice-response time data from a two-choice fluctuating brightness discrimination task, thereby not favoring either model. However, <ref type="bibr">Ratcliff and colleagues (2018)</ref> found that a similar implementation of the DDM provided a better fit in more participants than the LCA model to their fluctuating brightness discrimination task data.</p><p>We believe that one reason that these two studies published conflicting results is that the specific models compared differed by too many mechanisms for the key mechanism of the LCA model, lateral inhibition, to be fairly compared to the inhibitory process of the DDM. To uncover which model framework (partially dependent or fully dependent accumulation) and which additional sources of variability (between-trial or within-trial) provide the best account of these data, we decided to fit the relevant models from this line of research to our two experiments. We believe that we created a fair comparison of the extant mechanisms of the models by giving both the fixed FFI and LCA models the same additional sources of variability. Our work sits in contrast to this previous research where the LCA model was given no additional sources of variability whereas the DDM was given an additional source of either between-trial or within-trial variability. To implement the models in this way, we modified the LCA and the fixed FFI models to represent the drift rate as a linear function of the difference in magnitude of the stimulus strengths and added parameters and mechanisms to link within-trial and between-trial variability to the coherence of the input. Our modifications are similar to the modifications made in the previous work that examined the fits of these models to data where the overall evidence present in the stimulus was manipulated between trial while maintaining a constant difference in evidence between the choice alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ratcliff et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teodorescu et al., 2015)</ref>. We will now explain each of model variants in this study in turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>No Additional Variability Models</head><p>We examined both the fixed FFI model and the LCA model with no additional sources of variability than the models from Model Analysis 1, but with the change to how the drift rate in each model is calculated. In the remainder of the paper, we will call these models the NV fixed FFI model and the NV LCA model respectively. We fit these models to our data to determine if representing the rate of accumulation as a function of the difference in the stimulus values provides an acceptable (or even improved) fit than assigning a separate drift rate for each coherence or contrast value. One advantage of these models is that they have two fewer parameters than their model counterparts in Model Analysis 1. First, we standardized the stimulus values to be on a 0 to 1 scale (a separate 0 to 1 scale for the RDM task and for the grating task). Then, using the same 10 conditions that we used in Model Analysis 1, we calculated the differences between the stimulus values and scaled that difference by the parameter µ. Then our drift rate for each condition becomes the scaled difference value added to our single ρ parameter, which is still a free parameter in this model. The ρ parameter is necessary to allow the drift rate to be greater than 0 in the conditions where the evidence supporting each direction is equivalent.

For our purposes, the within-trial variability mechanism could allow the fixed FFI model to simulate faster response times as the evidence increases in the equal-evidence conditions and overcome the strong input competition in the model, which led to response time distributions that did not match the observed data in Model Analysis 1. In our implementation, we modulated within-trial variability through the parameter υ. As with the BTV models above, we added the within-trial variability mechanism to both the LCA model and the fixed FFI model.

Furthermore, the NV LCA ND, BTV LCA ND, and WTV LCA ND models each fit better than the fixed FFI and free FFI models with the same additional sources of variability.   LCA, and NV fixed FFI models closely match the observed proportion correct in every coherence difference condition. The BTV LCA and WTV fixed FFI models slightly underestimate the observed proportion correct in the 0.1 and 0.2 coherence difference conditions but simulate the correct proportion correct in the other two conditions for Experiment 1.The BTV fixed FFI model underestimates the proportion correct the more than the other 5 model variants, but this model correctly simulates increasing accuracy as coherence difference increases. For Experiment 2, all models provide similar fits to these data with the BTV fixed FFI having a slightly worse fit than the other models to the 0.1 and 0.2 conditions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> shows the fit of each model to the equal-evidence response time data from Experiments 1 and 2. Each model struggled to fit to some aspect of the data from Experiment 1 with the BTV LCA model providing the closest fit overall. As expected, for both Experiments 1 and 2, both the NV LCA model and the NV Fixed FFI model could not simulate the decrease in response time as the evidence increased. This is because the difference in stimulus strength is zero regardless of equal-evidence condition, and there is no other mechanism besides the difference that can adjust the response times as the stimulus magnitude changes. A stimulus strength of zero will result in the same response times irrespective of the amount of evidence present in the stimulus.</p><p>For Experiment 1, the BTV fixed FFI and WTV fixed FFI models simulate different response times than we observed in the equal-coherence data because the amount of inhibition upon each accumulator is high in spite of the additional sources of variability.

It appears that the mechanisms in these models are too insensitive to simulate the slope of the observed decrease in response time as a function of contrast condition. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> shows the fit of each model to the response times associated with the correct response in conditions where exactly one coherence is equal to 0.3 in Experiment 1 and where exactly one contrast is equal to the highest contrast in Experiment 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We fit both the LCA and fixed FFI models with additional sources of variability that have been proposed by other researchers to the RDM data from Experiment 1 and to the grating data from Experiment 2. Across the two experiments, an LCA model variant had the lowest BPIC value in 36 of the 39 participants. Both how the stimulus was represented in the model and how the sources of variability were added to each model were identical for the LCA and for the fixed FFI model. This suggests that even when between-trial variability gave rise to an improved fit, lateral inhibition is a key mechanism for attaining the best fit to our datasets instead of the fully dependent mechanism of the fixed FFI model. In general, the qualitative fits of all models to most conditions was good, but the BTV and WTV fixed FFI models simulated faster response times than were observed in the highest evidence equal-coherence condition of Experiment 1 and slower response times than were observed in the lowest evidence equal-contrast condition of Experiment 2.</p></div>

Although many mechanisms can be mixed to produce new model variants within these classes, the architectural constraints provide strong guidelines on how those models can ultimately behave. When the patterns of predictions defined by architecture are compared against experimental data involving exhaustive and systematic configurations of perceptual evidence embedded within the stimulus itself, strong tests emerge that can be used to provide theoretical support for types of architectures, and hence, classes of models.</p><p>A novel contribution of our task was the factorial manipulation of stimulus "coherence" for one of two options. That is, each stimulus was a mixture of evidence for alternative one (e.g., "left" response) and alternative two (e.g., "right" response), and the degree of evidence was manipulated such that stimuli could have equal amounts of evidence for both alternatives, zero evidence for both alternatives (i.e., a special case of equal evidence), or could have preferential evidence for one alternative. We used this basic factorial schematic within the classic paradigm of random dot motion, as well as contrast discrimination of grating stimuli. Both experiments exhibited strong consistency in terms of the patterns of data that emerged, providing evidence that the design itself reveals insight into decision-making processes, and the tasks are neither subject to idiosyncratic features of the stimuli nor the apparatus.</p><p>We then defined a set of models each inheriting a specific type of architectural constraint: full dependence, partial dependence, or independence. A set of 12 model variants were examined across two sets of analyses, ultimately revealing that while various mechanisms could be used to improve fits to data within a class, the architecture of dependency imposed on the class was strong enough to provide consensus about which type of dependency best captured choice-response time data across both experiments. These analyses revealed that partial dependency was the strongest contributor to model performance, evaluated as the total number of individuals best accounted for by each model. Specifically, the mechanisms of lateral inhibition and leakage as specified in the LCA model showed clear promise in explaining human decision-making across the tasks investigated here.</p><p>Given that our results show such strong consistency for partially dependent accumulation, one may wonder why other researchers with similar curiosities either failed to find consistency or found results that favored an alternative architecture. Similar to our study, recent work has examined the fits of the LCA model and the DDM to data where the overall evidence present in the stimulus changes, but the difference in evidence between the two options is consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ratcliff et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teodorescu et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Teodorescu and colleagues (2015)</ref> found that an implementation of the DDM where processing noise in the model increases with increased input intensity fit 3 out of 6 participants worse than the LCA model in the choice-response time data from a two-choice fluctuating brightness discrimination task. <ref type="bibr">Ratcliff and colleagues (2018)</ref> found that a similar implementation of the DDM provided a better fit in more participants than the LCA model to their fluctuating brightness discrimination task data. Contrary to these two studies, in our study, the LCA models fit to 36 of the 39 participants better than the fixed FFI model similar to the DDM implementation of the previous two experiments. This suggests that allowing either withinor between-trial variability to be a function of the magnitude of the input is insufficient for the DDM to fit these data better than the LCA model.</p><p>Within the category of partially dependent accumulator models, we found the LCA model to fit the data better than the free FFI model. In Model Analysis 1, the LCA model had the lower BPIC value than the free FFI model for all 39 participants across the two experiments. In Appendix C, we show the fits of the free FFI models with the same additional sources of variability as the models in Model Analysis 2. When both the LCA and free FFI models had the same sources of variability, the LCA model fit more participants better than the free FFI model. This is evidence that the interactive competition mechanisms of the LCA provide a better fit to these data than the input competition mechanisms of the free FFI model. Competition between the stimulus values themselves alone is not sufficient to account for the patterns observed in our dataset and lateral inhibition is necessary to provide the best explanation of our data.</p><p>One explanation for the discrepancy between the results of our study and the results of previous studies could be the specific models compared differed by too many mechanisms for the key mechanism of the LCA model, lateral inhibition, to be fairly compared to the full inhibition process of the DDM model. Particularly relevant to this paper, Teodorescu and colleagues (2015) compared models similar to the WTV LCA and WTV fixed FFI models, but did not consider the between-trial variability versions of the LCA and fixed FFI models, our BTV LCA and BTV FFI, respectively. Ratcliff and colleagues (2018) compared models similar to the BTV and WTV fixed FFI models and the NV LCA model, but did not include models similar to the BTV or WTV LCA models. In our study, the BTV LCA model quantitatively fit the data better than the NV LCA model indicating that the between-trial variability mechanism specifically improved the fit of the BTV model to our datasets over that of the NV LCA model. Furthermore, the only difference between the BTV LCA and BTV fixed FFI models were the passive decay of evidence and lateral inhibition processes of the LCA model against the fully dependent input competition process of the fixed FFI model. Because the BTV LCA model fit our datasets better than both the BTV and WTV fixed FFI model, it is possible that the BTV LCA model would have fit the data from <ref type="bibr">Ratcliff and colleagues (2018)</ref> better than the models they tested that were similar to the BTV and WTV fixed FFI models. However, it is interesting that even the NV LCA model outperformed the BTV and WTV variants of the fixed FFI models used here.</p><p>Given its prior success in capturing a wide range of decision-making data, it is perhaps unsurprising that the LCA model fit our data well.

We believe our fitting procedure and dataset satisfy these criteria. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>, we show the DE-MCMC chains for the LCA 100 300 500 700 900 1100 1300 At iteration 400, we switched over from burnin mode to sampling mode. After switching over from sampling mode, we waited for 200 additional samples before considering the chains as being a true sample of the posterior distribution. model fit to the data of one of the participants from Experiment 1. From this figure, it can be observed that proper mixing is occurring such that we can be confident that the posterior distributions will be well-estimated. In Appendix A, we show a successful recovery of the parameters of the BTV LCA model. Each of the generating BTV LCA model parameters was within the respective posterior distribution. To overcome the computational intensity of fitting the LCA model to data, our model fitting code was written such that it could be parallelized on a graphics processing unit (GPU). As a result, it only took 1 to 2 hours of compute time for each participant to produce full posterior distributions of the model parameters. Hence, we believe that computational concerns are no longer reasonable justifications for excluding the LCA from serious investigations of human decision-making.</p><p>Another possible reason for the discrepancy between our results and other researchers is due strictly to methodological concerns. In nearly all previous applications, quantiles have been used to reduce the full set of data down to a set of 10 summary statistics. Models are then fit to these 10 summary statistics by minimizing the distance between the model predictions and the observed data. Although reducing the full choice-response time distribution down to a set of summary statistics clearly reduces the computational burden of fitting a model to data, the benefit also comes with an important cost. Namely, reducing the data to summary statistics will necessarily reduce the informativeness of said data unless the summary statistics are sufficient for the model parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Palestro et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Turner &amp; Sederberg, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Turner &amp; Van Zandt, 2012;</ref>. However, for simulation-based models such as the ones used here, demonstrating whether or not summary statistics are sufficient is difficult, if not impossible. To provide some indication of whether or not statistics are sufficient for models of choice-response time, one can compare estimated posterior distributions under two conditions: fitting the model using quantiles, and fitting the model using the full set of data. If the two posteriors closely align, then the set of summary statistics could be declared as jointly sufficient for the parameters of the model under consideration <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Molloy, Galdo, Bahg, Liu, &amp; Turner, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Turner and Sederberg (2014)</ref> demonstrated using the LBA model (which has a tractable likelihood function) that quantiles are not jointly sufficient for the LBA parameters, and thus do not convey the same information as the full choice-response time distribution when fitting the model to data. Given the consistency between the parameters of the DDM and LBA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Donkin, Brown, Heathcote, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rodriguez, Turner, &amp; McClure, 2014)</ref>, we believe that quantiles are also insufficient for conveying the full granularity of information in the data to the parameters of other models such as the DDM and LCA, which will clearly affect conclusions about model parameters and relative model fits to data. Our study fit 12 models sampled from the three architectures of accumulator dependency to the full response time distributions for each participant individually. Both the level of constraint provided by our tasks and the methods we applied to fit the models to our data provide what we consider to be an unbiased and comprehensive assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the examined accumulator models, focused on the theoretical question of the nature of choice dependency.</p><p>There are models we did not examine in this study that may have the mechanisms necessary to fit this dataset. The Advantage LBA model of van Ravenzwaaij, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Brown, Marley, &amp; Heathcote (2019)</ref> is structured such that both the sum of the stimulus values and the difference between stimulus values are preprocessing steps of the evidence accumulation process. It is possible that the sum of the stimulus values would allow the model to simulate the faster response times observed as the total evidence present in the stimulus increases (including in the equal evidence conditions) and the difference between the stimulus values would allow the model to simulate the slower response times observed as the difference in evidence supporting each side of the stimulus decreases. The full normalization model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Louie et al. (2013)</ref> is structured such that it continuously transitions between a relative ratio model and an independent race model. Because this model has both dependent and independent accumulation processes, it may be sufficiently flexible to capture the patterns of response times observed in both the equal-evidence and unequal-evidence conditions. A differential relativity account may also be able to capture all of the patterns observed in our dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Moreno-Bote, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teodorescu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Zylberberg, Barttfeld, &amp; Sigman, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Differential relativity models are designed such that one parameter can manipulate the degree of dependence of the accumulators, allowing the model to flexibly switch between independent and dependent processes using input competition in a similar manner to the FFI model. The main distinction between the differential relativity models and the FFI model is that the FFI model has a neurally inspired lower boundary preventing the accumulator from activating below 0. Thus, it is reasonable to assume the two models will make similar predictions for this dataset. Although these hybrid models with both independent and dependent accumulation styles could potentially capture our data, ultimately they are nested within the architecture of partial dependency. One approach to establishing the level of dependency would be to fit a hybrid model to our data and report the estimates of the parameter that allows the hybrid model to transition from fully dependent to independent. However, another approach, used here, is to define sets of models according to the extreme classes that hybrid models transition between. Evidence for the type of dependency can then be assessed by examining relative model fits, rather than parameter estimates. Both approaches are appropropriate, but as our goal was to evaluate whether or not the extreme positions of independence and full dependence were valid, we chose model evaluation metrics over parameter estimates within hybrid models (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Osth &amp; Dennis (2015)</ref> for an example).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Sequential sampling theory has proven to be a plausible framework for investigating the dynamics of decision-making. Since its inception, many models have been developed that provide exquisite accounts of behavioral data for a handful of empirical benchmarks of decision-making. Although these models make use of a variety of different mechanisms, at their core is an explicit architectural assumption about the type of dependency that describes the accumulation of evidence. Here we have investigated the plausibility of three types of dependency -fully dependent, partially dependent, and independent -using a combination of a fully factorial experimental design and a consortium of models, followed by model evaluation techniques. In the end, our results provide remarkable consensus that the type of dependency among choice alternatives is neither independent nor fully dependent. initial analyses). Conversely, if the models from Model Analysis 2 had not overfit the data, the analysis would show the same models that fit the best in the initial fitting procedure to fit the best in the cross validation analysis.</p><p>For this analysis, we chose two participants from Experiment 1, which we will call participant A and participant B here. In our initial analyses, we found that the BTV LCA model had the lowest BPIC value of the four LCA models for participant A and the WTV LCA had the lowest BPIC value for participant B. So the BTV LCA model fit participant A better than the other three models and the WTV LCA model fit participant B better than the other three models. For each participant, we specified 10 pairs of training and testing datasets where the training set was all of the data from Experiment 1 for that participant save one condition (i.e. the 0.0-0.2 coherence condition) and the testing set consisted of the data from the one condition that was not included in the training data. Using the same fitting methods as Model Analyses 1 and 2, we then fit each of our four LCA models (BTV LCA, WTV LCA, NV LCA, and 4 DR LCA) to each of the 20 training datasets (10 for each participant) to obtain full posterior distributions for each model and dataset. Next, we sampled from each posterior distribution and resimulated the respective model using those samples from the testing data conditions. Using the simulated data, we calculated the log likelihood value for each posterior sample using the kernel density estimation procedure and combined these samples together to create a distribution of log likelihood values.</p><p>The BPIC values in each subfigure of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 21 and 22</ref> are calculated from the distributions of log likelihood values plus the log prior for each testing dataset with only one condition removed. So, for example, to generate the blue BTV LCA point in the subfigure with the heading 0.0, 0.0 for Participant A, we sampled from the posterior distribution generated when we fit to the training data and then resimulated the BTV LCA model 50,000 times using 0.0 as for both coherence values for each of those posterior samples. For each of those 50,000 simulations, we created a probability distribution using a kernel density estimate with Silverman's rule of thumb, took the log of each value in the probability distribution, and then summed the log probability values together to get the log likelihood. We then added the log likelihood to the log prior for that posterior sample. This was repeated for each of our posterior samples to form a distribution of weights which was used to calculate the BPIC We calculated the BPIC for each of the four models for each participant and testing data set. The results of our analysis are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 21 and 22</ref>. For the datasets of participant A where data from one condition were the testing data, the NV LCA had the lowest BPIC value for 7 of the 10 conditions, the 4 DR LCA had the lowest BPIC value for 2  of the 10 conditions, and WTV LCA had the lowest BPIC for 1 condition. For the datasets of participant B where data from one condition were the testing data, the WTV LCA and NV LCA had the lowest BPIC value for 3 conditions while the BTV LCA and 4 DR LCA had the lowest BPIC value for 2 conditions. We also calculated the mean BPIC across the 10 single condition testing data sets for each model.  data. This speaks to the validity of our approach in that the extra mechanisms given to the WTV LCA and BTV LCA models provide additional explanatory power to the model without the cost of overfitting to non-psychological processes.</p><p>Appendix C: Analysis of the free FFI model with additional sources of variability and the LCA models without the stimulus difference in the drift rate computation</p><p>Model Analysis 2 showed that the LCA model benefited from additional sources of variability which suggests that other partially dependent models could potentially fit our data better than the LCA model if given additional sources of variability. We fit one such model, the free FFI model from Model Analysis 1, with the drift rate representation and additional sources of variability from Model Analysis 2.

Thus, in addition, we fit each LCA variant from Model Analysis 2 where the drift rate for each accumulator was a function of only the stimulus value represented by that accumulator instead of the difference between the stimulus values.

The poor mixing hindered our ability to use BPIC values to discriminate between the models even though the best fitting parameter values suggested a reasonable fit for the WTV free FFI model. Thus, we re-fit all 12 models for this one participant for illustration purposes where (after first removing all response times less than 0.2 seconds and greater than 5.0 seconds) we iteratively removed trials where the response times were outside 3 standard deviations of the mean (~3% of all trials).

Overall, the LCA models had the lowest BPIC values for 17 of the 23 participants, providing more evidence that the interactive competition LCA model is the preferred model for our datasets over the input competition fixed and free FFI models, even when additional sources of variability are considered.</p><p>To assess whether the LCA models from Model Analysis 2 would be improved if the stimulus difference component of the drift rate calculation was removed, we compared the LCA models introduced in Model Analysis 2 to the LCA models introduced in this Appendix. Across the two experiments, the BTV LCA model fit 30 of 39 participants better than the BTV LCA ND model. The NV LCA model fit 26 of 39 participants better than the NV LCA ND model. Similarly, the WTV LCA fit 32 of 39 participants better than the WTV LCA ND model. Each LCA model from Model Analysis 2 provided the best fit to more participants than their counterpart introduced in this Appendix which indicates that calculating drift rate as a function of the difference in the stimulus values is an important mechanism for fitting these data.</p><p>To provide further evidence that interactive competition is a better mechanism than input competition for fitting these data, we also compared the free FFI models with additional sources of variability to the LCA models with additional sources of variability from Model Analysis 2. Across the two experiments, the BTV LCA model fit 29 of 39 participants better than the BTV free FFI model. The NV LCA model fit 31 of 39 participants better than the NV free FFI model. The WTV LCA model fit 33 of 39 participants better than the WTV free FFI model. Each LCA model from Model Analysis 2 provided the best fit to more participants than their counterpart free FFI model which indicates interactive competition is the preferred mechanism to input competition for fitting these data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 24</ref> shows the fits of the free FFI models and the LCA ND models to the proportion correct data as a function of the difference in stimulus value for both experiments.</p><p>All models generally match the proportion correct data well with the largest misses for all models appearing in the 0.03 contrast difference condition of Experiment 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 25</ref> shows the fits of the free FFI models and the LCA ND models to the response times of the equal evidence conditions for both experiments. For Experiment 1, the LCA ND models generally fit the data well. The biggest miss of the models is the WTV LCA ND model for the 0.3 coherence condition. The WTV and BTV free FFI model fit the 0.0 and 0.1 conditions well but miss on the 0.2 and 0.3 conditions. The NV free FFI model simulates the same response time for each condition for Experiment 1 and the same response time for each condition for Experiment 2. For Experiment 2, the LCA ND models fit the data similarly to each other. All three models miss greatly on the 0.4 and 0.49 conditions, miss slightly on the 0.43 condition and fit the 0.46 condition well. The WTV free FFI model provides the best visual fit to this subset of data of these 6 models and the BTV free FFI model fits all conditions except the 0.4 condition well. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 26</ref> shows the fits of the free FFI models and the LCA ND models to the response times of a subset of the unequal evidence conditions for both experiments. For Experiment 1, the LCA ND models generally predict faster response times than observed with the WTV LCA ND predicting the fastest response times. The BTV free FFI model provides the best fit to these data, the WTV free FFI predicts even faster response times than the response times predicted by the LCA ND models, and the NV free FFI predicts slower response times than observed in two of the conditions. For Experiment 2, all models generally provide a good fit to the data with the fit of the free FFI models being worse than the LCA ND models in the 0.46 contrast condition. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 27</ref> shows the fits of the free FFI models and the LCA ND models to the proportion correct data of a subset of the unequal evidence conditions for both experiments.</p><p>For Experiment 1, all models generally fit the data well with the LCA ND models fitting the data worse in the 0.1 coherence condition and the free FFI models fitting the data worse in the 0.2 coherence condition. For Experiment 2, all models generally fit the data well with all models underestimating the proportion correct in the 0.46 contrast condition. Taken together, the quantitative BPIC results and the visualizations of the model fits indicate that the LCA ND models generally fit the data better than the free FFI models but neither set of models fit the data as well as the LCA models from Model Analysis 2.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Illustration of the evidence accumulation process for each class of accumulator model.

The fixed FFI model had a lower BPIC value than the free FFI model in 14 participants from Experiment 1 and a lower BPIC value than the free FFI model in 22 participants from Experiment 2. Since the calculation of BPIC penalizes the inclusion of extra parameters, it would appear the benefit of freeing this parameter in the FFI model fails to overcome the complexity costs. The LBA model fit better in 10 participants than a theoretically similar race model with an LCA architecture from Experiment 1 and fit better in 21 participants from Experiment 2. Unlike the race model, the LBA model takes into account starting point variability and relies upon its between-trial variability mechanism to generate a distribution of response times. In this instance, it appears that one or both of these mechanisms have provided an advantage when fitting to these data.</figDesc><table><row><cell>M odel</cell><cell>ρ 0.0</cell><cell>ρ 0.1</cell><cell>ρ 0.2</cell><cell>ρ 0.3</cell><cell>κ</cell><cell>β</cell><cell>ν</cell><cell>z</cell><cell>α</cell><cell>t 0</cell></row><row><cell>Fixed</cell><cell>2.139</cell><cell>2.416</cell><cell>2.705</cell><cell>2.998</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>5.011</cell><cell>0.171</cell></row><row><cell>FFI</cell><cell cols="4">(1.495) (1.478) (1.463) (1.492)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">(0.97) (0.098)</cell></row><row><cell>Free</cell><cell>1.751</cell><cell>2.029</cell><cell>2.306</cell><cell>2.608</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.997</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>5.056</cell><cell>0.165</cell></row><row><cell>FFI</cell><cell cols="4">(1.501) (1.487) (1.511) (1.507)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>(0.008)</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">(0.976) (0.099)</cell></row><row><cell>LCA</cell><cell>4.921</cell><cell>5.214</cell><cell>5.462</cell><cell>5.688</cell><cell>0.386</cell><cell>0.575</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>9.319</cell><cell>0.123</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="6">(1.404) (1.433) (1.457) (1.472) (0.186) (0.179)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">(3.126) (0.103)</cell></row><row><cell>Leak</cell><cell>2.417</cell><cell>2.555</cell><cell>2.684</cell><cell>2.821</cell><cell>0.661</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>5.227</cell><cell>0.167</cell></row><row><cell cols="6">Only (1.698) (1.691) (1.702) (1.720) (0.198)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">(2.205) (0.129)</cell></row><row><cell>LCA</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Race</cell><cell>0.041</cell><cell>0.117</cell><cell>0.236</cell><cell>0.346</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>3.738</cell><cell>0.173</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="4">(0.061) (0.127) (0.132) (0.149)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">(0.668) (0.098)</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

C represents the half cauchy distribution, and the logistic operation represents the inverse logit transform.Table 6show the mean best-fitting parameter values for each model fit to the data from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.Figure 14shows the mean-centered BPIC values for each model and participant from Experiment 1 and 2. In Experiment 1, the BTV LCA had the lowest BPIC value in 5 participants, the NV LCA had the lowest BPIC value in 9 participants, the NV fixed FFI had the lowest BPIC value in 1 participant, and the WTV fixed FFI had the lowest BPIC in 1 participant. Overall, the LCA models had the lowest BPIC values for 14 of the 16 participants. In Experiment 2, the BTV LCA had the lowest BPIC value in 11 participants, the NV LCA had the lowest BPIC value in 10 participants, the WTV LCA had the lowest BPIC value in 1 participant, and the NV fixed FFI had the lowest BPIC value in 1 participant. Overall, the LCA models had the lowest BPIC values for 22 of the 23 participants, providing more evidence that the partially dependent LCA model is the preferred model for our datasets over the fully dependent fixed FFI model, even when additional sources of variability are considered.To confirm the representations for the models of Model Analysis 2 provide a better fit than their counterparts in Model Analysis 1, we compared the NV fixed FFI model with the Model Analysis 1 fixed FFI model and the NV LCA model with the Model Analysis 1 LCA model. The NV fixed FFI model had lower BPIC values than the fixed FFI model of Model Analysis 1 for all 16 of the participants from Experiment 1 and for all 23 of the participants from Experiment 2. The NV LCA model had lower BPIC values than the LCA model of Model Analysis 1 for all 16 of the participants from Experiment 1 and for 21 of the 23 participants from Experiment 2. Taken together, these results provide evidence that these NV models fit the data from both experiments better than the models of Model Analysis 1.In Appendix C, we examined six additional model variants. In one set of model variants, we fit three additional free FFI models: an NV free FFI model, a BTV free FFI model, and a WTV free FFI model. We also fit additional NV LCA, BTV LCA, and WTV LCA models where the drift rate is not a function of the stimulus difference and the drift rate for each accumulator is simply a function of the stimulus value that accumulator</figDesc><table><row><cell>Category</cell><cell cols="2">Parameter Description</cell><cell>Prior</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">All models α</cell><cell>Decision threshold</cell><cell>N(2.5, 10, 0, 30)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>t 0</cell><cell>Non-decision time</cell><cell>U(0, min_rt)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>ρ</cell><cell>Base level of drift rate</cell><cell>N(2.5, 5, 0, 10)</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
