			<abstract>
				<p>Group living increases the likelihood of inter-individual conflicts, necessitating effective conflict resolution. While institutions and social structures play an important role in resolving conflicts, societies which emphasize egalitarianism often prioritize individual autonomy and lack strong socio-political institutions. Existing scholarship highlights the critical role of leaders in facilitating conflict resolution, particularly in the maintenance of group cohesion under egalitarianism. Here we investigate the association of peer-rated conflict resolution skills with 11 peer-rated psychosocial traits linked to leadership in a sample of 60 individuals from a Chabu community, a relatively egalitarian population of forest-dwelling Ethiopian forager-horticulturalists. We employ networkbased methods and Bayesian multi-level modeling to identify trait clustering, trait-based linkages, and the key predictors of conflict resolution skills. We found that conflict resolution skills cluster with decision-making abilities, intelligence, social alliances, and expertise, while attributes such as being respected and liked constitute another distinct cluster. Conversely, traits like aggressiveness, being feared, and farming productivity align within a third separate cluster. After accounting for inter-rater variation, sound decision-making and intelligence (i.e., neural capital) as well as social alliances were positive predictors of conflict resolution skills, while aggressiveness was a negative predictor. Our results also reveal an overlap in similarity networks between women and men. These findings suggest that, when it comes to effective conflict resolution, it is neither better to be feared nor loved. Instead, in this egalitarian social context, well-connected individuals equipped with high levels of neural capital emerge as the most effective conflict mediators. Our results shed light on leadership phenotypes associated with conflict resolution under egalitarianism. Additionally, they carry implications for the evolution of group living among humans by highlighting the pivotal role of neural capital in promoting effective conflict mediation in more close-knit social contexts.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Human life is social. We cannot survive or thrive in isolation. Our social groups, however, are highly heterogeneous and prone to many conflicts of interest among group members (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bird, Bliege-Bird, Codding, &amp; Zeanah, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birdsell, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kelly, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lawson, Alami, &amp; Somefun, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Parker, Royle, &amp; Hartley, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Roscoe, 2009)</ref>. Despite interdependence and social ties, disputes nonetheless arise between neighbors, economic partners, friends and family <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Garfield, 2021)</ref>. Left unresolved, interpersonal conflicts threaten group stability and can negatively reverberate throughout a community. Conflict resolution then is an essential feature of human sociality and our species' unique cooperative propensities. This is particularly true among more mobile, egalitarian, hunter-gatherers, where smaller collectives of group members can move if severe within-group conflicts remain unresolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lee, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Woodburn, 1979)</ref>. Such societies also tend to have weaker institutional systems for mediating conflicts, such as courts and police or specialized norm enforcement roles, rending conflict mediation a service in need of providers (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kelly, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lee &amp; Daly, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Molho, De Petrillo, Garfield, &amp; Slewe, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wiessner, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Owing to the central role of conflict and mediation for human sociality and societies, they have been the focus of a large interdisciplinary literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bercovitch, Zartman, &amp; Kremenyuk, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Laursen, Finkelstein, &amp; Betts, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Morrill &amp; Rudes, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nelson, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ramsbotham, Miall, &amp; Woodhouse, 2011)</ref>, including in anthropology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Augsburger, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boehm, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fry &amp; Björkqvist, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Garfield &amp; Glowacki, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Levine, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Singh &amp; Garfield, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wiessner, 2020)</ref>. In particular, there is a heated debate on the importance of concerted conflict mediation among hunter-gatherers (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boehm, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Knauft et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lee, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wiessner, 2014)</ref>. Many contend that among hunter-gatherers, social structures limit interpersonal conflict and mobility allows individuals or small groups involved in intense conflicts to simply disperse and "vote with their feet," rather than engage in complicated and costly conflict mediation. For example, <ref type="bibr">Wiessner (2016, pp. S156-157)</ref> explains among the Ju/'hoansi in southern Africa: A number of cultural means supported the rejection of physical violence. Marriages were arranged for young girls <ref type="bibr">(Marshall 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shostak 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wiessner 2009)</ref>, often prepubescent, to avoid male competition and to secure in-laws who get along. Trance healing dances drew people together in a joint effort to promote community well-being and reduced tensions, particularly during large gatherings <ref type="bibr">(Katz 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marshall 1999)</ref>. Engaging stories told by firelight soothed tensions in the evenings <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wiessner 2014)</ref>. The most common response to serious conflict was dispersal; the xaro exchange system assured that conflicting parties had a place to go. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lee (1972)</ref> similarly explains among the Ju/'hoansi that: in contrast to agricultural and urban peoples, hunters have a great deal of latitude to vote with their feet, to walk out of an unpleasant situation. And they do so, not when the food supply is exhausted, but well before that point when only their patience is exhausted. This mobility has a profound ecological adaptive significance. Fear and avoidance of conflict has the effect of keeping people apart.</p><p>Among the Hadza in Tanzania, another highly egalitarian hunter-gatherer society, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Woodburn (1979)</ref> also underscores the lack of third-party conflict resolution and suggests:</p><p>The great majority of disputes do not, however, lead to violence in spite of the fact that the Hadza have no procedures for arbitration. They have to solve their disputes for themselves almost always without any intervention by third parties. In fact most disputes are resolved by self-segregation and attract hardly any attention: units are highly unstable with individuals constantly joining and breaking away, and it is so easy to move away that one of the parties to the dispute is likely to decide to do so very soon, often without even acknowledging that the dispute exists.</p><p>Third-party conflict mediation certainly occurs among hunter-gatherers. Using a systematic ethnographic sample, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Garfield, Syme, &amp; Hagen (2020)</ref> documented 21 instances of evidence for third-party conflict resolution from nine unique hunter-gatherer societies (43% of the sample of hunter-gatherers). For example, relatively greater gender egalitarianism among many hunter-gatherers (compared to most rural agricultural or pastoral populations) gives women increased opportunity to engaged in inter-gender conflict resolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lewis (2008)</ref> explains among the Mbendjele of northern Congo:</p><p>Women quickly support each other in situations of conflict with men, especially in situations of serious domestic violence. During such episodes women often ganged up to beat a violent husband with long sticks.</p><p>Even among the staunchly egalitarian Mbuti, forest-dwelling hunter-gatherers in the Congo Basin, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Turnbull (1965)</ref> explains:</p><p>The elder settles numerous disputes, both within and without his hunting band. Such disputes mainly concern marital disagreements, Schebesta says. The elders often settle controversies by delivering speeches during the evening, leading frequently to noisy debates between the elders of different bands or lineages. Outside the lineage context, the elder is not in any way different from the others; there are none of the trappings of villager chieftainship. He delivers his decisions without hesitancy and is obeyed in the same way within his lineage. His power is limited, however, by custom and tradition as well as by context.</p><p>In northeastern North America among the hunting and gathering Ojibwa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rogers (1962)</ref> describes the role of leaders in conflict mediation, mentioning: Formerly, each band had a leader. This role entailed certain obligations and responsibilities, such as the protection of followers from harm (i.e. witchcraft), caring for the sick and needy, settling intra-group differences, and giving feasts.</p><p>Much of the ethnographic research has focused on the contexts in which conflicts occur and the nature and process of conflict outcomes, but less on the traits of successful conflict mediators. In a meta-analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Tehrani &amp; Yamini (2020)</ref> systematically characterize the link between personality traits, as measured by the Five-Factor Personality Inventory, and conflict resolution strategies drawing on 20 eligible studies, largely focused on post-industrial contexts, i.e., WEIRD participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Henrich, Heine, &amp; Norenzayan, 2010)</ref>. They categorize variation in conflict resolution into five styles: avoidance, compromise, integration, accommodation, and domination. They demonstrate 1) a positive correlation between extroversion and a preference for the dominating approach to conflict resolution, characterized by a high self-concern, low other-concern, and a tendency to pursue selfbeneficial outcomes aggressively, and 2) a negative correlation between agreeableness and domination, but a positive correlation with both accommodating and integrating styles. The accommodating style is identified by mediators prioritizing others over themselves, aiming for prosocial results, whereas the integrating style is characterized by mediators valuing both their own and others' concerns, striving for outcomes that are mutually beneficial to the parties involved.</p><p>There are fewer empirical data on the traits associated with effective conflict mediation among smaller-scale egalitarian societies, however, where effective conflict mediation hinges upon the capacities of group members. Our contribution helps fill this gap. We draw on peer-rated data from a sample of Chabu forager-horticulturalists, a relatively egalitarian community of recently settled former hunter-gatherers. We explore the traits of individuals recognized for conflict mediation skills and the relationship between key psycho-social measures emphasized in the evolutionary literature of human leadership and related to social influence in smaller-scale societies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Garfield, von Rueden, &amp; Hagen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lewis, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">von Rueden &amp; Vugt, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

Specially, we investigate 1) trait-based linkages, i.e., the underlying network structure of participants based on similarities in their trait profiles, 2) trait clustering, i.e., how variation in peer-rated psycho-social traits cluster and if data suggests distinct dimensions, and 3) the traits associated with conflict resolution skills, i.e., the key predictors of mediation capacities accounting for the multi-level structure of our ratings data and interrelationships between trait measures. Our goal is to provide an empirically informed view of the phenotypic profile of effective conflict mediators in this egalitarian society.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Focal ethnographic community</head><p>The Chabu are a small ethnic group in Southwest Ethiopia residing in the Sheka forests that historically practiced a hunter-gatherer lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dira &amp; Hewlett, 2017)</ref>. Since at least the early 1990s their subsistence economy has predominately involved a mix of hunting, foraging, horticulture (e.g., maize, yams, beans) with limited market integration based on a few cash crops and goods (e.g., coffee cultivation, honey collection, pottery) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dira &amp; Hewlett, 2016</ref>, unpublished field notes 1 ). Their social structure has been predominantly egalitarian, with leadership roles emerging contextually and not formally established or institutionalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Taye, 2015)</ref>. Such roles were typically associated with collective activities such as hunting or construction projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dira &amp; Hewlett, 2017;</ref>. More recent changes, however, include integration into Ethiopia's Kebele system (since the early 2000s), a governmental administrative structure. This transition introduced more formalized leadership roles, yet these are still influenced by traditional Chabu values emphasizing respect and community service .</p><p>Linguistically, the Chabu language represents a unique aspect of their cultural identity. Historically, their language was often missclassified (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Teferra, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Teferra &amp; Unseth, 1989)</ref>, but more recent studies have identified it as a distinct and sole remnant of a previously undocumented African language phylum <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Schnoebelen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Taye, 2015)</ref>. Genetic analysis further supports Chabu as a distinct ethnic population with long ties to their current homeland in the forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gopalan et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Over the past 15 years or so, the Chabu have experienced significant changes since their integration into the wider Ethiopian administrative framework, greater interactions with neighboring agricultural communities, increased market integration, and broader processes of development in the region. Their traditional egalitarianism, characterized by a lack of fixed leadership and shared resources, has been impacted by the Kebele system's more hierarchical structure. As recently as 2019 their subsistence economy had shifted to include substantial reliance on goat, sheep, and enset-based agro-pastoralism (unpublished notes, personal communication). Despite these changes, Chabu society still values prosocial behavior and community service, as evidenced in the selection of Kebele leaders . These leaders are chosen for their embodiment of culturally valued traits, capacities to solve community problems, and their prosocial motivations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Chabu Ratings Data</head><p>We rely on the chabu ratings data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Garfield &amp; Hagen, 2024)</ref> developed and originally introduced by . These data include of peer-rated measures on psycho-social traits from 7 peer-raters on a convenience sample of 60 adults from a remote Chabu community, home to about 250 individuals, located deep in the Sheka forest. Interviews were conducted privately (present company included the participant, a local research assistant, an external research assistant, and ZHG), in the Chabu language at the participant's house, at their field shelter, or at the house of the researcher's accommodations in the community.</p><p>Data were collected in 2016 (prior to the aforementioned shift in subsistence economy, ca. 2018-2019). Participants consented to having a portrait photograph taken for use in a peer-rating procedure. Photographs displayed the participants head and shoulders set against a neutral background. Seven participants (four males, three females) were recruited as peer-raters, based on skill in working with researchers. Peer-raters ranked participants separately for males and females on a series of psycho-social traits associated with leadership <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>) using a digital screen and a subtraction-after-ranking procedure. These rankings were then converted to relative ranks ( / !"# ), i.e., values bound between 0 and 1. Here we rely only on 12 variables which were rated for both sexes from the  data, i.e., we exclude the male-only productivity measures and measures dependent on parental and marital status. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Network Analysis of Trait-Based Similarities</head><p>We used the peer-rated quantitative traits to develop individual trait profiles for all participants and assessed the network structure of the inter-individual similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Camacho, Panizo-LLedot, Bello-Orgaz, Gonzalez-Pardo, &amp; Cambria, 2020)</ref>. For each participant, we calculated the mean ratings and their mean standard errors across all peerrated traits. To account for variability and measurement error, we adjusted the mean ratings by subtracting their corresponding standard errors for a more reliable estimate of the central tendency for each trait for each participant. Alongside adjusted trait ratings, we included demographic information (i.e., sex and estimated age). To explore the relationships between individuals based on their trait profiles, we constructed a similarity matrix by first computing Euclidean distances between the adjusted trait scores of all participants and then transforming them into a similarity matrix by applying the formula similarity = $ $%distance , which inversely relates similarity to distance. In the resulting matrix, smaller pairwise distances (indicating more similar trait profiles) correspond to higher similarity values.</p><p>We then created an undirected graph using the igraph package <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Csárdi et al., 2023)</ref>, weighted to reflect the variation of similarity between individuals, with weights derived from the similarity matrix. In this network, nodes represent individuals and edges correspond to the similarity in their trait profiles. To construct the network, we used the Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fruchterman &amp; Reingold, 1991)</ref>, which positions nodes in a manner consistent with their interconnectedness (i.e., more connected nodes are drawn closer together). To enhance the clarity of the visualization, we scaled edge weights for better visual differentiation and applied a threshold of 0.4 to exclude less significant connections from the plot. Edges in the network thus represented significant inter-individual trait-based similarities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Exploratory Graph Analysis of trait clustering</head><p>To explore possible trait-based clustering, i.e., emergent dimensions of our measured traits, we conducted an Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Golino &amp; Epskamp, 2017)</ref> on the same set of peer-rated traits using the EGAnet package <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Golino &amp; Christensen, 2023)</ref>. EGA conceptualizes the pattern of relationships between variables (in our case, traits) as a network. This method allows for the identification of clusters (or dimensions) of closely related traits, offering a visual and quantitative understanding of the data structure. Often EGA approaches will begin with a Unique Variable Analysis (UVA) to assess the uniqueness of each trait in the matrix by computing the proportion of non-redundant information each variable contributed. We conducted a UVA analysis presented in the Supplementary Information (SI, https://osf.io/yx39c) <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1)</ref>, however, despite some redundancies, we chose to retain all 12 variables in the EGA so that network structures would be more interpretable alongside our modeling results (introduced below). To assess the stability and robustness of our EGA results, we performed a Bootstrap EGA, which involved repeatedly resampling our data and conducting EGA on each sample, allowing us to estimate the variability and reliability of the identified network structure. We compare the empirical and bootstrap-based networks to draw inference on the stability of our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Bayesian Multi-Level Modeling for Conflict Resolution Skills Analysis</head><p>We employed Bayesian multilevel modeling to identify the predictors of conflict resolution skills. We used the 11 peer-rated traits (as well as controls: sex, estimated age) as predictors of conflict resolution to identify correlates of conflict mediation skills in a multilevel Bayesian regression model, accounting for inter-rater variation (i.e., random effects for rater ID and participant ID). The model uses a Gaussian distribution, which can be used for modeling continuous data bound between 0 and 1, as is the case for our outcome. The priors for the intercept and the coefficients (slope parameters) are normally distributed, and the prior for the standard deviation of the random effects is an exponential distribution. Bayesian models were fit using the brms package <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bürkner, 2017)</ref> which which fits Bayesian models using RStan <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carpenter et al., 2017)</ref> under Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Markov chain convergence was assessed using standard diagnostics (number of effective samples, the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic, and visual inspection of trace plots).</p><p>One rater did not complete rankings for two variables and in some cases the rater did not have sufficient information to rank a particular individual. To account for missing observations (69) within the 296 × 12 matrix), we performed multiple imputation using themicepackage (Van Buuren &amp; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011), generating = 100 fully imputed data sets, where all other variables are used as predictors of missing values <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bartlett, Frost, &amp; Carpenter, 2011</ref>) (see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>). Multiple imputation converges to full Bayesian estimation (i.e., missing data modeled as parameters) when the number of imputed data sets is large <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Zhou &amp; Reiter, 2010)</ref>. Uncertainty in the imputed values was retained by averaging over these 100 fully imputed data sets in model fitting (using the brm_multiple function). This approach allowed us to account for the nested structure of our data, where observations (trait ratings) were nested within individuals (the ratees) and produced by multiple raters, as well as missing data and uncertainty in data imputation.</p><p>The Bayesian mixed effects model is specified as follows:</p><p>where is modeled as a linear combination of predictors. The model for is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ! + " × allies + # × kin + $ × farming + % × decisions + &amp; × expertise + ' × intelligent + ( × likable + ) × prosocial + * × respect + "! × feared + "" × fighting + participant + rater</formula><p>Priors for the model are specified as:</p><p>Our model selection strategy used an information criterion approach comprised of several stages, each progressively adding complexity, incorporating intercept-only models, control variables, and their interactions. See the SI for details. Model fitting involved four chains with 4000 iterations each (half of which were warm-up iterations). Model comparison was conducted using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO) and the loo package <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Vehtari et al., 2023)</ref>. This approach allowed us to evaluate model fit and compare the explanatory power of different models and revealed the model with predictors (but not control variables, i.e., sex and estimated age) to be the best fit of the data <ref type="table">(Table S3)</ref>. We report and interpret results from this predictor model below.</p><p>We report 95% highest posterior density credible intervals (HPDI) of posterior distributions from the Bayesian multi-level model (LCI and UCI), the posterior median estimate of the regression coefficients ( 2 ) and the probability of direction ( ), or the proportion of the posterior distribution that is of the median's sign (i.e., greater or less than 0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Makowski, Ben-Shachar, &amp; Lüdecke, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">McElreath, 2020)</ref>. We interpret associations between predictors and our outcome as strong when the 95% HPDI does not include 0 and weak when the 80% HPDI does not include 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>We first describe the sample characteristics and distributions of key variables before introducing results from network and modeling methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Descriptive results and sex differences</head><p>The sample includes sixty adult participants (26 women and 34 men) with a mean estimated age of 37 (SD = 16). The mean value of peer-ratings for conflict resolution were 0.521 (SD = 0.061) and 0.518 (SD = 0.081) for women and men, respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> displays density plots of peer-ratings of conflict resolution by sex and the relationship between estimated age and conflict resolution ratings by sex. The distribution of peerratings of conflict resolution appears to be more bimodal for women than for men and there may be an interaction effect with sex, with older women slightly more likely to be rated higher on conflict resolution skills compared to older men. These plots suggest sex and age may play a role in relationships between conflict resolution skills and other psycho-social traits.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> displays the trait-similarity network graph. The network exhibits moderate density, suggesting that many individuals have been rated similarly on the psycho-social traits, with a few individuals (mostly men) more distant (i.e., disimilar). Older participants, represented by larger nodes, tend to occupy more peripheral positions in the network, indicating a lower level of trait similarity with others. The network shows a clear mixing of node colors, indicating that women and men were often rated similarly. Connections with greater weight, indicated by darker lines are common, suggesting that strong trait-based similarities are common. The network displays a core cluster suggesting high intra-group trait similarity, with one possible subgroup of mostly men. The trait-based individual network indicates patterns of psycho-social trait similarities that do not correlate strongly with participants' sex but may correlate with age.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> displays the EGA results. The EGA recovered three dimensions from the data. The network was estimated with a glasso model ( = 0.5 and = 0.086) using the Walktrap algorithm. Dimensions 1 includes the conflict resolution skills measure (conflict), as well as psycho-social traits linked to neural capital (decisions, intelligent, expertise) and social capital <ref type="bibr">(allies, kin, prosocial)</ref>. A second dimension includes other social capital traits more closely associated with prestige (respect, likable). A final third dissension includes traits linked to dominance (feared, fighting) as well as a measure of material capital and horticultural productivity (farming). The partial correlation analysis revealed fighting negatively correlates with likable, decisions, prosocial and respect and positively correlates with feared and farming. Other notable inter-dimension correlations include conflict positively correlated with respect and both respect and likable correlating with intelligent. Farming also correlates positively with allies, expertise, intelligent, and kin. Generally, the bootstrap analysis further strengthened our confidence in the network structure revealed by the EGA. However, intelligent is included in dimension 2 in the bootstrap analysis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>Using network-based methods and multi-level modelling we analyzed peer-rated measures on a series of psycho-social traits developed from the human evolutionary social science literature on leadership to better understand the correlates of conflict resolution skills, a key function of leaders, in an egalitarian society. Our analysis focused on identifying patterns and relationships on the correlates of individuals rated high on conflict mediation capacities. The data were collected from a forest-dwelling Chabu community -former Ethiopian hunter-gatherers who maintain much of their egalitarian ethos, including sharing and respect for individual autonomy. At the time of data collection, this community lacked substantial interaction with state-level institutions, exhibited limited market integration, and their subsistence economy was predominately characterized by maize horticulture, wild and domesticated yams, hunted meat, and other foraged foods.</p><p>Descriptive evidence suggested that there may be a relationship between age, gender, and the distribution of conflict resolution skills, and there may be greater variance among conflict resolution skills among women compared to men (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>; standard deviations for mean conflict ratings by sex: &amp;'!() = 0.081, !() = 0.061). We found, however, that the trait profiles of men women largely overlap ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) and including sex as a predictor did not provide an improvement in fit in regression models of conflict Predictors of conflict resolution skills resolution skills <ref type="table">(Table S3)</ref>. Consistent with previous results on leadership and social influence in smaller-scale egalitarian societies, a more complete view of inter-individual variation provides more predictive power than sex or gender differences per se (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">von Rueden, Alami, Kaplan, &amp; Gurven, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Results from EGA suggest trait-based clustering consistent with much of the evolutionary literature on leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cheng, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Garfield, Hubbard, &amp; Hagen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rueden, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Van Vugt, 2006)</ref>. The data support a distinction between dominance and prestige, indicated by our dominance-productivity and prestige dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cheng, Tracy, Foulsham, Kingstone, &amp; Henrich, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Henrich &amp; Gil-White, 2001</ref>) and negative relationships between fighting and other traits <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3</ref>). However, these results also challenge dual, dominance-prestige model approaches to leadership for at least two reasons. First, farming productivity, a highly respected and culturally valued skill, clusters withing the other classic dominance-style traits (i.e., feared and fighting) forming a link to more prestigebased traits. Second, many traits typically associated with prestige form separate dimensions. Both the neural and social capital and prestige dimension contain prototypical traits of prestige-style leadership. For example, expertise (in dimension 1) and respect (in dimension 3), or prosocial (in dimension 1) and likable (in dimension 3). This differentiation between the neural capital components of leadership from being respected and likable, more generally, support revisions to evolutionary models of prestige-based leadership (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chapais, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Garfield, Hubbard, et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jiménez &amp; Mesoudi, 2019</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, being feared was a positive, albeit weak, predictor of conflict resolution skills. This suggests that power or social control may play a role and those with greater social dominance may, at least in some contexts, be able to resolve inter-individual conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cheng, Tracy, &amp; Henrich, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Redhead, Dhaliwal, &amp; Cheng, 2021)</ref>. The components of neural capital, however, were the strongest predictors of evidence for conflict resolution in the Bayesian model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4</ref>), highlighting the importance of cognition independent of prestige and dominance. Taken together, these results further underscore calls to move beyond dual models of leadership, such as put forth by ; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Durkee, Lukaszewski, &amp; Buss, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Garfield, Hubbard, et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pietraszewski, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rueden, 2014)</ref> and to focus on the various forms of capital which contribute to social influence and the ability of the few to provide benefits to, or impose costs on the many. The weak relationship between being feared and resolving conflicts highlight a limitation of our data discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Limitations</head><p>Our results and conclusions have limitation. First, we rely on a small convenience sample of participants and only seven peer-raters. The community is small and interconnected. We are reasonably confident our peer-raters provided valid ratings (and regression outputs do not suggest substantial rater effects). We also did not have spouses rate each other. However, we cannot be sure that raters were not biased in particular ways. We attempted to mitigate this by including all ratings data and random effects for raters in our Bayesian model and incorporating standard errors into the mean calculation of our similarity network. We do not, however, have full kinship data or other social network data which could be used to better understand relationships between individuals and between raters and ratees. Also, interpersonal conflicts are highly variable and we cannot distinguish between different types of conflicts. Perhaps the dominance style of conflict resolution is particularly well suited for more severe conflicts or for economic conflicts, where as neural capital may play a more important role in more social conflicts. These remain outstanding questions for future research. These analyses also inherit the limitations discussed in .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Conflict resolution is a key feature of human sociality and a critical function of leadership across a diverse range of societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fitouchi &amp; Singh, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Glowacki &amp; von Rueden, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Redhead et al., 2021)</ref>. In smaller-scale societies, such as more egalitarian hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists, third parties often help mediate interindividual conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Garfield, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Singh &amp; Garfield, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">von Rueden, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wiessner, 2020)</ref>. Much of the evolutionary literature on leadership has focused on prestige and dominance, often suggesting these are distinct yet viable strategies for social influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cheng, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cheng et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Henrich &amp; Gil-White, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Redhead et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Van Vugt &amp; Smith, 2019)</ref>. Although conflict resolution seems to be among the most frequent jobs leaders perform, results here suggest that, when it comes to effective conflict resolution it is neither better to be fear or loved. Neither prestige nor dominance seem to be prerequisites for effective conflict resolution among the Chabu. Rather, individuals equipped with high levels of neural capital are best able to effectively mediate interindividual conflict. These results lend support to the Computational Services Model and theoretical arguments made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Garfield, Hubbard, et al. (2019)</ref> and . Effective third-party conflict resolution will often require the mediator to possess specific knowledge about each individual in conflict (e.g., their preferences, personalities, network and status positions) as well as their assessment of potential conflict outcomes. They then must develop and recommend resolution strategies likely to be approved and adopted by each individual. This process can be cognitively challenging and is a "computational service" provided by the third-party mediator to the benefit of the individuals in conflict and the group .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A: Density plots of conflict ratings by sex.
