			<abstract>
				<p>Reported perception of a new stimulus is either attracted toward or repelled away from taskirrelevant prior stimuli. While prevailing theories propose that the opposing serial biases may stem from distinct stages of processing, the exact role of working memory (WM) in the serial bias remains unclear despite its consistent involvement in nearly all pertinent studies. Additionally, it is not well understood whether this bias is primarily driven by the biased representation itself or by the decision-making process for the new stimulus. In the present study, we used a novel delayed estimation paradigm with an intervening task, designed to disrupt the maintenance of stimulus information to investigate the involvement of WM in serial bias. In the analysis, we scrutinized the trajectory of mouse reports and response time to investigate how the response unfolds over time. Our findings indicate that interrupting WM maintenance process significantly reversed the direction of the bias effect, and that the associated response trajectories and response time exhibited patterns that cannot be explained by the biased representation alone. Together, these results demonstrate that the task-irrelevant prior stimulus influences the decision for the new stimulus, with the direction of the final bias determined by how the stimulus was maintained in WM, thereby placing significant constraints on existing theories on the serial bias effect.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Recent experiences can automatically impact ongoing thoughts and behavior. Studies have shown that the report of the newly perceived stimulus is systematically biased by the stimulus seen a moment ago, despite the fact that the past stimulus is completely irrelevant to the current goal of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fischer &amp; Whitney, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kiyonaga et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pascucci et al., 2023)</ref>. This serial bias can be either attraction toward the prior stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fischer &amp; Whitney, 2014)</ref> or repulsion away from it <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bansal et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bliss et al., 2017)</ref>. These opposing biases may reflect two distinct goals of the visual system: To achieve perceptual stability over time in the face of noise and occlusion, the visual system may integrate the current visual input with the past one (attraction), and to achieve the sensitivity in the detection of changes in the environment, it may exaggerate the differences between representations (repulsion).</p><p>Although the perceptual reports may exhibit either attractive or repulsive biases in relation to the prior stimulus, this may actually reflect the mixture of attractive and repulsive components that originated from different processing stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fritsche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moon &amp; Kwon, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pascucci et al., 2019)</ref>. Specifically, the repulsive component may occur during the encoding stage to optimize the efficiency of information processing (Efficient encoding; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wei &amp; Stocker, 2015</ref>) and the attractive component may occur during the decoding stage to optimize perceptual decision by integrating visual information over time (Bayesian decoding; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bergen &amp; Jehee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cicchini et al., 2018)</ref>. This computational framework naturally predicts that resulting bias is dependent on the relative strength of the two mechanisms. For example, if Bayesian decoding mechanism is stronger, then the resulting behavior would exhibit an attractive bias. Indeed, a recent study found an attractive serial bias in behavior even if neural representations exhibited repulsive bias in early visual processing areas (i.e., V1-3), suggesting that the attractive component overcame the initial repulsive bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sheehan &amp; Serences, 2022)</ref>. Although this framework parsimoniously explains the opposing serial biases in the final report, it is still unclear what determines the final direction of the bias and at which processing stage the bias actually occurs. The present study addresses these issues. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. (a) Task procedure for orientation delayed estimation task with the intervening Stroop task. Participants remembered the orientation of the sample teardrop and reproduced the remembered orientation using a computer mouse. During the delay period, a Stroop color word was presented. After the delay, a response ring (with a mouse pointer at the center but without a test object) was presented, indicating the time to report. A probe teardrop was presented as soon as participants moved the mouse pointer. In Experiment 1A, participants pressed a keyboard button to report the color of the Stroop word. A feedback ("Slow") was presented when the RT was slower than 1.2 s. In Experiment 1B, a Stroop word was presented but participants simply pressed the down-arrow key to the Stroop word (i.e., no Stroop decision). In Experiment 2, participants reported the remembered orientation after the first delay for the majority (75%) of the trials and performed the Stroop task before the orientation report in the remaining trials. (b) A schematic of response trajectory. If the serial bias occurs before the orientation report, then the trajectory should be a straight line (black). If, however, the bias occurs during the report, then trajectory may reflect systematic adjustments (blue). In the example shown, the blue trajectory indicates that the trajectory started from the opposite side of the previous-trial target  and then converged into the final response (RN). This is an example of a repulsive serial bias.</p><p>We started from the fact that the vast majority of the tasks used in serial bias studies include working memory (WM) delay, but little is known about the exact role of WM on serial bias.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v SLOW v Report : until respond v T N T N-1 R N Response cue : until mouse movement v 3 AFC Stroop task (button press)</formula><p>However, some studies have shown that the magnitude of serial bias varies with the length of the delay period in the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bliss et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Stein et al., 2020)</ref>. Following this finding, we</p><p>hypothesized that how the current stimulus information is maintained in WM is the key determinant for the direction of serial bias. To test this hypothesis, we used a dual-task approach where participants performed an intervening Stroop task during the delay period of an orientation delayed estimation task <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a</ref>). Because the intervening task draws attention from the internal orientation representation, the representation should be maintained passively outside the focus of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Clapp et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Teng &amp; Kravitz, 2019)</ref>. Previous study used similar approach has shown that interrupting WM maintenance decreased the representational precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2019b)</ref>. We predicted that the WM interruption will lead to attractive serial bias because the visual system will integrate the current information with the past one to avoid sub-optimal behavior that could be driven by noisier representations.</p><p>To address when the serial bias actually emerges, we first note that most serial bias studies have focused on analyzing only the final reports (e.g., response angle at the time of key press).</p><p>However, answering the question solely on the basis of the final reports has inherent limitations because the final reports reflect the combined impact of multiple processes (e.g., encoding, maintenance, and decision). It also ignores the process of response generation which may better reflect the origin of the serial bias than the output of the process alone. Therefore, the present study analyzed two additional variables -response time and response trajectory -to more comprehensively investigate how the bias emerges in a given task. We hypothesized that, if the prior stimulus influences the decision for the new stimulus during the report, then both response time and response trajectory should reflect characteristics related to decision-making.</p><p>Specifically, we predicted that response time should be longer when the current stimulus is more similar to the prior stimulus because the decision should be more difficult in such case. We also predicted that the response trajectory should show systematic adjustments during the report <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b</ref>), as shown in perceptual decision making studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Resulaj et al., 2009)</ref>. If, however, the serial bias is driven by the distortions in the representation itself, then response time should not vary with the stimulus similarity and response trajectory should exhibit a straight line (on average) toward the final report without systematic adjustments <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b</ref>).</p><p>To foreshadow the main results, we found that the direction of serial bias was reversed when WM maintenance was interrupted by the intervening Stroop task. Response time was longer for the trials with small orientation differences than for the trials with larger orientation differences.</p><p>Critically, response trajectories converged from the opposite side of the previous-trial stimulus (repulsion) to the final report irrespective of the direction of the bias in the final report. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the direction of serial bias is dependent on how the stimulus was maintained in WM and the bias is driven by the memory-based decision during the report, placing significant constraints on existing theories on the serial bias effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Method</head><p>Ethics statement. The study was approved by the local ethics committee in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Organization, 2013). None of the studies reported in this article was preregistered.</p><p>Participants. Prior study examining the serial bias using a similar task design reported a large effect size (Cohen's d &gt; 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2019a)</ref>. A power analysis determined that a minimum of 15 samples would be necessary to detect a large effect (Cohen's d = .8) with a statistical power of .8. We confirmed this empirically in a pilot study (see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure  S1</ref>). In the present study, we recruited a total of eighty-eight college students between the ages of 18 and 30 (Experiment 1A: 18 female, 12 male; Experiment 1B: 14 female, 15 male; Experiment 2: 10 female, 19 male). Written informed consent was collected from all participants.</p><p>Apparatus, stimuli &amp; Procedure. The stimuli were generated using Psychophysics Toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brainard, 1997)</ref>  The present study used a dual task paradigm where an orientation delayed estimation task was intervened by a Stroop task <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a</ref>). In Experiment 1A, participants remembered an orientation of the sample stimulus (an oriented black teardrop; 2º long, 0.57° maximum width)</p><p>presented on the fixation dot for 200 ms. The stimulus orientation was randomly sampled from the entire orientation space (0º-360º). To ensure a uniform orientation sampling, we divided the orientation space into 16 discrete orientation bins (0º to 337.5º in steps of 22.5º), and randomly sampled the stimulus orientation from within ± 11.25º of each bin. After a short delay (300 ms), a Stroop color word ("red": 1.58º x 0.57 º; "green": 2.72º x 0.57 º; "blue": 2º x 0.57º) was green: down-arrow key; blue: right-arrow key) within the delay period. If participants failed to do so, feedback ("Slow") was presented for 500 ms. If participants successfully reported the color within the delay, a blank screen with a fixation dot lasted for the rest of the delay (i.e., 1000 ms minus response time) to ensure the constant memory delay across trials. After the delay (or after the feedback), the mouse pointer and the response ring (radius 2.15º) (but not the test teardrop) appeared in the center of the display for the orientation report. As soon as participants moved the mouse pointer 1 , a test teardrop object appeared, and the tip of the teardrop continuously followed the mouse pointer. Participants adjusted the orientation of the teardrop to reproduce the remembered orientation and pressed a mouse button to submit their report. During the mouse report, the angular position of the mouse pointer was recorded every 10 ms and the recording stopped when participants clicked the mouse button. Response time -the time difference between the onset of the response ring and the mouse click -was also recorded. To ensure that participants precisely adjust the orientation of the test teardrop, we had participants move the mouse pointer outside of the response ring to submit their report. The next trial started after a 1000-ms blank screen (ITI). Each participant completed 15 practice trials and 480 main experiment trials (30 trials for each orientation bin x 16 orientation bins) which were presented in 5 blocks of 96 trials.</p><p>The stimulus and the procedure for Experiment 1B was identical to Experiment 1A ( <ref type="figure">Figure   1a</ref>) except that no Stroop decision was necessary: participants simply pressed the down-arrow key irrespective of the color of the Stroop word. In Experiment 2, participants reported the remembered orientation after the first delay for the 75% of the trials and performed the intervening Stroop task after the first delay and then reported the orientation for the remaining 25% of the trials <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a</ref>). These two types of trials were randomly intermixed.</p><p>Analyses. We excluded participants from the analysis if their intervening task performance was poor (lower than 2 SD of the mean; three participants in Experiment 1A, two participants in Experiment 2) or if they did not follow the instruction (i.e., no response for the Stroop task: one participant in Experiment 1B, two participants in Experiment 2).</p><p>For each trial, we computed response errors by taking the difference between the sample and the reported orientations (i.e., report minus stimulus). Following the procedure used in the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bliss et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fritsche et al., 2017)</ref>, the mean of response errors (collapsed across all orientation differences) was subtracted from response errors in individual trials to compensate overall shift in the reports. Trials with the absolute response error greater than 60°</p><p>were excluded from the analyses (Experiment 1A: .77% of total trials; Experiment 1B: 0.3% of total trials; Experiment 2: 0.67% of total trials) as they may reflect lapses of attention. Trials with slow intervening task response (RT &gt;1.2s) were also excluded from the analyses (Experiment 1A: 1.84% of total trials; Experiment 1B: 4.82% of total trials; Experiment 2: 1.44% of total trials). Finally, trials were excluded if orientation reports were slower than 5s or faster than 300 ms (Experiment 1A: 2.07% of total trials; Experiment 1B: 1.41% of total trials; Experiment 2:</p><p>1.23% of total trials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serial bias</head><p>For each trial, the orientation difference between the previous trial and the given trial was computed (i.e., previous-trial orientation minus current-trial orientation) and this was binned into 9 absolute orientation difference bins (i.e., centered at every 22.5°, from 0° to 180°, with the bin size of 22.5°). Following previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2017</ref>, we assigned a positive sign to response errors away from the previous trial and negative sign to response errors toward the previous trial, and the magnitude of the serial bias was quantified by computing the average of the signed response error for orientation differences less than 90° (excluding 0°). This was statistically tested using one sample t test comparing against the null (i.e., zero bias). More sophisticated model-based analyses using a derivative of gaussian (DoG) function produced the same pattern of results (Supplementary material <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure S4</ref>).</p><p>To ensure that our analysis pipeline accurately reflect the direction of bias in relation to the prior stimulus, we conducted a simulation experiment where the current-and the previous-trial orientations were presented at the same time in a given trial. We intentionally created attractive bias by clicking the center of the two orientations for 480 trials and then run the data through our analysis pipeline. The result exhibited attractive bias as intended. We also confirmed the repulsive bias by clicking the opposite side of the previous-trial orientation from the current-trial orientation in an independent stimulation experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response time analysis</head><p>We computed the average response time for the orientation reports for the trials in each of the 9 absolute orientation difference bins. Statistical analysis tested whether the average response time for small orientation differences (abs(Δ) &lt; 90°) were different from the response time for large orientation differences (abs(Δ) &gt; 90°) using paired t tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response trajectory analysis</head><p>Response errors were computed at every 10 ms during the entire duration of the report. As in the basic serial bias analysis, positive sign was given to errors away from the previous-trial orientation. This signed response error trajectory was averaged across the orientation difference bins used to quantify the serial bias (abs(Δ) &lt; 90°, excluding 0°). For comparisons, we also analyzed the response trajectories for cardinal bias which is known to occur during the perception of the stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bae, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Girshick et al., 2011)</ref>. We gave positive sign to the response errors if the orientation of the test teardrop was on the opposite side of the nearest cardinal axis. Because serial bias may systematically interact with the cardinal bias (Bae, 2023), we used the data that exhibits no or weak serial bias (abs(Δ) &gt; 90°) for the cardinal bias trajectory analysis.</p><p>Due to the variability in the length of response trajectory, the main trajectory analysis timelocked the individual trajectories to the final mouse click and focused on the last 400 ms time window. This was to avoid noise created by motor response during the earlier time points in the trajectory: participants sometimes shook the mouse to locate the pointer after the onset of the response ring and then adjusted the mouse pointer as a part of motor execution (see Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S2</ref>). More importantly, this approach is more appropriate to test our main hypothesis because the ending points of the trajectories are naturally associated with the final biases. The length of time window was determined a priori on the basis of our pilot data where we found that more than 90% of the trials showed reaction time slower than 400 ms (see Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S3</ref>). We provide the full trajectories that combine the trajectories timelocked to the onset of the response ring and the trajectories time-locked to the final report in Supplementary material (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref>).</p><p>Statistical analysis tested whether the response trajectory exhibited a straight line or not <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>. This was done by estimating the area under the curve (AUC) between the response trajectory and the hypothetical baseline (i.e., the straight horizontal line at the response error of the final report). If the trajectory exhibited a non-straight line, then the AUC should be different from zero. This was tested using one sample t test.</p><p>Data availability. The data will be made publicly accessible at https://osf.io/685we/ upon acceptance of the manuscript.    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2b</ref> shows the average response error as a function of the absolute orientation difference between the current-and the previous-trial in Experiments 1A and 1B. In Experiment 1A, the reports were biased toward the previous-trial stimulus orientation (i.e., negative error), especially when the orientation difference was small (abs(Δ) &lt; 90°). Following the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2017</ref>, we quantified this effect by computing the mean errors for the small orientation differences. One sample t test confirmed that the effect was significant (M = -1.17º, t(26) = -3, 95% CI = [-1.96º, -.37º], p = .006, Cohen's d = -.58) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 2c</ref>). Given that this task paradigm produced repulsive serial bias when the Stroop task was not included <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2019a</ref>)(see also, <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S1</ref>), the present finding indicates that interrupting WM maintenance process reversed the direction of serial bias.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serial bias</head><p>To confirm that it was the interruption of the maintenance process rather than mere distraction (i.e., seeing a Stroop word and pressing a keyboard button) that led to attractive serial bias, we conducted a control experiment (Experiment 1B) where participants simply pressed the down-arrow key to the Stroop word regardless of the color of the Stroop word. This version of the intervening task, therefore, may distract the maintenance process but minimally interrupt the maintenance process as it did not require attention-demanding Stroop decision. We found a significant repulsive serial bias in this experiment (M = 1.16º, t(27) = 5.34, 95% CI = [.72º, Model-based: p =. 013). The difference between the two types of trials was significant (t(25) = 5.97, 95% CI = [1.46º, 3º], p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 1.17, paired t test; Model-based: p &lt;. 001).</p><p>These results replicate Experiments 1A and 1B, showing that the serial bias was repulsive before the interruption but then it became attractive when the maintenance was interrupted by the attention-demanding Stroop task. In addition, this result also demonstrates that the opposing directions in serial bias in Experiments 1A and 1B were not merely driven by potential artifacts of the between-subject design experiment (e.g., differences in encoding strategies) because the two conditions were randomly inter-mixed in Experiment 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response time</head><p>Our results indicate that the direction of serial bias could be either attractive or repulsive depending on how the stimulus was maintained in WM. We next investigated how the bias was generated by analyzing response time for orientation reports. We hypothesized that, if the bias was driven by the distortions in the representation itself, then the response time should be comparable across different orientation differences. If, however, the bias was driven by the decision during the report, then response time should be longer for the trials with small orientation differences. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> shows the mean response time for orientation reports as a function of orientation difference between the previous-and the current-trials. In all experiments and conditions, response time was longer for the trials with small orientation differences than the trials with large orientation differences. To test this effect statistically, we compared the average response time for small (abs(Δ) &lt; 90°) and large (abs(Δ) &gt; 90°) orientation differences and found that the orientation reports were slower when the orientation difference was small (Experiment  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response trajectory</head><p>To find more evidence that the serial bias is driven by decision-making processes, we examined how the report unfolded over time by analyzing the trajectory of the mouse report. We hypothesized that if the bias was driven by the change in the representation itself, participants would have guided the mouse pointer straight toward the to-be reported location from the center of the response ring, with no systematic response adjustment. To ensure that this is really the case, we first examined the response trajectories for cardinal biases (i.e., bias away from the nearest cardinal axis) which is known to emerge during perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bae, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Furmanski &amp; Engel, 2000)</ref>. As can be seen from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4</ref>, our data showed a typical cardinal bias in all three experiments (the ending point of the trajectory; see also Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref> for complete analyses and the horizontal line at the final response error; gray areas in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4</ref>) and compared it with the hypothetical baseline (i.e., AUC = 0). The difference was not significant in all experiments and Bayes factors support this conclusion (Experiment 1A: M = 1.93º t(26) = .14, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-27.01º, 30.86º]</ref>, p = .892, BF01 = 4.87; Experiment 1B: M = -7.14º, t(27) = -.59 , 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-32.12º, 17.84º]</ref>, p = .562, BF01 = 4.26; Experiment 2: M = -15.5º, t(25) = -1.02, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-47.02º, 16</ref>.02º], p = .32, BF01= 2.98). These results demonstrate that the representation-based biases exhibit a straight-like response trajectory.</p><p>We next examined the response trajectory for the serial bias <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 4</ref>). The final reports in the trajectory showed the biases consistent with our main serial bias analyses. Importantly, the trajectories converged to the final report from the opposite side of the previous-trial target (i.e., positive error), regardless of the direction of serial bias in the final report, reflecting that participants adjusted the orientation report in relation to the prior stimulus. We confirmed that this was not an artifact driven by the averaging of the trials with positive and negative orientation differences (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S6</ref>). To test this effect statistically, we computed the AUC for the trajectory. The area was significantly different from zero in all experiments, confirming that the trajectory for serial bias was not a straight-line (Experiment 1A: M = 128.06º   <ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref> for trajectories time-locked to the onset of the response period. The differential patterns of response trajectory between the cardinal and serial biases might be driven by the differences in the distance to the maximum reference point: the maximum distance to the nearest cardinal orientation was 45° but the maximum distance to the previoustrial orientation was near 90° in our quantification of serial bias. However, we found the same results when the trials with orientation difference less than 45° were used for serial bias trajectories (all AUCs &gt; 0, all ps &lt; .01) (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S8)</ref>. It is also possible that the difference between the cardinal bias and serial bias trajectories was driven by the fact that different types of trials were used in the analysis (i.e., trials with absolute orientation difference greater than 90° were used for cardinal bias trajectory while trials with absolute orientation difference less than 90° were used for serial bias trajectory). However, we found the same results when exactly the same type of trials was used for both analyses (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S9)</ref>.</p><p>Together, these results provide converging evidence that the non-straight-line trajectory for serial bias was not an analysis artifact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Reported perception is either biased toward or away from task-irrelevant prior stimulus. In the present study, we examined the role of working memory (WM) in this serial bias effect and found that the direction of serial bias was determined by how the current stimulus was maintained in WM. We found attractive serial bias when WM maintenance was interrupted by an attention-demanding intervening task (Experiments 1A) and repulsive serial bias when the maintenance was not interrupted or merely distracted (Experiment 1B). Experiment 2 demonstrated that this effect was not merely driven by the differences in encoding strategies and provide further evidence that interrupting WM maintenance produces attractive serial bias which otherwise was repulsive. In addition, we found that the prior stimulus not only biased the report of the current stimulus, it also impacted the speed of response: orientation reports were slower when the current stimulus was more similar to the prior stimulus, irrespective of the direction in the final bias, exhibiting a signature pattern of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Churchland et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the response trajectories associated with the repulsive and attractive serial bias converged into the final report from the opposite side of the previous-trial stimulus (i.e., repulsion side) rather than progressing directly to the orientation of the final report. This is in stark contrast with the response trajectory for cardinal bias which is known to originate from perception. Together, these results provide converging evidence that the direction of serial bias is determined by how the information is maintained in WM and that the bias is driven by the decision-making process that takes the memory of the previous-trial stimulus into account, rather than being driven by a biased representation of the current-trial stimulus itself.</p><p>While serial bias effect was initially conceptualized as a perceptual phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cicchini et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fischer &amp; Whitney, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fornaciai &amp; Park, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Manassi et al., 2018)</ref>, studies provide converging evidence that post-perceptual processes also play a critical role <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bliss et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ceylan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fritsche et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pascucci et al., 2019)</ref>. Integrating these findings, recent theories provide a computational framework that posits that the bias reflects the combined impact of the repulsion from the perceptual stage (i.e., efficient encoding) and the attraction from the post-perceptual stage of the processing (i.e., Bayesian decoding) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fritsche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moon &amp; Kwon, 2022)</ref>. While this 'Encoding-Decoding' framework is known to be capable of capturing final serial bias in various contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fritsche et al., 2020)</ref>, it mostly focuses on explaining the final bias alone and does not explain how and when the bias is generated. The framework also relies on abstract concept such as Bayesian priors and it is unclear what specific computations the brain operates during the post-perceptual processes. The present findings propose that post-perceptual processes recruit memory-based comparisons, determining the similarity between the current and prior stimuli and decision processes, determining whether to integrate or separate the current and the prior stimuli which is dependent on WM maintenance of the current stimulus. Consistent with this idea, previous studies have shown that perceived similarity between perceptual and memory representations led to attractive biases and that the strength of the bias was correlated with the quality of the memory representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fukuda et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Saito et al., 2023)</ref>. Our response trajectory and response time analyses suggest that the decision process took place during the report rather than during the maintenance. However, we note that this may depend on the length of the maintenance period in a given task <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bansal et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bliss et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Stein et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The finding that the response trajectories started from the repulsion side of the prior stimulus is consistent with the hypothesis that repulsive serial bias is driven by sensory adaptation during the encoding stage of information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fritsche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moon &amp; Kwon, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pascucci et al., 2019)</ref>. Alternatively (but not mutually exclusively), it is also possible that the initial repulsion in the trajectory might be driven by the interaction between the representation of the current stimulus and the reactivated representation of the prior stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, 2019a</ref>. In line with this possibility, studies have shown that a centersurround inhibitory mechanism takes place between representations in WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kiyonaga &amp; Egner, 2016</ref>), leading to repulsive bias away from each other. The present study was not designed to test these possibilities and to what extent the initial repulsive bias in the trajectory was driven by these mechanisms remains to be seen. Under the context of the present study, however, we emphasize that these mechanisms alone cannot account for the final repulsive bias because those mechanisms assume that the final bias was determined before the report was made, in which case the trajectory should exhibit a straight-line like pattern seen in the cardinal biases. Based on the finding that the final repulsive serial bias was associated with the curved response trajectory, we argue that the final repulsive serial bias was also driven in part by decision-related processes that reduced the initial repulsive bias during the report.</p><p>Repulsive and attractive biases are ubiquitous in visual WM studies. Research demonstrates that concurrent WM representations exhibit attractive or repulsive biases depending on the task demands, such as spatial attention and memory load <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chunharas et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Golomb, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lively et al., 2021)</ref>. To understand these opposing biases in WM, a recent study proposed a theoretical framework, suggesting that the direction of WM biases is contingent upon the quality of WM representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lively et al., 2021)</ref>. This framework predicts that visual WM representations show attractive biases under low memory fidelity conditions (e.g., high memory load trials) and repulsive biases under high memory fidelity conditions (e.g., low memory load trials). Our results are consistent with these predictions despite the fact that serial bias occurs between the current and the prior representations, rather than between concurrent WM representations. However, the exact relationship between the variability and biases in WM reports remains to be seen: although it is possible that the variability in the representational fidelity caused differential biases in the report, it is also possible that both the variability in the representational fidelity and differential biases was driven by the differences in WM maintenance process. In addition, future research should investigate whether observed biases in WM reflect the biased representation itself or biased decision during the report.</p><p>Methodologically, our mouse tracking analysis provides an efficient approach to investigate the nature of biases in visual information processing beyond the serial bias effect. Understanding the nature of biased reports in visual perception tasks is a fundamental yet challenging question in part because the behavioral reports reflect the combined impact of multiple cognitive processes. Therefore, to better understand that nature of the biased reports, one should take more comprehensive approach, focusing not only on what was reported but also on how it was reported. One such approach includes the use of neural decoding techniques, which can track how the representation evolves over time in a given task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bae, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ester et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sheehan &amp; Serences, 2022)</ref>. However, the neural decoding may be limited to the decoding of spatial features (e.g., location and orientation) and neural signals may not have sufficient temporal resolution (e.g., fMRI) to detect when the bias emerges in a timely manner. Here, our mouse tracking method provides an efficient complementary approach which can provide information on the origin of the bias (representation vs. decision) for both spatial and non-spatial visual</p><p>features. The present study demonstrates that cardinal and serial biases in orientation reports exhibit differential patterns of response trajectory. Future research should investigate whether corresponding biases in non-spatial features, such as colors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bae et al., 2015;</ref>, also exhibit the same pattern of the results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>and MATLAB (The MathWorks, MA) and presented on an LCD monitor (60 Hz) at viewing distance of approximately 100 cm.

A two-sample t test confirmed that this effect was significantly different from the attractive bias in Experiment 1A (t(53) = -5.28, 95% CI = [-3.21º, -1.44º], p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 1.42, two sample t test; Model-based: p &lt;. 001) (Figure 2c).To further confirm that the intervening Stroop task altered the direction of serial bias, we conducted Experiment 2 where participants reported the remembered orientation directly after a short delay in the majority (75%) of the trials (short-delay condition), and performed the intervening Stroop task and then reported the remembered orientation in the remaining trials (w/ Stroop condition)(Figure 1a). If the Stroop intervening task indeed altered the direction of serial bias in the final report, then the short-delay condition should exhibit repulsive serial bias and the w/ Stroop condition should exhibit attractive serial bias. Figure 2e and 2f summarizes the results from this experiment. As predicted, trials without the Stroop task (i.e., short-delay condition) exhibited a repulsive serial bias (M = 2.1º, t(24) = 4.82, 95% CI = [.68º, 1.71º], p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = .94; Model-based: p &lt;. 001) while trials with the Stroop task exhibited an attractive serial bias (M = -1.04º, t(25) = -2.39, 95% CI = [-1.93º, -.14º], p = .025, Cohen's d = -.47;</figDesc></figure>
