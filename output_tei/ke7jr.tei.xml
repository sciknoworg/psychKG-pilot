				<p>Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is an ever growing field that attracts much attention for research and development due to its increasing size and complexity that resulted in having risks occurring frequently, these risks need to be identified, predicted, and mitigated since they tend to happen unexpectedly. Some supply chain industries are still struggling to mitigate these risks, that has emphasized the importance of predictions and decision making which researchers are trying to solve using mathematical techniques. This makes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques a great approach to solve these problems with their prediction and problem solving abilities. This paper focuses on the application of AI and ML effect on improving SCRM along with data mining importance and discusses the gaps and limitations of such technologies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Supply chains (SC) have been growing rapidly over the years, and the larger the growth more problems and unpredictable risks can happen. This, in turn, affects this growing industry and subjects it to countless losses with threats to its continuity. This turned many eyes of researchers to try to analyze the different causes of these problems and try to minimize the effects of these risks, which resulted in the concept of Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM).</p><p>Different researchers have conducted various research each with their own methodology, some of which are quantitative such as mathematical approaches, the use of statistics and simulations, and the others are qualitative such as theoretical approaches and evidential approaches based on observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. SCRM approaches can be either reactive which responds to the risk after it takes place, or proactive which analyzes and denies said risks before taking place. Evidence proved that proactive approaches tend to be more effective since denying risks from happening is better than having to deal with the already damaging risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In other words, being proactive means efficiently predicting the chances of various risks happening. This makes Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques a suitable approach to be applied in SCRM as a predictor for these risks. Therefore, it's claimed that AI and Machine Learning (ML) technology might revolutionize SCRM by using predictive analytics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>As a result, decision making in SCRM has been increasingly adopting different data analysis techniques to contribute in predicting the risks, thus the significance of applying more advanced AI techniques such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of AI methodologies used in SCRM and their ability to deny different risks by exploiting Machine Learning, prediction, and decision making. The following research questions are to be answered.</p><p>• 1. How much of a positive effect have AI techniques had on solving SCRM problems?</p><p>• 2. What are the adopted approaches to deal with the risks effectively using data from online sources?</p><p>• 3. How will AI have promising results in the future on SCRM as it continues to develop?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Supply chain risk management processes</head><p>Supply chain risk has no consistent definition that can describe it, the reason for that is that mainly the risks affecting SC tend to be ambiguous as a result of an unexpected and uncertain event <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Therefore, risks are considered weakness to the SC that should be treated by strengthening the toughness of SC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. SCM has to ensure that different processes such as the transition of products, materials, or information are run smoothly without any obstructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>As a result, SCRM is an adopted process with an aim to stop different risks either by strengthening the SC core to minimize the chances of different risks occurring, or by minimizing the damage done by the already occurred risks.</p><p>Predicting risks in SCRM has to be done accurately and quickly especially with high impact low frequency risks, this has brought a limitation to the standard mathematical techniques as they aren't able to predict the upcoming risks. Failing to do that would lead to catastrophic events, thus the importance of adopting AI techniques which are efficient in predicting future uncertainties and decision making. Integrating AI techniques and mathematical models in the SCRM would improve the performance greatly in both predicting and mitigating different risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</head><p>AI is applied in almost every field of the modern world, and SC is a field that benefits greatly from AI. Several AI techniques that benefit SCRM decision making, Machine Learning, Multi agent systems, and Petri nets (PN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Each technique has its own success rate in various situations and methodologies and can greatly help in mitigating the risk damage and improve the toughness of SC.</p><p>Machine Learning (ML) is one of the strongest techniques in the field of AI as it can withstand massive amounts of data from different sources with an ability to process this data effectively, which makes it a suitable solution for a large industry like SC. That is proven by using Bayesian networks (BN) which is an ML approach to successfully analyze the risk propagation in SC in order to measure the weaknesses and adaptability of different SC nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ANALYSIS OF STUDIES</head><p>This section studies the approached techniques based on evidence, explain how they are one of the better options that are suitable for our problem, and state some of their complications and limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Machine Learning Techniques</head><p>Machine Learning approaches can cover a wide range of problems, it covers regression, classification, and clustering problems. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were tested by Silva to predict future risks as they are able to predict future scenarios having new data as input that were untrained before to the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, ANN were used more commonly in predicting risks. Another good reason for adopting ANN is that these networks run their inputs through multiple non linear mathematical equations to get the outputs, methods like these are called 'black box' methods. It was suggested by Van Gulijk that 'black box' methods aren't the most trustworthy ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. As a result, Deep Neural Networks were introduced to overcome the previous obstacles and predict the risks more accurately by monitoring the fluctuations in the condition of the system which, in turn, improved the quality of the decision making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian Network (BN) technique was also introduced by</head><p>Garvey to analyze the risk propagation by picking up new information whenever it appears using risk dependency graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Li improved BN technique to make it able to quantify the possibility of any risks happening in the future by recognizing the various factors causing these risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>A good SCRM would have as few vulnerabilities as possible along with a higher level of toughness against different risks, thus a strong approach is essential to achieving these conditions and keep the SC sustainable and more performing. This can be expressed through key performance indicators (KPI), maintaining these KPIs would improve the overall performance of the system and reduce the potential risks. Therefore, a mathematical model was introduced by Dumitrascu using an AI algorithm that uses a data mining multilayer perceptron that analyzes the risks efficiently which improves the KPIs mentioned <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. It was proven later that using historical data improved the prediction accuracy greatly in the SCRM <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>However, a notable error occurred due to the imbalance of classes of different risks around different SC industries, the fact that each industry has its different causes of risks caused inconsistencies which imposed a challenge in applying ML techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data mining</head><p>The ever-growing amounts of big data and information along with the improvement of technology and the increase of uncertain risks have caused data to be a big field of interest in contributing to SCRM. Data can help us adopt reactive and proactive approaches by making use of other historical risks data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Data mining is a method of acquiring this data by collecting various risk data from different sources through the SC industry or a certain SC organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Good sources of such data are social media and news, they can contain a big variety of data related to SC risks such as natural disasters, world conditions, or environmental occurrences. Natural disasters, for example, can be predicted by tracking locations of similar occurrences such as tweets or news about earthquakes and their locations which are stored and used to feed AI algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>A real-world application was done by Su &amp; Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> where they created a tool to capture tweets about different suppliers through sentiment analysis to collect any potential risks about the suppliers. Though, one disadvantage of this method was the great sizes of the historical data to be stored, so the method only adopted live tweets which wasn't enough data to be trained into the AI models as input. However, another solution was suggested by Kamruzzaman <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> by using a hybrid AI algorithm that merges association rule, Naïve Bayes, and genetic algorithms that can require less training data and manage to give results with higher accuracy. As a result, different ML approaches can be applied to SCRM in different situations which provides high flexibility and accuracy, and give place for more data sources like social media in comparison to traditional methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSION</head><p>We discuss in this section the answers to the research questions presented, along with addressing some of the gaps discovered.</p><p>In our analysis of studies, we answered the first and second questions, AI techniques greatly helped SCRM by identifying, predicting, mitigating, and denying different risks. We deduced that predicting and denying risks is more effective than mitigating the effects of these risks.</p><p>Our studies explored Machine Learning as one of the stronger AI techniques in SCRM field as they provide a more analytical approach to the problem and give more accurate and quantitative results in predicting the risks. We also explored the importance of data as most research only aim to predict the risks without any attempt of understanding these risks. This makes it more difficult for SC researchers to understand the prediction results which causes difficulties with decision making for dealing with these risks. That, in turn, encouraged leaning more towards using data analysis approaches by collecting data from different sources and combining AI and ML techniques to train with this data to give a more accurate decision making and a stronger performing SCRM.</p><p>As for the third research question, AI could have promising results in the future of SCRM by addressing the following gaps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Gaps in methods 1) Applying Artificial Intelligence in SCRM:</head><p>Applying AI in SCRM is still in its early stages as it's not widely applied in more advanced industry problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. AI usage in SC is also limited to learning and prediting, as most SC researches still tend to depend on mathematical approaches than AI approaches. They don't seem to trust AI techniques enough to depend on its ability to predict the unknown risks in the future, thus more research in the applicability of AI techniques in SCRM can turn AI into a reliable approach in predicting risks which would strengthen SCRM and turn SC managers' attention to trusting AI techniques more.</p><p>2) Data Analytics in prediction: Data analytics can be useful in risk management for SC. It is hindered by classes imbalance, difficulties extracting relevant data, and having a little understanding. However, combining ML techniques and data analytics into SCRM to predict and mitigate the risks as discussed earlier with BN techniques that use data mining that proved to be efficient. More research and testing can be done to explore more robust methods in the hope of improving data analytics approaches.</p><p>3) Applying hyprid methods: An adopted method to solve a certain problem can't be used to solve other problems, that results in most methods having limitation when applied. In order to solve that, researchers would integrate multiple methods together so that they'd complete each other, as in one method would do what the other couldn't. For example, in SCRM, mathematical methods are stronger in risk metigation but aren't able deal with amounts of data, make predictions or decision making. However, AI and ML techniques can deal with the mentioned. Therefore, researchers can try integrating mathematical techniques along with ML techniques in SCRM to make a more robust solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The aim of this paper was to discuss the potential and effect that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning approaches have on Supply Chain Risk Management. We explored the limitations of managing supply chain risks with the traditional ways, and the many possibilities with which AI approaches can improve SCRM. We deduced that proactive approaches are more important than reactive ones since we prefer to prevent risks rather than having to deal with their damage. The study focused on one branch of AI which is Machine Learning as it's one of the stronger approaches for the scope of this problem, along with providing evidence explaining why. Along with the many qualities that data mining and analysis would provide SCRM with by improving predictability and decision making, and how using hybrid techniques by integrating different AI techniques together would further improve the overall performance of the system. Some gaps were also identified, gaps between research findings and actual industrial expectations resulted in less use of AI in SC and encouraged conducting further research for AI to be completely integrated within SCRM. Gaps in data analytics that reside in most of the data acquired having too many classes and dimensionalities which resulted in more confusion and disruption in the ML models integrated with SCRM. However, it could be improved by using data mining, and conducting further research. Therefore, we conducted that integrating supply chains with smarter technologies of AI and ML can revolutionize SC industry and greatly improve decision making and risk management. However, because there is limited research in integrating AI with SC, more studies should be conducted to consider the gaps and limitations mentioned in this paper.</p></div>		</body>
