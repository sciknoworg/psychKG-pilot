<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT</head><p>A person high in psychopathic traits is unencumbered by the anxieties and emotions that ordinary people experience in interpersonal encounters <ref type="bibr">(Blair, 1995)</ref>. They are unable to form emotional attachments or feel real empathy with others. They lack guilt or remorse, are callous, and have a shallow and deficient affect. When doing wrong, they tend to fail to accept responsibility for their actions <ref type="bibr">(Cooper et al., 2007)</ref>. In relations, they are grandiose, arrogant, deceitful, and manipulative <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Levenson et al., 1995)</ref>. They cannot love or establish meaningful personal relationships. They may be very impulsive, violent <ref type="bibr">(Hare, 1999)</ref>, and even sadistic, including feeling pleasure from the suffering of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Porter et al., 2018)</ref>. Finally, they may manifests amoral and antisocial behavior, and they might be diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder <ref type="bibr">(Cooke et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ogloff, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lykken, 2018)</ref>. Because a person high in psychopathic traits is unable to form emotional attachments or feel empathy with others, and we already know that empathy is crucial for moral decision-making and prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Decety &amp; Cowell, 2014a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, 2014b</ref>, a person high in psychopathic traits is an excellent example of a person believed to have an atypical tendency in moral dilemma judgment.</p><p>Understanding how people high in psychopathic traits make moral dilemma judgments is relevant both for theory and practice and is crucial for clinical, forensic, or moral psychology. People with a high level of psychopathic personality traits usually have impaired empathy and remorse. They also may behave antisocially and have egoistic motives. That is why studying how they make moral dilemma judgments may help understand moral judgments' mental underpinnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Conway et al., 2018)</ref>. Moreover, psychopathy is the most dangerous of all antisocial personality disorders. Because of its high impact on other people, psychopathy has been identified by some as the most expensive mental health disorder and a significant public health issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gatner et al., 2022)</ref>. The prevalence of psychopathy in the general population is thought to be ~1% but is up to even 25% in prisoners <ref type="bibr">(De Brito et al., PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Edens et al., 2006)</ref>, and offenders who meet the criteria for psychopathy are a highly aggressive group <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Porter et al., 2018)</ref>. Because people high in psychopathic traits might be very violent <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hare &amp; Neumann, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Leistico et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blais et al., 2014)</ref>, the proper diagnosis and simply understanding of psychopathic personality are essential to avoid damaging psychopaths can do in society or recidivism <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Skeem et al., 2011)</ref>. Especially considering the hypothesis that the number of violent behaviors conducted by people with high psychopathic traits is underestimated, e.g., not reported female home-aggression <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Porter et al., 2018</ref>).</p><p>In the current research, we focused on moral decision-making and how psychopathic personality traits may influence such decisions. Because people make moral decisions every day, and such decisions impact their behaviors, understanding how people with psychopathic traits make moral decisions may help us broaden our knowledge about personality and find new practical implications, especially for clinical and forensic psychology. The main goal of the current research was to provide deeper insights into the relationships between psychopathic traits and utilitarian moral judgment by using three approaches to moral decision-making: (1) the traditional approach with trolley dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Foot, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thompson, 1976)</ref>, instrumental harm from the two-dimensional model of moral-decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kahane et al., 2018)</ref> and traditional scores from the CNI model of moral decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>; (2) a formal modeling approach to disentangle sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms, and general action tendencies in responses to moral dilemmas described in the CNI model of moral decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>; (3) impartial beneficence from the two-dimensional model of moral-decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>; and by distinguishing between three psychopathy constructs: <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(1)</ref> primary and secondary psychopathy <ref type="bibr">(Levenson's Self-report Psychopathy Scale;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Levenson et al., 1995)</ref>; (2) selfcentered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness (Psychopathic Personality PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT Inventory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lilienfeld &amp; Widows, 2005)</ref>, inclduding eight dimensions and validity scales; (3) disinhibition, meanness, and boldness (Triarchic Psychopathy Measure; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Patrick, 2010a)</ref>, including the seven recently uncovered subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Roy et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychopathic Traits and Utilitarian Moral Judgment in The Traditional Approach</head><p>Previous research showed that individuals high in psychopathy have a greater preference for utilitarian over deontological judgments than individuals low in psychopathy (for a meta-analysis, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Marshall et al., 2018)</ref>. However, those results were found using a traditional way of measuring moral dilemma judgments, i.e., the well-known trolley dilemma and its modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Foot, 1967)</ref>. For example, in the bridge version of the trolley dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Thomson, 1976)</ref>, participants must decide if it is appropriate to push a fat man from the bridge to stop the train and save five people on the track. The bridge dilemma highlights the tension between two philosophical ethics: deontology and consequentialism. Deontological ethical theories posit that moral judgments should be based on rights, duties, and obligations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kant, 1916)</ref>. Deontology says that we should not push the man from the bridge because we should strictly follow moral norms, such as not harming others. In contrast, as a particular type of consequentialism, utilitarianism posits that moral judgments should be guided by the consequences for the greater good (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mill, 1863)</ref>. Utilitarianism says that we should push man because we should focus on the consequences of our decision for the greater good.</p><p>Past research showed that people high in psychopathic traits more often push the man from the bridge than people low in psychopathic traits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartels &amp; Pizarro, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Glenn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kahane et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Patil, 2015)</ref>. Although this result was confirmed in the metaanalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Marshall et al., 2018)</ref>, it is worth highlighting that some studies did not confirm it (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Glenn et al., 2009)</ref>. Sometimes this result appeared only when participants were asked what they would do in this dilemma, but not what is morally acceptable (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pletti et al., PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Tassy et al., 2013)</ref>. Other studies showed contradictory findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Glenn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Patil, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychopathic Traits and Moral Dilemma Judgment in The CNI Model</head><p>Previous studies relied on the traditional approach of using moral dilemmas that pit "characteristically utilitarian" against "characteristically deontological" options  like shown in the bridge dilemma above, where pushing the man from the bridge was interpreted as a preference for utilitarianism and not pushing was interpreted as the preference for deontology. A significant disadvantage of this approach is that it includes two confounds in measuring moral dilemma judgments. First, endorsing the "utilitarian" option requires rejecting the "deontological" option and vice versa. This approach confounds the measurement of utilitarian and deontological tendencies, which conflicts with the idea that the processes underlying the two kinds of tendencies are independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Conway &amp; Gawronski, 2013</ref>). Second, "utilitarian" judgments are conflated with action (i.e., pushing the man from the bridge; <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Thomson, 1976)</ref>, while "deontological" judgments are conflated with inaction (i.e., not pushing the man), confounding the two moral tendencies with general action tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crone &amp; Laham, 2017)</ref>. Because of the above and other problems, a new way of measuring moral judgment was developed: the CNI model of moral decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>The CNI model of moral decision-making measures (1) sensitivity to consequences,</p><p>(2) sensitivity to moral norms, and (3) general preference for inaction versus action in responses to moral dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>. It helps to describe moral decisions using three dimensions. First, the C (from "consequences") dimension relates to the importance of considering moral decisions' consequences when making moral judgments.</p><p>Second, the N (from "norms") dimension relates to the importance of looking at the norms (like "do not kill") when making a moral judgment. Third, the I (from "inaction") dimension PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT relates to the importance of inaction versus action in response to moral dilemmas. It simply shows how often study participants choose the "no action" solution. Each of the three parameters of the model represents a probability with which certain cognitive processes occur. More precisely, by comparing the participants' responses, it is possible to estimate the probability that responses to a given dilemma are driven by consequences, moral norms, or a general preference for inaction versus action.</p><p>Gawronski and colleagues showed the first evidence that previous researchers might have come to the wrong conclusions because of using a limited measure of moral dilemma judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>. They conducted a study using <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Paulhus, Neumann, and Hare's (2009)</ref> 30-item SRP-III Scale and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Levenson, Kiehl, and Fitzpatrick's (1995)</ref> 16-item Primary Psychopathy Scale and found that people high in psychopathic traits show (1) a weaker sensitivity to consequences, (2) a weaker sensitivity to moral norms, and (3) a weaker general preference for inaction compared to people low in psychopathic traits. This result was replicated in a study analyzing how people high in psychopathic traits see personal and societal moral standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Luke &amp; Gawronski, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, the other study showed that this problem might be more complex than previously assumed. Luke and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Luke et al., 2022)</ref> used the Four-Factor Model of Psychopathy measured by a 29-item scale of psychopathy SRP-SF <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Paulhus et al., 2017)</ref> and found that those with high psychopathic traits showed the strongest and most consistent deviations in moral judgment in terms of their conformity to moral norms. However, differences in the maximization of consequences and general action preferences over inaction were less reliable across studies. The authors suggested that it may depend partly on the measurement of psychopathy, so we need more studies using other psychopathy scales to deeply understand the relationships between psychopathy and moral dilemma judgment.</p><p>Psychopathic Traits and Moral Dilemma Judgment in The Two-Dimensional Model PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT Pro-sacrificial judgments, on which the traditional approach and the CNI model are based, are just one part of utilitarian psychology. According to the two-dimensional model of utilitarian psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Everett &amp; Kahane, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>, utilitarianism has two dimensions that are conceptually and psychologically distinct. Instrumental harm (the socalled negative side of utilitarian decision-making) captures the willingness to cause harm to achieve positive consequences for the greater good. Impartial beneficence (the so-called positive side of utilitarian decision-making) taps the extent to which people endorse the radically demanding and impartial helping utilitarianism requires. While the traditional and CNI approach infer utilitarianism from responses to sacrificial dilemmas, this approach infers endorsement of instrumental harm and impartial beneficence from participants' agreement with broad ethical statements about critical ideas of the two dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this model, psychopathy (measured by already mentioned Levenson's primary psychopathy subscale) was associated positively with a willingness to personally harm others for the greater good (i.e., instrumental harm), similar to past results related to pro-sacrificial moral judgments. However, it was associated negatively with the endorsement of moral selfsacrifice (i.e., impartial beneficence) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Three Models of Psychopathy</head><p>Psychopathy is a complicated theoretical construct, and different psychopathy scales capture different psychopathic traits based on different theoretical assumptions. The construct of psychopathy has a rich history, not free from diagnostic confusion over the definition of psychopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hervé, 2017)</ref>, and researchers still have many unanswered questions about its nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Wygant et al., 2018)</ref>. There are many ways in which psychopathy was understood.</p><p>First, we can distinguish the classical dual-factor model of psychopathy, which includes primary and secondary psychopathy. It was noticed by a few researchers, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Karpman (1948)</ref> (see the review: Hervé, 2017), and empirically confirmed by Mokros and colleagues PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT (2015). In this model, psychopathy is not a disorder characterized by deficits in neurological systems, but a pattern of intrinsically antisocial behaviors based on general judgments about others and us. This model explains that social learning, not biology, plays the most crucial role when becoming a person with high psychopathic traits. Moreover, the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) was initially developed in 1995 to assess psychopathy in individuals who do not manifest extreme levels of the trait. Probably that is why it is one of the most common scales used in psychological studies. Primary psychopathy explains how selfish, uncaring, and manipulative someone is. High primary psychopathy also means the tendency to lie and a lack of guilt. People with high primary psychopathy have deficits in affective functioning, characterized by shallow affect. Primary psychopathy is related more to an individual's character. Secondary psychopathy explains how impulsive, quicktemperateness, and intolerant of frustration someone is. People with a high level of secondary psychopathy make risky decisions, and their behavior is more hostile and antisocial.</p><p>Secondary psychopathy is more related to lifestyle. Primary and secondary psychopathy positively correlate, but treating them as two separate constructs is helpful because we can distinguish between psychopathic characters and psychopathic lifestyles.</p><p>Second, we can look at psychopathy through three factors: self-centered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lilienfeld &amp; Widows, 2005)</ref>. This model was developed after a comprehensive assessment of the full range of trait constructs embodied in the clinical descriptions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cleckley (1941)</ref> and other prominent psychopathy theorists, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Karpman (1948)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">McCord and McCord (1964)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lykken (1957)</ref>. It is a personalitybased approach, so it focuses on self-reported psychopathic traits. Self-centered impulsivity is associated with impulsivity, aggressiveness, substance use, antisocial behavior, negative affect, and suicidal ideation. It is a factor that consists of four subscales: Machiavellian egocentricity (a lack of empathy and sense of detachment from others for the sake of PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT achieving one's own goals), rebellious nonconformity (a disregard for social norms and culturally acceptable behaviors), blame externalization (inability to take responsibility for one's actions, instead of blaming others or rationalizing one's behavior), and carefree nonplanfulness (difficulty in planning and considering the consequences of one's actions).</p><p>Fearless dominance is related to three subscales: social influence (the ability to charm and influence others), fearlessness (an eagerness for risk-seeking behaviors, as well as a lack of the fear that usually goes with them), and stress immunity (a lack of typically marked reactions to traumatic or otherwise stress-inducing events). It is associated with less anxiety, depression, empathy, higher well-being, assertiveness, narcissism, and thrill-seeking. Finally, coldheartedness is a separate factor that consists of only one subscale termed the same name, and it refers to being cold, not empathic, not worrying about others who are hurt, and feeling not guilty about their wrongdoing.</p><p>Third, psychopathy was also operationalized in a triarchic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Patrick et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Patrick, 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Patrick, 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Patrick, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Patrick &amp; Drislane, 2014)</ref>. This model combines historical and more present-day perspectives (e.g., neuro-etiological perspectives) in understanding the psychopathic individual. The triarchic conceptualization is not a new way of understanding psychopathy. However, the authors suggest that past measures of psychopathy do, to varying degrees, index the three constructs proposed but that measures such as the PCL-R do not capture distinct constructs. Authors suggested that past measures fail to capture some critical elements of psychopathy, referring to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cleckley's (1941)</ref> descriptive work with psychiatric patients, which highlighted the positive adjustment characteristics like the absence of delusions and nervousness or suicidal intent. That is why <ref type="bibr">Patrick and colleagues (2009)</ref> incorporated a distinct and equal focus on boldness into their model. In this model, psychopathy has three distinct aspects: disinhibition, meanness, and boldness. These three constructs are alternative conceptions of the classical understanding of PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT psychopathy. Disinhibition reflects an inclination towards problems with impulsivity, weak restraint, hostility, mistrust, and difficulties in regulating emotion. Meanness shows the tendency towards aggressive behavior and disregard for others. It entails low empathy, lack of affiliative capacity, contempt toward others, predatory exploitativeness, and empowerment through cruelty or destructiveness. Boldness measures a syndrome that contains social dominance, confidence, social assertiveness, emotional resiliency, and venturesomeness.</p><p>Lately, Roy and colleagues (2020) tested the structure of the TriPM via exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in a few samples, and they proposed a new way of using this scale. Specifically, they uncovered seven subscales, i.e., positive self-image, leadership, and stress immunity (all three uncovered from boldness), callousness and enjoy hurting (uncovered from meanness), impulsivity, and overt antisociality (uncovered from disinhibition). All emergent factors were differentially associated with the external correlates, suggesting that the three original TriPM factors do not optimally represent the conceptual model underlying the TriPM. When presenting our results, we used both solutions in the current research, as many past studies were done using the classical three factors, so now it is possible to compare our results with them, but at the same time, Roys et al. solutions seem to be the correct way of using this scale (and also our data support seven factors, not the classical three).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Research</head><p>We argue that previous conclusions about the relationship between moral dilemma judgment and psychopathic traits may be too hasty for two reasons. First, psychopathy is a complicated psychological construct, and in most previous studies, only one psychopathy measurement was used per study (the most common was the primary psychopathy subscale of Levenson's Self-Report Psychopathy Scale). Moreover, psychopathy was treated as a general, unitary construct, and only one study showed nuances in its facets <ref type="bibr">(Luke et al., in press</ref>). PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT Second, the traditional measurement of moral dilemma judgments, used to make the above conclusions, was broadly criticized for flawed methodology and theoretical problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Conway et al., 2018)</ref>. Despite that in the previous studies the CNI model was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Körner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luke et al., in press)</ref>, only one psychopathy scale was used per one study with this model.</p><p>The main goal of the current research was to provide deeper insights into the relationships between psychopathic traits and utilitarian moral judgment by using three wellknown psychopathy measures: the full version of the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Levenson et al., 1995)</ref>, Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lilienfeld &amp; Widows, 2005)</ref>, and Triarchic Psychopathy Measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Patrick, 2010a)</ref> and by using three approaches to utilitarian moral decision-making: (1) the traditional approach with trolley dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Foot, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thompson, 1976)</ref>, instrumental harm from the two-dimensional model of moral-decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>, and traditional scores from the CNI model of moral decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>; (2) a formal modeling approach to disentangle sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms, and general action tendencies in responses to moral dilemmas described in the CNI model of moral decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>; (3) impartial beneficence from the two-dimensional model of moral-decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>, which helped us to test how positive dimension of utilitarianism may be related to psychopathy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants &amp; Procedure PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT</head><p>We aimed to recruit a sample size of 700 participants, which provides a power of 80% in detecting a small correlation of r = .11 (two-tailed). Participants were recruited online. All participants were Polish and filled out the survey in the Polish language. The study consisted of two parts. First, participants were asked to respond to psychopathy measures. Next, they received the link to the second part of the study with moral dilemmas in a fixed randomized order. Participants could rest and fill out the second part of the survey at their comfortable time. Individuals who were younger than 18 years were not eligible for participation. Of the 779 participants who completed the assessment, data from 77 participants were excluded from analyses because they failed to pass one or more attention checks (75 participants) or provided the same response to all moral dilemmas (2 participants), resulting in a final sample of 702 participants (36.75% male, 62.82% female, 0.43% other; Mage = 33.46, SDage = 14.39 with a minimum age of 18 and maximum age of 83). 35% of participants were single, 29.1% were in a relationship, 31.8% were married, and 4.1% chose the option "other." 63% of participants did not have children, 11.8% had one child, 16.7% had two, 6.7% had three, 1.6% had four, and 0.3% had five. 42.3% of participants were working full-time, 10.1% in a parttime job, 33.3% were students, 4.1% were unemployed, 5.7% were retired, and 4.4% chose "other employment status." 25.1% of participants declared that they do not practice any religion, and 74.9% of participants declared that they practice religion from a low to a high degree. When asked about their religion, 16.4% of participants declared that they do not belong to any church, 76.2% declared Catholics, 3.6% were Protestants, and 3.8% declared other religions.</p></div>

Psychopathic emotional affect and lifestyle were measured using the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale <ref type="bibr">(LSPR;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Levenson et al., 1995)</ref> in a Polish adaptation (Rogoza &amp; Cieciuch, 2014). The scale consists of two PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT subscales, apart from the overall score: primary psychopathy with ten items, which measures the psychopathic emotional affect, and secondary psychopathy with sixteen items, which measures the psychopathic lifestyle. Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed or disagreed with each statement using a 4-point rating scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).</p><p>Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised. We used the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lilienfeld &amp; Widows, 2005</ref>) in a Polish adaptation , which is a 154-item self-report measure. The scale can assess eight dimensions: Machiavellian egocentricity (ME), rebellious nonconformity (RN), blame externalization (BE), carefree nonplanfulness (CN), social influence (SOI), fearlessness (F), stress immunity (SI) and coldheartedness (C). The factor of self-centered impulsivity is created from the domains ME, RN, BE, and CN. The factor of fearless dominance from the domains SOI, F, and STI. The factor of coldheartedness from the domain C. PPI-R also has a virtuous responding validity scale and a deviant responding validity scale. Participants were asked to indicate if the given statement tells the truth about them and to which degree, using a 4-point rating scale ranging from 1 (false) to 4 (true).</p><p>Triarchic Psychopathy Measure. We used the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM; Patrick, 2010b) in a Polish adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Pilch et al., 2015)</ref>, which estimates three distinct aspects of psychopathy, apart from the overall score (1) disinhibition, which consists of sixteen items reflecting an inclination toward problems with impulse control, (2) meanness with ten items measuring the tendency towards aggressive behavior and disregard for others, and (3) boldness with fifteen items, which measures a syndrome that contains social dominance, emotional resiliency, and venturesomeness. Participants were asked to indicate if the given statement tells the truth about them and to which degree, using a 4-point rating scale ranging from 0 (false) to 3 (true). Additionally, we followed Roy and colleagues (2020) PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT proposition of uncovering seven subscales, i.e., positive self-image, leadership, stress immunity, callousness, enjoy hurting, impulsivity, and overt antisociality.</p><p>Trolley Problems. Participants were presented with the switch dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Foot, 1967)</ref> and the footbridge dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Thomson, 1976</ref>) and asked whether they would perform the described action on the 7-point rating scale. The end-points were labeled "I would definitely do nothing" (1) and "I would definitely pull the lever" (7) for the switch dilemma, and "I would definitely do nothing" (1) and "I would definitely push the man onto the track" (7) for the footbridge dilemma.</p><p>Oxford Utilitarianism Scale. Dimensions of utilitarianism were measured using the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kahane et al., 2018)</ref>. The impartial beneficence subscale includes five items measuring the extent to which people endorse the utilitarian demand for impartial helping (e.g., "It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn't really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal"). The instrumental harm subscale includes four items measuring willingness to cause harm to achieve positive consequences for the greater good (e.g., "It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people"). Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with each statement, using 7-point rating scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</p><p>CNI dilemmas. Participants were asked to respond to a validated battery of 48 moral dilemmas for research using the CNI model <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Körner et al., 2020)</ref>. The battery includes four variants of 12 basic scenarios manipulating consequences (either the benefits of the described action are greater or smaller than the costs) and salient moral norms (the described action is either prohibited or prescribed by a moral norm). Participants were asked if they would perform the described action using dichotomous yes vs. no response options for each dilemma. Using the CNI model template files provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Körner et al. (2020)</ref>, the total PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT numbers of yes vs. no responses on each type of dilemma were used to estimate three scores for each participant via multinomial modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hütter &amp; Klauer, 2016)</ref>: a score reflecting sensitivity to consequences (C parameter); a score reflecting sensitivity to moral norms (N parameter); and a score reflecting a general preference for inaction versus action (I parameter). Toward this end, the CNI model was fitted to the data for each participant following the procedures by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Körner et al. (2020)</ref>. CNI parameter estimations were conducted with the freeware multiTree <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Moshagen, 2010)</ref>, using random start values, two replications, and a maximum of 90,000 iterations.</p><p>Participants were also asked about their sociodemographic: gender, age, relationship status (single, in a relationship, married, other), number of children, occupational status (fulltime job, part-time job, student, unemployed, retired, or other), religion and the degree of practicing religion (on a scale from 0 -I do not practice at all to 7 -I practice regularly).</p><p>Moreover, they were asked about their anonymous code, which helped to match their scores in two surveys. No other measures were used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic Plan</head><p>We planned to test both correlations and regressions. All psychopathy subscale and scale scores were computed by reverse-coding relevant items and then averaging all items together, forming composite scores. Given that the default framing of TriPM items is such that higher scores indicate lower psychopathy, TriPM subscale and scale scores were further reverse-coded such that higher scores indicate higher psychopathy, which is consistent with the other psychopathy measures.</p><p>We followed the original procedures to measure the main scores for the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale and the trolley dilemmas. For the CNI model, we calculated scores in traditional and modeling approaches. This way, we could compare results in traditional scores from the CNI models with instrumental harm and the trolley dilemmas. In line with past work PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT using the CNI model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Körner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Luke &amp; Gawronski, 2021)</ref>, moral dilemma judgment was quantified using two different approaches. Following the traditional approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Greene et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Greene et al., 2004)</ref>, we first quantified moral dilemma judgment as the preference for breaking a proscriptive moral norm to maximize consequences for the greater good. To this end, we aggregated the number of yes responses to one of the four dilemmas variants in which the described action is prohibited by a moral norm but produces greater benefits than costs. The resulting scores reflect the relative preference for utilitarian over deontological judgment and will be referred to as the traditional dilemma score. To analyze the relation between psychopathy and the relative preference for utilitarian over deontological judgments, as has been done in past work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Glenn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartels &amp;</ref> Pizarro, 2011), we first computed correlations between psychopathy scores and traditional dilemma scores. To examine the unique relationship between different features of psychopathy and moral dilemma judgment, we regressed traditional dilemma scores on the psychopathy subscale scores of each psychopathy scale separately. Given that both psychopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cale &amp; Lilienfeld, 2002)</ref> and moral dilemma judgments are associated with gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Friesdorf et al., 2015)</ref>, gender was included as a control variable in all regression models.</p><p>To disentangle the unique contributions of factors underlying moral dilemma judgments, the CNI approach was further used to quantify sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms, and a general preference for inaction versus action in responses to moral dilemmas. To this end, we summed the number of yes responses and the number of no responses provided in response to each of the four moral dilemma variants for each participant. Individual parameter estimates for the C parameter, N parameter, and I parameter were obtained by fitting the CNI model to the aggregated moral judgment data of each participant. PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT Since the data analytic steps of analyses using the CNI model have been described extensively elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Körner et al., 2020)</ref>, we provide only a summary here. Each parameter of the CNI model can be illustrated by a unique processing path in a multinomial processing tree, each dictating a different response pattern across the four dilemma variants manipulating consequences and moral norms. Based on these processing paths, it is possible to obtain equations expressing the probability of yes responses (i.e., action responses) and no responses (i.e., inaction responses) in terms of the CNI model parameters for each moral dilemma variant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">1</ref> Using maximum likelihood statistics, numerical scores for the three parameters can be estimated for each participant such that the discrepancy between the predicted probabilities of action vs. inaction responses across moral dilemma variants and the actual probabilities of action vs. inaction responses across moral dilemma variants are minimized.</p><p>By fitting the CNI model to the aggregated moral judgment data of each participant, individual-level parameter estimates can be obtained for the C parameter, N parameter, and I parameter ranging from 0 to 1. Higher scores on the C parameter reflect a stronger sensitivity to maximizing consequences in response to moral dilemmas. Higher scores on the N parameter reflect a stronger sensitivity to moral norms in response to moral dilemmas. Scores exceeding .50 on the I parameter reflect a general preference for inaction (regardless of consequences and moral norms), while scores below .50 on the I parameter reflect a general preference for action. Following analyses using the traditional approach, relations between psychopathy and factors underlying moral dilemma judgments will be analyzed by computing the correlation between psychopathy scores and CNI model parameters. To examine the unique relationship between different features of psychopathy and factors underlying moral PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT dilemma judgment, we regressed each CNI model parameter on the psychopathy subscale scores of each psychopathy scale separately, controlling for gender across all models.</p></div>

PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT To examine the unique relationship between different features of psychopathy and a general preference for inaction versus action, the I parameter was regressed on the psychopathy subscales scores of each psychopathy scale separately, controlling for gender across all models <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 6</ref>). When regressed on LSRP subscales, the I parameter continued to show a significant negative association with primary subscale scores, β = -.11, t(695) = -2.71, p = .007, but not secondary subscale scores, β = -.03, t(695) = -.81, p = .417.

Taken together, these results suggest that primary psychopathy, disinhibition, and self-centered impulsivity have unique associations with a general preference for inaction versus action, while other psychopathic traits have largely shared associations.</p><p>Additionally, we looked at the relations between the eight dimensions of PPI and all moral variables (Tables 7 and 8). We observed small positive correlations between the trolley switch and trolley footbridge and Machiavellian egocentricity, rebellious nonconformity, and fearlessness. Moreover, blame externalization correlated positively with the trolley footbridge. Regarding Oxford Utilitarianism Scale, all PPI dimensions (apart from stress immunity) were positively correlated with instrumental harm. Impartial beneficence correlated negatively only with half of the dimensions (i.e., Machiavellian egocentricity, rebellious nonconformity, social influence, and coldheartedness). Regarding the CNI model, the traditional score positively correlated with all dimensions, excluding blame PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT externalization. Sensitivity to consequences correlated negatively with blame externalization and positively with fearlessness. Sensitivity to norms negatively correlated with all dimensions. Preference for inaction versus action negatively correlated with six of them (excluding social influence and stress immunity). These patterns of results are very similar to the one observed for the three factors described above, but they show more nuances of the relations between utilitarian moral judgment and the PPI scale. Regarding the deviant behavior validity scale, we found positive correlations with instrumental harm and traditional score in the CNI model and negative correlations with all CNI parameters. Regarding the virtuous responding validity scale, we found positive correlations with impartial beneficence and sensitivity to norms and negative with instrumental harm, traditional score in the CNI model, C and I parameters, and trolley switch. These results make sense and are consistent with the theoretical assumptions about these constructs. For example, that deviant behavior was related to instrumental harm, as harming others may be seen as some kind of deviant behavior.</p><p>Lastly, we also analyzed seven subscales of TriPM uncovered by Roy and colleagues (2020) (Tables 9 and 10). Specifically, we found a higher level of stress immune positively correlated with utilitarian moral judgment in the trolley switch. Higher levels of subscales: stress immune, callous, enjoy hurting, and antisocial positively correlated with utilitarian moral judgment in trolley footbridge. Higher instrumental harm was associated with higher levels in all subscales apart from positive self. A higher level of impartial beneficence was associated with lower levels of the following subscales: leader, stress immune, callous, and enjoy hurting. Regarding the CNI model, higher levels in all subscales (excluding positive self) were associated with a higher traditional score. Sensitivity to consequences was not related to any of the subscales. Higher levels in all the subscales (excluding positive self)</p><p>were associated with lower sensitivity to norms. Finally, higher levels of stress immune, PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT callous, enjoy hurting, and antisocial were associated with a lower preference for inaction versus action. These results are consistent with the results observed when using the threefactor structure, but they show more nuances and may help us notice which subscales contribute more to preferences in moral judgments.</p></div>

First, the C parameter did not show significant correlations with any psychopathy scores, except for a significant positive correlation with PPI fearless dominance scores, suggesting that elevated levels of fearless dominance are related to higher sensitivity to consequences. Second, when the C parameter was regressed on psychopathy subscales, controlling for gender, only fearless dominance had a reliable association with sensitivity to consequences across analyses. That means other psychopathic traits were unrelated to sensitivity to consequences (when using the CNI model of moral-decision making).</p><p>One of the possible interpretations regarding why fearlessness is related to sensitivity to consequences is that being sensitive to consequences requires some courage (fearlessness) compared to simply following norms created by external authorities like God or society.</p><p>Future studies should try to replicate this finding and look for possible mechanisms of that relationship. The lack of relationships between psychopathy scores (apart from fearless dominance) and sensitivity to consequences shows how cautious we should be when describing moral dilemma judgment among people with high psychopathic traits. When using traditional scores, psychopathic traits were related to utilitarian over deontological moral judgment, but when using the CNI model, psychopathic traits were not related to sensitivity to consequences in our study (apart from fearless dominance). Because the CNI model solves PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT past problems about the traditional approach to moral dilemma judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>, we conclude that psychopathic traits are not associated with sensitivity to consequences when we define psychopathy through the lens of three constructs: <ref type="formula">(1) primary</ref>and secondary psychopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Levenson et al., 1995)</ref>; (2) self-centered impulsivity and coldheartedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lilienfeld &amp; Widows, 2005)</ref>; (3) the triarchic model with three distinct aspects: disinhibition, meanness, and boldness <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Patrick, 2010a)</ref>, also using more recent seven subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Roy et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The N parameter showed significant negative correlations with all psychopathy scores, suggesting that those with elevated levels of psychopathic traits are less sensitive to moral norms than others. These results align with the findings that people low in Honesty-Humility (measured with the Hexaco personality inventory) have a lower sensitivity to moral norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kroneisen &amp; Heck, 2020)</ref>. When the N parameter was regressed on psychopathy subscales, controlling for gender, we found that primary psychopathy, disinhibition, boldness, meanness, self-centered impulsivity, and coldheartedness had unique associations with sensitivity to moral norms, while other psychopathic traits had largely shared associations.</p><p>Primary psychopathy is a construct that explains how selfish, uncaring, and manipulative someone is. High primary psychopathy also means a tendency to lie and a lack of guilt. Individuals with high primary psychopathy have deficits in affective functioning; they are characterized by shallow affect. This result is consistent with the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>. It means that psychopathic traits are not related to sensitivity to moral norms, probably because psychopathic traits are associated with not caring about others and just focusing on their own selfish goals, and at the same time, not feeling guilty after wrongdoing. Our results also showed that disinhibition, boldness, meanness, impulsivity, and coldheartedness are negatively related to following moral norms. Those findings are consistent with the theoretical understanding of the above constructs. Disinhibition reflects an PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT inclination towards problems with impulsivity, weak restraint, hostility, or mistrust, so it makes sense that it is negatively correlated to sensitivity to moral norms. People characterized by high boldness are self-confident, dominant, persuasive, and resistant to stress. So high boldness and low sensitivity to norms make sense: following the norms is related to conformity, and boldness is the opposite of conformity. High meanness means that an individual has low empathy and low agreeableness and may be very cruel. This result is consistent with previous research about associations between sensitivity to moral norms and empathic concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Körner et al., 2020)</ref>. A person with high self-centered impulsivity is rebellious, non-conformist, egocentric, and externalizes blame. This relation could be explained by the fact that those who are more impulsive may be less likely to follow moral standards or rules. Finally, coldheartedness relates to low empathy, lack of guilt, and not caring about others' feelings. People high in psychopathic traits do not care about the norms because they do not care about others' feelings, and they also know that they probably will not feel guilty after wrongdoing. Because the CNI model solves past problems about the traditional approach to moral dilemma judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>, we conclude that psychopathic traits are related to lower sensitivity to norms when we define psychopathy through the lens of three constructs: (1) primary and secondary psychopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Levenson et al., 1995)</ref>; (2) self-centered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lilienfeld &amp; Widows, 2005)</ref>; (3) the triarchic model with three distinct aspects: disinhibition, meanness, and boldness <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Patrick, 2010a)</ref>, also using more recent seven subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Roy et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The I parameter showed significant negative correlations with all psychopathy scores except for a TriPM boldness subscale. These results suggest that elevated levels of psychopathic traits (except for boldness) are related to lower action averse. When the I parameter was regressed on psychopathy subscales, controlling for gender, we found that primary psychopathy, disinhibition, and self-centered impulsivity have unique associations PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT with a general preference for inaction versus action, while other psychopathic traits have largely shared associations.</p><p>The Influence of primary psychopathy on the higher tendency to action (lower to inaction) is consistent with past findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>. Given that this subscale is related to low empathic concern, those lower in primary psychopathy may be less likely to adhere to the norms. Moreover, disinhibition and self-centered impulsivity were unique to the general preference for inaction over action. Higher disinhibition or impulsivity relates to lower action aversion in responses to moral dilemmas, which is consistent with understanding those psychopathic traits: it is easier to act when individuals are more impulsive and disinhibited. Because the CNI model solves past problems about the traditional approach to moral dilemma judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017)</ref>, we conclude that psychopathic traits are associated with lowering action averse when we define psychopathy through the lens of three constructs: (1) primary and secondary psychopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Levenson et al., 1995)</ref>; (2) self-centered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lilienfeld &amp; Widows, 2005)</ref>; (3) the triarchic model with three distinct aspects: disinhibition, meanness, and boldness <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Patrick, 2010a)</ref>, also using more recent seven subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Roy et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Our results may be helpful for moral psychology theory and clinical or forensic practice focused on personality disorders. Moral psychologists study the mechanisms underlying moral dilemma judgments. According to <ref type="bibr">colleagues' (2001, 2004)</ref> dual-process theory, utilitarian judgments result from deliberate cognitive analyses of costs and benefits. Furthermore, vice versa -deontological judgments are rooted in automatic (intuitive) emotional reactions to moral problems. Our results, consistent with the latest findings of Gawronski and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gawronski et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Körner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Luke &amp; Gawronski, 2021)</ref>, pose a challenge to the dual-process theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gawronski et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Future studies in moral psychology should focus on finding the psychological processes PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT underlying sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms, and general action tendencies. The current problem also provides valuable insights into personality, clinical and forensic psychology, broadly discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Luke, Neumann, and Gawronski (2022)</ref>. Our findings suggest that people high in psychopathic traits have a weaker tendency to follow moral norms when making their moral dilemma judgments. Moreover, they are impulsive and disinhibited, so they prefer to act, not wait, when making moral decisions. Future clinical and forensic research using the CNI model could provide valuable insights for developing interventions that could help reduce antisocial behaviors by identifying the psychological underpinnings of moral dilemma judgment among people high in psychopathic traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Luke &amp; Gawronski, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Luke et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study is using a non-clinical sample. Although the sample was well-powered, future studies should include clinical and more specific samples, such as violent prisoners. We studied only individuals who mostly are on the very low end of the continuum of psychopathic propensities (i.e., the mean item scores for the psychopathy scales are generally in the 'false' or 'disagree' response range), so it would be too much to say that the study involves the examination of psychopathic personality per se. We assume that studying new samples with high mean scores could reveal a piece of new and relevant knowledge about psychopathy and moral judgment. Additionally, future research is needed to establish the generalizability of our findings (Simons et al., 2017), for example, in cases involving other types of moral dilemma judgments. Utilitarian and deontological ethics are only a tiny part of all possible ways to describe how people make moral judgments.</p><p>Moreover, we encourage other researchers to study the associations between psychopathy and moral judgment in different cultural backgrounds <ref type="bibr">(Sorokowski et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turpin et al., 2021)</ref>. PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT Lastly, it should be highlighted that the psychopathy construct is still being discussed and developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Wygant et al., 2018)</ref>. One of the most widely debated elements of psychopathy is fearless dominance/boldness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Crowe et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lynam &amp; Miller, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lilienfeld et al., 2018)</ref>, which was found not to be strongly related to externalizing behaviors (i.e., theft, physical fighting, threat with a weapon, assault with a weapon, intentional injury of another person, burglary, and being arrested) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Crowe et al., 2021)</ref>. We still need to understand better which elements of psychopathy are the best predictors of real-life behaviors.</p><p>Also, concerns regarding the unidimensionality, orthogonality, or construct validity of PPI <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neumann et al., 2013)</ref> and the TriPM scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Roy et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Roy et al., 2021b)</ref> were raised. For example, the model analyses did not support a 3-factor model for TriPM but uncovered a 7-factor structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Roy et al., 2021a)</ref>. Because many researchers still use the classical model for TriPM, we reported the results for both solutions in the current manuscript (however, our data also support <ref type="bibr">Roy et al.' solution)</ref>. As we do not have a better solution for the PPI, we reported the results using the classical way of analyzing the PPI scale, but readers should take into account concerns about this scale, and future research should look for a better methodology. Moreover, we recommend that future researchers do more advanced analyses like the item-level exploratory factor analysis or the latent profiles analysis to look for potential profiles of people with high psychopathy scores and ways they solve moral dilemmas. Despite the scales' limitations, we still need to study how moral judgments relate to psychopathy traits, especially regarding the fact that moral judgments may precede real-life behaviors, including deviant ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>To make sure that we fully understand the associations between psychopathy and moral judgment, we used three psychopathy constructs: (1) primary and secondary psychopathy <ref type="bibr">(Levenson's Self-report Psychopathy Scale;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Levenson et al., 1995)</ref>; (2) self-PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT centered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness <ref type="bibr">(Psychopathic Personality Inventory;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lilienfeld &amp; Widows, 2005)</ref> and its eight dimensions; (3) disinhibition, meanness, and boldness (Triarchic Psychopathy Measure; Patrick, 2010a), and lately uncovered seven subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Roy et al., 2020)</ref>. We confirmed that people high in psychopathic traits are correctly associated with a higher utilitarian tendency (caring about the greater good when harming is necessary) in the traditional dilemma approach (i.e., trolley dilemmas, instrumental harm, and traditional scores in the CNI model). However, we also showed that this conclusion is incorrect when using the CNI model of moral decision-making (i.e., C, N, and I parameters). We found that a higher level of psychopathic traits is related to weaker sensitivity to moral norms and less action averse in morally problematic situations. However, we did not find a relationship between psychopathy and sensitivity to consequences, apart from fearless dominance. PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS AND UTILITARIAN MORAL JUDGMENT Note: MIIC = Mean inter-item correlation. Cronbach's Alpha values for CNI model parameters were calculated by estimating two scores for each parameter, one based on responses to dilemmas with odd item numbers and one based on responses dilemmas with even item numbers. The mean inter-item correlation for CNI model parameters reflects the correlation between these two scores.      </p></div>
