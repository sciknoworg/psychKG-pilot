				<p>Statement of relevance Does our identity represent our selves who are here and now? In this research, we aimed to draw a clearer picture for mentally representing the self, defined as an individual (social-being) who exists here (space) and now (time), by utilizing tools adapted from psychophysics. Using a shape-label matching task in a redundancy gain paradigm, we showed that mentally representing the self in a social, temporal, or spatial dimension is systematically structured in such a way that the social identity carries the temporal identity which carries the spatial identity within the mental construct of the self as a whole. Such findings imply that the spatial self might be at the core of the general self-representation which conceptually extends to the temporal and ultimately, to the social domain. This novel finding advances the understanding and theorizing of the self-concept as an orderly structured mental construct across space, time, and social contexts.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal and Spatial Selves via modified redundancy gain paradigms</head><p>How the "self" is represented in human mind has long been a general quest of Psychology <ref type="bibr">(James, 1890</ref><ref type="bibr">(James, /1981</ref> because the way we construe our "selves" modulates motivation, emotion, and decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Leary &amp; Tangney, 2012)</ref>. Although empirical evidence and seminal theoretical frameworks on the outcomes of constructing the self as a social entity have mounted in the last half century, empirical findings pointing to the exact mental structure of the experiential self (who is here and now) and the integration of the social and experiential selves are largely lacking. We address and examine these questions directly by utilizing a tool borrowed from psychophysics and introduce a new paradigm that can test representational overlaps of such social constructs to establish some grounds for a more integrative self-representation across social, temporal and spatial domains.</p><p>The functionality of the perceived self as a social entity has been conceptualized as an action guiding and evaluating information processer. For instance, the self is conceived as a goal setter (possible selves; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986)</ref>, an activator of context-dependent attributes (multiple self-concept <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr">Elster, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">McConnel;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kurzban &amp; Athena Aktipis, 2007)</ref>, and a self-efficacy enhancer (expanded self; Mattingly &amp; Lewandowski Jr, 2013) in social psychology, and a saliency enhancer  and a facilitator of the information processing in attention and memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Symons &amp; Johnson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sui &amp; Han, 2007)</ref> in social cognition. Accumulated evidence from various fields of psychology and neuroscience testing such functions of the self has enabled the new era for researchers to redefine the self as an organized motivational, cognitive-affective and interpersonal action guidance system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Morf &amp; Mischel, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Leary &amp; Tangney, 2012</ref>).</p><p>Yet, contemporary evidence is limited to perceiving the self as a unique individual separable from other people, when in fact, the self can be conceived beyond such social boundaries and often projected into different time points and places <ref type="bibr">(Buckner &amp; Carroll, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">De Brigard et al., 2013;</ref>. The mental structure of how the self is constructed as a unique individual (social self), who exists at a given moment in time (temporal self) and in a given place (spatial self) are crucial sources for inferring other people's feelings and attitudes, predict own behavior, and plan own actions for future (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Adolphs, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Davies &amp; Stone, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Meltzoff &amp; Brooks, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2005)</ref>. Such an exclusive ability to project the self into alternative situations is the very basis of human decision-making processes <ref type="bibr">(Buckner &amp; Carroll, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Waytz, Hershfield, &amp; Tamir, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To date, whilst the field has endorsed empirical evidence pointing to the processing commonalities of socially, temporally and spatially alternative situations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schacter, Addis &amp; Buckner, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Parkinson, Liu, &amp; Wheatley, 2014)</ref> and the spatio-temporal dimension of the self <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Northoff, 2018)</ref>, the precise representational structure of social, temporal and spatial selves remains to be discovered.</p><p>In the present work, we aim to fill in this much needed gap by answering questions such as, does the social self share a similar mental construct as the temporal and spatial selves?; Is the mental representation of "me now" a mental summary of who we have become as an individual?; How much does the mental construct of "me now" overlap with the mental construct of "me here"? These questions are fundamental to building a comprehensive representational map of the self across social entities, time, and space to establish solid grounds for building a comprehensive cognitive architecture to investigate key characteristics of self-representation that enables self-projection. Potential answers to these questions are nearly absent in the current literature, mainly because researchers mostly rely on the existing measures and self-reports that often hinder parametric analyses for revealing a precise structure of complex social constructs such as the self.</p><p>To infer to what extent social constructs converge at the representational level requires a tool that can indicate quantifiable measures of the conceptual overlaps. In the present study, we introduce a novel paradigm derived from a measure traditionally used for gauging redundancy gain in the lower level of processing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Miller, 1982)</ref>. Redundancy gain refers to the phenomenon where performance is enhanced by responding to redundant stimuli (i.e., two identical stimuli) compared to one stimulus that prompt the same response (i.e., faster and more accurate responses) due to the coactivation of the identical information and/or facilitation of the information integration (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Mordkoff &amp; Danek, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yankouskaya, Booth, &amp; Humphreys, 2012)</ref>. More recently, a pioneering work demonstrated that not only the perceptual but also conceptual redundancy gain occurs by using nonidentical neutral stimuli (i.e., geometric shapes) associated with social labels (e.g., self, friend; . The conceptual redundancy gain occurred when responding to two different geometric shapes associated with the same label (e.g., self) compared to responding to one of those stimuli. Importantly, testing the effects on neutral geometric shapes as response targets allowed to rule out cumbersome and inherent confounds in early research paradigms such as frequency, familiarity and recency effects of social stimuli such as emotional words, faces, and names.</p><p>Inspired by the conceptual redundancy gain effect, we modified the redundancy gain paradigm in order to infer to what extent two social constructs share representational properties. Based on the rationale of the redundancy gain paradigm, the strength of the redundancy gain signals the extent to which two stimuli overlap at the perceptual or conceptual level. Consequentially, when two distinct stimuli that are each associated with two somewhat overlapping social constructs (labels), responding to one stimulus while another is present may result in a certain level of redundancy gain, depending on the overlapping structure. For instance, assume that the construct of "social self" is an overarching construct of the "temporal self" and "spatial self". One can predict that, responding to a temporal or spatial self-associated stimulus when a social self-associated stimulus is simultaneously presented should boost the response, resulting in redundancy gain because the mental construct of the social self fully encompasses the temporal and spatial selves, enabling the social self-associated stimulus act as redundant information for processing temporal or spatial self-associated stimulus. Conversely, responding to a social self-associated stimulus when a temporal or spatial self-associated stimulus is present might not result in redundancy gain because the information activation of temporal or spatial self only partially activates the construct of social self, thus failing to act as enough of redundant information.</p><p>Given the tool, we hypothesized that the social, temporal and spatial selves will show an orderly representational structure. We ground our prediction in the developmental steps of the construction of the self <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Harter, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yost, Strube, &amp; Bailey, 1992)</ref>. As an infant, the self-representation is firstly cultivated as physical self-awareness via sensing intermodal contingencies between visual and proprioceptive information for the movement of the self <ref type="bibr">(Bahrick &amp; Watson, 1985)</ref>. Accurate spatial localization of the own body is crucial to developing an integrated sense of the self <ref type="bibr">(Leed, Chinn, &amp; Locknan, 2019)</ref>. After establishing the spatial (physical) self, humans in their early to middle childhood grow to understand the temporal aspect of the self, for instance, by comparing oneself with their younger self on attributes and competencies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Harter, 2012)</ref>. Finally, the social aspect of the self arises at the middle to late childhood when children start engaging in social comparisons for selfevaluation purposes <ref type="bibr">(Ruble, Boggiano, Felman, &amp; Loebl, 1980)</ref>. Based on the evidence of the developmental stages of self-representation, we hypothesized that the spatial self resides at the core of the self-construct that extends to the temporal self which ultimately stretches to the social self ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Our aim was to test this prediction across three experiments. The following studies were fully pre-registered at the open science framework (registration DOI:</p><p>10.17605/OSF.IO/BF8EW).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>In Experiment 1, our aim was to verify the extent to which the social self conceptually overlaps with the temporal self by utilizing a shape-label association paradigm . According to our hypothesis, we expected that responding to the temporal self associated stimulus while the social self associated stimulus is present will result in redundancy gain but not the either way around. To draw a fuller picture of the process, we measured perceptual (same shapes associated with the same label), conceptual (different shapes associated with the same label) and overlap (different shapes associated with different labels) redundancy gain effects in all studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>The experiments were programmed using PsychoPy version 2021.2.3. All materials are available on the open science framework (https://osf.io/k8jf5/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants.</head><p>To determine the sample size, we replicated the redundancy gain experiment involving shapes associated with self-relevant labels (Experiment 1;  to test for the effect size (see supplementary materials). Based on the medium effect size (Cohen's ds = 0.12 ~ 0.37) we acquired, the sample size was calculated as thirty-six participants. We almost doubled the required sample size due to the high novelty of the present experimental design. Sixty-six participants (16 males; Mage = 20.33, Rangeage = 18 ~ 29) were recruited and participated in Experiment 1 for an exchange of course credits at the university of XXX</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>Illustrations of the experimental conditions in the matching trials Stimuli. Participants were instructed to form associations between four geometric shapes (e.g., randomly chosen from six shapes: hexagon, horizontal ellipse, vertical rectangle, diamond, cross, and reversed triangle, each measuring approx. 4° × 4° of visual angle; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kim &amp; Florack, 2021)</ref> and self-relevant labels. Two shapes were associated with the social self-label (i.e., myself) and two shapes were associated with the temporal self-label (i.e., [me] now), the remaining two shapes were neutral shapes (no association with a self-label). Shapes were presented at the left and right positions of the cross fixation (white) point each except for the Single condition when one shape was presented either on the left or the right side of the cross fixation. All stimuli were white and shown on a gray background on a 19 in. monitor (1280 × 1024 pixel resolution at 60 Hz).</p><p>Matching Task (Redundancy Gain Paradigm). In the matching task, participants were presented with binary-choice trials to judge whether any shape(s) presented after the target self-label were matching (press "c") or nonmatching (press "n"). The matching task was comprised of 4 conditions: 4 shape conditions (Single, Same, Different, Overlap) for each matching condition (matching vs. non-matching). In Single condition, one shape associated with the preceding self-label was presented in matching trials (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). In Same condition, two of the identical shapes that were associated with the preceding self-label were presented in matching trials. In Different condition, two different shapes that were associated with the preceding self-label were presented in matching trials. In Overlap condition, one shape associated with "myself" and another shape associated with "(me) now" were presented in matching trials. The position and the combination of the shapes were counterbalanced across all trials. In non-matching trials of Single, Same, and Different conditions, only neutral shapes were presented accordingly. In non-matching trials of Overlap condition, one neutral and one non-matching shape (not corresponding to the preceding selflabel) were presented. Each condition had 64 matching and 64 non-matching trials spread across 4 blocks in a counterbalanced way across each block, presented in a random order (128 trials per block), tallying up to 512 trials per participant.</p><p>In each trial, participants were first presented with a label (myself or [me] now) for 500 ms followed by the shape presentation for 500ms. Participants were allowed 1200ms to respond. Once participants responded, a feedback screen was presented (correct, incorrect, or too slow for responses that took longer than 1200ms). Participants were instructed to respond as fast and as accurate as possible.</p><p>Procedure. Participants were guided into experimental cubicles and given the instruction on the screen after the informed consent was obtained. Participants reported gender and age. First, participants were instructed to learn associations between shapes and social and temporal self-labels; "myself" and "me now". To clarify the meanings of social and temporal selves, participants were given the following explanations. After learning the associations (two shapes for the social self and two shapes for the temporal self), participants proceeded to perform a matching task. The presentation of the two shapes corresponding to each label in the instruction was vertical (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) to control for any effect of visual memory. The order of presenting social and temporal shape-label associations were randomized to control for any effect of the information processing order. Participants performed 15 practice trials before the actual experimental trials began.</p></div>

The conceptual redundancy gain was examined by contrasting the Different condition to the single shape condition. No significant difference was found in the temporal self-label condition, t(50) = 1.36, p = .40, CI = -19, 100, but in the spatial self-label condition, participants' performance was enhanced in the Different condition compared to the single shape condition (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> for Ms and CIs), t(50) = 3.40, p = .022, CI = 14, 55, Cohen's d = .31, indicating that a conceptual redundancy gain occurred in the spatial self-label condition.</p></div>

However, in the spatial self-label condition, participants' performance was enhanced in the Overlap condition compared to the single shape condition, t(50) = 2.47, p = .003, CI = 5, 45, Cohen's d = .22, indicating that the presence of the temporal self-associated shape boosted the redundancy gain for responding to the spatial self-associated shape but not the other way around.</p><p>Based on the results, temporal self-associated stimulus seemed to have acted as redundant information for processing spatial self-associated stimulus. This pattern supports our hypothesis that the representational structure the temporal self includes the representational properties of the spatial self.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Across three experiments, we demonstrated that participants' processing performance (speed and accuracy combined) of social, temporal, and spatial self-associated shapes systematically boosted one another revealing a mental structure of self-representation in social, temporal, and spatial domains. Our results showed that social self-associated shapes facilitated the processing of temporal and spatial self-associated shapes. And temporal selfassociated shapes facilitated the processing of spatial self-associated shapes, evidently shown in significant redundancy gains. Based on the developmental stages of constructing the selfrepresentation, we hypothesized that the spatial self would reside in the core of the selfrepresentation which extends to the temporal self, and further to the social self. Our findings showed that this pattern was indeed evident in the modified redundancy gain using a shapelabel matching task.</p><p>To our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate the representational structure of the self in social, temporal, and spatial domains. Despite abundant empirical research on the functionality of the self, an important question awaits answer: Is the self a mental construct that unifies across many constructs or a conglomeration of separable constructs? (for a review, see McConnell, 2011) The current findings indicate that the self might be systematically structured in accordance with how the self-representation is developed in human mind. Our findings are in line with converging evidence that conceptual knowledge is rooted in perceptual (sensory and motor) experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Matheson &amp; Barsalou, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wellsby &amp; Pexman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yee, 2019)</ref> as the observed representational structure of the social, temporal, and spatial selves might reflect the steps of abstraction stemming from the physical (spatial) self when acquiring the self-concept and constructing the selfrepresentation.</p><p>The representational structure of the self across social, temporal and spatial domains builds basic grounds for the fundamental materials constituting judgments and decisions in daily contexts. The ability to simulate oneself in an alternative situation for predicting and planning our attitudes and behaviors is utmost important for achieving goals and maintaining an emotional balance in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Taylor, Pham, Rivkin, &amp; Armor, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Waytz et al., 2015)</ref>. The source that gives rise to such self-projections is the self, conceptualized as a timely and spatially defined social entity. Therefore, the effort to delineate the mental structure of the self, projected onto temporal, social and spatial domains advances the theoretical framework of self-representation into a more integrative system and extends the knowledge of the cognitive organization for the self as a decision-maker.</p><p>Some limitations of the current research call for future research to test for validating the representational structure of the self. First, our data showed varying levels of perceptual and conceptual redundancy gain across the experiments. Although this phenomenon might reflect the specificities of the present experimental set-up or some malleable characteristics of the redundancy gain, future studies could confirm the overlap redundancy gain using a different task that requires a response to a target stimulus while the overlapping construct is present. Our findings nevertheless revealed that the overlap redundancy gains showed medium to medium high effect sizes (d = .22 ~ .30) across three experiments. Second, our research does not directly show at which processing level (semantic or non-semantic level) the overlap redundancy gain occurs. However, this question becomes mainly problematic when using words as stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Shepherdson &amp; Miller, 2016)</ref>. In contrast, our paradigm utilized a shape-label association paradigm to minimize the effect of words and to show the effect at the earlier (perceptual) processing level by demonstrating the effects on the neutral geometric shapes. Yet, remining questions are whether the same effect would occur at the semantic level and whether the redundancy gain occurred through the coactivation of the identical information and/or facilitation of the information integration. Future research is warranted to verify the exact mechanism of such representational overlaps.</p><p>Despite the limitations, our research demonstrates a novel paradigm that can gauge to what extent two social constructs overlap at the representational level. The present research brings new insights into building a comprehensive representational map of the self across social entities, time, and space, that had long been neglected in the field. Given this initiative, we highly encourage future researchers to propose new predictions and develop frameworks for investigating a cognitive architecture of the self-representation that enables selfprojection.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Social self ("myself"): You yourself as a social individual differentiated from other people.
