<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Moun_ng evidence suggests that a cri_cal source of corrup_on in perceptual decision making is computa_onal noise. However, it remains unclear whether similar computa_onal noise appears in different types of perceptual decisions. Here we examined whether metacogni_ve noise -a type of noise hypothesized to only affect type-2 confidence ra_ngs -also appears in type-1 decisions biased by expecta_ons or rewards. Subjects (N=319) performed a simple perceptual discrimina_on task and in different condi_ons provided confidence, or incorporated expecta_on or reward cues. Metacogni_ve noise manifests as a decrease in sensi_vity (d') when computed based on confidence criteria compared to the decision criterion. We first replicated this drop in sensi_vity with confidence ra_ngs. Cri_cally, we found equivalent drops in sensi_vity for both expecta_on and reward cues, regardless of whether the cues were presented before or ager the s_mulus. A computa_onal model with a single type of computa_onal noise that underlies confidence, expecta_on, and reward reproduced these results. These findings suggest the existence of similar computa_onal noise in perceptual decision-making involving confidence, expecta_on, and reward, thus sugges_ng common computa_onal principles across type-1 and type-2 decisions.</p></div>

Importantly, work on computa_onal noise in type-1 and type-2 decisions has been done separately with the tacit assump_on that these two types of noise are completely separate from each other.</p><p>Here we examine the possibility that similar computa_onal noise may underlie type-1 and type-2 processes. To do so, we compare confidence ra_ngs to perceptual decisions that are biased by expecta_ons about the probability of the category of the forthcoming s_mulus or unequal reward for each s_mulus category <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Drugowitsch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kok et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Martens &amp; Johnson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Meijs et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Navalpakkam et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Stein &amp; Peelen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wyart et al., 2012)</ref>.

In other words, the criterion placement for decisionmaking with expecta_on and rewards, and the criterion placement for confidence judgments can be similar, thus allowing us to ask whether the computa_onal noise associated with these criteria is also similar. Specifically, would the type-2, metacogni_ve noise known to corrupt confidence judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2021a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, 2021b</ref>) also appear as decisional noise in the type-1 judgments?</p><p>To address this ques_on, we asked subjects to perform a simple perceptual decision-making task with confidence or by incorpora_ng expecta_on or reward cues. The expecta_on and reward cues could be presented either before or ager the s_muli, thus crea_ng a total of five different condi_ons (confidence and four cue condi_ons). We first confirmed that all condi_ons led to comparable criterion placement. Cri_cally, all condi_ons were associated with computa_onal noise revealed by lower d' when computed from the biased criteria compared to the unbiased decision criterion. The results were reproduced by a simple computa_onal model with a single type of computa_onal noise that underlies confidence, expecta_on, and reward.</p><p>These findings suggested that the metacogni_ve noise which is assumed to only affect confidence ra_ngs might also affect perceptual decision-making with expecta_on and reward cues, sugges_ng that there is similar computa_onal noise across these three types of judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preregistra_on</head><p>We preregistered the sample size, exclusion criteria, study design, analysis plan, and hypotheses (https://osf.io/ryjq8/?view_only=06553a2e9c9743499aa4e6285e971118).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p>We recruited 319 subjects (age: 35.06 ± 12.98; Female = 57.69%) via the Prolific plasorm. The experiment lasted around an hour, and each subject was paid $7.5 as basic par_cipa_on fee.</p><p>Subjects were also addi_onally awarded a bonus based on their task performance. Experimental procedures were approved by the Georgia Ins_tute of Technology Ins_tu_onal Review Board, and subjects signed informed consent at the beginning of the experiment.</p><p>To ensure data quality, we pre-registered four exclusion criteria. Specifically, we planned to exclude subjects who: 1) exhibited overall accuracy &lt; 55% correct; 2) reported the same confidence level in more than 95% of trials; 3) failed three out of five awen_on checks; or 4) exhibited reac_on _mes (RTs) longer than 3 seconds on more than 20% of trials. However, these exclusion criteria resulted in retaining several nega_ve d' values for individual condi_ons, which complicates the interpreta_on of the results. Therefore, we instead applied these same criteria separately for each condi_on (except exclusion criterion 3 related to awen_on checks, which was s_ll applied in the same way as pre-registered), thus ensuring that no nega_ve d' values remained. Addi_onally, we confirmed that all of our conclusions remain the same when applying the original exclusion criteria ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>). In addi_on to subject exclusions, as preregistered, we also removed individual trials with RT longer than 3 seconds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>On each trial, two black squares were presented on the leg and right sides of the screen in an imaginary 15x15 grid. One square contained 100 white dots randomly assigned to the grid, while the other square contained 85 dots <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Each trial began with a 200-ms fixa_on period. The s_muli were presented for 300 ms and followed immediately by a 500-ms blank screen. Subjects indicated which square contained more dots. The posi_on of the square with more dots was randomized on each trial. We included five different condi_ons: confidence, pre-expecta_on, post-expecta_on, pre-reward, and post-reward.  expecta_on or reward cue ager the s_mulus presenta_on. In all condi_ons, responses were self-paced.</p><p>In the confidence condi_on, we included a 500-ms blank screen between the fixa_on and s_mulus periods. Subjects first made their perceptual decision using an un_med buwon press. Immediately ager, they reported their confidence level on a binary scale: low confidence (i.e., 50-75% probability of being correct) or high confidence (75-100% probability of being correct).</p><p>Subjects completed a total of 100 trials in the confidence condi_on.</p><p>In the expecta_on and reward condi_ons, we manipulated the temporal order between the cue and s_muli. In the "pre-cue" condi_ons, the expecta_on or reward cue (details regarding the cues are described below) was presented for 1500 ms immediately before the visual s_muli. In the "post-cue" condi_ons, the expecta_on or reward cue was presented ager the visual s_muli and simultaneously with the response prompt ("Leg/Right"). Subjects did not provide a confidence ra_ng in any of the cue condi_ons.</p><p>The reward condi_ons contained biased and unbiased reward cues. The unbiased cues indicated that correct leg and right choices would both result in winning 1 point, whereas the biased cues indicated that one of the choices would win 3 points, if correct. The expecta_on condi_ons similarly contained biased and unbiased expecta_on cues. The unbiased cues indicated that the leg and right op_ons were equally likely, whereas the biased cues indicated that one of the choices was 3 _mes more likely that the other. In reality, the biased expecta_on cues were valid on 66% of the trials to ensure that we could collect sufficient number of trials with invalid cues.</p><p>Each reward and expecta_on condi_ons had 150 trials (for a total of 600 trials across all four cue condi_ons), equally split between cue favoring the leg choice, cues favoring the right choice, and unbiased cues. Except in the reward condi_ons with biased cues, all correct answers resulted in winning 1 point. Incorrect answers always resulted in not winning or losing any points. In the end of the experiment, subjects were given a bonus based on the total number of points earned.</p><p>Subjects underwent the experimental condi_ons sequen_ally, with the sequence of task condi_ons randomized across subjects. The confidence condi_on consisted of two blocks, whereas the other condi_ons consisted of three blocks each. Every block contained 50 trials. To help subjects familiarize with each condi_on, each condi_on began with 20 prac_ce trials. The prac_ce trials were not included in the analyses and are not counted in the trial numbers presented above. To screen inawen_ve subjects, we included an awen_on check at the end of each block. The awen_on checks were regular trials, except that subjects were instructed to choose the square on the right side instead of picking the one with higher number of dots. The awen_on check trials were not included in the analyses and are not counted in the trial numbers presented above.</p><p>The experiment was programmed using the jsPsych library (Version 5.0.3; de Leeuw, 2015). To ensure that the s_mulus size was consistent for all subjects, we employed an established calibra_on procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bang et al., 2019)</ref> where subjects posi_oned the computer monitor at an arm's distance (approximately 60 cm) and adjusted the size of a credit card displayed on the computer screen to match the actual object's dimensions in real life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sta_s_cal analysis</head><p>We computed the signal detec_on theory (SDT) parameter decision sensi_vity (d') <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2004</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">! = "# (ℎ ) − "# ( )</formula><p>where -1 is the inverse of the cumula_ve standard normal distribu_on that transforms hit rate and false-alarm rate into z scores.</p><p>We also computed the SDT parameter decision criterion (c) to quan_fy the bias in repor_ng one choice alterna_ve over the other:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= − 1 2 ( "# (ℎ ) + "# ( ))</formula><p>In the cue condi_ons, we computed d' and c separately for trials with cues favoring the leg choice, cues favoring the right choice, and unbiased cues. To match the d' and c es_ma_on procedure across all condi_ons, we transformed the responses from the confidence condi_on in three different ways to match the three types of cues in the cue condi_ons. For instance, a leg cue makes subjects more liberal to report the leg choice, thus shiging the criterion to the right.</p><p>In the confidence reports, the confidence criterion separa_ng low and high confidence for right responses acts similarly to a biased decision criterion obtained when using a leg cue. Indeed, in both cases subjects report right (for the leg cue) or right with high confidence (for confidence reports) only when there is very strong evidence for a right choice. Therefore, to match the leg cues, "right" choices with high confidence were then treated as "right" choices, while all other responses were treated as "leg" choices. Similarly, to match the right cues, "leg" choices with high confidence were treated as "leg" choices, while all other responses were treated as "right"</p><p>choices. Finally, to match the unbiased cues, we retained the original choices disregarding the confidence ra_ngs.</p><p>We calculated the degree of d' drop as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">$%&amp;' ! = ! ()*+,-.$ − 1 2 7 ! /.01 + ! %+231 8</formula><p>where ! /.01 , ! %+231 , and ! ()*+,-.$ are the d' values for leg, right, and unbiased cues. On the other hand, the degree of c shig was calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">-3+01 = /.01 − %+231</formula><p>where /.01 and %+231 are the criterion values associated with the leg right cues.</p><p>It should be noted that there were circumstances where hit rate or false alarm rate was one or zero, leading to NaN values for c and d'. One common method of addressing issue is by applying an edge correc_on to avoid the zero hit rare and false alarm rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, edge correc_ons are imperfect and can lead to systema_c mises_ma_on of d' <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2021b</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= 27 ()*+,-.$ − %+231 8,</formula><p>whereas if %+231 = , then we used the formula -3+01 = 27 /.01 − ()*+,-.$ 8. However, if both /.01 and %+231 were NaN, or ()*+,-.$ was NaN, then the c shig in this condi_on was excluded from further analyses.</p><p>We note that we pre-registered analyses inves_ga_ng whether the degree of criterion shig and d' drop correlated across the five condi_ons. However, we found that the d' drop produced very low split-half reliability ( <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref>). Low split-half reliabili_es indicate that between-condi_on correla_on have to be very low too, which makes them uninterpretable. Therefore, we provide the pre-registered correla_on results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S3</ref> but do not discuss them further in the main paper. Further, we pre-registered that we would perform Bayesian correla_on equality tests for c shig and d' drop between different condi_ons. However, it turned out that the BFpack package in R that we planned to use does not support such analyses and we were unable to find any sogware to allows us to perform this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model simula_on</head><p>In addi_on to the pre-registered analyses, we performed simula_ons using the recently developed lognormal metacogni_ve noise model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2021b)</ref>. In our simula_ons, we assumed that the same "metacogni_ve" noise affected not only the confidence judgments but also the biased cues in the reward and expecta_on condi_ons.</p><p>We performed 100 simula_ons of the whole experiment, with each simula_on having the same number of subjects (N = 319), condi_ons, and trials per condi_on (100 for confidence; 150 for the rest) as in the actual experiment. In addi_on, in the simulated expecta_on cue condi_ons, we set the cue validity (i.e., s_muli category was iden_cal to the cued direc_on) to 68%, which was the same as in the experiment. To generate data for a given subject, we had to specify their associated sensi_vity (d'), response criterion ( &amp; ), criterion shig for each condi_on, and metacogni_ve noise ( 4.1, ). Because we had rela_vely small number of trials per subjects, we did not awempt to fit the model to each subject separately. Instead, we generated synthe_c experiments by sampling the parameters for each subject from the empirical data in the . Finally, metacogni_ve noise was sampled from a Gaussian distribu_on with mean of 1 and standard devia_on of 0.1 and was the same for all condi_ons in each subject.</p><p>In the model, Type-1 responses were generated by comparing the perceived sensory evidence ( ) with the decision criterion 8 . Sensory evidence was assumed to follow SDT principles, such that for s_muli from the first category (i.e., the leg square containing more dots), the sensory evidence was sampled from the distribu_on (−</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">9 !"#! 7 , -.)- 7</formula><p>), whereas for s_muli from the second category (i.e., the right square containing more dots), the sensory evidence was sampled from the distribu_on (</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">9 !"#! 7 , -.)- 7</formula><p>). Here -.)-refers to the distance between the peaks of the distribu_ons for the two s_muli categories, and -.)-is the standard devia_on of the Gaussian noise. Here, we assumed that -.)-= 1 and set -.)-= ′.</p><p>To generate responses, the model compares the sensory evidence, , with the criterion, , such that &lt; leads to a "leg" response and ≥ leads to a "right" response. Note that here = 8 for the confidence and unbiased cue condi_ons, = "# for cue condi_ons with a bias towards the "right" response, and = # for cue condi_ons with a bias towards the "leg"</p><p>response. Finally, the model generates Type-2 confidence responses in the confidence condi_on by comparing the sensory evidence, , to the confidence criteria. For a "leg" response, &lt; "# would lead to high confidence and "# ≤ r &lt; 8 would lead to low confidence. For a "right" response, &gt; # would lead to high confidence and 8 &lt; r ≤ # would lead to low confidence.</p><p>For trials with an unbiased cue in the cue condi_ons, we generated responses in the standard way described above. For trials in the confidence condi_on, following the lognormal metacogni_ve noise model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2021b)</ref>, we assumed that the criteria "# and # were sampled from a lognormal probability distribu_on across trials. Therefore, the overall probabili_es of high confidence responses associated with "# and # were generated by the following double integrals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(ℎ ℎ | = " ℎ ") = ∑ ∫ ∫ ( | !"#! $ % ! , !"#! &amp; ) '()#(*+,' 9 ; % " , +"-, &amp; &lt; ∞ % ! ! ∑ ∫ ( | ∞ % ! ! !"#! , !"#! &amp; ) , = 1 and (ℎ ℎ | = " ") = ∑ ∫ ∫ ( | !"#! % ! $ , !"#! &amp; ) '()#(*+,' 9 ; % " , +"-, &amp; &lt; % ! .∞ ! ∑ ∫ ( | % ! .∞ ! !"#! , !"#! &amp; ) , = −1</formula><p>where 5 $ was computed as ln(| + − 8 |), is the Gaussian probability distribu_on of sensory evidence, ( | , 7 ) = # √7;&lt; % " (' )*) % %, % , and '()#(*+,' is the lognormal probability distribu_on of confidence criteria.</p><p>Finally, for trials with biased cues in the cue condi_ons, we applied the same metacogni_ve noise ( 4.1, ) and generated the response probabili_es in the same way as in the confidence condi_on. Then, we performed transforma_ons such that, to simulate the effects of leg cues, we treated the model-generated right responses with high confidence as "right" responses and all other responses as "leg" responses. Similarly, to simulate the effects of right cues, we treated the model-generated leg responses with high confidence as "leg" responses and all other responses as "right" responses.</p><p>For each of the 100 simula_ons of the en_re experiment, we analyzed the simulated data using iden_cal procedures as the ones used for the empirical data. We report average values across the 100 simula_ons. The p-values reported in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> are the median p-values produced by any</p><p>given analyses across the 100 simula_ons.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criterion shig</head><p>According to signal detec_on theory (SDT), perceptual decisions with confidence, expecta_on, and reward involve a similar kind of criterion placement. Specifically, the decision criteria biased by expecta_on or reward, as well as the confidence criteria for dis_nguishing between low and high confidence, are all assumed to be shiged compared to the unbiased decision criterion.</p><p>Therefore, as preregistered, we first tested whether such criterion shig occurred in each condi_on (a form of manipula_on check). In the four cue condi_ons, we computed criterion shig as the difference in the values of the decision criteria for trials with biased cues favoring the right vs. leg op_ons. Similarly, in the confidence condi_on, we computed criterion shig as the difference in the values of the confidence criteria separa_ng low and high confidence for leg vs. right decisions.

Computa_onal noise for the biased criteria can be quan_fied as the drop in s_mulus sensi_vity (d') compared to the s_mulus sensi_vity for the unbiased criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2021b)</ref>.

Furthermore, we compared the degree of d' drop between condi_on pairs. We observed that the degree of d' drop in the confidence condi_on was significantly larger than the one in cue condi_ons (p &lt; .001), except for the pre-expecta_on cue condi_on (t(434) = .98, p = .33). Within the cue condi_ons, we found that the degree of d' drop in the pre-expecta_on condi_on was significantly larger than the one in the post-expecta_on (t(402) = 2.22, p = .03, Cohen's d = .22), but there was no significant difference between pre-reward and post-reward condi_ons (t <ref type="formula">419</ref>= .08, p = .4). In addi_on, the degree of d' drop in the pre-expecta_on cue condi_on was larger than the one in pre-reward cue condi_on (t(415) = 2.65, p = .009, Cohen's d = .26), but this effect disappeared when the cue was presented ager the sensory evidence (post-expecta_on vs post-reward: t(406) = 1.35, p = .18).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Replica_on from model simula_on with common computa_onal noise</head><p>The results confirmed our hypothesis that similar computa_onal noise may affect confidence ra_ngs and decisions made in the presence of expecta_on or reward cues. To further support this conclusion, we moved beyond the pre-registered analysis plans, and tested whether we could replicate the behavioral results with a computa_onal model that assumes that the same computa_onal noise is present in all condi_ons. Specifically, we simulated data from the recently developed lognormal metacogni_ve noise model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2021b)</ref> by assuming that subjects have the same level of metacogni_ve noise for both confidence judgments and decisions made with biased cues. To simulate the data, we sampled the sensi_vity (d') and criterion (c) values in the simula_ons directly from the empirical data for each condi_on. The main goal was to examine whether we can replicate the d' drop results in the empirical data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>).</p><p>We first confirmed that the model could replicate the criterion results across the five condi_ons ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>), as well as the significant criterion shig observed in each condi_on ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>).</p><p>These results are unsurprising given that we sampled the criterion values for the simula_ons from the empirical data.  <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Simulated results from a computa@onal model with common noise across condi@ons. A) Average criterion values across 100 simula_ons for trials with leg-biased (leg), right-biased (right), and unbiased cues (mid) in each condi_on. Similar with the empirical data, the value for biased criteria significantly deviated from the unbiased criterion. B) Average criterion shig across 100 simula_ons per condi_on, showing a consistent and significant pos_ve value. Simulated criterion shig in the confidence condi_on was generally higher than those in the cue condi_ons. However, unlike empirical observa_ons, differences within cue condi_ons were not evident. C) Average decision sensi_vity (d') for leg-biased (leg), right-biased (right), and unbiased (mid) criteria across 100 simula_ons in each condi_on. Similar to the empirical data, simulated d' for biased criteria was lower than for the unbiased criterion in all condi_ons. D) Average d' drop across 100 simula_ons for each condi_on, with a consistent posi_ve value in all condi_ons. Nevertheless, the difference in d' drop between condi_ons in simula_ons was less dis_nct than in empirical data. Error bars represent the average of standard error across simula_ons. Significance is based on the median p-value ( 4.$+,) ) of the 100 s_mula_ons. n.s., Cri_cally, the model with common noise level across all condi_ons also reproduced the empirical data on d' drop. First, we observed that the d' values associated with biased criteria were significantly lower than the d' value for the unbiased criterion in each condi_on across simula_ons ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4C)</ref>. Second, the level of d' drop in the simula_ons was qualita_vely similar to the empirical data ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4D</ref>). Specifically, d' drop was largest for the confidence condi_on, smaller for the two expecta_on condi_ons, and smallest for the two reward condi_ons, and this was true for both the empirical data and the simula_ons. Cri_cally, this similarity was not built into the model but emerged naturally. The reason d' drop changed between condi_ons in the model is that the model featured lognormal metacogni_ve noise. Indeed, the lognormal metacogni_ve noise leads to criteria that deviate more from the decision criterion to become progressively noisier. Thus, the condi_ons with greatest criterion shig naturally produced greatest d' drops in the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The decisional noise in Type-1 perceptual judgments and metacogni_ve noise in Type-2 judgments have been inves_gated in parallel in the literature, leaving it unclear whether the computa_onal noise affec_ng Type-2 judgments also appears in the Type-1 process. Our study aimed to bridge this gap by asking subjects to perform a perceptual decision-making task,</p><p>wherein under varying condi_ons they were required to either report their confidence in the perceptual decisions or consider expecta_on or reward informa_on to maximize payoffs. We discovered that both expecta_on and reward cues could bias the decision-making criterion in a manner akin to placing the confidence criterion discrimina_ng between low and high confidence in a decision. Cri_cally, we found a consistent decrease in sensi_vity (d') associated with both confidence criteria separa_ng low and high confidence ra_ngs and decision-making criteria biased by expecta_ons or rewards. Furthermore, by employing a computa_onal model that assumed the presence of iden_cal computa_onal noise across all types of decisions, we were able to replicate the empirical findings successfully. Taken together, the current study suggests the computa_onal noise affects Type-2 confidence judgments has a comparable effect on Type-1 judgments, highligh_ng a unified influence of computa_onal noise across different types of perceptual judgments.</p><p>Theore_cally, the similarity in the computa_onal noise between Type-1 perceptual and Type-2 metacogni_ve decisions might challenge the dominant view that Type-1 and Type-2 judgments are operated by two dis_nct (though interrelated) systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fleming &amp; Daw, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mamassian, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nelson &amp; Narens, 1990)</ref>. This two-system perspec_ve has been largely supported by the existence of confidence-accuracy dissocia_ons, where various manipula_ons have been shown to affect Type-2 confidence levels without affec_ng Type-1 performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(De Gardelle &amp; Mamassian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fleming et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rahnev, Bahdo, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rahnev et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rahnev, Maniscalco, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Samaha et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zylberberg et al., 2012)</ref>. Nevertheless, such confidence-accuracy dissocia_ons can ogen be modeled without assuming dis_nct systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fetsch et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Peters et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rahnev et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rahnev, Maniscalco, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zylberberg et al., 2012)</ref>. Conversely, a few recent studies suggest that Type-1 and Type-2 judgments may be produced by a unified system. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gao et al. (2023)</ref> found that the way by which people use the uncertainty of sensory evidence to integrate mul_sensory signals into decisions is iden_cal to how they use such uncertainty in confidence judgments. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zheng et al. (2023)</ref> provided evidence that a unified system might generate both metacogni_ve and meta-metacogni_ve judgments, a conclusion also consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Recht et al. (2022)</ref>. By demonstra_ng the existence of similar Type-2 metacogni_ve noise and Type-1 decisional noise, the current study further ques_ons the necessity of postula_ng the presence of two separate systems for percep_on and metacogni_on.</p><p>Our study could also challenge certain aspects of how the drig diffusion model (DDM) conceptualizes the process of perceptual decision making. The DDM conceptualizes perceptual decision making as a process of accumula_on terminated when the evidence reaches the same stereotyped boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Voss et al., 2008)</ref>. Pre-s_mulus cues providing expecta_on and reward informa_on are typically modeled as a change in the star_ng point or drig rate bias of the accumula_on <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dekel &amp; Sagi, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sánchez-Fuenzalida et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Summerfield &amp; de Lange, 2014)</ref> and thus noise in the pre-expecta_on and pre-reward ra_ngs would naturally be modeled as noise in the star_ng point or drig rate bias adjustment. However, noise in the post-expecta_on and post-reward condi_ons cannot be modeled in the same way. Therefore, one may expect that DDM would predict that the noise in the pre-cue condi_ons would differ from the noise in the post-cue condi_ons. Similarly, confidence within the DDM context has ogen been modeled as a post-decisional accumula_on process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Calder-Travis et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Desender et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">van den Berg et al., 2016)</ref>. This account would predict similar noise for the confidence and post-cue condi_ons, but not for the confidence and pre-cue condi_ons.</p><p>Contrary to what DDM seems to predict, our findings indicate the existence of similar computa_onal noise for pre-cue, post-cue, and confidence condi_ons, thus poten_ally necessita_ng novel DDM extensions to account for them.</p><p>Our model, which assumes a consistent level of computa_onal noise across condi_ons, successfully replicated the empirical pawern of d' drop. Par_cularly, the d' drop was largest in the confidence condi_on and smallest in the reward condi_ons. It should be emphasized that this feature emerged naturally from the model and was not built in. The reason our model makes this predic_on is that it features lognormal computa_onal noise as postulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shekhar &amp; Rahnev (2021b)</ref>. The lognormal noise leads to greater variance and thus more pronounced d' drop as the distance between confidence and decision criteria increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2021b)</ref>. Therefore, the level of d' drop in the model is directly propor_onate to the level of criterion shig, which was largely true for the empirical data where the confidence condi_on featured the largest criterion shig and d' drop, whereas the reward condi_ons featured the smallest criterion shig and d' drop. Notably, the model predic_ons did not capture the empirical finding that post-cue condi_ons had a slightly lower d' drop than the corresponding pre-cue condi_ons. This effect is likely due to post-decisional evidence accumula_on <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Desender et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Elosegi et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010</ref>) that occurs for post-cues but not for pre-cues. Nevertheless, this effect could easily be incorporated into the computa_onal model used here as a slight reduc_on of noise for the post-cue condi_ons. Overall, these modeling results support the existence of similar computa_onal noise for expecta_on, reward, and confidence.</p><p>Finally, our study confirms and extends two findings from the literature.  . Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this d' drop has never been explained in the context of a computa_onal model or linked to the equivalent d' drop seen for confidence ra_ngs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2021b)</ref>. Second, we also confirmed prior findings that reward cues have a smaller effect on criterion shig than expecta_on cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermann &amp; Landy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Locke et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Locke &amp; Robinson, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Maddox &amp; Bohil, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, 2003</ref>.
