				<p>Background. Health messages are more effective when framed to be congruent with recipient characteristics, and health practitioners can strategically decide on message features to promote adherence to recommended behaviors. We present exposure to United States (U.S.) culture as a moderator of the impact of gain-vs. loss-frame messages. Since U.S. culture emphasizes individualism and approach orientation, greater cultural exposure was expected to predict improved patient choices and memory for gainframed messages, whereas individuals with less exposure to U.S. culture would show these advantages for loss-framed messages. Methods. 223 participants viewed a written oral health message in one of three randomized conditions: gain-frame, loss-frame, or no-message control, and were given ten flosses. Cultural exposure was measured with the proportions of life spent and parents born in the U.S. At baseline and one week later, participants completed recall tests and reported recent flossing behavior. Results. Improved patient decisions (increased flossing) and memory maintenance during the week were each predicted by congruent cultural exposure and message frame (e.g., low cultural exposure and loss frame). Incongruent messages led to the same flossing as no message. Memory retention did not explain the flossing effect. Limitations. Flossing behavior was self-reported. Cultural exposure may only have practical application in either highly individualistic or collectivistic countries. Conclusions. In healthcare settings where patients are urged to follow a behavior, asking basic demographic questions could allow medical practitioners to intentionally CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 4 communicate in terms of gains or losses to improve patient decision making and adherence. CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 5 The impact of cultural exposure and message framing on oral health behavior: Exploring the role of message memory The American Dental Association recommends flossing every day to promote oral health (ADA, 2013), but fewer than half of United States (U.S.) adults floss daily (ADA, 2008). Promoting adherence to medical recommendations with printed messages is a practical and relatively inexpensive intervention to influence health behaviors. Message effectiveness depends on patient characteristics and message content (e.g., Sherman, Uskul, &amp; Updegraff, 2011), but previous work does not provide applied tools to help practitioners determine communication choices in the healthcare setting. Governmental health organizations request that culture be considered in the design of health messages (e.g., Centers for Disease Control, 2008; National Cancer Institute, 2008; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, 2003), yet it is also unclear how to measure culture within diverse populations for use in message design. The present study makes three advances. First, in an ethnically diverse sample of young U.S. adults we test the effectiveness of framed health messages with a message medium that is easily designed and disseminated in the healthcare context (brochures). Second, we present a new measure of cultural exposure, a construct designed for diverse populations, and examine its interaction with message frame in predicting self-reported flossing. Third, we evaluate the impact of cultural exposure and message frame on the ability to recall message content, and test whether memory retention is associated with increased health behavior. Message Frame and Patient Characteristics People respond differently to health messages that emphasize gains vs. losses (e.g.,</p>

One key characteristic is motivational orientation: how much people are motivated by seeking positive outcomes compared to avoiding negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carver &amp; White, 1994)</ref>. Motivational orientation moderates which frame is more effective across a number of health domains, including smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shen &amp; Dillard, 2009)</ref>, acceptance of an HPV vaccine <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gerend &amp; Shepherd, 2007)</ref>, and oral health behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sherman, Updegraff, &amp; Mann, 2008)</ref>. In oral health, relatively approach-oriented people are more persuaded by gain-frame messages (e.g., "If you floss your teeth regularly, you will have healthier teeth and gums") whereas relatively avoidance-oriented people are more persuaded by loss-frame messages (e.g., "If you don't floss regularly, the health of your teeth and gums is at risk"), as shown by increases in flossing behavior, flossing self-efficacy, and intentions to floss <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mann, Sherman, &amp; Updegraff, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sherman, Mann, &amp; Updegraff, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Cultural background affects cognition, motivation, and emotion at all levels, from basic pattern perception to affective responses of social actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heine, Lehman, Markus, &amp; Kitayama, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &amp; Norenzayan, 2001</ref>). Integrating cultural perspectives to improve health communications requires identifying psychological characteristics that vary between cultural groups and examining whether health messages framed to match those characteristics are more effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sherman et al., 2011)</ref>. For example, people from collectivistic cultures such as Japan are more motivated by avoiding losses than pursuing gains (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hamamura &amp; Heine, 2007)</ref>, perhaps due to the pressure to maintain face (social reputation) and be a valued member of their family, groups, and society. Collectivistic individuals are sensitive CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 7 to losses and vigilant to reputation threats because face is hard to gain but easily lost, and a group's reputation can be easily damaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heine et al., 1999)</ref>. In contrast, members of more individualistic cultures such as the U.S. are more sensitive to gains, individual distinction, and self-promotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heine et al., 1999)</ref>. Although individuals differ in approach and avoidance motivations within countries, the overall balance also varies between cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Norenzayan &amp; Heine, 2005)</ref>, reflecting differences in chronic motivational orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hamamura &amp; Heine, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee, Aaker, &amp; Gardner, 2000)</ref>. Framing oral health messages to be congruent with recipient culture leads to higher effectiveness: individualist White British participants indicated more flossing intentions after receiving gain-frame messages, and collectivist British Chinese participants showed more flossing intentions after loss-frame messages <ref type="bibr">(Uskul et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural Exposure</head><p>We focus on a related cultural dimension: the extent to which people are exposed to the U.S., which is relatively individualistic and approach-oriented. We present the novel construct of cultural exposure, the extent to which people are integrated into a host country (in this case, the U.S.), relative to other cultural experiences. We hypothesize that cultural exposure will interact with message frame to determine the effectiveness of persuasive health messages, similar to previous research comparing East-West ethnicities. Key advantages of the present approach are that cultural exposure can be measured for all ethnic groups and is practical for use in healthcare settings. The U.S. is highly individualistic and approach-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heine et al., 1999)</ref>, so we hypothesize that gain-frame persuasive messages will be congruent and lead to decisions to floss for individuals with high cultural exposure to the U.S. Loss-frame messages will be more effective for people with lower cultural exposure to the U.S. who are more collectivistic and avoidance-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hamamura, Meijer, Heine, Kamaya, &amp; Hori, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hofstede, 2001</ref>), CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 8 particularly those from Asian and Latino cultures, which form the largest contemporary immigrant groups in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Camarota, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Passel &amp; Cohn, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Cultural exposure is an objective, demographic measure calculated by the mean of two proportions: life spent in the U.S. and how many of one's parents were born in the U.S. (see Method for calculation). The first component approximates how much an individual has been exposed to U.S. culture in their lifetime relative to other cultural influences, and the second component indexes how much parental influence stems from U.S. vs. other cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Greenfield, 1994)</ref>. This extends work on generational status <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Taylor et al., 2004</ref>) that focused on the family level and did not include individual history.</p><p>Cultural exposure has advantages compared to previous scales: it does not rely on subjective interpretation or judgments (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ryder, Alden, &amp; Paulhus, 2000)</ref>, and should therefore be less sensitive to situational factors, experimental demand, or reference group effects (a problem where individuals compare themselves to different reference groups in cross-cultural research; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heine, Lehman, Peng, &amp; Greenholtz, 2002)</ref>. Cultural exposure is easily measured for any individual and is feasible for use in the healthcare context, unlike acculturation scales that must be written to anchor questions between two specific cultures. A recent study examined cultural exposure and message frame congruency using videos that emphasized the importance of flossing, and more flossing over six months was observed for those receiving congruent messages (i.e., high U.S. cultural exposure with gain-frame or low U.S. cultural exposure with loss-frame; <ref type="bibr">Sherman et al., under review)</ref>.</p><p>The present study advances beyond previous work by 1) testing the effectiveness of an easily disseminated printed message; 2) examining the effect of congruency on memory retention CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 9 and the relation between memory and behavior; and 3) evaluating the congruency effect on oral health behavior over one week among young adults who are provided flosses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>H1: Gain-frame messages will increase flossing among individuals high in cultural exposure to the U.S., and loss-frame messages will increase flossing among individuals low in cultural exposure to the U.S., compared to incongruent messages and no message.</p><p>A secondary goal is to evaluate memory as both an outcome and a mechanism of the key effect in H1 (as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mann et al., 2004)</ref>. Memory represents what information is available for cognition over time, so memory is a strong candidate for causing the heightened effectiveness of congruent health messages. For example, the MODE model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fazio &amp; Towles-Schwen, 1999)</ref> posits that attitudes readily accessible from memory will better predict behavior than less accessible attitudes. Also, health messages that are framed to be congruent with approach-avoidance orientation are processed more systematically <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rothman &amp; Updegraff, 2010)</ref>. Individuals elaborate more on congruently framed messages, and message effectiveness is higher when congruently framed messages present strong evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Updegraff, Sherman, Luyster, &amp; Mann, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, we expect that participants who receive congruent (vs. incongruent) health messages will have better recall (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Higgins &amp; Tykocinski, 1992</ref> on recall and health messages). In line with this claim, memory recall was improved for culturally congruent messages in two non-health studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hamamura et al., 2009)</ref>. H2: Individuals high in cultural exposure to the U.S. who receive a gain-frame message, and individuals low in cultural exposure to the U.S. who receive a loss-frame message, will have better memory retention for the health message compared to incongruent messages. CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 10 A third goal is to test whether increased memory for congruent messages leads to the improvement in health behavior. Because cultural congruency is expected to increase engaged information processing and elaboration, it could also lead to an increased accessibility of flossing-related thoughts that cause an increase in flossing behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Two hundred twenty-three undergraduates participated for course credit, M(SD) age=20.1(3.29) years; 62.8% female; 41.3% Caucasian, 17.4% Latino American, 15.7% African American, 15.7% Asian American, 1.4% Native American, 7.2% other ethnicity, and 1.3% declined to answer (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Recruitment occurred at two universities, one Midwestern and one Western, to increase ethnic and cultural diversity. The study was approved by the Human Subjects Review Boards of both universities. Participants were randomly assigned to condition: gain-frame (n=75), loss-frame (n=76), or no message control (n=72). U.S. cultural exposure varied from .002-1, M(SD)=0. <ref type="bibr">73(0.34)</ref>. At baseline (in the laboratory) and the one-week followup (online), participants reported their flossing behavior and completed recall memory tests on a computer. At the conclusion of the first session, participants were given ten individually wrapped flosses to enable flossing regardless of home supplies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures and Stimuli</head><p>Oral health messages. Two oral health brochures were developed (gain-frame: 628 words, loss-frame: 646 words) to convince individuals to brush and floss their teeth (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Materials)</ref>. Each black-and-white tri-fold brochure had a professional layout with images and text (adapted from American Dental Association, 2013), and was CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 11 ostensibly produced by the American Dental Society as indicated by several logos. The brochure contained six sections: "Your Teeth," "Your Breath," "Plaque," "Your Gums," "Your Cardiovascular System," and "How to Floss Correctly." Across brochure types, the same content was presented with different frames. For example, the gain brochure read:</p><p>"A consistent routine of brushing and flossing maintains the health of your teeth and gums," while the loss brochure read: "An inconsistent routine of brushing and flossing hurts the health of your teeth and gums." Each brochure contained 18 framed statements and 20 unframed statements, e.g., "To floss your teeth, take about 18 inches of floss in your hand." Participants were invited to keep the brochure.</p><p>Recall. Following a 10-minute figure-drawing delay task (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Christianson, Loftus, Hoffman, &amp; Loftus, 1991)</ref>, participants took a surprise recall memory test and were asked to type all the statements they remembered, one per box.</p><p>Eighteen boxes were provided, and participants made a substantive effort, spending M(SD)=5.92(3.73) minutes on free recall (recorded with survey software). Next, participants were shown the six section headers and were provided five blank boxes per cue for additional cued recalls.</p><p>Recall coding. Two trained coders, unaware of condition or participant characteristics, coded each recalled statement for accuracy, frame, and the matching brochure statement (statement ID). Recalls were coded as accurate when they retained accurate facts. Recall frame was coded as gain, loss, unframed (if the original statement was framed, but the recall was not), or control. Statement ID allowed the removal of duplicate recalls. For recalls that combined statements, credit was given for both statements when coders agreed on accuracy, frame, and statement ID for both. Coding reliability (intraclass correlation) for statement ID was very good, CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 12 baseline r=.93, follow-up r=.90; reliability was also good for frame, baseline r=.80, follow-up r=.87. Accuracy was rated dichotomously, and most recalls were rated "accurate" (94%).</p><p>Cohen's kappa is typically used to assess inter-rater reliability with dichotomous ratings, but it has well-known problems for uneven category base rates. Therefore, Gwet's AC1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gwet, 2002)</ref> was used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the accuracy, and inter-rater reliability was also good (baseline AC1=.93; follow-up AC1=.87). A blind and independent third coder resolved all discrepancies. Correct recalls from the free and cued tests were summed for overall recall frequency and accuracy. See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Cultural exposure. Participants were asked: "How long have you lived in the United States? (in years)." Years were divided by age to yield the proportion of life spent in the U.S. Then, participants were asked: "How many of your parents were born in the United States?" (0, 1, or 2). This value was divided by two so that both components reflected a proportion from 0 (low exposure to U.S. culture) to 1 (high exposure). The components were correlated r=.48, and were averaged together to yield cultural exposure. By ethnicity, Caucasians had the highest cultural exposure to the U.S.: M(SD)=.93(.19), followed by African Americans: .88(.27), Latino Americans: .58(.20), Asian Americans:</p><p>.51(.28), and Other: .42(.38).

See Discussion.</p><p>Demographics. Participants reported demographics including age, gender, and ethnicity, for which participants were asked: "What is your racial/ethnic background?" and selected from: White/Caucasian, African American, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, and Other. See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Previous flossing. Flossing behavior was measured before the manipulation with a single item <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Davidson, Rams, &amp; Andersen, 1997)</ref>: "In general, how often do you floss your teeth?", measured from 1 (Never) to 7 (Two or more times per day). See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory. Participants completed measures assessing additional constructs, including</head><p>brushing frequency (one question); flossing self-efficacy, perceived value, and enjoyment (10 questions); flossing intentions (one question); individualism (16 questions); and perceived susceptibility for oral health problems (five questions; see Supplementary Analyses). There were no significant correlations with cultural exposure nor any main effects or interactions with these variables, and they are not discussed further.</p><p>Follow-up: Self-reported flossing and recall. After one week, participants received a study reminder by email, were contacted by phone after three days if they had not responded, and completed a questionnaire online. Nine participants (4%) failed to complete the follow-up.</p><p>Participants first reported how many times in the past week they flossed their teeth, measured by integers between 0 and "14+," in addition to an exploratory item measuring brushing frequency.</p><p>Participants then repeated the free and cued recall tests from baseline. Finally, participants also completed an exploratory measure of intentions to schedule a dental appointment. There were no significant main effects or interactions with intentions.</p><p>Sampling method. In the interest of transparent sampling methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2011)</ref>, all measures and conditions are described above, and all sampled participants are described. The first data collection period (n=154) lasted 10 weeks (one quarter). This was inadequate for the desired statistical power, so collection was extended for the remainder of the following quarter (n=79). Confirmatory hypotheses were tested after data collection ended.</p><p>Analytic plan. H1 was evaluated with a hierarchical linear regression predicting flossing behavior from frame and cultural exposure (CE), with motivational orientation and its interaction with frame entered in the second step to isolate the unique contribution of CE. To highlight practical implications, a logistic regression further evaluated who flossed at recommended rates between individuals who received a matching, mismatching, or no message. H2 involves memory retention across one week and was tested with generalized estimating equations (GEE), an extension of the generalized linear model for regressions with repeated outcomes that allows for correlated outcomes and reduces Type I errors compared to using separate regressions for each outcome period. GEE was used to predict memory retention over time as a function of CE and frame. H3 was evaluated with a Sobel-Goodman test of memory decay mediating the effect of message congruency on flossing. Age, gender, and ethnicity (dummy-coded with the most numerous group, Caucasian, as reference) have previously predicted flossing behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Updegraff et al., 2014)</ref>, so these variables were retained as covariates in each analysis to avoid cohort effects and better isolate the effect of CE.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In Step 1, prior flossing was the only significant covariate, <ref type="bibr">B=.58,</ref><ref type="bibr">SE=.08,</ref><ref type="bibr">p&lt;.001</ref>  <ref type="bibr">SE=1.58,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.002</ref>. These main effects were qualified by the predicted two-way interaction, B=5.10, SE=1.90, p=.008, η 2 =.06 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). CE was entered as a continuous variable, and because CE was peaked at 1 (54.7% of cases) and ranged down to .002, contrasts were created at high CE (1) and low CE (the average of non-1 values: .45). High-CE participants who received a gain-frame message flossed somewhat more, M(SD)=5.20(.50), than those who received a loss-frame message, M(SD)=4.55 <ref type="bibr">(.48);</ref><ref type="bibr">SE=.66,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.16</ref>. Low-CE participants who saw a loss-frame message flossed significantly more, M(SD)=7.29(.67), compared to those who saw a gain-frame message, M(SD)=5.13(.59); B=13.9, SE=3.48, p&lt;.001.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self</head><p>In sum, H1 was supported, especially among low-CE individuals, with a directional but not significant contrast among high-CE individuals. To examine whether this interaction was driven by motivational orientation (MO), in the next regression step MO and its interaction with message frame were included as predictors. There was no main effect, nor was there a significant interaction of MO with frame, ps≥.31. As hypothesized, the interaction between CE and frame remained significant, B=4.97, SE=1.92, p=.01, η 2 =.05 (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>Because there is an objective threshold of recommended flossing (daily), the next analysis predicted who was flossing at recommended levels. Additionally, we tested the effect of congruent and incongruent conditions relative to no message. Congruent conditions (n=75) were either those with CE≤.45 who received a loss-framed message, or those with CE=1 who received a gain-framed message; the remaining participants saw incongruent messages (n=76). In a logistic regression using age, gender, ethnicity, and prior flossing as covariates, a congruency effect was observed on flossing at recommended rates, χ²(7)=55.6, p&lt;.001. Planned contrasts showed that participants who received a congruent message were more likely to floss at recommended rates, 44.0%, SE=4.86, than those who read an incongruent message, 28.4%, SE=4.45, odds ratio (OR)=2. <ref type="bibr">94,</ref><ref type="bibr">SE=1.43,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.03</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study provides three advances in understanding persuasive communication for culturally diverse populations. First, this study explored a message medium (brochure) that is typical for the healthcare context being studied (e.g., dentist offices) and can be easily adapted and distributed by healthcare professionals. Second, it introduced the novel, practical index of cultural exposure (CE) and showed that strategically matching culture to message frame can improve patient decisions about oral health (H1) and message memory for health recommendations (H2). Third, it demonstrated that the content of congruent health messages are better remembered, and showed that recall does not explain the behavior effect (H3).</p><p>The hypotheses were generally supported, although the congruency effect on flossing was driven more by individuals with lower cultural exposure (H1) and the congruency effect on memory was driven more by individuals with high cultural exposure (H2). Participants who There was a strong advantage of loss-frame messages among individuals low in U.S. CE.</p><p>A loss-frame advantage on behavior was also shown among a large sample of U.S. adults <ref type="bibr">(Sherman et al., under review)</ref>. This loss-frame advantage challenges long-standing beliefs about how health messages should be framed to encourage adherence to preventative health behaviors such as flossing. A recent meta-analysis showed that gain-frame messages are slightly more effective than loss-frame messages for encouraging preventative behaviors in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gallagher &amp; Updegraff, 2012)</ref>. However, past research in message framing has been conducted almost exclusively in individualistic countries: a meta-analysis reviewed 95 studies and found that only one sample was from a collectivistic country (Taiwan; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gallagher &amp; Updegraff, 2012)</ref>. Our results suggest that loss-frame messages may be more effective than gain-frame messages for individuals low in U.S. CE, and for collectivistic populations (c.f., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pakpour, Yekaninejad, Sniehotta, Updegraff, &amp; Dombrowski, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Motivational orientation (MO) did not mediate the cultural congruency effect. This was surprising, because the congruency predictions for CE arise from theory that also predicts congruency effects for MO. There are several possible explanations. One is that the BIS-BAS measure requires awareness and conscious reflection, and some individuals may be unable or unwilling to report their motivations. We recently completed a feasibility pilot to evaluate the logistics of delivering framed health messages in dental clinics and offices in central California.</p><p>We administered a validated scale of U.S. acculturation of Hispanics to participants who spoke at least some Spanish <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Marin, Sabogal, Marin, Otero-Sabogal, &amp; Perez-Stable, 1987)</ref>, and found that CE correlated with Hispanic acculturation at r(32)=.62, p&lt;.001. As expected, CE appears highly related to U.S. acculturation in Latinos, and this provides convergent validity for CE. The behavior effect in the main study was driven by a loss-frame advantage for individuals with low CE. It is possible that the key construct behind this effect is not exposure to U.S. culture but exposure to a common feature of the other cultures in our sample (e.g., collectivism, as the majority of low CE participants were also from collectivistic cultures, reflecting the most numerous immigrant groups to the U.S.; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Camarota, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>We suggest that future work further explore which psychological variables are associated with CE. Prior work using prevention/promotion as an index of MO <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lockwood, Jordan, &amp; Kunda, 2002)</ref> found that regulatory focus, an alternative construct of individual difference motivation to BIS-BAS, mediated the culture by frame interaction on flossing intentions <ref type="bibr">(Uskul et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore, measures of regulatory focus may be better suited than BIS-BAS to capture individual differences related to the exposure to U.S. relative to other cultures. The above pilot study sets up future work to uncover the relationship between CE and well-described individual differences such as acculturation and prevention/promotion focus.</p><p>The main study also found that message congruency led to improved memory retention across one week, and tested whether message memory was a mediator of the congruency effect CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 20 on flossing behavior. Despite the logic for how memory drives behavior, there are several possible explanations for the lack of mediation. First, memory may not be a mechanism of the congruency effect; congruency may lead to a cascade of effects on cognition and behavior.</p><p>Second, behavior might be driven less by memory for the content of the message than the overall memorability of the health message. The third explanation is operational. As a self-report measure, successful memory recall requires conditions beyond the presence of underlying semantic memory such as task motivation and conscious processing. Other types of memory tests that rely less on these conditions (e.g., recognition tests) may yet reveal associations with behavior.</p><p>Limitations. First, we predicted that CE would interact with framed health messages to determine effectiveness because the U.S. is highly individualistic, and low-CE individuals in our sample mostly came from relatively collectivistic cultures (i.e., East Asia, Latin America).</p><p>Therefore, CE may only be useful for determining message frame in countries that are either highly individualistic or collectivistic, and where the predominant immigrant groups differ on these dimensions. CE may be less informative for a recent U.S. immigrant from Northern Europe, a relatively individualistic place. CE may also be a poor measure for Native Americans, who have high exposure to the U.S. but are generally collectivistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fryberg &amp; Markus, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>For these groups we suggest consulting other framing moderators such as perceived susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Updegraff et al., 2014)</ref>. Second, it is unclear based on the present research how to optimally frame medical communications for individuals with moderate CE. Third, the measure of ethnicity was confounded with race and did not separate White and non-White Hispanics.</p><p>Fourth, self-reported flossing behavior could have introduced measurement error through social CULTURAL EXPOSURE, MESSAGE FRAME, AND ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR 21 desirability bias or inaccurate memory, although this would not explain the observed interaction patterns.</p><p>Conclusions. Cultural exposure is simple to measure, calculate, and use in healthcare contexts, and has now predicted differential message frame effectiveness in two independent samples of diverse U.S. citizens (the present study and <ref type="bibr">Sherman et al., under review)</ref>. These findings inform medical decision making in two ways. First, health practitioners can use strategic communication to improve message effectiveness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abhyankar, Summers, Velikova, &amp; Bekker, 2014)</ref>. In healthcare settings where patients are urged to perform (or not perform) a behavior, asking two questions about cultural exposure would allow medical practitioners to strategically describe the consequences of a behavior primarily in terms of gain or loss. Second, patients who receive congruent messages appear to decide on better health behaviors. In practice, we suggest cultural exposure could be measured at patient intake and used to inform provider communication during the patient session.</p><p>Being aware of cultural characteristics can help practitioners promote oral health behaviors in diverse populations. Cultural congruency leads to improved memory as well as greater adherence, and these two effects appear independent. Almost any health suggestion can be framed in terms of gains or losses, and framing can be employed in any medium <ref type="bibr">(speech, text, video, etc.)</ref>. We encourage oral health professionals to adapt and use our brochures, and hope that sharing these materials informs the development of strategic health messages in other health areas. In sum, strategic framing choices in health communication can improve patient decisions and behaviors. Note. The reference group for ethnicity was the most numerous (Caucasian).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>-reported flossing.

A key advance was finding the congruency effects with a simple, demographic measure of culture in an ethnically diverse sample.
