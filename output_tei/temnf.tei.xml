			<abstract>
				<p>Peripersonal space (PPS)-the immediate space surrounding our body-is known to enhance perceptual and neural processes. However, whether PPS influences voluntary action initiation and its temporal awareness remains underexplored. In this study, we tested whether spatial proximity per se affects the initiation of voluntary actions and the temporal awareness of associated events-from decision to action execution. Using an adapted Libet clock paradigm within a virtual reality environment, participants were presented with a clock either within their PPS (Near) or outside it (Far). They were required to initiate spontaneous actions and either report the perceived timing of their decision to act, report the timing of their action execution, or make no report. Results showed that when participants were not required to estimate timings, they initiated their actions earlier when the Libet clock was within PPS compared to when it was outside PPS. This suggests that there is an urgency induced by spatial proximity, which may be reduced by cognitive demands. Additionally, when the clock was within PPS, participants perceived their action decision and execution as occurring earlier than when it was outside PPS. By revealing that spatial proximity objectively modulates action urgency and subjectively influences temporal awareness of actions, these findings disclose a critical role of PPS in voluntary decision-making and temporal awareness. These results highlight a previously overlooked role of distance in decision-making processes and call for further experiments to understand how proximity can shape our experience of agency and control over actions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Peripersonal space (PPS), the multisensory region immediately surrounding the human body, serves as a critical interface between individuals and the environment. This multisensory region plays a fundamental role in how we perceive and interact with the world around us. Reminiscent of Hediger's foundational work on animal behaviour and spatial zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hediger, 1950)</ref>, PPS is understood to serve various sensorimotor functions, ranging from defensive to appetitive ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(de Vignemont, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">de Vignemont &amp; Farnè, 2024)</ref>. Electrophysiological studies in primates have significantly contributed to our understanding of PPS by identifying neurons that integrate visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information within this space <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Colby et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Graziano &amp; Gross, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rizzolatti et al., 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Several decades of empirical research since, the theoretical framework of PPS has gained enormous empirical insights, clarifying its role in acquisitive actions, defensive behaviours and social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brozzoli et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bufacchi &amp; Iannetti, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cartaud et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">de Vignemont &amp; Farnè, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Patané et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ruggiero et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Serino, 2019)</ref>. Notably, neural and behavioural responses to stimuli are enhanced when events occur within PPS compared to when they occur outside of it. This enhancement manifests as faster reaction times, increased perceptual sensitivity, and stronger neural activations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brozzoli et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brozzoli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brozzoli et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dureux et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Makin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">O'Connor et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Patané et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Patané et al., 2019)</ref>. Importantly, enhanced perception occurs irrespective of stimulus valence: even neutral visual stimuli, such as simple geometric shape discrimination between cubes and spheres, are subject to enhancement when presented within PPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blini et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">O'Connor et al., 2014)</ref>, implying that PPS could influence fundamental perceptual processes. While previous research has extensively explored perceptual advantages within PPS, the influence of spatial proximity on voluntary action initiation remains largely underexplored. Thus, the first goal of this study was to address the question of whether the distance of visual stimuli from the body modulates the initiation of voluntary actions.</p><p>Conscious awareness of initiating and controlling voluntary actions is a major component of human experience. Determining whether spatial factors influence this awareness can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying action initiation and decision-making processes. The Libet clock paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Libet et al., 1983</ref>) offers a valuable approach to accessing subjective awareness related to voluntary actions. In the seminal study introducing this paradigm, participants were asked to mentally note, and later report, the position of a rotating clock hand when they first became aware of the intention to perform a self-initiated movement, while their brain activity was continuously recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Libet and colleagues found that conscious awareness of the intention to act occurs approximately 200 ms before the actual movement, while neural activity indicative of motor preparation (the readiness potential) begins even earlier, around 500 ms before movement onset. This finding has spurred extensive debate about the nature of free will and the temporal dynamics of conscious intention. Regardless of the interpretation of Libet's original experiment, it still offers a paradigm to estimate temporal awareness of the decision to act and action execution, and, within the framework of our study, to examine their modulation by spatial distance. Recent studies suggest that stimuli presented within PPS can support motor preparation and execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Patané et al., 2019)</ref>, potentially affecting the timing of action initiation. Therefore, our second goal was to investigate whether the distance of visual stimuli from the body influences temporal awareness along the intentional chain-from the decision to act to the execution of the action.</p><p>Moreover, the original Libet paradigm did not consider the consequences of actions and their effects on temporal awareness. Haggard and colleagues extended this research by introducing external sensory events, such as auditory tones that occur predictably after participants' intentional actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Haggard et al., 2002)</ref>. This led to the discovery of the "intentional binding" phenomenon, where the perceived times of actions and their outcomes are perceived as closer together in time when the actions are voluntary. Crucially, this temporal attraction is attenuated or even reversed in cases involving involuntary movements and their associated tones. As a result, the intentional binding effect has been widely used as an implicit measure of the sense of agency-the feeling of controlling one's own actions and, through them, their consequences in the external world <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Haggard &amp; Chambon, 2012)</ref>. However, recent studies have questioned the interpretation of intentional binding, suggesting that factors like causality, predictability, and multisensory integration rather than intentionality per se contribute to the effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Buehner, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Buehner &amp; Humphreys, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kirsch et al., 2019;</ref>. In this respect, while recent studies suggested that intentional binding was modulated by distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jenkins &amp; Obhi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mariano et al., 2024)</ref>, it has been questioned whether the modulation genuinely concerned this phenomenon <ref type="bibr">(Kong et al., 2024, under review)</ref> and another study failed to report any effect of distance of intentional binding .</p><p>While temporal binding between voluntary actions and their consequences is well-documented, less is known about whether the decision to act also exhibits temporal binding with subsequent outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Haggard and Cole (2007)</ref> found that the perceived timing of the decision to act did not shift toward the timing of the action's consequence, suggesting a lack of temporal binding at the decision level. However, subsequent studies have provided evidence that individuals may retrospectively adjust their perceived decision time based on the consequences of their actions, leading to a forward shift in perceived timing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Banks &amp; Isham, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Matute et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, our third goal was to investigate whether the spatial proximity of visual stimuli affects temporal binding not only between the action execution and its consequence but also between the decision to act and the action consequence.</p><p>To address these aims, we conducted two experiments using an adapted version of the Libet clock paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Libet et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Haggard et al., 2002)</ref> within a virtual reality (VR) environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kong et al., 2017)</ref>. VR allows precise manipulation of spatial variables and provides an immersive experience that can effectively simulate PPS and extrapersonal space. In Experiment 1, we focused on decision to act, presenting the clock either within PPS (Near) or outside PPS (Far), and asking participants to either report the timing of their decision or not. We also examined the effect of introducing an action consequence (a tone) on temporal perception. In Experiment 2, we focused on action execution, requiring participants to estimate the timing of their actions under similar spatial conditions. By comparing these conditions, we aimed to determine whether spatial proximity objectively modulates the urgency to act and subjectively influences temporal awareness of action-associated events.</p><p>We predicted that proximity would lead to earlier action initiation and earlier perceived timing of decisions and actions, reflecting an enhanced state of readiness within PPS. We also explored whether spatial proximity affects temporal binding between actions (or decisions) and their consequences. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 26 participants (18 females, age = 25.38 ± 4.76 years old) for Experiment 1.</p><p>Participants were pre-screened by the TNO Stereo test <ref type="bibr">(Laméris Ootech,</ref><ref type="bibr">the Netherlands,</ref><ref type="bibr">19th edition)</ref> which is used to test participants' stereoscopic vision to ensure their perception of depth in VR. All participants were naive to the study's purpose and reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision, normal hearing, and no history of neurological disorders. They provided informed consent prior to participation and received compensation for their involvement. Procedures were approved by the ethics committee</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(CEEI/IRB Comité d'Evaluation Ethique de l'Inserm, n°21-772, IRB00003888, IORG0003254, FWA00005831</formula><p>) and adhered to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and apparatus</head><p>We adapted the Libet clock paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Haggard et al., 2002)</ref> to a VR setup to obtain stereoscopic vision of the clock at different distances. Participants sat comfortably and wore a head-mounted display (HMD, Oculus Rift CV1, resolution 2160 × 1200), engaging in the task within a virtual environment. The virtual environment featured a room with two long, high, squared walls spaced 1.84 m apart, providing depth perception cues, and a virtual clock face ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>) that participants were asked to fixate on. The clock face was marked with conventional "5-min" intervals.</p><p>The clock was presented randomly either at a distance close to (45 cm) or far from participants (3 m). The diameter of the near clock was 0.24 m, and the diameter of the far clock was 1.8 m, with both clocks having a visual angle of 29.86 degrees. Both clocks had a 'hand' in the form of a green dot, which rotated clockwise with a period of 2560ms per circle. To control for any size-dependent visual discrepancies, as done in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blini et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dureux et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">O'Connor et al., 2021)</ref>, the retinal size of the clock was adjusted. This adjustment is crucial for isolating the influence of spatial proximity under controlled experimental tasks. While retinal size can suggest proximity, it is not a reliable or exclusive indicator. Instead, binocular disparity -the difference in the images each retina receives -more accurately conveys information about an object's distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Howard, 2012)</ref>. Before formal testing, participants estimated the distances of the near and far clocks. The average estimations confirmed that perceived distances were consistent with our intended presentation: near clock (Mean = 0.70 m, SD = 0.54 m) and far clock (Mean = 2.67 m, SD = 1.22 m).</p><p>The key press was performed on a computer keyboard with the participant's right index finger at a time of their own choice. When applicable, the action consequence was an auditory tone (44.1K Hz, 30 ms duration) played through the HMD's built-in headphones. During the inter-trial interval, a fixation square was displayed at the centre of the upcoming virtual clock and at the middle distance between the near and far space. The virtual environment and tasks were programmed using Unity (Version 2018.4.22f1) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.  Experiment 1 included three tasks using the adapted Libet clock paradigm. Voluntary action only task: participants were asked to watch the clock hand rotation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. After the clock hand started rotating, they could press the 'zero' key on a computer keyboard when they felt the urge to press; in other words, at a time of their own choice. Notably, to assess potential variations in the natural buildup of urgency, participants were not instructed to wait until the clock rotation had completed at least one cycle, as was done in previous studies. Once they pressed the key, the clock kept on rotating for a random duration (1.5s to 2s) before disappearing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. Decision baseline task: building upon the Voluntary action only task, participants were additionally asked to verbally report at the end of the trial where the rotating hand was when they first became aware of their decision to press the button. The experimenter then input their reports with another computer keyboard. Decision operant task: similar to the Decision baseline, except that a tone followed the key press after a 250 ms delay, allowing us to study the effect of predictable auditory consequences on decision reporting <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. The order of the Voluntary action only and Decision baseline tasks was counterbalanced, while the Decision operant task was always performed last.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus and experimental design</head><p>Each trial began with a fixation square displayed for a random duration between 1 and 2 seconds, followed by the appearance and rotation of the virtual clock. Participants completed 30 trials for each task at both near and far distances, presented in random order. The clock's distance was entirely taskirrelevant. Participants underwent four practice trials before formal testing in each task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>To assess the effect of distance on action initiation, we calculated mean action initiation times for each task, defined as the elapsed time between the clock's rotation onset and the key press. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted with factors Distance (Near, Far) and Task (Voluntary action only, Decision baseline, Decision operant).</p><p>To evaluate the impact of distance on the subjective awareness of decision to act and the presence of temporal binding due to the tone, we calculated estimated decision times on the Decision baseline and Decision operant tasks. Reported clock positions were converted to milliseconds. The key press time was subtracted from the reported decision time; negative values indicated the decision was perceived before the actual action. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was performed on the estimated decision times with factors Distance (Near, Far) and Tone Presence (Baseline, Operant).</p><p>To examine distance effects on temporal binding, we calculated the binding effect by subtracting the estimated decision time in the Baseline task from that in the Operant task for each distance. Positive values indicated that participants perceived their decision as occurring later when followed by a tone, reflecting stronger temporal binding. A paired t-test compared temporal binding between Near and Far conditions.</p><p>Data analyses were performed using MATLAB (Version 2019b; MathWorks) and Python 3.0. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To facilitate comparison, we plotted action initiation times and subjective awareness results from both experiments in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 2, 3 and 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Urgency to act is driven by proximity only when subjective estimates are not required</head><p>The two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between Distance and Task (F(2,50) = 4.23, p = 0.02, partial η2 = 0.15, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>). Post-hoc analyses indicated that participants acted earlier in the Voluntary action only task when the clock was positioned in the near space compared to the far space (p = 0.01, partial η2 = 0.22). This effect was not observed in the two tasks requiring decision timing estimations (p &gt; 0.33). Neither the main effect of Distance (F(1,25) = 2.46, p = 0.13, partial η² = 0.09) nor the main effect of Task (F(2,50) = 1.14, p = 0.33, partial η² = 0.04) on action initiation times was significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective awareness of decision to act is modulated by proximity</head><p>The 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA on estimated decision times revealed a significant main effect of Distance (F(1,25) = 4.75, p = 0.039, partial η² = 0.16, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3A</ref>). Participants perceived their decision to act earlier relative to the actual action time when the clock was in near space. The main effect of Tone Presence was also significant (F(1,25) = 196.23, p &lt; 0.001, partial η² = 0.89), indicating a temporal binding between the perceived time of decision and the subsequent tone. The interaction between Distance and Tone Presence was not significant (F(1,25) = 0.25, p = 0.62, partial η² = 0.01).</p><p>A paired t-test showed no significant difference in temporal binding between Near and Far conditions (t (25) = 0.50, p = 0.62, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4A</ref>), suggesting that distance did not influence the temporal "decision" binding.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study investigated whether the spatial distance at which a Libet clock is displayed affects voluntary action initiation, the temporal awareness of action decision and execution, and the temporal bindings involved in these associated events. Our findings suggest that spatial proximity plays a significant role in several of these processes. Indeed, participants initiated their actions earlier when the Libet clock was within peripersonal space (PPS) compared to when it was outside PPS. Yet, this action anticipation was not observed when they were additionally required to estimate decision and action timings, suggesting that the urgency to act induced by spatial proximity is reduced by concurrent cognitive demands. Furthermore, when the clock was within PPS, participants perceived their action decisions and executions as occurring earlier. Finally, spatial proximity did not modulate either the decision or the action binding. By showing that spatial proximity objectively modulates action urgency and subjectively influences temporal awareness of actions, our findings reveal a critical role of PPS in voluntary decisionmaking and time awareness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proximity enhances the urgency to act</head><p>First, in Experiment 1, we found that the distance at which the Libet clock was displayed modulated the timing of action initiation when participants were not required to report anything.</p><p>Specifically, participants initiated key presses earlier when the clock was within PPS compared to when it was distant. This suggests that the mere presence of this visual stimulus within PPS heightens the urgency to act, considerably extending our knowledge about which environmental features can modify such action urgency. Indeed, previous research on animals and humans highlighted the important role played by rewards, showing that rewards placed in the near space increased impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morrison &amp; Nicola, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">O'Connor et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stevens et al., 2005)</ref>. Importantly, this study reveals that visual stimulus closeness per se, in the absence of reward, can increase the urgency to act. Recent neurophysiological studies suggest that the neural representations of space near the body are linked to motor planning regions, facilitating quicker action initiation for stimuli within PPS compared to farther ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Basile et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cléry et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Grivaz et al., 2017)</ref>. Such prioritization could explain why participants acted as if they felt an earlier urge to act when the clock was closer. The enhanced readiness to act in near space may be attributed to the integration of sensory inputs and motor outputs within fronto-parietal networks specialized for PPS processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Graziano &amp; Cooke, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Serino, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive demands modulate proximity effects</head><p>Interestingly, the proximity-driven increase of urgency was no longer observed when participants were required to additionally estimate the timing at which they either decided to act or executed their action. This may be explained by the additional cognitive demand imposed by the task of reporting actionassociated time estimates. Estimating the timing of one's own action-associated events requires attentional resources and an introspective focus on the temporal aspects of the action <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wenke &amp; Haggard, 2009</ref>). This cognitive demand could have overshadowed or mitigated the influence of spatial proximity on action initiation. When participants are engaged in self-monitoring and timing estimation, the urgency induced by spatial proximity might be less pronounced because their attention is divided between performing the action and monitoring its timing. We suggest that the effect of spatial proximity on action initiation is reduced by task demands and may be attenuated when cognitive processes are concurrently engaged. This aligns with theories suggesting that increased cognitive demands can impact attentional allocation and motor behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lavie, 2005)</ref>, indicating a dynamic interplay between spatial processing and cognitive resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial proximity modulates subjective temporal awareness</head><p>Second, we nevertheless found that action-associated time estimates were affected by proximity.</p><p>In the near clock condition, participants perceived action decision and execution times as occurring earlier compared to the far clock condition. This suggests that spatial proximity can either influence objective behavior (i.e., increase the urgency to act when no estimates are required) or modulate the subjective awareness of decision and action timings when these are at stake in the task. The close proximity of the clock seems to make participants believe that they decided to act and acted sooner compared to when the clock is farther away. This indicates that our perception of the timing of the action-associated events is closely tied to the distance of a time tracker. This effect can be understood within the broader context of how spatial proximity influences cognitive processing. Previous research has shown that objects within PPS are processed more rapidly than those outside of PPS <ref type="bibr">(Noel, Blanke &amp; Serino, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blini et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bufacchi &amp; Iannetti, 2018)</ref>. This enhanced processing is thought to arise from the brain's prioritization of information that is perceived as immediately relevant to the body's safety and interaction with the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Graziano &amp; Cooke, 2006)</ref>. Additionally, the earlier perception of action timing when the clock was near may be linked to mechanisms of predictive coding in the brain. Predictive coding theories propose that the brain continuously generates and updates predictions about incoming sensory information <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Friston, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>When an object is close to the body, the brain might anticipate the need for quick action, leading to a shift in the perceived timing of decisions and actions towards earlier times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal binding of decision and action</head><p>Third, introducing a consequence to the action-a tone-significantly impacted the perceived timing of the events associated with the action: a temporal binding effect was observed, where the perceived times of action execution shifted closer to the consequence side. Such results replicated the previously reported temporal binding between the perceived time of an action and its external consequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Haggard et al., 2002)</ref>, a well-known effect that has been attributed to causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Buehner &amp; Humphreys, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Buehner, 2015)</ref>, multisensory integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kirsch &amp; Kunde, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kirsch et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kong et al., 2023)</ref>, predictability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buehner, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gentsch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hughes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kirsch et al., 2019</ref>) and sense of agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Caspar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Haggard &amp; Chambon, 2012)</ref>, although the latter remains debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kirsch et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Buehner, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, here we show that a temporal binding effect exists also for the decision phase, with the perceived decision time also shifting towards the action and its consequence. This finding contrasts with an earlier study that did not observe such binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Haggard &amp; Cole, 2007)</ref>, but aligns with more recent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Banks &amp; Isham, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Matute et al., 2017)</ref>. Several methodological differences might explain this discrepancy. Noteworthy, in the studies showing a temporal decision binding (including the present one), participants were requested to report the "time of their decision", or "when they became aware of their decision to press", whereas in the study showing no such binding, participants were requested to report their "first awareness of being about to move", which may not correspond to the same cognitive process as the time of a decision or of an intention. Overall, neither the well-established temporal binding related to the action nor the newly reported one related to the decision was affected by the proximity of the Libet clock. This underlines that distance, rather than modulating a general effect, seems to selectively modulate certain aspects of voluntary action preparation, temporal awareness of decision and execution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proximity does not modulate temporal binding</head><p>Indeed, the temporal bindings of the decision and action were not modulated by the spatial proximity of the clock: the temporal shifts associated with the presence of the tone were consistently strong, regardless of whether the clock was inside or outside the PPS. This is due to spatial proximity modulating the temporal awareness of both the operant and the baseline tasks to a similar extent. These results also suggest that while the proximity of a neutral stimulus can influence the initiation and subjective timing of action-associated events, the temporal binding (both decision binding and action binding) remains robust against changes in the spatial context of the visual time marker. Notably, the tone, as the action consequence played via the VR headset, remained the same in all tasks; only the distance of the clock was manipulated, not the distance of the tone from the participant. This distinction allowed us to isolate the role of the Libet clock's distance as a neutral stimulus on voluntary action from the impact of the action's consequence (the tone).</p><p>While our findings indicate that the temporal binding of both action decision and execution was not affected by the clock's proximity, previous studies using temporal binding with the interval estimation procedure, focusing on the distance of action outcome, have shown that distance could affect temporal interval estimations. For example, some research indicates that the spatial distance of action outcomes can influence the perceived temporal interval between actions and their effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jenkins &amp; Obhi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mariano et al., 2024;</ref>. However, these studies have yielded different results, and there is still a lack of consistent evidence showing whether or not distance impacts the sense of agency (see <ref type="bibr">Kong, Vernet &amp; Farnè, 2024, under review)</ref>. Whether and how spatial proximity influences the sense of agency remains a debated topic. Ongoing studies in our lab are employing alternative measurements, beyond the temporal binding paradigm, to investigate whether PPS might influence the sense of agency in ways not captured by the current experimental design.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides timely evidence that distance can modulate the urgency to act and the temporal awareness of those actions, though not both at the same time. These findings broaden our understanding of the role played by proximity in fundamental aspects of human cognition, underscoring the influence of distance on voluntary decision-making and conscious awareness of events timeline. The results highlight the need for further exploration of how spatial context interacts with temporal and sensory processes to shape our experience of agency and control over our actions.</p></div>
