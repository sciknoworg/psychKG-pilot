<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goal Conflict When Making Decisions for Others</head><p>Some of life's most important and difficult decisions are made on behalf of others. For example, a parent may decide whether to send a child to public school or to private school, a physician may recommend palliative care and/or painful chemotherapy treatments, a psychiatrist may order a distressed patient to involuntary hospitalization or choose to continue outpatient treatment, and a health surrogate may decide whether a loved one should continue with lifesustaining treatments or institute a Do-Not Resuscitate Order. Such decisions are difficult because they involve tradeoffs with serious consequences. Emerging theoretical perspectives suggest that goal pursuit is carried out with assistance from other people: individuals help each other to pursue goals or pursue goals together <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Fishbach &amp; Tu, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fitzsimons, Finkel, &amp; Vandellen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Orehek, Forest, &amp; Barbaro, in press</ref>). However, little is known about how people negotiate goals in the context of making high stakes decisions for others.</p><p>Understanding how individuals negotiate conflicting goals in the context of making high stakes decisions on behalf of others is important to understand because decision making on behalf of others is prevalent and consequential. Individuals often make decisions on behalf of others, particularly when others lack the capacity to make decisions for themselves (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shah &amp; Raskinski, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shalowitz, Garrett-Mayer, &amp; Wendler, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vig et al., 2007)</ref>, or when they lack the expertise to make those decisions (as may be perceived by healthcare providers who make decisions on behalf of patients rather than engaging in shared decision making; <ref type="bibr">Degner &amp; Sloan, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gravel, &amp; Légaré, Graham, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Murray, Pollack, White, &amp; Lo, 2007)</ref>. Moreover, the person making the decision often experiences serious emotional repercussions as a result of the choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Azoulay et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vig, Starks, Taylor, Hopley, &amp; Edwards, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Wendler &amp; Rid, 2011)</ref>. Indeed, decision-making sometimes comes with a higher emotional cost when deciding for others than when deciding for the self <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Zikmund-Fisher, Sarr, Fagerlin, &amp; Ubel, 2006)</ref>, especially if the decision-maker is interdependent with the other person <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Polman &amp; Vohs, 2016)</ref>. The present research aimed to better understand the influence of goal conflict on high stakes decision making for others by investigating healthcare providers' decision to provide palliative care to patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goal Conflict</head><p>People have many goals, which often come into conflict with one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Neal, Ballard, &amp; Vancouver, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Orehek &amp; Vazeou-Nieuwenhuis, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Vancouver, Weinhardt, &amp; Schmidt, 2010)</ref>. Two or more goals come into conflict when a behavioral means to one goal deters or precludes achieving the other, or because inadequate resources exist to pursue both goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Emmons &amp; King, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kruglanski et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Orehek &amp; Vazeou-Nieuwenhuis, 2013)</ref>. At the individual decision-making level, such conflict can preclude successful pursuit of both goals, and may require a choice to pursue one goal at the expense of another <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achtziger, Gollwitzer, &amp; Sheeran, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Goschke &amp; Dreisbach, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Köpetz &amp; Orehek, 2015;</ref>. Although in some goal conflict situations, it is possible to identify means that can facilitate both goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chun, Kruglanski, Sleeth-Keppler, &amp; Friedman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kruglanski et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Orehek, Forest, &amp; Wingrove, in press)</ref>, such choices are often not readily available <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Köpetz, Faber, Fishbach, &amp; Kruglanski, 2011</ref>). Because of this, people often pursue the more valued goal, inhibiting the activation of conflicting goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achtziger et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gollwitzer, Heckhausen, &amp; Stellar, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fishbach &amp; Zhang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kruglanski et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Köpetz, Kruglanski, Chen, &amp; Orehek, 2008)</ref> or disengaging from pursuit of those goals <ref type="bibr">(Orehek, Bessarabova, Chen, &amp; Kruglanski, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Wrosch, Scheier, Miller, Schulz, &amp; Carver, 2003)</ref>. This is particularly likely when one goal is prioritized over the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chun et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Köpetz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Shah et al., 2002)</ref>, and can lead to motivated distortion of information in order to justify the chosen alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bélanger, Kruglanski, Chen, Orehek, Johnson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bélanger, Kruglanski, Chen, &amp; Orehek, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kruglanski &amp; Orehek, 2007)</ref>. Thus, unless a choice is readily available that satisfies both currently activated, important goals, a person facing a conflict between two goals inhibits the activation of the lower priority goal, behaviorally disengages from its pursuit, and justifies their choice in favor of the higher priority goal through motivated reasoning. Despite extensive research on negotiating and resolving goal conflict at the individual decision-making level, there is a dearth of evidence on how individuals resolve goal conflicteither their own, or their perception of goal conflict experienced by the individual for whom they are making the decision when making decisions on behalf of others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conflict between Curative and Palliative Care</head><p>The choice healthcare providers' face between providing curative and palliative care in healthcare settings is a prime example of goal conflict, with consequential implications for the health and well-being of others. Palliative care is treatment designed to manage pain and symptoms and provide psychosocial support in advanced illness or illness with high symptom burden, and can be administered even in conjunction with curative care <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(CAPC, 2015)</ref>. In part due to the shortage of palliative specialists <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dharmarajan, Wei, &amp; Vapiwala, 2015)</ref>, palliative care requires participation from providers at all levels, including not only physicians, but also nurses, nursing aids, medical support team members, pharmacists, and paramedics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahsberg &amp; Carlsson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barrett &amp; Connaire, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kent et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Morrison, Wallenstein, Natale, Senzel, &amp; Huang, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Wiese et al., 2009)</ref>. Palliative care decision making among healthcare providers is an ideal context in which to examine robustness of social psychological theory, because it involves high-stakes decisions made in a uniquely emotionally-laden environment, as well as decisions made on behalf of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ferrer, Padgett, &amp; Ellis, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The perceived conflict between curative and palliative care is an important real-world context to study goal conflict when making decisions on behalf of others for several reasons.</p><p>First, healthcare providers tend to assume that such goal conflict exists, and prioritize curative goals, which suggests that they may be less likely to provide palliative care and delay conversations about prognosis and palliative care options <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bakitas, Lyons, Hegel, &amp; Ahles, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">CAPC, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gawande, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kelley &amp; Morrison, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mollica et al., under review;</ref><ref type="bibr">Peppercorn et al., 2011)</ref>. Unfortunately, many providers erroneously believe that palliative care is appropriate only at end-of-life, and that patients may lose hope if it is provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Garrett et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schenker et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">CAPC, 2011)</ref>; thus, perceived conflict among curative and palliative goals may reflect conflict experienced by the provider, as well as perceived conflict projected onto the patient. Second, no research has experimentally investigated the effect of curativepalliative conflict on healthcare providers' decisions about whether to provide or refer patients to palliative care.</p><p>Finally, despite empirically supported benefits and expert recommendations, palliative care is underutilized in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cohen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ferrell &amp; Grant, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ferrell, Temel, Temin, &amp; Smith, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ferrell et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ferris et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gidwandi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Graham, 2014</ref>). For example, cancer patients often receive chemotherapy within days of death without accompanying palliative care <ref type="bibr">(Peppercorn et al., 2011)</ref>, and dementia patients often undergo intensive and ineffective medical interventions in the last months of life <ref type="bibr">(Mitchell et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Palliative care has been shown to reduce symptom burden, lessen depression and anxiety, and improve physical and functional well-being among patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bakitas et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">El-Jawahri, Greer, &amp; Temel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kavalieratos et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Temel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wright, Zhang, &amp; Ray, 2008)</ref> and their caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dionne-Odom et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">El-Jawahri et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wright et al., 2008)</ref>. Palliative care also reduces pursuit of aggressive treatment options that are unlikely to be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adelson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Temel et al., 2010)</ref>. Accordingly, although most adults in the U.S. have limited knowledge of palliative care, the majority would want it for themselves or family members once they read the definition (CAPC, 2011). Critically, contrary to the perception that palliative care conflicts with curative care, palliative care does not hasten death and may even extend life for patients with terminal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bakitas et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">El-Jawahri et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Temel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> although see <ref type="bibr">Kavalieratos et al., 2016)</ref>, and pain management strategies (including opioid analgesics) do not interfere with curative care or lead to drug abuse or mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Novak, Nemeth, &amp; Lawson, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the decision whether to provide palliative care is an ideal context in which to study how goal conflict is negotiated and resolved in high stakes decision-making on behalf of others.</p><p>Provision of palliative care involves serious consequences for the recipient of care: it can influence their pain, comfort, and longevity. The decision is commonly made by a variety of healthcare providers on behalf of patients. In addition, healthcare providers perceive a conflict between palliative care and curative care, even though the reality is that no such conflict exists.</p><p>Therefore, we can take advantage of this pre-existing decision domain in order to manipulate perceptions of goal conflict that have the potential to serve as useful interventions that could serve as ways to improve treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Making Decisions for Other People</head><p>The preceding sections reviewed evidence and theory in support of the notion that goal conflict influences individual decision-making when making choices for oneself. However, if such research is to be applied to cases in which people make important decisions for others, then it is important to consider the current understanding of how making decisions for other people may differ from making decisions for oneself. As stated, people often make decisions on behalf of others. Moreover, one person can set goals for another, and can engage in decisions and actions that help close others to achieve those goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fitzsimons et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fishbach &amp; Tu, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Orehek &amp; Forest, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The available research suggests that people making decisions for others focus more on potential gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Polman, 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">2012b)</ref>, are more indulgent <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Laran, 2010)</ref>, perceive fewer tradeoffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kray, 2000)</ref>, and engage in more pre-decisional motivated reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Polman, 2010)</ref>, than when making decisions for themselves. When making a decision for someone else, people make more creative <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Polman &amp; Emich, 2011)</ref> and idealistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Laran, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lu, Xie, &amp; Xu, 2013)</ref> choices than when making a decision for themselves. Thus, although preliminary, it seems that people making decisions for others may be less constrained than when making decisions for themselves. Consistent with this assertion, at least one study suggested that people were more likely to decide in favor of chemotherapy when making the decision for someone else (either from the role as parent or role as healthcare provider) than when deciding for oneself <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Zikmund-Fisher et al., 2006)</ref>. However, other research suggests that both surrogates and providers have difficulty predicting others' preferences, often project their preferences onto patients, and use their own values and preferences when making decisions for others (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ditto et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fagerlin, Ditto, Danks, &amp; Houts, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Norris et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">O'Donnell et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schneiderman et al., 1997)</ref>. As such, even with the potential for less constraint on decisions for others, it seems that one's own individual decision-making tendencies are a strong influence on decisions for others. Importantly, each of these studies stopped short of specifically investigating how goal conflict would influence decision making when deciding for others.</p><p>Based on this existing evidence, it seems that, if anything, people who are making decisions for others may be more likely to choose in favor of the higher priority goal when faced with goal conflict. By focusing on potential gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Polman, 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">b)</ref>, making more indulgent choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Laran, 2010)</ref>, being idealistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Laran, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lu et al., 2013)</ref>, and being creative <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Polman &amp; Emich, 2011)</ref>, it seems that when making decisions for other people are inhibiting constraints imposed by conflicting goals. In addition, they seem to engage in motivated distortion <ref type="bibr">(Polmam, 2010)</ref> in order to justify their actions by perceiving fewer tradeoffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kray, 2000)</ref> as they engage in such indulgent choices. Indeed, when faced with a chance to provide painful curative treatment (chemotherapy), people were more likely to adopt this option when they were making the decision for others than for themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Zikmund-Fisher et al., 2006)</ref>. This suggestion is further supported by research which has found that a choice that is in conflict with alternatives can be appealing because it is presumed to be especially instrumental in attaining the prioritized goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kruglanski, Chernikova, Babush, Dugas, &amp; Schumpe, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kruglanski et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Orehek, Mauro, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Kruglanski, &amp; van der Bles, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Zhang, Fishbach, &amp; Kruglanski, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we predicted that healthcare providers would find palliative care less important and would be less willing to provide it when they perceived curative and palliative care to be in conflict. The present research is the first to experimentally manipulate perceptions of goal conflict between curative and palliative care. Importantly, although healthcare providers often assume curative and palliative care are in conflict, patient outcomes suggest that curative and palliative care are best presented as complementary treatments. Thus, this is a decision domain in which deciding for others in the face of goal conflict has important real-world consequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Affirmation</head><p>In addition to a goal conflict manipulation, we also examined a brief social psychological induction with the potential to mitigate the consequences of goal conflict. Self-affirmation is a process by which individuals reflect on strengths or values <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Steele, 1988)</ref>, which attenuates psychological dissonance associated with holding conflicting beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aronson, Cohen, &amp; Nail, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Heine &amp; Lehman, 1997)</ref>. Self-affirmation can also mitigate reactions to identity threat by bolstering a more global sense of self-competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cohen, Garcia, Apfel, &amp; Master, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cohen, Garcia, Purdie-Vaughns, Apfel, &amp; Brzustoski, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hall, Zhao, &amp; Shafir, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Havranek et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Martens, Johns, Greenberg, &amp; Schimel, 2006)</ref>. Healthcare providers have reported that medical competence imbues a sense of identity, and that being confronted with a medical problem they cannot solve is a threat to this identity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gawande, 2014)</ref>. Medical identity may be threatened by palliative care goals, because palliation may be seen as giving up (CAPC, 2011), and providers are less likely to initiate palliative care discussions when curative options are still available <ref type="bibr">(Keating et al, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, providers report that they find it difficult to deliver bad news, including prognostic information and palliative options <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fallowfield &amp; Jenkins, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mitchell, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Another reason self-affirmation may be particularly promising for attenuating goal conflict and its consequences in the domain of palliative care decision making is that selfaffirmation can facilitate other-directed positive emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Armitage &amp; Rowe, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crocker, Niiya, &amp; Mischkowski, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Exline &amp; Zell, 2009)</ref>, which may increase empathy with patients, thereby making their quality of life more salient and important to providers. Providers' inability to fully empathize with patients has been implicated in failure to adequately provide or refer to palliative care <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ferrer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Loewenstein, 2005)</ref>. For example, physicians report that they themselves would not want to pursue aggressive curative measures with little chance for success <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Garrett et al., 2014)</ref>, but these preferences do not extend to their practices with patients. Closing this interpersonal hot-cold empathy gap could facilitate some perspective-taking and allow physicians to better calibrate preferences, shifting to palliative goals for care when necessary (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kim et al., 2004)</ref>. Thus, self-affirmation may increase the importance of palliative goals, regardless of whether they are in conflict with curative goals.</p><p>These two research streams seem to suggest that self-affirmation may reduce perceived curative-palliative goal conflict and increase importance of and willingness to administer palliative care. However, to the extent that self-affirmation interventions strengthen pre-existing values <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cohen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011)</ref>, and healthcare providers currently value curative care and under-utilize palliative care, then it may instead increase perceived curativepalliative goal conflict and may decrease willingness to administer palliative care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Research</head><p>In the present study, we examined the consequences of goal conflict and self-affirmation in a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. healthcare providers, who made treatment decisions on behalf of others. We examined a range of providers, given that palliative care requires participation from providers at all levels, including not only physicians, but also nurses, nursing aids, medical support team members, pharmacists, and paramedics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahsberg &amp; Carlsson, 2014</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barrett &amp; Connaire, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kent et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Morrison, Wallenstein, Natale, Senzel, &amp; Huang, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Wiese et al., 2009)</ref>. This underscores the need to understand malleable psychological factors that contribute to suboptimal palliative care provision/referral in a range of providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ferrer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Halpern, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Padgett &amp; Ferrer, 2015)</ref>. Providers were randomly assigned to self-affirm (vs. a neutral control condition), and to read a short message about the conflict (vs. complementarity) between curative and palliative goals for care. We then assessed importance of palliative care goals and willingness to provide palliative care in a specific scenario.</p><p>Due to prioritization of curative goals among healthcare providers, we predicted that goal conflict would lead providers to disengage from palliative goals, resulting in less willingness to provide or refer to palliative care (Hypothesis 1), consistent with evidence regarding how goal conflict influences choices among participants making decisions for themselves. We also predicted that self-affirmation would attenuate the consequences of goal conflict, increasing importance of palliative care goals and willingness to provide or refer to palliative care (Hypothesis 2). Finally, we predicted that goal conflict and self-affirmation would interact, such that self-affirmation would attenuate effects of goal conflict on importance and willingness (Hypothesis 3). The study methodology and hypotheses were pre-registered, and data are publicly available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>The study proposal was selected for fielding by Time-Sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences (TESS; tessexperiments.org), a National Science Foundation funded initiative through which project proposals are vetted through a peer-review process and selected for funding based on whether the project is deemed meritorious by reviewers and the TESS Principal Investigators.</p><p>Proposals (including hypotheses) are archived on the TESS website (in a process akin to preregistration), and data are made publicly available one year after a study is conducted (http://www.tessexperiments.org/previousstudies.html). The study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. All measures, manipulations, and participant exclusions relevant to the study are reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were a nationally representative U.S. sample of 502 healthcare providers recruited through a standing internet panel of non-institutionalized U.S. adults recruited using statistically valid sampling techniques, GfK Knowledge Panel (www.gfk.com). A priori power calculations determined that a sample size of 501 was yielded 95% power to detect differences in a 2 × 2 (goal conflict/ complementarity X self-affirmation/ no affirmation) factorial design, assuming a small-to-medium effect size. Sensitivity analyses indicated that a sample size of 502 can detect a small effect (&gt; f = 0.16). Because the study was facilitated by TESS, sample size was determined based on the length of the survey, where longer surveys enroll fewer participants (see http://www.tessexperiments.org/limits.html). The specific inclusion criteria further reduced the allowable sample size. Therefore, to maximize power, we limited the length of the survey to accommodate &gt; 501 participants. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> contains demographic characteristics of the sample, which were derived from variables collected and provided by GfK (rather than reported as part of participation in the study). Although the sample was relatively highly educated and female because of the occupation targeted in the sampling strategy (i.e., healthcare providers), the sample was racially and ethnically diverse. Moreover, study weights were generated to render the sample representative of U.S. healthcare providers (see Analysis section). Providers included were in one of four categories: medical doctors (n = 47; e.g., physicians, surgeons); other healthcare practitioners (n = 255; e.g., nurses, pharmacists); healthcare support (n = 116; e.g., nursing aids, nursing assistants); and technologists/technicians (n = 85; e.g., paramedics, lab technicians).</p><p>Because participants in the last occupational category may not necessarily interact with patients and thus may not have an opportunity to support referrals for palliative care, we conducted ancillary analyses excluding this occupational category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Materials</head><p>The experiment was presented as two ostensibly separate studies. First, in the "values study," providers were randomly assigned to a self-affirmation condition (choosing their most important value from a list and writing for ~8 minutes about why the value is important to them and how they uphold it in daily life; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">McQueen &amp; Klein, 2006)</ref> or a no-affirmation condition (writing about their daily routine; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burson, Crocker, &amp; Mischkowski, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Then, providers were transitioned to the "goals for care" study, in which they were randomly assigned to receive one of two messages about curative and palliative care. Both messages began by stating: "Palliative care is defined as an approach designed to treat pain, manage physical symptoms/treatment side effects, and provide psychosocial support that improves the quality of life of patients and their families. Participants then answered a questionnaire that included items assessing goal conflict, the interpersonal empathy gap, importance of palliative and curative goals, and willingness to provide or refer to palliative and curative care. The order of item presentation was randomized, such that half of the participants received the willingness item at the beginning of the survey, and half of the participants received this item at the end of the survey.</p><p>We developed items to assess curative and palliative goal conflict and goal complementarity, adapting a previously developed goal conflict matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Emmons &amp; King, 1988)</ref> and a pictorial item assessing overlap between the self and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aron &amp; Fraley, 1999)</ref>. Items were assigned to each scale using exploratory factor analysis. We initially conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with no rotation, extracting factors based on an eigenvalue of greater than 1 with no set number of factors, which returned two distinct factors. Following the recommendations of Fabringer and colleagues (1999), we then conducted a second EFA with an oblique rotation (promax), specifying two factors, which indicated a low correlation among the factors (r=-0.21, below the recommended 0.32 threshhold for oblique rotation). As such, the final EFA involved an orthogonal rotation (varimax) to maximize the factor loadings, and extracted factors based on eigenvalue &gt; 1 with no set number of factors. All factor analyses specified principle components extraction. We used a cut-off value of 0.40 for factor loadings (all primary loadings &gt; 0.42). One variable had a high cross-loading ("Palliative and curative care are in conflict with one another", primary loading = 0.65, cross-loading = -0.44), but because the primary loading was substantially higher than the cross-loading, it was assigned to the scale on which it had a higher loading (goal conflict). No other items had high cross loadings (all &gt; -0.08).</p><p>The Goal Conflict Scale (α = .73) comprised three items (1 strongly disagree -5 strongly agree): "Curative care is detrimental to palliative care;" "Palliative care is detrimental to curative care'" and "Palliative care and curative care are in conflict with one another." The Goal Complementarity Scale (α = .68) comprised five items. Two were on a scale from 1 very harmful to 5 very helpful: "Does being successful achieving palliative goals for a patient have a helpful, harmful, or no effect at all on achieving curative goals for a patient?" and "Does being successful achieving curative goals for a patient have a helpful, harmful, or no effect at all on achieving palliative goals for a patient?" The other two were on a scale from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree: "Curative care is helpful to palliative care" and "Palliative care is helpful to curative care." The fifth asked participants to select the image that best represents the relationship between curative and palliative care, presenting overlapping circles ranging from not overlapping to strongly overlapping. Because the latter item was on an 8-point scale, the goal complementarity items were standardized prior to score computation. Of note, the goal conflict and goal complementarity scales were only modestly correlated, r = -0.29, p &lt; .001, n = 502. Importance of palliative goals was assessed with one item: "Palliative care is a strong priority" (1 strongly disagree -7 strongly agree). Importance of curative care goals was assessed with one item: "Curative care is a strong priority" (1 strongly disagree -7 strongly agree).</p><p>Palliative care willingness was assessed with one item: "If a patient requested a palliative procedure or treatment instead of a curative treatment, I would be willing to fulfill that request (if possible) or support them in making the request of other medical personnel" (1 strongly disagree -7 strongly agree). Curative care willingness was also assessed with a single item: "If a patient requested a curative procedure or treatment that I did not believe would work, I would be willing to fulfill that request (if possible) or support them in making the request of other medical personnel" (1 strongly disagree -7 strongly agree). These items were designed to assess willingness to provide these types of care under specific circumstances, patterned after behavioral willingness items shown to be more predictive of behavior than intentions items <ref type="bibr">(Gibbons, Gerrard, Oulette, &amp; Burzette, 1998)</ref>. The items included palliative and curative care situations in which providers may have some reluctance to provide care, to avoid ceiling effects.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to have these items presented first or last in the outcome questionnaire, and they were counterbalanced.</p><p>Positive other-directed emotion was assessed with two items: "How much do you currently feel nurturing?" and "How much do you currently feel compassionate?" (1 not at all -7 extremely). Threat to medical identity was assessed with a single item: "I feel less competent when I am faced with a patient who has a medical problem that I cannot solve" (1 strongly disagree -7 strongly agree). Empathy gap was operationalized as the difference between two counterbalanced items: "The patients I see who are dealing with disease or illness feel it is important to seek:" and "If you were a patient dealing with disease or illness, you would feel it is important to seek:" (1 curative care -7 palliative care).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analytic Strategy</head><p>In three separate 2x2 analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) performed in SAS 9.3, we examined whether the goal conflict condition (goal conflict vs. goal complementarity) increased 1) perceived goal conflict, and 2) decreased importance of palliative goals and 3) willingness to provide or support requests for palliative care (and whether the self-affirmation condition decreased these, as well as whether there was an interaction). In two separate regression analyses, using indirect modeling procedures available to evaluate mediation in Mplus 5, we examined whether: 1) Goal conflict condition had a causal indirect path to importance of palliative goals, mediated by perceived goal conflict; and 2) Goal conflict condition had a causal indirect path to willingness to provide or support requests for palliative care, mediated by perceived goal conflict.</p><p>We also conducted additional analyses not included in our pre-registered hypothesis and analysis plan. First, because we initially anticipated that perceived goal conflict and perceived goal complementarity would load onto the same factor (with perceived complementarity reversecoded), we did not include hypotheses about perceived complementarity as a mediator. However, as two factors emerged from this scale, we conducted analyses that included both perceived conflict and perceived complementarity as mediators, evaluating indirect effects via each individually and total indirect effects. Second, in response to a reviewer comment, we also examined whether the goal conflict condition influenced providers' ratings of patient preferences for curative versus palliative care. We report analyses adjusted for age, gender, education (college vs. no college), race/ ethnicity (white vs. non-white), and occupation (physician vs. other healthcare provider), as well as unadjusted estimates. Order of the willingness item presentation did not influence responses, and was thus not included as a covariate. All analyses were weighted with post-stratification weights generated by GfK to attenuate biased statistical estimates that could be derived from the complex sampling design, in the context of the current experimental design (i.e., due to nonresponse and potential under-coverage within each experimental cell, as well as recruitment using different probability-based sampling methods as the panel composition changes over time) and render estimates nationally representative. Weights ensure that each experimental cell is representative of the population of interest (i.e., U.S. healthcare providers) and that analyses accurately reflect the demographic makeup of this population. Because Mplus will not calculate bias-corrected confidence intervals for weighted analyses, we used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate these paths <ref type="bibr">(Selig &amp; Preacher, 2008)</ref>, inputting weighted estimates of unstandardized paths and sampling variance, and specifying 95% confidence intervals and 20,000 repetitions.</p><p>We also conducted ancillary analyses, repeating analytic procedures described above but excluding healthcare technologists and technicians from the sample. These individuals were included in the study because they may have a role informing decision making due to emergent crises or worsening symptoms associated with advanced disease. However, we acknowledge that many individuals in this occupational category may not interact with patients, and as such it is important that the pattern and reliability of analyses are reproduced when these individuals are excluded.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This experimental study investigated the consequences of goal conflict when making decisions for others in a high-stakes decision-making context in which healthcare providers make decisions for patients (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ferrer et al., 2016)</ref>. Among a nationally representative sample of U.S.</p><p>healthcare providers, we found that a message presenting curative and palliative goals as in conflict (as opposed to as complementary to one another) increased perceived goal conflict and decreased goal complementarity, as well as decreased the importance of both curative and palliative goals for care. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the consequences of goal conflict among people making decisions on behalf of others, among experts, and in a highstakes decision making context, as well as the first to point to goal conflict as a malleable barrier to optimal palliative care uptake.</p><p>We predicted that providers would resolve goal conflict for a decision made on behalf of others following strategies used for resolving goal conflict for an individual choice. Specifically, because providers often value curative goals over palliative goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bakitas et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gawande, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mollica et al., 2018)</ref>, and project these preferences to their patients <ref type="bibr">(Fagerlin et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Norris et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">O'Donnell et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schneiderman et al., 1997)</ref>, we expected that goal conflict (vs. complementarity) condition would attenuate the importance of palliative, but not curative, goals, consistent with the tendency for individuals to resolve conflict by pursuing the prioritized goal and disengaging from the less prioritized goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achtziger et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gollwitzer et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fishbach &amp; Zhang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kruglanski et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Köpetz et al., 2008;</ref>. However, we found that goal conflict (vs. complementarity) condition reduced the importance of both types of goals. It is possible that the goal complementarity condition was driving this effect -that is, that providers' perceiving the two goals as complementary were able to value both concurrently. This explanation is consistent with research demonstrating individuals are better able to pursue concurrent goals when they can be pursued by a single means or when they are otherwise not conflicting <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chun, Kruglanski, Sleeth-Keppler, &amp; Friedman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kruglanski et al., 2013)</ref>. However, mediation analyses indicate that both perceived goal conflict and perceived goal complementarity mediate effects on goal importance. This suggests that goal complementarity may not fully explain these findings. It is possible that individuals disengage from both goals when facing goal conflict on behalf of others, or that providers were responding to the goal conflict message by prioritizing a third, unmeasured goal. Future research should examine these possibilities.</p><p>Conversely, effects of goal conflict (vs. complementarity) on willingness to provide or refer to palliative care and willingness to provide aggressive curative care were largely consistent with the notion that individuals resolve goal conflict when making decisions for others by disengaging from the less important goal. Although the goal conflict induction did not have a direct influence on willingness to provide palliative care, there was an indirect effect of condition on willingness, mediated by perceived goal conflict (but not perceived complementarity). The absence of a direct effect does not preclude mediation <ref type="bibr">(Hayes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002)</ref>, and indirect effects are often observed in absence of a detectable direct effect <ref type="bibr">(O'Rourke &amp; MacKinnon, 2015)</ref>. Indirect effects in absence of direct effects suggest either a direct effect too small to detect <ref type="bibr">(Kenny &amp; Judd, 2014)</ref>, given that a smaller n is necessary to detect an indirect effect compared to a direct effect, or can point to the presence of an unmeasured opposing force <ref type="bibr">(Hayes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002)</ref>. These possibilities cannot be examined in the available data, and should be addressed in future research; however, the presence of an indirect effect, even without a direct effect, points to an influence of goal conflict on palliative care willingness.</p><p>Conversely, the goal conflict induction did not influence willingness to provide curative care directly or indirectly. These two findings, taken together, are consistent with our hypotheses, but not with findings for goal importance. Future research should examine why goal importance did not translate neatly to willingness.</p><p>We found that the goal conflict condition did not influence providers' ratings of patients' prioritization of curative vs. palliative care. As such, although we do not have an analogous assessment of patients' goal importance, we can infer that the effect of the goal conflict induction is not influencing goal importance and behavioral willingness via changes to providers' understanding of patient goals. Rather, the goal conflict appears to be experienced and resolved based on the providers' goals, rather than the patients' goals. This finding is consistent with research on surrogate decision making suggesting that providers' behaviors are guided by their own values (and that they are often unable to accurately estimate their patients' values; e.g., <ref type="bibr">Carmel et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Downey et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Druley et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fagerlin, Ditto, Danks, &amp; Houts, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figueroa et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gramelspacher et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Norris et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">O'Donnell et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schneiderman et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, self-affirmation reduced willingness to provide or support requests for palliative care, contrary to expectations that it might have a beneficial effect because of its effects on reducing cognitive dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aronson et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Heine &amp; Lehman, 1997)</ref> increasing positive, other-directed affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Armitage &amp; Rowe, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crocker et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Exline &amp; Zell, 2009)</ref>, and attenuating threat to medical identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cohen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cohen &amp; Sherman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hall et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hravanek et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Martens et al., 2006)</ref>.

Our brief goal complementarity message facilitated positive attitudes towards palliative care, compared to the control condition, without decreasingin fact, increasingattitudes towards curative care. The efficacy of the message should be interpreted with caution, as the design was intended to uncover causal evidence for goal conflict's role in providers' palliative care importance and willingness, and thus did not include a true control condition. However, whether using this brief method or another method, social psychological interventions targeting goal conflict have the potential to improve palliative care uptake and quality of life outcomes. Indeed, conflict between curative and palliative goals may be particularly amenable to intervention, given evidence supporting the complementarity of these (i.e., trials showing that palliative care may extend life; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bakitas et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Temel et al., 2010)</ref>, and highlighting ways in which a single behavior can be used to achieve multiple goals can attenuate perceived goal conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chun et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Köpetz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kruglanski et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Orehek et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Orehek &amp; Vazeou-Nieuwenhuis, 2013</ref>).</p><p>However, our message was clear and straightforward, and it may be more difficult to facilitate perceptions of curative-palliative goal complementarity in complex real-world medical situations.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the use of single-item assessments of outcomes.

Nonetheless, single items are less reliable than scales and as such may have attenuated some of the associations observed in the study <ref type="bibr">(Luttrell, Petty, and Xu, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Findings related to the willingness itemwhich assessed willingness to provide palliative care instead of curative careare also limited by the sample, of whom some (unknown) proportion are less involved in treatment of patients with potentially terminal diagnoses and therefore answering this item hypothetically. This item was intentionally constructed to examine behavior under specific circumstances, as specific behavioral willingness items are more predictive of actual behavior than are vaguer intentions items <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gibbons, Gerrard, Ouelette, &amp; Burzette, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>However, importance of palliative care is relevant to the full sample regardless of their experience with terminal patients, given that palliative care is appropriate in medical care regardless of whether the patient has a terminal diagnosis. These limitations are offset by a number of strengths, including use of a large nationally representative sample of U.S. healthcare providers and use of an experimental design that allows for causal inferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to elucidate the dynamics of goal conflict among experts making decisions for others and for high-stakes decision making. This study also elucidates a malleable social psychological mechanism serving as a barrier to palliative care: goal conflict among healthcare providers. Because perceived goal conflict can be reduced or eliminated via low-burden interventions, this study points to a clear method to increase palliative care utilization, while concurrently increasing the importance of curative goals. Future studies should examine the dynamics of and consequences for goal conflict among other sets of experts, and for other high-stakes decision-making contexts. This study provides a model for leveraging ecologically valid, consequential health contexts for understanding the robustness of social psychological theory regarding goal conflict, as well as enriching health care by looking beyond disciplinary "silos" to better understand and solve clinical challenges.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open Practices</head><p>The study proposal was selected for fielding by Time-Sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences (TESS; tessexperiments.org). The proposal and all hypotheses were peer-reviewed, and the study was conducted based on this pre-registered protocol. The study proposal and all study data are available at http://www.tessexperiments.org/data/ferrer825.html. The proposal, methods section, and data labels are sufficient to allow a third-party researcher to replicate all reported results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>" The goal conflict message went on to read: However, barriers to integrating palliative care are many, and include important conflicts between integrating palliative and curative treatment, including medical training that prioritizes curative care no matter the cost, an incentive and payment structure weighted toward curative treatment, and a medical system that constrains time medical personnel with patients. The goal complementarity message went on to read: A growing number of medical organizations endorse the integration of palliative care into the entire care continuum of patients with advanced disease or significant symptom burden. Although there are barriers to optimal integration of palliative care, a mounting body of evidence shows that it can actually contribute to the benefits of curative care. For example, several recent studies have demonstrated that early palliative care can extend length of life among terminal cancer patients.</figDesc></figure>
