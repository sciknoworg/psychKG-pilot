			<abstract>
				<p>Vicarious learning refers to learning to make decisions on behalf of others. We asked if, in the context of value-based decision-making, there is any difference between learning strategies for oneself vs. for others. We implemented a 2-step reinforcement learning paradigm in which participants learned, in separate blocks, to make decisions for themselves or for a present other confederate who evaluated their performance. We replicated the canonical features of the model-based and model-free reinforcement learning in our results. The behaviour of the majority of participants was best explained by a mixture of the model-based and model-free control, while most participants relied more heavily on MB control, and this strategy enhanced their learning success. Regarding our key self-other hypothesis, we did not find any significant difference between the behavioural performances nor in the model-based parameters of learning when comparing self and other conditions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>There are times in everyone's life when the consequences of their choices are not limited to themselves. Depending on the situation, people voluntarily or involuntarily make decisions that influence others' advantage. Most of the time, decision-making and learning for self differ from what we do on behalf of others.</p><p>A wide range of previous studies have focused on the differences in decisions made for self and others. For example, vicarious decision-makers solve a problem more wisely <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, have more creative ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and seek out more information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Another line of research has shown that, in this process, individuals adjust their vicarious choices based on the most prominent feature of in-hand issues, whereas for themselves, they consider various features evenly, giving nearly equal weight to all of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Also people change their mind more often in vicarious decisions.</p><p>More frequent switching can increase the probability of post-decisional distortion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Making decisions for others, has been found to entail its own cognitive biases such as omission bias, pre-decisional distortion, confirmation bias, and lexicographic weighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, the consensus is that people often suffer fewer cognitive biases in vicarious decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. These findings suggest that decisions for others might be more rational than those made for oneself.</p><p>Another factor that complicates vicarious decision making is that often, the other person for whom the decision is being made is present. One of the primary forms of intrapersonal effects discussed in social psychology is "social facilitation," which means that the presence of others can enhance or impair an individual's performance <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. Investigating a set of studies, Zajonc has shown that the presence of others, either as observers or colleagues, could enhance participants' performance but would disrupt the process of learning new and complex issues <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. More recently, Kumano and colleagues demonstrated that, in a value-based decision-making context, when participants played on behalf of their partner, in the presence of the partner they took less reasonable risks, and were more affected by anticipated regret <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Being watched by others will lead to cardiovascular changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and stimulate social anxiety -a severe fear of negative evaluation by others -often causing people to avoid social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, which can explain the changes in behaviour and disruption of the learning process observed by the other studies listed above. Schwabe and Wolf showed that being imposed by stress, here, socially evaluated cold pressor (SECP), before and after learning, leads people to rely more on habitual (model-free) learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Based on Gilbert's social rank theory, fear of negative evaluation of others can increase the level of subordinating behaviour among those suffering from this type of social anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. As a result, under the pressure of social evaluation, people may apply more implicit and automatic responses representing a direct effect of social anxiety in the learning mechanism <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. As regards risk-taking, although there is a debate on this issue, <ref type="bibr">Polman and</ref> Wu have found that people make riskier decisions for others than themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> which can increase the stress in vicarious decision-making . Together, the available evidence suggests that the presence of the beneficiary may increase the cognitive burden of vicarious decision making.</p><p>Whereas vicarious decisions have been extensively studied, far less is known about vicarious learning. There are a number of recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> that have focused on the question of how we learn the preferences of others, in order to make decisions for them. It is important to clarify here that by vicarious learning we refer to learning on behalf of someone else, and not learning about someone else. In other words, our question here can be described as how do we learn when our decisions benefit someone else.</p><p>To answer this question, here we focus on an experimental paradigm from the family of two-system theories of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>. The overarching theme of these models of learning is that learning is governed by two systems. One is fast, automatic, rigid, and model-free, and the other is slow, deliberative, flexible, and model-based, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. These two systems are always in competition to control our actions <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. This is not to say that one of these systems is constantly dominant or brings us more benefits all the time. In fact, the benefit of having two different systems for control is to achieve behavioural goals by exploiting the system that best matches the moment-to-moment requirements of the environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>. A computational approach [29] has implemented this two-system model within the reinforcement learning paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>.</p><p>At the simplest level, an agent could learn from repeating the actions that previously led to the greatest reward. This would constitute model-free (MF) learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref>. A more sophisticated model-based (MB) strategy would be to estimate the future outcome of each action according to a learned transition structure of the environment (world model) and, as a result, chooses the action that promises highest reward within that world model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref>]. This flexible model-based strategy will be updated by environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref>. When the action supported by the MF and MB strategies are in conflict, the system whose prediction for outcome has a higher precision dominates the behaviour.</p><p>Searching through all the possible ways to learn the environment is costly and, in some cases, impossible <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30]</ref>. This means the MB strategy is flexible but slow and cognitively demanding. On the other hand, if the world is stable for long periods of time, the MF strategy is computationally optimised since prediction error would be progressively decreased. However, more trial and error would be needed in this strategy as the estimated values are not flexible <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref>. The MF strategy is cognitively cheap but slow in responding to environmental changes. In complicated situations, where more planning will be needed the model-based system is preferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>. For example, at the beginning of the learning process, individuals rely more on a model-based strategy to identify the environment. As time goes by, as they get more and more experience in the same environment, behaviour becomes more habitual or automatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>. Thus, learning behaviour is often best described by a mixture of MB and MF <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>.</p><p>MB decision-making costs mental effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref> but is likely to result in a more desirable outcome in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>. On the other hand, when under pressure to perform, people tend to decrease MB control and employ the low-demand MF alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref>. As children get older they learn the transition structure of the environment better and demonstrate more MB behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[40]</ref>. Similarly, under high cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[41]</ref> and acute stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref> people shift to MF control. Bringing these ideas together, here we ask whether the balance between MF and MB strategies changes when we are learning to make value based decisions for ourselves vs. on behalf of others i.e., vicarious learning.</p><p>To answer this question, we implemented a canonical example of the reinforcement learning paradigm configured to optimally assess MB and MF learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>. Participants undertook the task once for themselves and once for another person. To create a strong social context, under both conditions, the other person was also present in the experimental session and evaluated the participant's performance. If decisions for others were made more rationally with higher cognitive effort, we predict that learning for others should tip the balance in favour of the MB strategy. On the other hand, if deciding for others increased cognitive load and induced social stress, then one we expect learning to favour MF strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods Participants</head><p>Seventy-six healthy individuals (34 female) with different levels of education participated in this study between December 2020 and September 2021. They were recruited through local advertising in the campus area. Participants were randomly assigned to a pair (19 pairs: female-male, pairs: female-female, and pairs: male-male) and scheduled to attend the same test session. Members of each pair did not know each other. To determine sample size, we decided based on previous studies with a total sample of 38 players. Of all tested participants, we excluded two people because they missed more than 20 percent of the trials.</p><p>Other exclusion criteria were checked, but we did not see these issues among participants. For example, those participants who took the same action (e.g., </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus and setup</head><p>All experiments were conducted in a 10 m 2 conference room at the University of Tehran, College of Engineering. Participants sat at a table next to each other about 1 metre apart. There was a 17-inch laptop in front of one participant (i.e., the player) to which the other participant (i.e., the observer) had a clear view. The players completed a two-step task designed by Kool, Cushman, &amp; Gershman, 2016, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>. This paradigm allowed us to distinguish the MB and MF behaviour among subjects. Based on our pilot results, all task parameters matched the original design except the response time, which we decreased from 200ms to 100ms. We designed the task in MATLAB using Psychtoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Upon arrival, the participants were greeted by the experimenter who gave them a brief explanation about the procedure and assigned the participants' roles in the experiment by an ostentatious coin toss. One participant was assigned to the role of the player and the other to that of the observer.</p><p>The experimenter then described the task instruction for both individuals.</p><p>The experiment consisted of two rounds. In one round, the player did the task for themselves, meaning whatever bonus the player managed to collect would be paid to them. While the player was engaged in the task, the observer's task was to follow the player's performance carefully without talking to them. The observer filled in a paper-based questionnaire to evaluate the player's performance. These evaluations were not included in the data analysis. Instead, they served to reinforce the evaluative role of the audience and raise the stakes for the player. The experimenter was present in the room throughout the experiment.</p><p>The experimenter then described the gamified structure of a learning task for both of the player and the observer with this story: "You will play a game of intergalactic trade with aliens that live on other planets. In each trial, you load your goods on a spaceship and send it to some target planet. In each trial, there are two spaceships you can choose from. The chosen spaceship will then travel to one of two planets. Your profit or loss will depend on the value of your goods on the destination planet. At any given point, your goods are more valuable on one of the two planets. Your job is to figure out which spaceship would take your goods to the more profitable planet. The more profit you make, the higher your bonus. Note that this profitability changes across time and you will have to switch from one planet to another every once in a while."</p><p>The experiment began after the examiner ensured that the participant had understood the task instruction adequately, starting with 25 practice trials to become familiar with the experiment. After practice, in half of the groups, the player did 126 trials in 3 blocks for themselves first and then another 126 trials for the observer. Other half of the groups the player started by playing on behalf of the observer. At the start of each block, the experimenter reminded the participant whether they were playing for themselves or the observer. At the end of blocks, participants took a short break. After each condition, they took a 10minute break. There was a fixed compensation for each participant. In addition, the player received a variable compensation based on the sum of points that the player earned under the "self" condition. The observer receiving a variable compensation determined the points that the player had earned for them in the "other" condition. If a given participant's bonus was negative, it was set zero, and the participant received the fixed compensation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The task design closely followed an earlier work (Kool et al). Each trial consisted of two stages. In the first stage, the participant was given two spaceships to choose from. In the second stage, the chosen spaceship travelled to its destination and the corresponding profit or loss was revealed. All in all, there were two pairs of spaceships (A-B and C-D) and two planets (red and purple) in the experiment.</p><p>Note that A was always paired with B and C always with D. Spaceships A and C both went to the red planet. B and D went to the purple planet. The spatial position (left or right) of the spaceships on the screen were randomly assigned across trials. By pressing the F or J buttons on the keyboard the participant could select the left or right option, respectively. Response time window was 1000ms.</p><p>Otherwise, the trial was missed. After selecting their spaceship, the participant pressed the spacebar to proceed to the second stage and get the profit or loss which was a number between -4 to +5. Thus, each trial had a definite correct choice: the spaceship that returned the higher payoff <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig 1)</ref>.</p><p>For each participant, a new set of payoffs was generated. We used a random walk with a Gaussian distribution (µ=0, σ=0.2) in a range of 0 to 1. A set of probabilistic numbers determined the outcome of planets. Based on the mean of previous outcomes (µ), a random number was added or subtracted from the generated reward. Sigma shows the variance of changes in each trial. To be more sensible, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kool et al (2016)</ref>, the outcomes were displayed as integers between -4 to +5. The spaceships, rules of transition, and reward generation systems were the same in all conditions of the task (playing for self, for the other, and in the practice phase), but the colour of the planets was different.</p><p>It should be noted that, before implementing the main experiment, we ran three pilots with a total of 22 participants to ensure that we could replicate the original findings (Kools et al, 2016) that would allow us to differentiate between model-based and model-free behaviour. The results of the pilots guided us in two ways: firstly, we changed the number of trials slightly from the original analysis to fit our design. Secondly, we observed in our pilots that behaviour was dominated by the MB system. To achieve a more balanced combination of MB and MF systems, we reduced the response time from 2000ms to 1000ms to add some urgency <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref>. We ran the main experiment when the pilots' results confirmed that this paradigm worked well. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Modelling</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To see if our experiment worked properly, we compared the predicted behaviour from Kool's task, as a reference, with our results. As Kool and colleagues had shown in the novel paradigm, participants tended to rely more on model-based than model-free strategy, we saw a similar pattern. While some participants showed a combination of these two strategies, a great number of them had a pure MB behaviour. Regardless of the condition (the player did the task for themselves or did on behalf of the observer), the results showed the mean of stay probability was almost as much as our reference ones (~ 0.8 . In other words, for both the same and different stimuli, the stay probability significantly increased when the previous outcome was rewarding compared to when it was punishing. All of these results confirmed that the basis of our task worked correctly.</p><p>Additionally, there was no significant difference in behavioural performance between self and other conditions. Although stay probability in other conditions for both outcome valence (reward or punishment) was slightly higher than that in self rounds; this difference was insignificant, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig 2A)</ref>. We also evaluated the difference between some behavioural parameters in self and other conditions. For example, we assessed the measures such as accuracy (the number of correct choices), response time, and relative performance (sum of points a subject gained, divided by maximum attainable reward). Based on the two-tailed paired t-test results, there was no significant difference in these measures between self and other conditions. The horizontal axis shows whether the current state started is the same or different compared to the previous start state; the vertical axis shows the probability of repeating the choice, which leads to the same outcome as the previous stage. (B) The model-based and model-free index in self and other conditions based on the multilevel logistic regression analysis. The model-based control was the dominant behaviour among participants, while there was not a significant difference between these strategies in self and other conditions. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 2B</ref> shows, the MB control was the dominant strategy in both conditions (self and other), but there was no significant difference between subjects' MB index in playing on self and other rounds. It was true that there was a slight difference in MF control between self and other conditions, but we ignored this difference since this strategy was less dominant among participants.</p><p>In addition we looked at the relationship between the MB and MF indexes and participants' performance. Following Kool's paper as a guideline <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>, we expected participants' performance to improve when they applied a more MB approach. Pearson correlation results showed that both MB and MF strategies affected one's performance in an opposite direction. The more MB control a person implemented, the higher performance she or he would reach. Following MB strategy was significantly caused participants choose more correct answers, (Pearson correlation = 0.63, p = 001, 95%CI = [0.46, 0.75]), <ref type="figure">(Fig 3A)</ref>, on the other hand, under MF control participants' performance decreased significantly,</p><p>(Pearson correlation = -0.29, p = 013, 95%CI = [-0.49, -0.06]), <ref type="figure">(Fig 3B)</ref>. This was another sanity check which approved that we have correctly conducted our experiment.</p><p>One of the interesting points was that MB control more affected the performance in self conditions than in other conditions <ref type="figure">(Fig 3C)</ref>, but since this was not related to our question, it can be addressed in the future studies (F (3, 68) =</p><p>14.49, p = 0.0001).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BFNE-II questionnaire</head><p>Our participants played the game while their performance was being observed and evaluated by their teammate who had the observer role; therefore, we asked all players to fill the Bfne-II questionnaire (a brief fear of negative evaluation questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45]</ref>) on an online platform. The Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between the Mb and MF control, w parameter and social anxiety score in this study.

Although the w parameter was higher when participants played for the observer compared to doing it for themselves, this difference was not significant. however, did not affect the participants' learning strategy remarkably. We report this negative result to avoid the "file drawer" bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In one exploratory analysis, we found that the positive effect of MB control on performance accuracy in learning for self was stronger than that in learning for others. The complete crossover pattern of interaction observed in the data ( <ref type="figure">Fig   3C)</ref> is in line with the lack of a difference in average MB index and average performance. However, it is not entirely clear to us why this interindividual relationship between learning strategy and performance accuracy should break down while deciding for others. Future computational studies that examine the role of context (such as deciding for self or other) on control mechanisms in learning could address this problem.</p><p>Our results did not show any significant difference between learning strategies when learning on behalf of self vs. others. There could be a number of reasons for these negative results. We had made a design choice to keep the partner present in the testing room hoping to exaggerate the impact of our social manipulation. We had predicted that decision making for others (vs. self) is more likely to follow the MB strategy and the presence of the partner will strengthen this tendency by heightening the participant's level arousal and attention. If, however, the impact of deciding for others were to decrease the MB learning and the presence of the partner to enhance performance, then it could be imagined that the presence of the partner might counteract and cancel this effect of making decisions for others.</p><p>A key factor in our hypothesis for a difference between deciding for self and others was that previous studies had indicated that when the task at hand requires high cognitive load, then participants do better when deciding for others.</p><p>To ensure that our task's required cognitive load was adequately high, we</p><p>performed several pilots and implemented the task with a limited time-window for response to increase the pressure on the participant for performing well. Our behavioural results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig 2 and 3)</ref> confirmed that our participants' were adequately far from perfect to rule out ceiling performance. The nature of our negative findings, however, leave the possibility open that manipulation of effort may not have been adequately effective. Finally, our participants did not know each other and members of each pair were recruited independently from one another. A previous report that demonstrated different levels of anticipated regret and risk taking when making decisions for others <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> recruited pairs who were familiar with one another. We hope that our study and the report of the negative findings helps future researchers who are interested in similar questions regarding vicarious learning and decision making.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>pressed the left button) throughout the experiment or the ones who, in debriefing, said that they did not understand the task structure.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>A</head><label></label><figDesc>reinforcement learning model was fitted to each participant's data to estimate the weighting parameter w (the relative contribution between modelbased and model-free control). Each participant's weighting parameter in the new paradigm was calculated according to the original reinforcement learning model, but the transition structure was estimated differently. A pure model-free agent is not affected by the reward obtained from one pair of spaceships when choosing between the different pairs on the subsequent trial. Therefore, as in prior studies, the SARSA(λ) temporal difference learning algorithm defines MF learning. As mentioned, since the transition structure is deterministic in the novel paradigm, there were some differences in the learning transition structure for a MB agent compared to the original paradigm. The second stage outcome influences the following choice of a pure MB agent, regardless of whether the first stage begins with the same pair of spaceships or the other pair. Model-based learning was calculated within Bellman's equation using the softmax decision rule. It defines the transition structure P in which the probability of action 'a' on trial 't' in the state 'i' is defined as below: Here the inverse temperature β indicates the randomness of choice. The "stickiness" parameter π measures the extent to which participants persisted (π&gt;0) or switched (π&lt;0) their choice at the first stage. The variable rep(ꭤ) is set to 1 if the chosen option at the first stage (ꭤ) is the same as the previous trial; otherwise, it is set to zero. "Response stickiness" parameter ρ measures the extent to which participants repeated (ρ &gt;0) or changed (ρ &lt;0) the key that they had pressed at the first stage compared to the previous first-stage trial. The variable resp(ꭤ) is set to 1 if the selected key at the first stage (ꭤ) is the same as the selected key on the previous trial; otherwise, it is set to zero. Following the reference work (Kool et al), maximum 'a posteriori' estimation with empirical priors was used. We also set our model's free parameter based on our reference: inverse temperature, β ~ Gamma (4.82, 0.88), and stickiness parameters, π, ρ ~ N (0.15, 1.42), and flat priors for all other parameters.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head>Following</head><label></label><figDesc>Kool et al. study (2016), a multilevel logistic regression was fitted to the data. All coefficients were modelled as random effects to estimate individual differences in choice behaviour for both self and other conditions. Then the results for the two conditions were compared to each other. In this model, the dependent variable was whether an individual repeated or changed the current choice compared to their previous choice (stay probability). Predictors for each trial were the amount of points gained on the previous trial (rewardi -1) andwhether the current trial started with an identical (samei = 1) or different (differenti = 0) pair of spaceships compared to the previous trial. A third predictor was the difference between the outcome of chosen and unchosen options in the previous trial (differencei-1). Regardless of the stimulus (same or different), gaining a reward is the most important measure for a MB agent. In this model, the main effect of the reward in the previous trial (rewardi -1) would indicate MB choice behaviour. On the other hand, a different stimulus will not affect a MF agent.Therefore, the participant would not necessarily choose the correct option when facing a different pair of spaceships. As a result MF control is represented by the interaction of the previous reward and the regressor for same transition (rewardi -1 * samei )</figDesc></figure>

We reconstructed a standard reinforcement learning paradigm designed to tease out the contribution of the model-based and model-free controllers (REF). Our data replicated the key hallmarks of previous findings. Critically, we observed that a larger proportion of our participants employed the MB strategy successfully. Moreover, the greater degree of MB control, the higher the participants' accuracy in learning. These findings lend support to the validity of our paradigm and permitted us to proceed to testing our main hypothesis.Overall, we did not see any difference between participants' behavioural data (such as accuracy, response time, and performance) and their learning strategy for themselves vs. others. Participants made value-based decisions, in some blocks for themselves and in other blocks for their teammate who was present in the testing room and sitting next to them watching over them and conspicuously evaluating the participant's performance.
