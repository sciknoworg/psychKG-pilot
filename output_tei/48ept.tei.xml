			<abstract>
				<p>Contemporary models of categorization typically tend to sidestep the problem of how information is initially encoded during decision-making. Instead, a focus of this work has been to investigate how, through selective attention, stimulus representations are contorted such that behaviourally-relevant dimensions are accentuated (or &quot;stretched&quot;), and representations of irrelevant dimensions are ignored (or &quot;compressed&quot;). In high-dimensional real-world environments, it is computationally infeasible to sample all available information, and human decision-makers selectively sample information from sources expected to provide relevant information. To address these and other shortcomings, we develop an active sampling model, Sampling Emergent Attention (SEA), which sequentially and strategically samples information sources until the expected cost of information exceeds the expected benefit. The model specifies the interplay of two components, one involved in determining the expected utility of different information sources and the other in representing knowledge and beliefs about the environment. These two components interact such that knowledge of the world guides information sampling, and what is sampled updates knowledge. Like human decision-makers, the model displays strategic sampling behaviour, such as terminating information search when sufficient information has been sampled and adaptively adjusting the search path in response to previously sampled information. The model also shows human-like failure modes. For example, when information exploitation is prioritized over exploration, the bidirectional influences between information-sampling and learning can lead to the development of beliefs that systematically differ from reality.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>At its heart, category learning involves extracting key patterns that capture the essence of our experiences, and allow us to make accurate inferences about the external world. Two fundamental challenges for psychological research are to understand how this knowledge is acquired, and once acquired, how it can be flexibly used to guide successful interactions with the external world. Although successful categorization models differ in how categories are represented in memory (e.g., as flexible clusters, exemplars, or prototypes; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Love, Medin, &amp; Gureckis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Nosofsky, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Smith &amp; Minda, 1998)</ref>, they tend to sidestep the question of how sensory information is encoded, but assume that the representations considered during deliberation are available to the decision-maker, and can be modulated by selective attention based on their behavioural relevance <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>.A).</p><p>Attention plays a key role in allowing these models to capture the flexibility by which humans are able to organize stimuli into categories .</p><p>These attentional weights provide key information about how different sources of information are organized during decision-making.</p><p>Leading contemporary categorization models, therefore, tend to treat category decisions as "single-step" decision problems; in which agents make decisions about the final choice, but not about what information to sample. While it is plausible that decision-makers encode all relevant stimulus information from the low-dimensional stimuli typically considered in the laboratory, 1 in high-dimensional environments, encoding all available sensory information is inefficient, and can impair learning. This reflects a fundamental computational constraint (known as the curse of dimensionality), which affects both machine-learning algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hastie, Tibshirani, &amp; Friedman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Li et al., 2017</ref>) and human decision-makers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bulgarella &amp; Archer, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Edgell et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Pishkin, Bourne, &amp; Fishkin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Vong et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>To be able to interact efficiently in high-dimensional environments, humans actively-sample information from sources expected to provide behaviourally relevant information (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cook, Goodman, &amp; Schulz, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Markant &amp; Gureckis, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Markant, Settles, &amp; Gureckis, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nelson &amp; Cottrell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Yang, Lengyel, &amp; Wolpert, 2016)</ref>. This is apparent, not only for decisions involving the collection of discrete samples of information across extended periods of time, 2 but are reflected in subtle patterns of eye-movements during decisions of relatively short duration (i.e., less than~3 sec.; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blair, Watson, Walshe, &amp; Maj, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rehder &amp; Hoffman, 2005a)</ref>. This partially reflects fundamental constraints of extrafoveal visual acuity, which drive decision-makers to integrate sensory information through a series of saccades to different locations. As expectations about ones environment can change based on the values of incoming sensory information, approaches that treat categorization decisions as single-step problems tend to ignore attentional effects that can occur within individual trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blair et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gottlieb, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gottlieb &amp; Oudeyer, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Through experience, decision-makers learn to selectively-attend to behaviourally-relevant stimulus features <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Shepard et al., 1961)</ref>. When observations are drawn randomly (as in typical laboratory experiments), participants tend to gain equivalent experience with all possible stimulus configurations. When participants are free to select the stimuli from which they learn, however, they tend to selectively sample information to test specific hypotheses (this is known as hypothesis-dependent learning bias; <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Markant &amp; Gureckis, 2014)</ref>. This can facilitate learning when the generated-hypotheses closely resemble the true structure of the environment, but can otherwise impair learning.</p><p>Humans often show a bias for testing simple hypotheses, for example, and this can impede learning (and/or lead to the development of inaccurate beliefs) when the true structure of the world is complicated.</p><p>Here, we develop a computational model, Sampling Emergent Attention (SEA), designed to reflect this effect. The model actively selects information as a function of its goals and its current beliefs, and learns to selectively sample information sources expected to provide behaviourally-relevant information. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Leading contemporary models of categorization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kruschke, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Love et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Nosofsky, 1986)</ref>, in contrast, tend to sidestep the question of how information is initially sampled. Rather than investigating how decision-makers choose what information sources should be sampled, these models emphasize questions related to how stimulus information is organized. A particular focus of these models is to understand how, through selective attention, stimulus representations are contorted such that representations of behaviourally-relevant stimulus dimensions are accentuated (or "stretched"), and representations of irrelevant dimensions are ignored (or "compressed"). We therefore describe these models as treating categorization decisions as single-step decision problems <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>.A), as decisions are made about the final choice, but sequential intra-trial active sampling behaviour <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>.B) is not considered.</p><p>SEA consists of two interacting components; each of which can be considered normatively optimal in its own right. The first component reflects the decision maker's beliefs and expectations about the environment, the second estimates the value of different information states. Interactions between the two components allow the model to select samples that maximize expected utility. Whereas contemporary categorization models often include attentional parameters that contort stimulus representations along <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Throughout the paper, we use the terms "information sources", "features", and "dimensions" interchangeably. "Information source" has a more general connotation than stimulus "dimension" or "feature," which are terms commonly used in the categorization literature. "Dimension" tends to emphasizes a geometric connotation, while "feature" does not. Although we focus on binary-valued features, the approach can also be applied to other representational formats supporting the expression of uncertainty as probability.</p><p>perceptually-separable stimulus dimensions <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>.A; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Garner, 1976</ref>), the proposed model re-conceptualizes attention as the gain in utility from sampling particular information sources. Despite this fundamental difference, SEA predicts classic behavioural effects associated with selective attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Nosofsky, Gluck, Palmeri, McKinley, &amp; Glauthier, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Shepard et al., 1961)</ref>. Its active sampling behaviour additionally closely resembles patterns of human eye movements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blair et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rehder &amp; Hoffman, 2005a</ref>). 5 Finally, like human learners, SEA can also develop inaccurate beliefs about the world when it fails to balance demands for exploration and exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Rich &amp; Gureckis, 2018</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> . Two Views of Attention. A) Contemporary categorization models tend to sidestep questions related to how decision-makers sample information from the world. Instead, their emphasis is on how multidimensional stimulus representations are are contorted by selective attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kruschke, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Love et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Nosofsky, 1986)</ref>. In the example on the left, three stimulus dimensions (Size, Color and Shape) are equally attended. On the right, "Size" is given greater attentional weight than "Shape" or "Color". B) Active sampling requires decisions, not only about the appropriate final choice, but also about what samples should be selected. In the category structure depicted at left <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blair et al., 2009)</ref>, the optimal sampling strategy is to first sample dimension 1, and then, depending on its value, sample either D2 or D3 (grey rectangles denote informative samples). This temporally-ordered sequence is illustrated at right. It is never necessary to sample all three dimension if D1 is sampled first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimal Experiment Design and Human Information Sampling</head><p>Several groups have used the principles of optimal experimental design (OED; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fedorov, 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fedorov, , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">MacKay, 1992)</ref> to investigate whether humans strategically sample information to test specific hypotheses. For cognitively-limited human decision-makers, the calculations underlying OED can be computationally-prohibitive. However, these studies indicate that, despite being susceptible to perceptual <ref type="bibr">(Itti, Koch, &amp; Niebur, n.d.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Yamada &amp; Cottrell, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Zhang, Tong, Marks, Shan, &amp; Cottrell, 2008)</ref> and decisional <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Klayman, 1995</ref>) biases, we are often able to select information samples that resolve uncertainty about specific hypotheses. This effect is apparent both during the performance of traditional categorization tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Markant &amp; Gureckis, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Markant et al., 2015)</ref>, and during naturalistic behaviour. Preschool children, for instance, spontaneously conduct experiments to test specific causal hypotheses about the objects they are playing with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cook et al., 2011)</ref>. Hypothesis-dependent sampling strategies have also been identified through study of human eye-movements. During categorization, for instance, we tend to selectively fixate on stimulus locations that resolve uncertainty about the potential category label <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nelson &amp; Cottrell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Yang et al., 2016)</ref>. During visual search, we similarly tend to fixate on locations expected to maximize information about the target location <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Najemnik &amp; Geisler, 2005</ref>).</p><p>To select useful information sources to sample, a decision maker must be able to simulate future events. This capacity for preposterior analysis, 6 involves predicting the probability and utility of future states. When diagnosing a patient, for instance, doctors must have sufficient knowledge of human pathology to identify plausible diagnoses. They must also be able to use this knowledge to select medical tests that efficiently differentiate between the most probable diagnoses. To reflect that some some results can be more informative than others, 7 full preposterior analysis aggregates information about both the probability and usefulness of each expected result. In practice, this forward-search process can be computationally prohibitive for large problems, necessitating an approximation to the full preposterior search performed by SEA. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> . Bidirectional Influences of Information Sampling and Learning. In this example, a decision-maker has learned to categorize stimuli, which vary according to three dimensions (one that is highly informative, one that is moderately informative, and one that is irrelevant), into two categories (denoted by blue crosses and red circles) by actively sampling information from the external world (110 stimuli, randomly-drawn from this imaginary world, are illustrated at the right). Their knowledge of the world (depicted as two probability distributions at left), reflects the samples that have been observed. In this example, the decision-maker has learned that the highly-important dimension predicts the category label, but has not learned that the moderately-important dimension mediates this relationship. As a result, this learner would be unable to classify all stimuli accurately. Characteristics of the external world (e.g., costs associated with sampling each dimension, or costs associated with incorrect choices), as well as characteristics of the learner (e.g., some learners might show a stronger bias for simple hypotheses) influence what is ultimately learned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is a Useful Question?</head><p>A number of different sampling norms have been used to define the usefulness of sampling a particular dimension (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Nelson, 2005)</ref>. Disinterested sampling norms seek to maximize decision accuracy. One way to define the usefulness of a particular medical test, for instance, would be the degree to which it is expected to improve the probability of making a correct diagnosis. 8 In contrast, situation-specific sampling norms maximize reward rather than accuracy, and may be preferable when payoffs are asymmetric (i.e., when the maximization of accuracy differs from the maximization of reward; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Meder &amp; Nelson, 2012)</ref>. For example, incorrectly diagnosing a malignant tumor as benign can be more costly than incorrectly diagnosing a benign tumor as malignant.</p><p>Utility-sensitive decision-makers should also consider the costs associated with sampling each information source. Invasive medical tests (e.g., a biopsy), for example, can be more informative than non-invasive tests (e.g., an X-ray). As a result, doctors must determine whether the benefits of a particular test are outweighed by its cost. A purely exploitative decision-maker should stop deliberating and commit to a choice when the gain in value from a particular test is outweighed by its cost. An exploratory decision-maker, however, might be willing to tolerate a small cost in order to learn about the environment.</p><p>Agents must, therefore, carefully balance demands for exploration and exploitation when learning about a domain, or risk developing inaccurate beliefs (as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>Although medical decisions are often extended in time, we face the same challenges when making rapid decisions (i.e., deciding what information should be sampled), even about which eye movements to make, as evaluated in category learning experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Termination &amp; Branching</head><p>As its beliefs are updated after observing each sample, SEA can display branching and self-termination. Branching involves changes in sampling strategy based on the values of the incoming information. Self-termination occurs when decision-makers decide to commit to a choice, rather than selecting additional samples.</p><p>Such decisions about when to commit to a choice are a fundamental component of many temporally-extended decisions <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>.B). Decision-makers may fail to capitalize on transient opportunities for reward (or accrue excessive costs associated with deliberation) if they wait too long before committing to a choice. If they respond too quickly, they may fail to collect enough evidence to support a desirable level of accuracy.</p><p>We propose that the depth of forward search, which varies from myopic search to full preposterior inference <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>.B), can be adjusted based on contextual demands on response timing. As clusters are activated based on the observed features (Equation (3)), and the cluster representations predict the appropriate final choice (e.g., the category label), as more information is accumulated/sampled, inferences about the correct response become more accurate (assuming that clusters reflect relevant aspects of the environment).</p><p>Several models have been proposed to address the question of self-termination.</p><p>"Integrate-to-bound" models, such as the Sequential Probability Ratio Test <ref type="bibr">(SPRT;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Wald &amp; Wolfowitz, 1948)</ref> and the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Ratcliff, 1978)</ref>, for example, operate by collecting evidence for competing hypotheses over time (in the form of a log-likelihood ratio), and committing to a choice when the strength of the cumulative evidence exceeds a pre-defined threshold. In typical implementations of these models, the threshold remains stationary during deliberation, and is chosen to balance the trade-off between accuracy and deliberation cost. Unlike SEA, however, these models act as passive observers, as they do not select the samples from which they learn.</p><p>In contrast, SEA selects samples sources of information through consideration of its beliefs about the environment, and updates these beliefs following the observation of each sample. Incidentally, the calculations involved in this procedure provide a principled way to define the termination criterion. While a purely exploitative decision-maker should commit to a choice when the gain in utility for each sample is outweighed by its cost, an exploratory decision-maker may be willing to bear some sampling cost in order to learn about the environment. Whereas the DDM and SPRT define the termination criterion to balance demands for accuracy with missed opporunity costs, in SEA the termination criterion is calculated with regards to expected information gain, and a heuristic that strives to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. 9</p><p>Because SEA strives to sample the most informative information source at each step, Additionally, the EGCM-RT will consider all stimulus features instead of than self-terminating.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">successive</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Proposed Model</head><p>Here, we introduce a novel model of categorization, SEA, which is designed to treat decision-making as an active sampling problem (in which decisions are made, not only about the final choice ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1.A</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Knox et al., 2012)</ref>, this mechanism can be seen as a heuristic linking the concept-learning and utility-sensitive sampling components.</p><p>Although category learning with feedback is typically treated as a supervised learning task, the present work recasts it as a problem in which the agent learns to traverse a series of probabilistic states (i.e., information samples) while minimizing sampling costs and maximizing reward (similar to reinforcement learning; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kaelbling, Littman, &amp; Moore, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Sutton, 1990)</ref>. While SEA will initially sample uniformly across dimensions, it will gradually learn to sample selectively from dimensions expected to provide useful information. The resulting representational structure is efficient, in that it minimizes both the amount of information encoded across experiences, and the amount of information considered during individual decisions.</p><p>In SEA, effects of selective sampling emerge with learning, and so sampling strategies change as the model learns about the environment. These bidirectional interactions between information sampling and concept-learning result in high-density representations along dimensions SEA believes are useful, and low-density representations along dimensions SEA deems irrelevant (reflecting the relative sampling frequency of these dimensions). This is analogous to the effects illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.A, which are captured by single step categorization models, which sidestep the information sampling stage of decision-making, and selectively weight dimensions through attentional processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kruschke, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Love et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Nosofsky, 1986)</ref>. In both frameworks, behaviourally-relevant stimulus dimensions have greater influence on the final choice than do irrelevant dimensions.</p><p>Active sampling can lead to a self-enforcing pattern of belief updating, where beliefs about the world influence the information that is sampled from it, and this information is used to update beliefs. This can have important consequences on learning efficiency. When decision-makers are free to select the stimuli from which to learn, they often learn more efficiently than when stimuli are presented in a predetermined order <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Castro et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gureckis &amp; Markant, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Markant &amp; Gureckis, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Markant et al., 2015)</ref>. This effect, however, depends on the structure of the problem being learned <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Enkvist, Newell, Juslin, &amp; Olsson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Markant &amp; Gureckis, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, 2014</ref>. Bidirectional interactions between information sampling and learning can also determine what concepts are ultimately learned. One example is the blocking effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kamin, 1969)</ref>, wherein after learning that a particular dimension is informative, a decision-maker will tend to exploit this knowledge rather than continue to explore other information sources. To avoid these kinds of "knowledge traps" <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Rich &amp; Gureckis, 2018)</ref>, decision-makers must successfully balance demands for exploration and exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kaelbling et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Overview</head><p>In this section, we present SEA, and its potential variations. SEA's information-value component determines which (if any) features should be sampled. Its learning component provides the information-value component with the probabilities required to determine the sampling policy, and is updated based on the information sampled. Below, we specify these components, outline their interactions, and consider model variants that incorporate mechanisms that reflect the constraints of human decision-makers. what information sources should be sampled When the cost of sampling an information source exceeds the gain in utility, a purely exploitative decision-maker should commit to a final choice. B) To decide whether to stop deliberating, or to sample an additional stimulus dimension, SEA performs preposterior inference. In the illustrated example, two of the four features used by Rehder and Hoffman (2005a) (i.e., the head and tail of an abstract bird stimulus) have been observed, and all possible future sequences of samples are simulated. In typical categorization tasks, participants strive to maximize the accuracy of the final choice (as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>), and the cost of sampling each dimension is equivalent. For other kinds of decisions (e.g., those involving medical diagnoses), outcomes associated with the final choice can be associated with asymmetric values (e.g., the cost of a false negative is often greater than the cost of a false positive). Similarly, different tests can impose different costs (e.g., an MRI is more expensive than a blood test). Our beliefs about costs, values, and the probabilities of future events influence what information is sampled, and therefore what is ultimately learned. Ellipse: A decision-maker using a myopic planning process would consider the possible results of only a single sample into the future, and then make the best possible response. Full preposterior inference is generally more accurate, as it also considers the potential results of subsequent samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept-Learning Component</head><p>The concept learning component we use is closely related to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson's (1991b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">1990)</ref> Rational Model of Categorization (RMC), although any generative probabilistic model would also likely be appropriate. The RMC incrementally learns to sort stimuli into appropriate clusters, and can make near-optimal use of past information during learning and prediction. Here, we provide an overview of the RMC. Additional details can be found in the original papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson, 1991b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson &amp; Matessa, 1990</ref>).</p><p>The RMC is a flexible clustering model, which learns to parcelate representational space into clusters based on its experience with the normative characteristics of the task environment.

The Dirichlet distribution allows the data to determine the number of clusters (as in SUSTAIN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Love et al., 2004)</ref>, and allows for a potentially infinite number of clusters. However, between one and three clusters per category is typical. These desirable characteristics of the Dirichlet distribution have led to it being used in many categorization models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson, 1991a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Griffiths, Canini, Sanborn, &amp; Navarro, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Across learning, SEA tracks the number of items in cluster k with the same value, j, on feature i in C ij .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combining Concept-Learning with a Utility-Sensitive Sampling Norm</head><p>When facing a choice with an uncertain outcome, the expected utility of a particular action, a, can be calculated by weighting the utility of each resulting state by its probability. In a category learning experiment, for example, one category label may be more probable than the other, but yield lesser reward. The action-utility function shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> corresponds to a contingency table in which two states (or categories), s p and s q , are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (i.e., P (s p ∪ s q ) = P (s p ) + P (s q ) = 1), and the decision maker must choose the appropriate action (a p or a q ; in a categorization experiment, this corresponds to the category label). The table could also be expanded to include more than two possible actions and states. </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">a p a q s p 100 0 s q 0 100</formula><p>For the action-utility function shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>, the expected utility, E(U ) of action a p can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">E(U (a p )) = U (a p |s p )P (s p ) + U (a p |s q )P (s q ).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>For example, if P (s p ) = 0.7, and P (s q ) = 0.3, the expected utility of choosing a p would be 70 and that of a q would be 30. In this case, the utility-maximizing action would be to choose a p . As mentioned, payoffs can also be asymmetric. For instance, if the lower-left entry in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> was -1000, there would be a high penalty associated with a p when state s q holds, and the optimal choice would switch to a q . As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson's (1991b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">1990)</ref> Rational Model of Categorization, the category label is treated like any other cluster feature; and equation (1) can be used to calculate the probability of each label, given the observed values.

This is important, as the information that is sampled can influence the final choice. The results of a blood test, for instance, can influence a doctor's decision about whether to suggest chemotherapy for a patient. To estimate the utility of a test that reveals the value of an unknown feature (e.g., "cancer antigen present" vs. "cancer antigen absent"), we consider how much the results of the test would improve the utility of the current state (where the current state is defined by the vector of observed features, F O ). The expected utility of the state after sampling unobserved feature i, can be estimated by summing across its possible values, j:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">E(U (F O , F i )) = j∈F i E(U (F O , j))P (F i = j),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where E(U (F O , j)) denotes the expected utility of the state if value j (of unobserved feature F i ) was included in the vector of observed features. Equation (9) demonstrates how the expected utility of the state can be calculated for a single feature. As each feature can have multiple values (2 in the simulations described below), the model explores each branch for each feature. During myopic decisions, the model considers only a single step into the future. Preposterior analysis (which is implemented in SEA as a "depth-first" search process), involves imagining each branch several steps into the future. The computational demands of preposterior analysis, therefore, are high, even for the relatively low-dimensional decision problems commonly considered in the categorization literature.</p><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">9</ref>is used to calculate the gain in utility (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Nelson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Nelson et al., 2010)</ref> from sampling unobserved feature i:  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport, 1998)</ref>, which require multiple samples to be drawn from a single noisy stimulus feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Edwards, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Rapoport &amp; Burkheimer, 1971)</ref>. Although such tasks similarly require participants to decide, at each time-step, whether to consider additional information or commit to a final choice, the problems considered here requires the integration of information across multiple stimulus features. This poses an additional challenge, as decision-makers must know which features provide useful information with regards to their goal. Efficient information sampling, therefore, requires knowledge about a problem's domain. In our model, the concept learning component provides this kind of information (i.e., knowledge of the problem's underlying structure) to the information-utility component (which then identifies the most informative samples).</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">G(F i ) = E(U (F O , F i )) − E(U (F O )).<label>(10)</label></formula></div>

In order to derive the optimal solution, one would need to make several assumptions. It would be necessary, for instance, to estimate the number of trials left in the study (as the negative consequences of choosing a sub-optimal strategy increases with the number of trials on which it is applied). It would also be necessary to estimate the how rewarding the environment is (as optimal inference requires normalizing estimates based on environmental characteristics). It would also be necessary to estimate the probabilities of different category structures, which represents uncertainty about the appropriate categorization strategy (alternatively, one could restrict the possible forms of the environment, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Stankiewicz, Legge, Mansfield, &amp; Schlicht, 2006)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>SEA interleaves concept learning and information sampling, such that they mutually influence one another. Information sampling is akin to a dynamic planning process in which SEA's concept learning component (i.e., the Rational model) serves as an internal model of the environment. For instance, the Rational model may might learn that red objects tend to be heavy 90% of the time. Using this acquired knowledge, after observing that an object is red, the Rational Model (Equation (1)) would then be able to update its expectation that the object is heavy to 90%. Before learning this relationship between color and weight, the Rational model would rely on an uninformative prior (50% of objects are heavy, 50% of objects are light) to guide its predictions.</p><p>Calculating these probabilities of unobserved features (e.g., weight) is critical for planning which feature to sample next. The expected utility of a possible state is calculated by combining the probabilities of these states with their utilities (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">8</ref>. The expected utility of sampling this particular feature can be calculated by combining these expected utilities across feature values (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">9</ref>). The gain in utility from sampling the feature can then be calculated using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">10</ref>. The exploration bonus for this feature could then be calculated using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">11</ref>. After performing these calculations for each feature, the probability of sampling each feature would then be calculated using equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">(12</ref> The process would then be repeated with the value of feature "1" set to 1 (i.e., F O = [1,?,?]). When the depth of the forward search is limited to two steps, the algorithm would commit to sampling a feature after simulating the sampling of two features. 14 For a three-feature categorization problem, SEA would simulate the sampling of all three features before sampling the first. After sampling one feature, SEA would simulate sampling both remaining features. After calculating the information gain and exploration bonus for each feature, SEA would then decide what feature to sample using the Softmax choice rule (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">12</ref>). Importantly, SEA does not learn anything during simulation.</p><p>The concept learning component is updated only after the final choice is made, and this learning changes behaviour on future trials only.</p><p>While the myopic decision algorithm requires minimal computational demands, it lacks the sophisticated behaviour that forward search enables (i.e., strategic self-termination and branching). When SEA employs a myopic strategy, it tends to sample more dimensions, and to be less accurate (in terms of its categorization decisions), than when preposterior analysis is employed. These limitations of the myopic algorithm are illustrated in the simulation of experiment performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blair et al. (2009)</ref> (see "Strategic Attention within Individual Trials").</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits of Selective Sampling</head><p>Many real-world learning problems involve identifying a sparse signal hidden within a noisy high-dimensional space (similar to finding a needle in a haystack In both simulations, the stimuli were composed of 99 random binary features (generated through a process similar to coin flipping), and a single binary feature that perfectly correlated with the category label. During each of the 100 repetitions of each simulation, SEA was trained over 100 blocks of ten trials. As full preposterior inference (exhaustive forward search through the 100-dimensional space) imposes high computational demands, SEA was set to use a myopic strategy in which forward search was limited to one step ahead. In our first simulation <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>.A &amp; 4.B), the cost associated with sampling each feature limited SEA's sampling behaviour to 5 or fewer features per trial.</p><p>Nevertheless, SEA quickly found the signal feature, and learned to ignore the others.</p><p>In the second simulation, instead of performing active sampling, SEA sampled every feature on every trial <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>.C). The comparison between the two models demonstrates how selective sampling based on expected utility can improve learning. Real world environments typically impose some cost for information sampling (e.g., time, effort, or value will be created. Low values of the α 0 parameter for the category label, for instance, would mean that distinct clusters with the same label would be unlikely.</p><p>monetary), and the number of features considered during deliberation is a function of these costs. Therefore, learning efficiency can be impaired when a models inductive bias (or prior) is inappropriately matched to the environment. Specifically, when estimated costs are too low, a decision-maker may sample too many-features. When decision costs are too high, the decision-maker may fail to efficiently explore the domain, and develop inaccurate beliefs as a result. A strongly cost-sensitive decision-maker, for example, may identify a single weakly-informative stimulus feature, and subsequently fail to identify more-reliable decision strategies (i.e., using a different stimulus feature, or considering a set of features).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A) B) C)</head><p>Active Sampling All Dimensions Sampled Active Sampling <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> . Classification accuracy increased quickly, such that after 40 training blocks, the model was typically able to categorize &gt; 97% of the stimuli correctly. The number of features sampled (A) negatively covaried with the slope of the learning curve (B). This reflects the models ability to efficiently explore unsampled features (i.e., by considering the number of times each feature has been observed; Equation (11)), and capitalize on the single reliable feature in the simulation environment. The selective sampling model learned more quickly than a comparable model in which all stimulus features were always sampled (C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shepard et al. (1961)</head><p>For decades, the six problems developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Shepard et al. (1961)</ref> have been a benchmark for testing formal categorization theories. In Shepard's six problems, stimuli consisting of three binary features, are used to define six different category problems ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). The type I problem is a one-dimensional task in which a single dimension is relevant and the other dimensions can be ignored. The type II problem is a two-dimensional rule-based task requiring the learner to employ a disjunctive exclusive-or (XOR) rule. In the type III, IV and V problems, all dimensions are informative, and for each category, all but one member can be categorized according to the same strategy, while the remainder must be categorized using a different strategy. These three problems also differ in interesting ways; the type III problem, for instance, can be solved using two dimensions, and the type IV problem is characterized by a linearly-separable prototype structure. Finally, in the type VI problem, all three dimensions are relevant, and participants must essentially memorize the individual stimuli.</p></div>

Geometric Depiction of the Six Problem Types <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Shepard et al., 1961)</ref>. Members of each category are denoted by white and black spheres. In the Type I problem, a single dimension is relevant. In the type II problem, two dimensions are relevant, and decisions makers must employ a logical XOR rule. In the type III, IV, and V problems, all dimensions are informative, but the categorization structures differ in interesting ways. In the type VI problem, all stimulus dimensions must be considered.</p><p>A typical finding, which has been both replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Nosofsky et al., 1994)</ref> and extended <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Feldman, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Love, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1996)</ref>, is that the initial difficulty of each task (as measured by the proportion of choice errors) closely reflects the number of dimensions that must be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Medin &amp; Schaffer, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Nosofsky, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Shepard et al., 1961)</ref>. Therefore, the tasks tend to increase in initial difficulty from type I to II, from II to {III, IV, V} 16 , and from {III, IV, V} to VI ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). In support of this idea, several formal categorization models, which include selective attention, are able to closely predict this behavioural effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Nosofsky et al., 1994)</ref>, while Bayesian models (like <ref type="bibr">Anderson's Rational model;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson, 1991b)</ref> tend to underestimate differences between the problems during early learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Nosofsky et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>We simulated the experiment performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rehder and Hoffman (2005a)</ref>, who used eye-tracking to investigate whether the differences in behavioural accuracy between rules might reflect differences in information sampling. Their important finding was that, following learning, eye-movements closely reflected the behavioural relevance of each dimension ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 6.A)</ref>. These results provide compelling support for the idea that differences in attentional strategies underlie observed differences in behavioural accuracy between rules. The results also indicate that attention operates, not only at later decisional stages, but can influence information sampling behaviour.</p><p>We performed 1,000 simulations of this experiment using full preposterior forward search. Each simulation involved 28 learning blocks. In each block, each stimulus was presented in random order. Although we simulated all problems, our goal was to compare our findings to those of Rehder and Hoffman (2005a), so we report only results associated with problems I, II, IV and VI.</p><p>The model predicted the correct ordering of six problem difficulties. Perhaps more interestingly, the model learned to selectively sample behaviourally relevant stimulus dimensions across learning blocks ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6.B)</ref>. Although the model used the same parameters for this simulation as for all others, this sampling behaviour resembled that of human decision-makers ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 6.A)</ref>. 17 One interesting difference, however, is that while humans tended to sample from all three dimensions during performance of the type IV problem, the model sampled an average of 2.5 dimensions. This reflects the prototype structure of this problem, which allowed SEA to strategically self-terminate on roughly half of the trials. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rehder and Hoffman (2005a)</ref> imply that only a small percentage of high-performing participants may have self-terminated in this stimulus-specific way. While it is potentially interesting that the model identified this efficient sampling strategy, the propensity for self-termination will correlate with information cost. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> In the next section, we apply SEA to a study whose design is ideal for evaluating whether people self-terminate and branch in a stimulus-specific way.</p></div>

(1961)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rehder and Hoffman (2005a)</ref> experiments demonstrate that the model is capable of mirroring the human tendency to strategically sample behaviourally-relevant information based on learned category structure. This type of feature-based attention is important for improving the efficiency with which decisions can be made. In many contexts, however, decision makers can further reduce the amount of information sampled by considering stimulus-specific factors.</p><p>For instance, in the category structure shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> (and in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.B) , the indicator dimension (D1), by itself, is not predictive of category membership, but determines which of the two remaining dimensions should be sampled. When D1=1, for instance, the decision maker should sample D2 next, but when D1=2, only D3 is informative. Thus, 100% accuracy can be achieved by first sampling the indicator dimension, and then strategically sampling only one of the remaining dimensions. 19</p></div>

The standard SEA model included stimulus specific attention and exhaustive preposterior search, while the myopic model considered only one step into the future. As each dimension is equally predictive in isolation, the myopic model was no more likely to sampling the indicator dimension than a non-indicator dimension. The myopic model, therefore, should sample the indicator dimension first on roughly one third of trials. In these trials, it could then select the appropriate non-indicator dimension to sample. However, if a non-indicator dimension was sampled first, the model should then randomly sample either the indicator dimension (and then self-terminate) or the other non-indicator dimension (and then sample the remaining dimension). As a result, when using a myopic strategy, the model should tend to sample a greater number of stimulus features than when preposterior analysis is used.</p><p>After reaching the learning criterion, the standard model correctly classified 93.3% of the remaining 72 transfer items. Mirroring human sampling behaviour, the standard model tended to sample all stimulus dimensions early in learning, but then tended to sample only 2 dimensions per trial: first D1, and then either D2 or D3. (The features sampled were optimal on 98.6% of trials). After reaching the learning criterion, the myopic model correctly classified 67.9% of the remaining 72 items. Like the standard model, the myopic model tended to sample all dimensions during early learning, and sample fewer dimensions later in learning. However, demonstrating the benefits of planning during information sampling, the myopic model tended to sample more dimensions than the standard model after learning (M = 2.33 instead of M = 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling Eye-Movements in the "5/4" Categorization Task</head><p>The previous results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blair et al. (2009)</ref> were inconsistent with a standard view of selective attention, but were compatible with SEA's sampling account which can lead to different sampling patterns for different stimuli. One possibility is that classic studies consistent with selective attention accounts in part reflect the averaging of different sampling patterns for different stimuli. In this section, we consider this possibility by revisiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Medin and Schaffer (1978)</ref> "5/4" categorization structure (shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 3</ref>), which was originally used to differentiate prototype-and exemplar-model accounts of category representation.</p><p>During a training phase, participants typically learn to categorize the first nine stimuli (A1-A5 and B1-B4) through trial and error. In a subsequent transfer phase, the participants also categorize the seven transfer items (T1-T7). The task is somewhat ill-defined, in that no single feature perfectly predicts the category label. Instead, the categories have a prototype structure (category A: [0,0,0,0]; category B: [1,1,1,1]), and the features differ in terms of how reliable they are with regards to prediction of the correct response. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 3</ref>, the "High1" and "High2" features each correctly predict the category label for seven of the nine training items, the "Med." feature predicts the correct category label for six out of the nine training items, and the last feature ("Low") predicts only five of the training items correctly.</p><p>Viewed through the lens of categorization models that include feature-wide attention parameters, an optimal decision-maker should place no-weight on the least-informative 716 feature. Exemplar models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Nosofsky, 1986)</ref>, but not prototype models <ref type="bibr">(Minda &amp; 717 Smith, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Nosofsky, 1987)</ref>, indicate that human participants tend to assign substantial 718 weight to this feature. This seemingly sub-optimal pattern of attentional weighting has 719 been interpreted as evidence favoring the prototype account of category representation <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 3</ref> The classic "5/4" Category Structure introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Medin and Schaffer (1978)</ref>.

Visual features were randomly assigned to each category feature (i.e., the features depicted in Each transfer block consisted of a single presentation of each stimulus in random order, and no feedback was presented. Matching the predictions of exemplar theory, a key finding was that the majority of participants actually do display this seemingly sub-optimal attentional pattern.</p><p>In SEA optimality is defined with respect to the maximization of expected utility.</p><p>From this perspective, an active-sampling learner should seek to optimize scan paths for individual stimuli (i.e., minimizing sampling costs and maximizing reward). One possibility is that the attentional pattern observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Rehder and Hoffman (2005b)</ref>, might reflect an average across different optimal scan paths for individual stimuli.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, we simulated this experiment 1,000 times. Although the same parameters were used for all simulations, SEA's choice behaviour closely resembled that of human decision makers (Pearson r = 0.98; <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Rehder &amp; Hoffman, 2005b</ref>). SEA's sampling behaviour also resembled human eye-movement data. Human decision-makers were more likely to sample the highly informative features (M (High1) = 80%, M (High2) = 80%) than the moderately informative feature (M = 75%), and were more likely to sample the moderately-informative feature than the least informative feature (M = 60%). SEA displayed the same ordering of feature fixation probabilities (High1 = 83%, High2 = 83%, Med. = 66%, Low = 17%).</p><p>These results provide a new vantage point on optimality for this task. From the perspective of models that have feature-wide attention, it is sub-optimal to place any weight (i.e., sample) the least informative feature in the 5/4 problem. However, according to SEA, featureal relevancy is contingent on what information has previously been sampled. According to SEA, depending on the stimulus and scan path, the so-called least informative feature can be highly informative. In those cases, SEA will sample this feature to maximize utility. SEA's strategic sampling leads it to sample 2.42 features on average for the 5/4 problem whereas a feature-wide attention model would need to consider 3.0 features on every trial. In light of this result, one conclusion is to exercise caution in characterizing attentional allocation as sub-optimal when stimulus-specific scan paths can increase sampling efficiency. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rule-Plus Exception</head><p>In the previous simulations, we focused on eye tracking studies as they provide an independent estimate of attention (assuming a typically strong coupling between eye-movements and attention holds; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Deubel &amp; Schneider, 1996)</ref>. However, we intend our theory and model to not only accurately predict human sampling behaviour, but to additionally account for effects thought to reflect the resulting mnemonic structure. To illustrate how our model performs subsequent recognition memory, we applied SEA to an experiment using the rule-plus exception category structure <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. In this structure, most stimuli can be accurately sorted into categories according to a simple rule, but the remaining exception items must be recognized, and categorized according to a different strategy. Behaviour on this task reveals interesting differences in how rule-following and exception items are encoded. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> Rule-plus exception category structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Davis et al., 2012c)</ref>. Participants in this study learned to categorize based on the first eight stimuli (Item Type: "Train"). By attending only to the first feature ("D1"), participants would be able to categorize three of the four stimuli within each category. 2007; <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Palmeri &amp; Nosofsky, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Sakamoto &amp; Love, 2004)</ref>. This is thought to reflect 774 stronger encoding of the rule-irrelevant features for the exception items. Differences in categorization and recognition accuracy between the rule-following and exception items, therefore, suggest differences in the organization of conceptual knowledge. As single-system categorization models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Nosofsky, 1986)</ref> have difficulty accounting for this effect, dual process frameworks (involving separate representational systems for rule-following and exception items) have been proposed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Nosofsky et al., 1994)</ref>. We predicted that due to its minimization of sampling cost, SEA would develop incomplete representations of rule-following items (i.e., ignoring rule-irrelevant features). We also predicted that SEA would sample more features for exception items (as these need to be differentiated from rule-following items, and then sorted according to a different strategy).</p><p>In SEA, recognition strength is modeled (by the concept-learning component) as the likelihood of the observed stimuli, given the learned clusters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Recognition Strength = k P (F O |k)P (k),<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where P (k) denotes the prior probability of existing clusters (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> . A) Human Behaviour: Recognition ("Rec.") and categorization ("Cat.") accuracy for rule-following ("Rule") vs. exception ("Ex.") stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Davis et al., 2012b)</ref>. While categorization accuracy was greater for rule-following items, recognition accuracy was greater for exception items. Error bars reflect 95% confidence intervals. B) Model Behaviour. Mirroring human behaviour, the model displayed greater categorization accuracy for rule-following items than for exception items, but greater recognition strength (Equation (13)) for the exception items than the rule-following items. (Note differences in the vertical-axis scale for categorization accuracy and recognition strength.) C) Model Categorization Behaviour: Categorization accuracy for rule and exception items for the standard and yoked ("Y") models. Mirroring human behaviour, both models displayed better categorization accuracy for rule-following items than for the exception items. Accuracy for the yoked model was lower than that of the standard-model. Model-type and stimulus-type interacted such that the yoked model displayed a greater difference in accuracy between rule-following and exception stimuli than the standard model. D) Model Sampling Behaviour. While the standard model sampled a greater number of features for exception items than for rule-following items, the yoked model did not.</p><p>The model results conformed to the pattern of human results, as rule-following items had an accuracy advantage during learning, and a disadvantage during subsequent recognition test <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref>). As illustrated by the black bars in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.D, our model sampled fewer features (M = 2.45) for rule-following items than for exception items (M = 3.17) during learning, reflecting a learned strategy of sampling until the presence or absence of an exception item could be determined.</p><p>To better understand the consequences of this learned sampling strategy, we simulated a yoked model that inherited the scan-paths from a simulation of our standard model. This removes the possibility of hypothesis-dependent sampling, as the concept-learning and active-sampling components were decoupled. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Compared to our regular model, the yoked model's performance was particularly impaired on the exception items. The yoked model made disproportionately more errors to the exception items during learning (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.C) and was worse than our standard model in recognizing these items. This finding illustrates the importance of strategic sampling in this task. In particular, the categorization task necessitated greater sampling of information about exception items, leading to a more complete representation of these items in memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>SEA describes how people strategically sample information while learning and making decisions. It consists of a Bayesian learning component, which models beliefs about the world, and an information-utility component that conducts a goal-directed forward search on these beliefs. Interactions between the two components allow the model to actively learn about the external world by sequentially sampling from information sources expected to provide useful information. In SEA, usefulness reflects both a drive to maximize gain in utility (exploitation of existing knowledge), and a drive to maximize knowledge of the external world (exploration). As a consequence of active sampling, SEA's knowledge of the world reflects the utility function it strives to optimize <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 1 provides</ref> an example of a utility function that would maximize decision accuracy). SEA differs from single-step categorization models that sidestep questions related to active sampling, and contort representations of encoded dimensions based on their behavioural relevance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kruschke, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Love et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Nosofsky, 1986</ref>). SEA's active sampling behaviour, however, leads to the development of dense representations along dimensions expected to be behaviourally-relevant, and sparse representations along dimensions expected to be irrelevant. As a result, SEA provides a compelling account for many aspects of human categorization behaviour. One example is that SEA can develop and maintain beliefs that systematically deviate from reality ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). This is interesting, as each component can be considered normative in its own right.</p><p>As our goal was to offer a general theory of how attentional-like behaviour could emerge from sequentially sampling information according to its expected utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Trommershäuser, Landy, &amp; Maloney, 2006)</ref>, SEA was not tuned to any of the individual tasks. The default parameters form <ref type="bibr">Anderson's (1991)</ref> rational model were used throughout. Similarly for each simulation, an arbitrary cost of 10 utility units was imposed for sampling each stimulus feature. Although it was not tuned to particular datasets or tasks, SEA was able to capture a wide range of category learning findings. For example, in addition to capturing the basic difficulty ordering of the six problem types described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Shepard et al. (1961)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kruschke, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Nosofsky et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>SEA can additionally address sampling phenomena that are outside the scope of existing models with attentional mechanisms. Rather than initially-encoding all information used to form the decision, and then contorting these encoded representations based on their behavioural relevance, SEA's information-utility component selects relevant information through a dynamic forward search process. This allows the model to allocate attention flexibly within individual trials (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blair et al., 2009)</ref>. This ability is unavailable to models in which attention operates at the level of individual features, but not at the level of individual stimuli. Moreover, as indicator features (such as those in the category structure considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blair et al. (2009)</ref>, which indicate the next appropriate feature to sample) can be considered as contextual cues signaling appropriate decisional strategies, SEA's active sampling procedure naturally accounts for effects associated with context-gated knowledge partitioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lewandowsky, Roberts, &amp; Yang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Little &amp; Lewandowsky, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Yang &amp; Lewandowsky, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>This capacity to flexibly sample from information sources expected to provide useful information supports an alternative interpretation of findings associated with the classic 5/4 category structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Medin &amp; Schaffer, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Rehder &amp; Hoffman, 2005b)</ref>. In our simulations, SEA sampled stimulus features at an overall rate consistent with the best-fit attention weights from the GCM exemplar model. However, these overall sampling proportions arose in SEA from averaging heterogeneous sampling patterns across the individual stimuli. One possibility is that heterogeneous sampling behaviour might also explain why these weights arose for the GCM. By characterizing each category decision as the culmination of an active sampling process, SEA offers a rich account of the micro-structure of each trial that can be tested experimentally. In cases such as the 5/4 studies, this dis-aggregation offers novel insights into classic categorization tasks and alternative accounts of the behavioural results.</p><p>Although we have focused on eye-tracking studies, we intend SEA to apply to other kinds of behaviour. Even in cases in which all stimulus features fall within the same spatial location, its selective sampling processes should still be operable. To illustrate this point, we applied SEA to a rule-plus-exception category learning problem in which most items followed a simple rule, and the remaining exception items had to be categorized according to a different strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davis et al., 2012a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Davis et al., , 2012c</ref>. Like human decision-makers, SEA made more errors on exception items during learning while also showing enhanced recognition for these items following learning. This reflects increased representational density for the rule-following items relative to the exception items; as SEA tended to sample more stimulus features for exception items (sampling each stimulus until it could be determined whether it was an exception).</p><p>We also aimed to show how behaviours beyond the scope of classic models of selective attention could be explained in terms of strategic sampling. That SEA could capture the qualitative data patterns in these studies, and in cases offer novel interpretations and predictions, is a strength of this work. In this contribution, we did not stress comparison to alternative models, though we did note where classic selective attention models and myopic versions of SEA that do not perform full-look-ahead search would fail. In the future, finer-grained model comparisons and fits to data, including to individual participants, can assist in evaluating alternative strategic sampling models.</p><p>By considering information gathering to be an integral component of category learning, the current approach recasts categorization as a dynamic decision making problem. This is similar to a model-based reinforcement-learning approaches, in which the learning agent incrementally builds a model of the external world, while at the same time using the model to adjust its policy (i.e., guide the agent's choices; <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Sutton, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Sutton, , 1991</ref>. In these kinds of dynamic decision making tasks, optimal performance requires a delicate balance between exploration (which provides the highest returns according to current estimates of utility) and exploitation (which help the agent to discover options with potentially greater utility; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kaelbling et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Although it places less emphasis on managing the exploration/exploitation trade-off, the model most similar to SEA is likely that developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nelson and Cottrell (2007)</ref>. This model combines a Bayesian concept-learning component (which was designed for the six problem types described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Shepard et al., 1961)</ref>, with an active sampling procedure driven by the expected information gain of each stimulus feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Nelson, 2005)</ref>. In conjunction with a fixed cost for sampling each feature, the sampling procedure encouraged the model to selectively sample task-relevant stimulus features; mirroring previously-observed patterns of human eye-movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Rehder &amp; Hoffman, 2005a</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Ng &amp; Jordan, 2002)</ref>. In brief, generative and discriminative models characterize the task of the learner differently. Generative models attempt to learn an internal model of each class (i.e., category). In contrast, discriminative models attempt to find a boundary that separates classes. Generative models are typically Bayesian in form, whereas discriminative models include decision trees, SVMs, regression approaches, and some (but not all) connectionist models. In generative models, the learning task is to estimate the joint probabilities between all variables. These models assume that a hidden or latent variable (e.g., a category label)</p><p>generates the observed features. In contrast, discriminative models perform a conditional estimation. For example, logistic regression only estimates the probability of a class (i.e., category) as a function of the predictive features. In this sense, discriminative models are more focused by the task, whereas generative models address a broader estimation problem, though models of all types have an inductive bias to make learning tractable.</p><p>SEA displays characteristics of both generative and discriminative models. SEA is a generative model in that it builds an internal model of the world that can be sampled from.</p><p>On the other hand, its internal model is heavily biased by the discriminative pressures of the tasks it performs, which results from its utility-driven sampling. Therefore, rather than attempting to build an unbiased model of the world, SEA samples information that it expects will be useful for performance of the task. While learning to classify items as members of one of two contrasting categories, for example, SEA will naturally focus on information that discriminates the two categories. SEA is therefore a generative model whose internal model of the world is shaped by its goals. This is also the defining characteristic of the SUSTAIN clustering model <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Love, 2005)</ref>. In effect, SEA follows SUSTAIN's basic principles, but updates and places these principles within a Bayesian framework. This allows SEA to handle uncertainty, display strategic sampling behaviour, and model changes in tasks and goals via changes of its utility function.</p><p>These characteristics allow SEA to capture behaviours not typically associated with Bayesian models. One such behaviour is blocking <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kamin, 1969)</ref>, in which knowledge of an informative stimulus feature can interfere with the learning of another. For example, consider a trial-by-trial category learning task in which the shape feature is predictive of category membership, and all other stimulus features are irrelevant. During early trials, SEA predicts that all features will be sampled occasionally, consistent with findings of a uniform prior in repeated resource allocation games <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benartzi &amp; Thaler, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Langholtz, Ball, Sopchak, &amp; Auble, 1997)</ref>. However, assuming some cost to sampling information (e.g., a desire to minimize cognitive effort), eventually, only shape information will be sampled and other stimulus features will be ignored. Thus, if another feature that was previously behaviourally-irrelevant becomes informative, SEA would be unlikely to learn this new relationship.</p><p>The simulations reported here involved classification learning in which the learner aims to predict the category label from the features. In this induction task, all the features are known and the category label is inferred. However, other induction tasks are possible, such as inference learning, in which the learner knows the category label and one of the features is inferred instead (e.g., This is a fish. Does it have scales?). Although inference and classification learning are informationally equivalent (after feedback is provided, inference and classification learning provide the same information to the learner), but strongly influence what human decision-makers ultimately learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chin-Parker &amp; Ross, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Rehder, Colner, &amp; Hoffman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Sakamoto &amp; Love, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Yamauchi, Love, &amp; Markman, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Yamauchi &amp; Markman, 1998)</ref>. In classification learning, people tend to learn information that discriminates between the two categories. In inference learning, however, people tend to learn more about the internal structure of each category.</p><p>When its utility function is adjusted to reflect each task, SEA's behaviour is consistent with these results. For classification learning, SEA's utility function should emphasize predicting the category label. In inference learning, SEA's utility function should emphasize predicting whatever feature is absent on the current trial. In effect, the task demands should shape SEA's utility function, which will in turn shape SEA's internal model; consistent with the psychological theory of how human memory is shaped by these tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Markman &amp; Ross, 2003)</ref>. Related manipulations that alter the presentation order of features and label <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Ramscar, Yarlett, Dye, Denny, &amp; Thorpe, 2010)</ref> or the isolation of categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Goldstone, 1996)</ref> could also be accommodated in a principled way by tailoring SEA's utility function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Directions</head><p>One line of future work is improving SEA's basic components. For example, SEA's learning component relies on <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson's (1991b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">1990)</ref> Rational Model of Categorization.</p><p>Virtually any other concept learning model could be used that can perform forward planning by estimating the probabilities of unobserved features. Basic improvements could also be made to SEA's information-utility component. SEA's information-utility component performs an exhaustive forward search; evaluating the full breadth and depth of the decision-tree defined by the stimulus attributes. As the number of possible branches increases exponentially with the number of features considered, this exhaustive approach is prohibitively expensive for all but the simplest problems.</p><p>We did consider a myopic version of SEA that lowered search costs (in terms of computation) and performed well in some environments <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref>. On occasions, people may also engage in simple myopic search strategies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>However, our results also highlight more sophisticated search strategies. One possibility would be to allow the model itself to appropriate depth of the forward search <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Snider, Lee, Poizner, &amp; Gepshtein, 2015)</ref>. For the problems considered here, searching only two steps ahead would have been sufficient to support human-like behaviour. A model starting with a shallow search and then progressing deeper until reaching a performance plateau could be a viable model for human information sampling. More sophisticated search procedures, of course, could also improve computational efficiency, and/or better capture human characteristics. For example, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, which defeated a champion human Go player, relies on Monte Carlo tree search to selectively explore the most promising parts of the search space <ref type="bibr">(Silver et al., 2016)</ref>. People may similarly rely on memory to retrieve the most effective search strategies used in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Logan, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to considering the search strategy, where the primary concerns are computational complexity and pruning of the search space, consideration of alternative evaluation strategies, such as a "confirmatory" or "positive" testing strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Klayman, 1995)</ref>, would also be fruitful. In a sense, SEA already explains people's tendency to engage in confirmatory behaviour in terms of using a biased internal model for forward planning.</p><p>Therefore, SEA can be considered an alternative account of how confirmatory behaviour can arise. Rather than solely reflecting a faulty reasoning process, confirmatory behaviour may reflect a biased internal model. In other words, a decision-maker could try to reduce uncertainty through preposterior inference, but fail to make accurate predictions as a result of inaccurate beliefs. SEA's capacity for this behaviour makes it susceptible to phenomena like blocking. Our hope is that it will advance our understanding of broader phenomena, such as echo chambers or filter bubbles, in which personalized information searches and social media use can lead to under-exposure to alternative viewpoints, resulting in inaccurate, or incomplete, worldviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Pariser, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Incorporating alternative search and evaluation strategies may increase SEA's quantitative fit to human data, as could incorporating additional noise sources into SEA's evaluation and decision processes. Across the simulations considered here, SEA's behaviour could be characterized as somewhat idealized in comparison to human participants. In this contribution, we prioritized illustrating basic principles and performance patterns over quantitative fit. Future efforts may emphasize quantitative fit and measurement of individual differences in learning and information sampling strategies.</p><p>SEA also suggests fruitful research avenues to explore in psychology and neuroscience.</p><p>Traditional models of selective attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kruschke, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Love et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Nosofsky, 1986</ref>) have been useful at both the behavioural and neural levels of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Braunlich &amp; Love, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mack, Preston, &amp; Love, 2013)</ref>. While these models provide a principled way to investigate how information is organized during decision-making, they tend to sidestep questions related to active sampling processes which unfold across time during deliberation. SEA, however, posits that more sophisticated sampling processes unfold across time during deliberation. This opens a number of avenues for future investigation. For example, SEA</p><p>proposes that an optimal decision-maker should consider the gain in utility from each feature (G(F i ), Equation (8)). This variable can be subdivided into three sub-components:</p><p>the expected cost of sampling a feature, the gain in utility of sampling the feature without consideration of its cost, and the expected reliability (i.e., expected inverse variance) of each feature. SEA also provides an estimate of the expected reduction in uncertainty about the appropriate final choice from sampling each feature. In addition to the issues outlined above regarding search strategies, each of these variables may be of interest to scientists interested in examining intra-trial attentional effects.

Although these models provide important insights into decision-making strategy, they sidestep sequential and contingent information sampling processes that can occur within individual trials ( <ref type="figure">Figure   1</ref>.B), and which are necessitated by the computational demands of interacting with the high-dimensional real world. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.C, encoding all available sensory information in high-dimensional environments is computationally inefficient (at least at high resolution; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Goffaux et al., 2010)</ref>. Accordingly, decision-makers appear to draw on their existing knowledge to selectively sample information from sources expected to provide behaviourally-relevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blair et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Najemnik &amp; Geisler, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nelson &amp; Cottrell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Yang et al., 2016)</ref>. Active-sampling learners therefore can develop beliefs about the world that systematically deviate from reality <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>), particularly when competing demands for exploration and exploitation are not balanced appropriately.</p><p>Sampling Emergent Attention (SEA) describes these bidirectional effects on the development of conceptual knowledge. Although it is largely formulated at the computational level <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Marr, 1982)</ref>, it makes predictions about how behaviour should unfold both within and across trials, and should be useful in understanding and predicting human behaviour. SEA should serve as a useful guide for understanding attentional effects, learning, and decision phenomena underlying the development of biased representations of the external world. Such effects are not only common in the laboratory, but are of fundamental importance for understanding how capacity-limited decision-makers interact with the high-dimensional external world.</p></div>

For instance, given a stimulus (including both observed and unobserved dimensions) defined as vector F = [2, 1, 1, 2], if the second feature was under consideration and the third and fourth features were known, then i would be 2, O would be[3,4], and F O would be[?, ?, 1, 2].</figDesc></figure>

The choice of what feature to sample would then be made stochastically using the softmax choice rule (equation(12)).Conceptually, preposterior analysis is an extension of the myopic algorithm that involves simulation of multiple unobserved features. As in the previous example, the model might begin a trial by calculating the expected utility of the first feature (feature "1") being "0" (i.e., F O = [0,?,?]). Holding this imaginary feature-value constant, SEA would then simulate the expected utility if other features were subsequently sampled. For instance, to simulate sampling feature "2", SEA would consider the expected utility of states F O = [0,0,?] and F O = [0,1,?], using equation(8). It would then abstract over these possible values using equation (9). It would then calculate the gain in utility and the exploration bonus associated with sampling this feature using equations (10) and (11).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>SEA proposes that this expected increase in utility from sampling F i is the key variable to consider when deciding what feature to sample, or whether to stop sampling and commit to a final choice. When G(F i ) for all features is less than, or equal to zero, a cost-sensitive decision-maker should stop sampling and commit to a final choice. When (F i ) for at least one feature is greater than zero, an exploitative strategy would be to sample the feature with the greatest gain.Importantly, costs are often dependent across features. The cost of a blood test, for instance, can be substantially less if other blood tests have already been ordered. A normative strategy therefore requires the consideration of all possible sequences of tests to account for these potential dependencies. As the computational demands of this approach increase exponentially with the number of features considered, it can only be justified when decisions involve a low number of stimulus features (as is common in psychology experiments), or when there is sufficient time available for deliberation and the stakes arehigh.An alternative would be to select tests myopically, selecting the next test without consideration of those following it. Such selection strategies are guaranteed to be optimal only if the next test happens to be the last. Interestingly, previous work has indicated that</figDesc><table /><note>human behaviour is often myopic during sequential sampling (or deferred decision) tasks</note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>In deciding which feature to sample, SEA plans ahead for the maximal number of steps, like an adult might when playing a simple game such as tic-tac-toe. In the simulations, we compared SEA to , we describe SEA's behaviour in a two-class categorization problem involving stimuli with three binary stimulus features. We assume that the model has already been trained.Myopic decision-making involves simulating the sampling of single unobserved features. Before sampling any stimulus features F O is[?,?,?]. To determine what feature to sample first, the model simulates the effects of sampling each. For instance, The model might calculate the expected utility of the possible states after sampling the first feature</figDesc><table /><note>). Importantly, the utility-sensitive sampling component does not learn utilities of various states. Instead, SEA is initialized with a utility table (as in Table 1), and with the costs imposed by sampling each information source. The conjunction of the concept-learning and utility-sensitive sampling components allows the model to perform active sampling. Equation (8) is used to calculate the expected utility of states (i.e., specific stimulus feature configurations), abstracting beyond specific actions (or choices). Equation (9) is used to calculated the expected utility associated with sampling an unseen feature, abstracting beyond its possible values. This helps the model to determine if, after sampling a single feature, whether it should sample another feature. To make this determination, SEA considers information gain (equation (10)) and the exploration bonus for each unsampled stimulus feature (equation (11)) and combines them using a softmax choice rule (equation (12)). Myopic Decision-Making vs. Preposterior Analysis.variants that are myopic in that they only consider the next step or move. To clarify how the equations interact to support myopic decision-making and Preposterior analysis(i.e., F O = [0,?,?] or [1,?,?]) using equation</note></figure>

As reviewed above, these sequential decisions about what features are goal-relevant can influence patterns of eye movements during short-duration decisions (i.e., less than~3 sec.), which are common in the categorization literature. Whereas successful contemporary theories of categorization tend to rely on attentional parameters that weight stimulus features according to their behavioural relevance, the proposed model can select relevant information through active sampling.To compare SEA's behaviour to human decision-makers and other computational models, we simulate several experiments. In the first, we demonstrate the utility of SEA's active sampling approach in high-dimensional environments. In the second, we investigate its choice behaviour in the classic six problems introduced by<ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Shepard et al. (1961)</ref> (a well-known test for formal models of categorization). To compare SEA's sequential sampling behaviour to that of human decision-makers, we then simulate an eye-tracking experiment conducted by</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

Through trial-and-error, participants trained until either completing 21 training blocks in total, or completing two consecutive blocks without error. Each block involved a single presentation of each of the nine stimuli in random order. During the subsequent transfer phase, participants categorized all 16 stimuli in each of two blocks.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

SEA is additionally able to predict the correct ordering of problem difficulties (i.e., Type I &lt; II &lt; IV &lt; VI), 21 a common touchstone for evaluating formal categorization models.Nelson and Cottrell's    work can be seen as a special case of SEA. First, SEA includes a flexible concept-learning component that is capable of learning a wide variety categorization problems. Second, it is flexible, in that it can maximize accuracy or expected utility. This is useful when the maximization of utility and accuracy represent distinct objective functions. Below, we discuss some possible elaborations of SEA after first considering some implications of this work.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Bayesian Discriminative Learning.
