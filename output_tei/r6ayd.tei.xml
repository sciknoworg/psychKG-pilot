			<abstract>
				<p>Psychological research demonstrates how our perceptions and cognitions are affected by context, motivation, expectation, and experience. A mounting body of research has revealed the many sources of bias that affect the judgments of experts as they execute their work. Professionals in such fields as forensic science, intelligence analysis, criminal investigation, medical and judicial decision-making find themselves at an inflection point where past professional practices are being questioned and new approaches developed. Workplace investigation is a professional domain that is in many ways analogous to the aforementioned decision-making environments. Yet, workplace investigation is also unique, as the sources, magnitude, and direction of bias are specific to workplace environments. The workplace investigation literature does not comprehensively address the many ways that the workings of honest investigators&apos; minds may be biased when collecting evidence and/or rendering judgments; nor does the literature offer a set of strategies to address such happenings. The current paper is the first to offer a comprehensive overview of the important issue of cognitive bias in workplace investigation. In it I discuss the abilities and limitations of human cognition, provide a framework of sources of bias, as well as, offer suggestions for bias mitigation in the investigation process.</p>

The investigation of critical events that occur in the work environment is analogous in many ways to the aforementioned professional decision making environments. Yet, workplace investigation is also unique, as the sources, magnitude, and direction of bias are specific to workplace environments. Neither the workplace investigation literature nor occupational health and safety literature, comprehensively address the many ways that the workings of honest investigators' minds may be biased when collecting evidence or rendering judgments; nor does the literature offer a set of strategies to address such happenings.</p><p>The current paper is the first to offer a comprehensive overview of the important issue of cognitive bias in workplace investigation.

At times, biasing factors found in other professional domains are relevant to workplace investigation and these are also reviewed and discussed.</p><p>Important to note in this discussion of practitioner bias is that no investigation system or protocol is immune to the effects of cognitive bias. Thus, it is prudent for people tasked with making judgments in workplace investigation to consider the research presented in this article and related it to the tools and processes that they rely on. This article focuses on the judgements of skilled professionals who are earnestly working to generate valid conclusion and not any small subset of the investigative population that act unethically or with negligence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Workplace Investigation</head><p>In the wake of an adverse workplace event, professionals collect information and render evaluative judgments about how, and sometimes if, an event occurred. The term workplace investigation is often used to describe a legal inquiry into alleged counterproductive workplace behaviors such as discrimination, harassment, assault, or theft <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Workplace investigation, however, also includes the investigation of industrial mishaps, such as near miss events and incidents in which people are physically injured and/or machinery is damaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. In addition to collecting and interpreting information about the event, workplace investigators with engineering and scientific backgrounds may engage in collision reconstruction, failure analysis, process hazard analysis, and/or analysis of injury biomechanics or aviation events. Similarly, workplace prevention inspectors and risk analysts make predictive judgments and identify potential hazards in work environments in an effort to mitigate future adverse events <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>. All of the aforementioned workplace investigation activities share a commonality in that cognition, human thought process and the brain, underpins their execution making the professionals, themselves, the instruments of analysis.</p><p>Workplace investigative activities are structured inquiries and, thus, principles of the scientific method apply. These principles include unbiased information collection and interpretation, hypothesis testing, the use of reliable and valid methods, as well as balanced judgments based on the evidence at hand (see principles of the scientific method; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27]</ref>).</p><p>Workplace inquiries are rarely criminal in nature but their outcomes affect organizational practices, the livelihoods of workers, and judgments in civil litigation trials. In a court of law investigative bias matters, if a workplace investigator is biased and an independent decision maker relies on that investigator's information to take action against an employee, the company may be liable for discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Bias</head><p>Bias is not random error; it is the systematic deviation from objective judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>. Put simply, bias is akin to a scale that consistently reports a 10-pound deviation from a person's true weight. Bias does not always lead to wrong conclusions but rather perceptions and judgments that are not entirely evidence-based. Hence, a biased judgement may be skewed in a direction counter to what the evidence would suggest, or alternatively, in a direction supported by the evidence but more so than what is appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>. Either circumstance undermines the quality of the conclusions drawn in the inquiry.</p><p>A healthy, yet limited, discussion of bias has taken place in the legal workplace investigation literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and occupational health and safety (OHS) literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>. Both areas of scholarship have considered the factors that bias the investigative process and investigators' causal attributions for workplace events. Topics that this literature has largely focused on are how specific knowledge of the worker or complainant (e.g., age, race, past performance) and event outcome can bias professionals' conclusions of cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>. Research has also tackled how organizational factors such as safety culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> or company size [37] influences attributional judgments. Research shows that a decision maker's natural cognitive tendencies can bias that individual to judge a worker as more causal than the evidence would suggest <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>, as well as, shape intuitions about who is trustworthy and deceptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. The workplace investigation literature has also considered the issue of investigative "tunnel vision," the tendency to focus on a preferred hypothesis and underappreciate the value of contradictory information, and presented a limited set of debiasing strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. The following literature review discusses in detail the workplace investigation research I mentioned here, as well as relevant research from other professional decision making domains that meaningfully contributes to the discussion of bias in workplace investigation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a taxonomy of sources of bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref>. Developed over years to discuss bias in forensic science, and then expert decision making more broadly, this taxonomy is a useful tool to organize the literature on bias in workplace investigation and reveal fruitful areas of future research inquiry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>. The arrow on the left side of the taxonomy shows how sources of bias range from the individual level to factors that exist in investigators' working environments to information investigators encountered when evaluating details about the workplace event. The current paper applies this framework to workplace investigation in order to discuss the unique sources, magnitude, and direction of biases found in this domain. These sources may bias basic perceptual, pattern matching, judgments of evidence (e.g., identification of critical safety features in a workplace environment [23; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">46]</ref>) or higher order information integration and final judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Sources of Bias Taxonomy</head><p>The quality of the information considered by the investigator significantly interacts with these sources. The greater the ambiguity of the information being judged the greater the opportunity for biased judgment (see evidence "elasticity," <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[47]</ref>). Information in the workplace investigation is often ambiguous and incomplete <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> and information-impoverished environments affords greater opportunities for sources of bias to affect an investigator's understanding of "the facts." The malleability of what a piece of information means in an investigation fundamentally challenges the efficacy of the mantra "the facts are the facts." Below I begin my analysis of sources of bias in workplace investigation at the bottom of the pyramid, human and cognitive factors, and the brain. There is simply too much information in our environment to process it all thoroughly so our minds have evolved to use "short cuts" <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[50]</ref>. These short cuts are often automatic and employed without awareness. They guide us to focus on areas that we believe are information rich and underestimate the value of, or ignore, other sources of information. This efficient use of information is the basis of human intelligence and as people become more experienced and highly skilled, they increasingly rely on these efficiencies of thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">52]</ref>. These expertisebased efficiencies often support accurate judgments but may also facilitate biased investigative decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Investigators' experiences facilitate efficient hypothesis formation, information processing and decision making. This expertise is invaluable but as expertise develops, cognitive processes become more automatic and less consciously accessible to the decision maker. It is in these moments of automaticity where sources of bias can shape decisions without the investigator being aware of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.   Workplace investigation is complex and at times, ill defined. Individual investigators will differ in their tolerance for ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, as well as, their need for closure (a motivation to reach an answer compared to tolerate ambiguity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[54]</ref>). A high need for cognitive closure can result in individuals reaching conclusions about what occurred more quickly and processing information with less depth than people lower in that need for closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">56]</ref>. In addition,</p><p>conscientiousness and actively open-minded thinking (AOT) are two personality traits that correlate with intelligence analysts' willingness to adhere to the practices which promote rigorous analytic decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[57]</ref>. Conscientiousness is people's tendency to be dependable, persevering, and achievement oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[58]</ref>. AOT is a person's openness to alternatives, sensitivity to contradictory evidence, and willingness to delay closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[59]</ref>.</p><p>It is appropriate to assume that workplace investigators' personal tendencies will similarly shape their decision making. Future research may consider how personality variables such as AOT, conscientiousness, need for cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[60]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2.1">Source 6: Education and Training. Educational background shapes how professionals develop initial hypotheses of what may have occurred, explain causality, and</head><p>generate solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">62]</ref>. To illustrate, a legal analysis of a workplace event in which three people died concluded that the cause for the event was largely the responsibility of a single person; whereas engineers' and psychologists' considering the same information offered causal explanations that were more multidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[62]</ref>. Another study revealed that engineers understanding of safety tended towards causal explanations that were more linear and focused on systemic causes whereas site managers were more multifaceted in their understandings of the factors which contributed to the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[61]</ref>.</p><p>Investigators of workplace events may be lawyers, human resource professionals, private investigators, individuals with a background in policing, the coroner service or the boarder services agency. In-house investigators in occupational safety investigation are often managers, supervisors, or occupational health and safety personnel with industry backgrounds that differ.</p><p>Educational background will bias investigative information seeking and judgments. More research is needed, however, if we are to develop an adequate understanding of how these educational differences shape the investigative process. In the wake of a workplace event that has stopped production or threatens the safety of an employee, time is essential. Research shows that prioritizing expediency over thoroughness in decision making negatively affects how criminal investigators cognitively process evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[65]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2.2">Source 5: Organizational</head><p>Those under time pressure tend to be more intuitive (rather than analytic) in their understanding of the information <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">67]</ref>. Hence, a goal of efficiency coupled with tight timelines would likely result in a less comprehensive workplace investigation.</p><p>Cognitive fatigue from an intense working schedule is another condition that investigators may experience. Legal research shows that judges' willingness to grant parole changed throughout the workday and their decisions were related to food intake and hours on task. Once depleted, because of either decision fatigue or low energy, judges tended to prefer denying parole which required less cognitive effort than granting parole <ref type="bibr">[68, cf. 69]</ref>. Similarly, professional investigators managing fatigue may lack the necessary resources to fully invest in the investigative assignment.</p><p>Personal allegiance to the organization or to individuals is another factor that can influence decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. OHS investigators are often employees of the organization in which they conduct investigations. This circumstance establishes a motivation (likely unconscious) in which the investigator may prefer to establish reasons for the event that emphasizes independent employee action rather than organizational factors. Indeed, correlational research shows that workplace safety specialists who have a higher job status in an organization provide a higher proportion of worker-centered explanations for events (compared to explanations that focus on management or design) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">70]</ref>. Alternatively, a close relationship between investigating personnel and the people involved may mobilize personal allegiances. In small organizations, decision makers tend to generate fewer worker-focused causes post-event; likely because of the close social proximity between workers and management <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. It is in the aforementioned ways that factors found at the organizational level can bias workplace investigators' judgements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2.3">Source 4: Base-Rate. Investigators experiences in investigation is an asset and</head><p>can support good judgments. Experiences build an understanding of the base-rate frequency of that outcome in the population (probability). However, these experiences can also influence the investigation and guide investigators to evaluate information and reach conclusions not solely on the information at hand but also their experiences of event likelihood. For instance, when a minority employee has been receiving anonymous, racially charged text messages, the perpetrator is most often a member of a different ethnic group. However, this is not always the case and the communication could be coming from a colleague of the same ethnic background. where a lack of consistency in a critical system can lead professionals to distrust machinery. For instance, professionals working with a piece of equipment that alarms for benign reasons, will learn that the likelihood that the alarm is signalling a truly critical situation is low which can result in human errors at life-threatening moments <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[71]</ref>. Similarly, an investigator who has familiarity with an employee who has a reputation as a "squeaky wheel" may underestimate the severity of a concern called to their attention by the dogged employee. Indeed, research shows that base-rate knowledge about a worker's or equipment's unsafe history significantly biases professional workplace investigators attributions of event cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">72]</ref>. Similarly, base-rate knowledge of an organization's unsafe reputation has been shown to bias professional safety inspectors to judge a greater number of features of a worksite as unsafe <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2.4">Source 3: Irrelevant Contextual Information.</head><p>Information that is related to the investigation of an event, but ultimately not diagnostic in determining ground truth of how the event occurred, may bias investigators' judgments. First, the manner by which information is presented can affect investigators' decisions. Information is interpreted as more truthful and, the people delivering it more credible, when it is accompanied by a (non-probative) image than the same information without an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">74]</ref>. Additionally, research on order effects shows that people weigh initially encountered information more heavily in their decision making than information encountered later (75; but also see 76 and 77 for recency effects in judgment).</p><p>Second, the content of information that is related to the event but irrelevant to determining cause can also affect decisions. Irrelevant information has been shown to bias the decisions of professionals such as DNA experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref>, forensic anthropologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[78]</ref> and fingerprint examiners <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[79]</ref>. The workplace investigation literature offers no comparable studies of irrelevant information on investigative decision making. Yet, sources of irrelevant contextual information in workplace investigation exist such as opinions shared by witnesses. Non-expert opinions such as "the driver was careless" or future projections such as "this will happen again" can never be facts as they cannot be fact checked and verified as accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">81]</ref>. These comments are irrelevant to the investigative decision making process. Future research may consider the effects of witness opinion and future projections on investigators' choices.</p><p>We can see the effectual possibilities of irrelevant contextual information in workplace investigation with research that has explored biasing contextual information on witnesses' (not investigators) understanding of event cause. Irrelevant contextual information that indicated an unsafe worker that was shared with witnesses after they experienced a workplace event and before they reported it, biased the content of their testimonies to emphasize worker fault, as well as, their allocation cause to be more worker focused <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[82]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3">Event Specific Information.</head><p>At times, information that is necessary for the investigation can also be biasing. These sources of bias may be the materials an investigator consults when attempting to render conclusions about event cause, or an aspect of the event information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3.1">Source 2: Reference Materials.</head><p>Information that workplace investigators use as a reference, such as images, documents, or investigative tools may be biasing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">83]</ref>). In these circumstances, the actual evidence is not driving investigators' judgements but rather the resources they are consulting are shaping their cognitions. When reference materials bias judgements it is often because professionals are not moving in a linear fashion from documenting the evidence, to comparing the evidence to references, to determinations of cause. Rather, the process is more circular: professionals consult the reference materials before or during their evaluation of the evidence and the consulted materials shape how investigators interpret the evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44]</ref>.</p><p>Investigation tools such as major case management software (e.g., Xanalys [84]), Cause Analysis Charts (e.g., SCAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[85]</ref>) or frameworks like the Internal Responsibility System (IRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[86]</ref> are reference materials that could affect judgments. To illustrate, research reveals that expert incident investigators who used a cause analysis chart, that is a checklist with substandard conditions and actions, while they selected and reviewed evidence about a workplace event were biased to allocate more cause to the person involved in the event than professionals who used an open-ended form (control). The experts using the chart also sought significantly less information about how the event occurred than those in the control condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[72]</ref>. In this case, the tool used as a reference negatively affected experts' judgment.</p><p>Reference material can also be less tangible than a physical IRS or SCAT chart. An investigator may use internally generated information such as a robust theory, anticipated pattern of event cause, or a notion of what is prototypical as a reference that they compare information to. To illustrate, research considering individuals' judgements of others found that when individuals called upon a mental prototype of a "male" or "female" person they subsequently rated images of androgenous people as less trustworthy compared to individuals not encouraged to conjure this internal gender reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[87]</ref>. In these ways physical and mental referrals can affect professionals' appraisal of information. The biasing effect of both internal and external reference materials is a fruitful area of future research in workplace investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3.2">Source 1:</head><p>The Data. Biasing information can be woven into information that is necessary to determine event cause (data). Some data is not biasing, for instance it is unlikely that a print of a tire is biasing. However, if the equipment involved in an industrial event is antiquated and looks in disrepair it may set the expectation that the equipment was causal when it may not have been -this expectation may go on to bias the process of information collection and interpretation.</p><p>At the outset of an investigation, investigators often know if people were involved in the event. This knowledge is necessary but may also be biasing. Human error is frequently determined to be causal in workplace incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">89]</ref>. Yet, professional workplace investigators have been shown to have a human error bias in which they tend to allocate a disproportionately greater amount of responsibility for the event to worker action than the evidence would support (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">91]</ref>, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>). There is likely a constellation of cognitive tendencies underpinning this investigative bias. For instance, the general belief that others' actions are intentional <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[92]</ref>, as well as our overemphasis of people's dispositional qualities as the cause of their behavior (e.g., inattentiveness or carelessness). This overemphasis of disposition is paired with a tendency to underestimate the effect of the situation (e.g., time pressure or impractical protocols; see the fundamental attribution error <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[93]</ref>; correspondence bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">95]</ref>).</p><p>Investigators' human error bias may be particularly influential on their determinations of cause in work environments that lack a "just" safety culture in which worker blame is the norm.</p><p>Investigators using a more "just" approach to safety related issues will invest more resources exploring organizational factors such as leadership and process (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[96]</ref>).</p><p>Knowledge of the incident outcome is another source of bias. Outcome bias is the tendency to believe that the quality of a judgment at the time of the incident is consistent with the magnitude of what occurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[97]</ref>; hence, an incident with a severe result may nudge an investigator to judge a worker's decisions as more careless or ill-informed at the time of the incident. In addition, a robust literature on hindsight bias demonstrates that people often perceive an event as more predictable after the outcome is known than it was at the time of the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[98]</ref>.</p><p>An investigator may, therefore be biased to conclude that the incident was more foreseeable for the individuals involved that it was in actuality. This would lead the investigator to focus on the poor decisions or missed opportunities by those involved rather than other, perhaps more relevant aspects of the event [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">99]</ref>.</p><p>Data may also bias investigators in that evidence that is particularly salient or distinctive can be overly persuasive <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">101]</ref>. Experienced-based expectations (i.e., schema) based on an individual's features (e.g., gender, ethnic group, organizational position) or the type of equipment or event may subsequently bias one's appraisals of information to be consistent with their expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">102]</ref>. Hence, necessary information such as who/what was involved and aspects of what occurred, can bias investigators' understanding of the evidence and their subsequent judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Threats in the Investigative Process: Confirmation, Coherence, Snowball and Cascade</head><p>Confirmation bias, a central aspect of "tunnel vision" <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[103]</ref>, is a human tendency by which an initial hypothesis overly influences final judgment. The content and direction of initial investigative hypotheses may be directly influenced by the eight sources of bias discussed above.</p><p>Once individuals invest in a leading hypothesis, they tend to seek information that supports their beliefs, interpret new information as consistent with their leading hypothesis, and minimize or ignore information that does not fit with their preferred theory (see reviews on confirmation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">104]</ref>). In workplace investigation, professionals may collect only a fraction of the facts available <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[105]</ref> and halt their investigative pursuits once they reveal event causes that they can confidently endorse and for which they can propose corrective measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[106]</ref>. Given these features, an initial hypothesis of how an event occurred may be particularly influential in workplace investigation.</p><p>Coherence-based reasoning is another process-based bias. It shows that if new, salient and sound information stimulates investigators to update their leading hypothesis of event cause they may (unconsciously) reinterpret previously evaluated information to be consistent with their new hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">108]</ref>. Taken together, we see that confirmation bias shapes how information is collected and interpreted as the investigation proceeds and coherence-based reasoning molds previously collected information into a coherent narrative of how an event occurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[109]</ref>.</p><p>The bias cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[110]</ref> and bias snowball effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[111]</ref> are additional biases that emerge with the investigative process. Bias cascade occurs when a professional's opinion, shaped at one stage of the investigation, biases other, subsequent judgements made by the same person at later stages of the investigation. The bias snowball effect occurs when one professional shares information with other individuals contributing knowledge to the investigation and in so doing biases the content of the information shared by these other contributors. The snowball effect leaves the investigator believing that (s)he/they have independent and corroborating sources of information regarding the truth of a hypothesis, when, in reality, the corroborating opinions can be traced to a single source. The implication of these process biases in workplace investigation are that the contribution of worksite factors such as toxic organizational culture, machinery design and function, environmental layout, work scheduling, managerial pressures, could be underappreciated because of an overarching narrative that highlights a limited set of causes for the event (e.g., delinquent employee behavior).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Proposed Solutions</head><p>Sources of bias will not always affect judgments. When conditions in which bias manifests are fertile, however, bias has a greater likelihood of taking root and developing <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[112]</ref>.</p><p>Fertile conditions include strong biasing information, difficult decisions, and a bias that pushes in the direction of a more comfortable conclusion for the investigator. Once biased it is very difficult, if not impossible, to debias one's perspective. Recall that bias largely resides outside of awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Decision makers who adopt the view that they are biased, without substantial evidence of its presence, are reliant on theories of how they are biased and the magnitude of that bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[113]</ref>. These theories can result in misguided attempts to correct for biases that may, or may not, be contaminating their cognitions (possible over or under corrections <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>).</p><p>there is a clear likelihood that the bias is present and the direction and magnitude can be anticipated <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[114]</ref>. Given that we rarely know the answers to the questions, if, how, and how much bias?, however, the most actionable strategies for managing bias focus on controlling an individual's exposure to sources of bias rather than removing bias that has taken root.</p><p>Interventions that control exposure can then be standardized into a "best practices" investigative approach. I refer to strategies that manage exposure to bias as context management and interventions which aim to minimize an established bias as debiasing.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Level 1: Bias Management Strategies</head><p>A common misconception in investigation is that all information about an event has investigative value. Many of the bias management recommendations that I present below argue the opposite. They emphasize the importance context management, that is limiting, managing and documenting professionals' access to, and use of, information as a way to minimize the likelihood of bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.1.1</head><p>Blinding. An effort to be scientific (reliable and accurate) requires that irrelevant information, especially that which has the potential to contaminate judgments, be concealed from professional fact finders <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. This strategy is an effective intervention for bias that can be introduced via irrelevant contextual information (Source 3 in the hierarchy). Each workplace incident is unique and professionals need to carefully consider what is necessary, versus interesting or nice to know. There is information, however, that is never relevant and this should be eliminated from the decision making environment.</p><p>In an effort to support information management of forensic analysts, researchers polled professionals from a variety of disciplines and itemized information as essential, review if available, or task irrelevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[115]</ref>. Workplace investigators would benefit from a similar auditing of the utility of information available to them in their investigations. Ultimately, professionals who accept that contextual information is persuasive and can bias their choices will likely adopt a practice of vigilance against acquiring information that is interesting but not strictly necessary.</p><p>The precise methods by which this information is removed from the investigation is a logistical matter for the investigation group doing the work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Linear Sequential Unmasking Extended (LSU-E). At times information that is</head><p>necessary for the workplace inquiry is also contaminating. These biasing factors are found in the data (Source 1) and reference materials (Source 2). In this circumstance a useful tool is Linear Sequential Unmasking Extended (LSU-E) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">117]</ref>. LSU-E controls the flow of information so that information that has relatively low potential to bias decisions is considered first and biasing information is presented to investigators only when it is required. For instance, the reference materials experts consult when judging information about an event can bias their impressions of the evidence. Hence, scholars in judgment and decision making suggest that professionals examine and document all features of each piece of evidence (e.g., vehicle marks) prior to comparing the information to a target (e.g., tires of the suspected vehicle). This is referred to as working "linearly" (compared to "circularly", <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref>) and it is a sequencing practice which limits the potential influence of reference materials on the interpretation of the event information <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[116]</ref>.</p><p>This type of sequencing can also occur on a broader scale in the investigation. For instance, a regulatory investigation of an event may take many months to complete. The organization in which the event occurred, however, may be required to submit their investigation report within one month of the incident <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[118]</ref>. The base-rates, motivations and allegiances of the organizational employee(s) building the organization's investigation report may result in the over-or under-emphasis of certain contributing factors in their report. In this circumstance, given that the regulatory agency is tasked with developing a report independent of the organization's report, regulatory investigators would benefit from postponing their reading of the organizational report until their investigation is well underway. Triaging information in such a way would delay exposure to any biasing material imbedded in the organization's report until later in their investigation process. Documenting when information is considered and how one's understanding of the event evolves is a central aspect of the LSU-E protocol. Below I discuss the value of documentation more thoroughly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Independent Assessment and Verification of Assessment. The Association of</head><p>Workplace Investigators (AWI) states that investigators "should be impartial, objective and possess the necessary skills and time to conduct the investigation." [p. <ref type="bibr">2; 119]</ref>. Indeed, this criterion is ideal and managing the investigative environment is foundational to achieving this mandate.</p><p>Familiarity with the workplace, people, or organization can bias judgments without the decision maker's knowledge as discussed in the section of base-rate expectations (Source 4) and organizational factors (Source 5). Hence, it is exceedingly difficult for an investigator internal to the organization to remain truly impartial and objective. It is thus prudent that, whenever possible, the investigation is done by a person who does not have personal connections to the people or organization involved with the event. However, this is not always possible. In circumstances where investigators have a priori knowledge or an affiliation, it behooves them to carefully follow the protocols that limit bias (e.g., blinding, LSU-E, or consider alternatives which is discussed below), as well as, thoroughly document the alternative hypotheses they explored and the process they followed while conducting the investigation.</p><p>Verifying an investigator's conclusions is also a useful practice in managing bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Base-rate knowledge, organizational, educational and personal factors can influence judgments (Sources 4 -7 of the hierarchy). In the practice of verifying, an independent investigator reviews the case information and provides a judgment. This strategy is useful even in circumstances where there is no obvious motivation or allegiances on the part of the primary investigator. This practice provides a measure of the reliability of the conclusions and reveals areas of discrepancy.</p><p>The independent verifier should not be selected by the first investigator or have been a participant in information collection. The verifier should be shielded from all potentially biasing information and blind to the conclusions of the first investigator. Investigators often work as both the collector and arbiter of the facts. This multifaceted role increases their likelihood of being exposed to sources of bias. In addition, some biases are cognitive tendencies that operate without our awareness (e.g., human error bias, hindsight bias).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Information Saliency to Combat</head><p>Ideally, we limit professionals' exposure to biasing information whenever possible. When decision makers cannot be shielded from biasing context, however we must consider the research that has tested ways to dislodge current, possibly flawed, thinking, and develop new insights.</p><p>These cognitive interventions are debiasing strategies and they differ from the context management strategies I discussed above (e.g., blinding, LSU-E, independent assessment). Much of the debiasing research emphasises deep and meaningful processing of information as a way to mitigate bias. Debiasing activities are, thus cognitively taxing and time-consuming exercises for which investigators require organizational support.</p><p>An organizational culture that offsets the rush to investigative closure is important. The desire for closure may be introduced via dispositional tendencies of the investigator (Need for Closure; 54), time pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[66]</ref>, or a goal of efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[65]</ref>. Organizations that provide adequate time and impart a goal of thoroughness increase their likelihood of data-driven and 123]) and it has had some success in bias mitigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">119]</ref>. This strategy helps to expand the narrow scope of information collection and interpretation that is the hallmark of confirmation bias. However, operationalizing this approach is challenging. ACH is a popular analytic technique predicated on the careful consideration of multiple hypotheses (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[128]</ref> and</p><p>[123] for a description of technique) and it has yet to be validated as a reliable method of reaching accurate results <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[129]</ref>.</p><p>Another technique used to disrupt coherence-based reasoning to is actively consider why a conclusion could be wrong (10; crystal ball technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[130]</ref>). This is akin to the "Devil's</p><p>Advocate" approach used in professional circles, where a final judgement is scrutinized by challenging key assumptions, re-evaluating the evidence, and presenting possible alternative judgments based on the evidence <ref type="bibr">[123]</ref>. The Devil's Advocate approach has had some success in improving accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[113]</ref> and reducing overconfidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[132]</ref>.</p><p>An important caveat must be included with this discussion of debiasing strategies. If we accept that these simple interventions have the capacity to dampen the momentum of processbased biases then we must also adopt a healthy level of caution when employing them. These approaches attempt to reduce the effect of a bias in a specific circumstance without evidence demonstrating the direction or magnitude of the bias in the situation, or if it is present at all.</p><p>These debiasing strategies are a unidirectional approach to bias reduction. That is, they work on the premise that the bias operates in one direction and applying pressure in the opposite direction will correct for it. However, biases are bidirectional and a strategy attempting to correct for a bias (e.g., overconfidence) can trigger the opposite bias (i.e., under-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>). In addition, they do not take into consideration the individual differences of the individuals making the judgments (e.g., an individual's baseline level of confidence). For example, investigators attempting to combat confirmation bias may work to generate as many alternative hypotheses about the event as possible. On the surface this appears to be an innocuous strategy, however, generating too many hypotheses, especially far-fetched ones, can create conditions in which the decision maker becomes predisposed to see their initial hypothesis as the most likely <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[133]</ref>. This strategy can also add unnecessary time to the investigation, and thus pressure for the investigator creating suboptimal decision making conditions. A thoughtful debiasing approach needs to address both the bias and its opposite <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref> and resist the assumption that a blanket debiasing strategy is harmless and will be applied consistently by all decision makers. Also revealed when investigators employ comprehensive documentation is the information that was not considered when making judgments. Hence, documentation validated strategy to prevent bias but it is an essential aspect of a robust bias management approach. Documenting records how an investigators' judgment evolved as new, potentially biasing, information was encountered and it is an important feature of the verification process mentioned above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Level 2: Noise Reduction with an Evidence-Based, Standardized Approach</head><p>Investigators may use one or more of the numerous workplace investigation approaches and techniques to develop their judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">136]</ref>. In occupational safety, most organizations do not have a specific investigative method for their inquiries <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Investigators' lack of consistency in decision making protocol is problematic for reducing cognitive bias in their evaluative and predictive judgments.</p><p>Standardizing the techniques and tools used by workplace investigation professionals promotes judgment consistency between-and within -investigators which reduces random error in judgments, i.e., noise (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> for schematics of noise and bias in judgment).</p><p>Standardized practices promote intra-investigator reliability, that is, consistent judgments with oneself overtime, as well as, inter-investigator reliability, judgments that are consistent with other workplace investigators who have considered the same information. The applied importance of workplace investigator consistency is demonstrated in the legal environment where reliability of a professionals' decision making practices is scrutinized because it is central to the credibility of their judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Frameworks of expert performance demonstrate that reliability (judgement consistency) is distinct from biasability but intimately linked to bias reduction. Reducing noise in investigators' judgments via standardization minimizes the noise produced via investigators' individualized biases but also provides an opportunity to see and address the effect of their shared biases more clearly (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[112]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[137]</ref>). Bias can still be present in a standardized system, thus the rigor that standardized practices promotes in decision making is greater decision consistency and less latitude for sources of bias to shape decisions. Hence, establishing consistency in judgment is vital to quality investigations but investigative consistency is not synonymous with investigative accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[138]</ref>.</p><p>Investigators interested in the reduction of bias must employ standardized protocols that both (i) promote consistency of their judgments, as well as, (ii) minimize the effect of bias, or at least do not contribute bias. Hence, standardized investigation practices developed in-house should be informed by the context management and debiasing literature discussed in the bias management strategies above. Out-of-the box investigation tools should be assessed to determine what bias, if any, they add to investigations.</p><p>Empirically vetting protocols is the soundest approach to unearthing potential implications of tools and techniques. This truth is underscored by findings from the intelligence community who recently discovered, via empirical scrutinization, that trusted assessment tools, with high face validity (i.e., the appearance of being a credible approach) were not as effective as previously imagined <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">131]</ref>. The majority of workplace investigation techniques and tools have not been empirically vetted with the exception of a few. This vetting has revealed the utility of some tools to support the investigation while not adding bias (e.g., Cognitive Interview <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[139]</ref>;</p><p>Self-Administered Witness Interview Tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[82]</ref>) whereas limited evidence suggests others should be used with caution (e.g., SCAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[72]</ref>).</p><p>Most investigative groups do not have the luxury of conducting controlled assessments of the methods and tools they use. Hence, the central message of Level 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>, is that standardizing one's approach to the investigative process reduces noise and promotes consistency in judgments. When working to standardize one's protocols, consider the sources of bias presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and integrate the bias management strategies outlined in Level 1 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>. It is particularly important for workplace investigators' whose findings are presented and evaluated in a court of law, a forum in which professional judgments are scrutinized for the potential of bias, that they are proactive in managing sources of bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. At their best, standardized protocols routinize unbiased, empirically sound, strategies for workplace investigator decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Level 3: Investigator Training</head><p>Explicit training about human cognition and bias is vital to managing bias in workplace investigation. Training educates investigators about the subtle nature of bias, how it influences their judgments, the bias management strategies they can employ to mitigate it, and the cognitive science underpinning each recommendation. When done effectively, it motivates workplace investigators to use the bias mitigation strategies outlined in Level 1.</p><p>Training should address common myths about bias held by investigators, including: they are not biased, even though they see evidence of bias in their colleagues' judgments (bias blind spot <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">140,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">141]</ref>); willpower can effectively manage bias; experts are immune to bias; or cognitive bias in an ethical issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[142]</ref>. These myths exist because knowledge about cognitive bias is not intuitive and must be explicitly taught.</p><p>People tend to believe that they process the world accurately (see naïve realism <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[143]</ref>) and evidence suggests that OHS experts subscribe to this flawed notion. For instance, threequarters of a sample of expert safety inspectors reported that historical information could not bias their judgements of a worksite; and yet, an experimental activity in which they were given such information demonstrated that they were biased by it and did not realize it <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Likewise, professional workplace investigators who were biased by base-rate information erroneously reported that the information benefited their decision making rather than compromised it <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Bias is undetectable when individuals introspect about their judgements and this promotes an inherent incongruity between confidence in one's decisions and the accuracy of those decisions.</p><p>Professional investigators' experiences may exacerbate this incongruity as expertise is a factor that promotes overconfidence <ref type="bibr">[144]</ref>. The awareness gained by investigators through training is not a bias management technique, but it does ignite the necessary motivation, and perhaps shift in organizational investigative culture, that investigators require to advance the bias management activities outlined in Level 1, and proceduralized in Level 2 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>

When population base-rates (the actual population frequency of an occurrence) are out of sync with investigators' beliefs about the probability of an event, there can be population base-rate neglect and biased judgment (Source 4). Imagine an investigator whose extensive professional experience in sexual harassment has generated an understanding that men, not women, are harassers. This tacit baserate understanding about who is likely to harass may bias the investigator's evaluation of the evidence in a case in which a female employee is accused of inappropriate behavior. A strategy to challenge the effect of flawed base-rates is to obtain the most up-to-date and specific base-rate information about the topic that one is investigating. Only activated information can inform judgments [see "what you see is all there is"; 29] and this base-rate information can then work as a datapoint in the investigation. Case evidence can then be evaluated for its strength and credibly in relation to the population base-rate for the event, this enhanced scrutiny may support an investigator reaching a more evidence-based conclusion [29, 120]. 2.1.5 Supportive Organizational Culture and Debiasing. Workplace investigators require a supportive organizational culture to conduct careful and thorough investigations and invest adequate cognitive resources to perform the necessary tasks. This strategy for bias mitigation largely addresses the biasing factors that originate at the organizational level (Source 5).</figDesc></figure>

An ambition to be thorough is important; however, so is having the adequate cognitive resources to meaningfully process the harvested material. Experts who are under cognitive load (via time pressure and memory load; 121) and/or feeling depleted via such things as decision fatigue [68] may not have the ability to deeply process information regardless of their motivation to do so. Those investigators armed with ambition and cognitive resources, have the capacity to meaningfully engage debiasing strategies. One such strategy is the consideration of alternative hypotheses (or the opposite) of one's primary leading hypothesis. Professional groups have relied on this technique for years (124; e.g., Analysis of Competing Hypotheses [ACH; 122,</figDesc></figure>

The AWI suggests that investigators document their activities to create a reliable record of the evidence and how they reached their conclusions<ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[119]</ref>. The AWI offers sage advice here and I add that the documentation should occur in real-time. Memory of one's experiences can be modified without awareness to reflect one's current perspective<ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">135]</ref>, hence, maintaining a log of one's thinking in the moment will ensure the most authentic account of the investigation.By engaging in real-time documentation investigators record what they knew prior toinvestigating, what hypotheses they considered, when hypotheses were added or disregarded, their initial understanding of the information and then, any shift in their understanding of the evidence. The record also includes if/when investigators consulted reference materials and/or incorporated technology; both of which are factors which have the potential to bias judgment.</figDesc></figure>
