			<abstract>
				<p>Workplace stress can affect forensic experts&apos; job satisfaction and performance, which holds financial and other implications for forensic service providers. Therefore, it is important to understand and manage workplace stress, but that is not simple or straightforward. This paper explores stress as a human factor that influences forensic expert decision-making. First, we identify and highlight three factors that mitigate decisions under stress conditions: decision parameters, internal factors, and external factors. Second, we situate workplace stress in forensic science within the Challenge-Hindrance Stress Framework. We argue that stressors in forensic science workplaces can have a positive or a negative impact, depending on the type, level, and context of stress. Developing an understanding of the stressors, their sources, and their possible impact, can help forensic service providers and researchers to implement context-specific interventions to manage stress at work and optimize expert performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Forensic science experts can provide critical information to police, courts, and other stakeholders in the legal system. When so doing, experts must make crucial decisions, such as how to collect and examine the evidence, prioritize exhibits for further analysis, and communicate their findings to fact-finders <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Morgan, 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Morgan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Morgan &amp; Bull, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Roux et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Decisions made earlier in the forensic process (e.g., at the crime scene) can affect subsequent decisions <ref type="bibr">(Dror, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Earwaker et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Morgan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Nakhaeizadeh et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, different cognitive and human factors influence the reliability of experts' decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dror, 2020)</ref>. One such factor is stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Almazrouei et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Jeanguenat &amp; Dror, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Take for example the misidentification of Brandon Mayfield as the perpetrator of the 2004 Madrid train bombings <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kassin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Office of the Inspector General, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Stacey, 2004)</ref>. In that case, multiple FBI experts, as well as an expert hired by the defence, all erroneously matched Mayfield's fingerprint to a fingermark recovered from the scene of the bombings. Later, an independent investigation by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) identified stress and other cognitive factors as having contributed to the erroneous identification (Office of the Inspector General, 2006)-including the high-profile nature of the case, time pressure, and a strong need for closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ask &amp; Granhag, 2005</ref>)-all creating fertile ground for a misidentification <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kassin et al., 2013)</ref>. Indeed, the OIG stated that the FBI's standard operating procedures at the time encouraged fingerprint experts to make conclusive rather than inconclusive decisions in highprofile cases, even if an inconclusive conclusion were more appropriate:</p><p>"The OIG did find, however, that the FBI Laboratory's stated criteria, for reporting an "inconclusive" result from a latent fingerprint examination could result in implicit pressure on the examiner to make an identification in a difficult comparison in a case involving a particularly heinous crime, and the OIG recommends that the FBI take several specific steps to reduce any such pressure in the future." (Office of the <ref type="bibr">Inspector General, 2006, p. 11)</ref>.</p><p>It should be noted that the crime scene fingermark in this case was degraded and highly similar to that of Mayfield, which made the comparison very difficult and therefore more vulnerable to unconscious bias and misidentification (i.e., the 'bias danger zone'; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Dror, 2013)</ref>. Even so, this example illustrates how various stressors-like time pressure, difficult decisions, cognitive overload, fatigue, hypervigilance, external scrutiny and other factors-can negatively impact forensic experts. Therefore it is crucial to address these human factors issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Busey et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Driskell et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Giurge et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Helsloot &amp; Groenendaal, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Zou et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, workplace stressors can increase financial and personnel burdens on forensic service providers, many of which are already underfunded and/or understaffed <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Kobus et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Koppl, 2020)</ref>. Research has shown that stress at work can reduce job satisfaction, lower engagement, and increase absenteeism and intentions to resign <ref type="bibr">(Craven et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Holt et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, some law-enforcement agencies have reported attrition rates around 50% over a three-year period, which was attributed to staff being exposed to critical accidents/crime scenes, with about 20% of officers reporting long-term psychological stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kelty &amp; Gordon, 2015)</ref>. Workplace stress may likewise lead forensic experts, who are valuable employees with specialised skills and in whom much time has been invested, to look for other jobs and eventually leave forensic science. This pattern, which has been described as "train/strain/lose" <ref type="bibr">(Kelty et al., 2023, p. 211)</ref>, can be an organizational burden on forensic service providers insofar as it creates a constant need to recruit and train new experts, plus an associated burden on existing experts to provide that training. Frequent turnover in forensic science laboratories can also limit laboratories' ability to handle existing piles of casework or case backlogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Almazrouei et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Houck, 2020)</ref> and may affect the quality of expert performance, such as unconsciously cutting corners to finish cases on time <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Busey et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the potentially detrimental impact of occupational stress in forensic science, there has been surprisingly little research or consideration of how stress may impact forensic expert decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Almazrouei et al., 2020;</ref>. Of course, stress can create strain (e.g., anxiety and burnout; Slack, 2020) that affects experts' wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Layard &amp; De Neve, 2023a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">, 2023b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">LePine, 2022)</ref>, but this paper focuses on how stress can also affect experts' performance in terms of their engagement in forensic tasks and the quality of their decision-making (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Almazrouei et al., 2020)</ref>. 1 Recent research has begun to examine the relationship between stress and forensic expert decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Almazrouei et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Busey et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Jeanguenat &amp; Dror, 2018)</ref>. However, much remains unknown in terms of understanding and managing forensic workplace stress, and this process is likely to be neither simple nor straightforward.</p><p>At a conceptual level, understanding workplace stress and its impact on decision-making is complex. First, there is still no universally-accepted definition of stress or workplace stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adderley et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Epel et al., 2018)</ref>. One commonly-used definition of stress comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Lazarus and Folkman's (1984)</ref> theory of stress and coping, which defines stress as one's perception that the demands of their environment are greater than their ability to cope with those demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Epel et al., 2018</ref>). If we adopt this perspective, workplace stress refers to employees' responses to work-related demands that exceed their available resources and coping abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Anshel, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Kelty &amp; Gordon, 2015)</ref>. However, these definitions seem to conceptualize stressat least implicitly-as universally negative, while some degree of stress may actually enhance performance (e.g., too little stress can lead to feeling bored or undervalued; Driskell et al., 2014).</p><p>Clearly it is important to understand what workplace stress is, how to measure it, how it affects performance, and whether there is an optimal level of stress, before considering approaches and policies to manage stress in ways that enhance forensic expert performance.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to unpack some of the complex effects of stress on forensic expert decisionmaking by drawing upon literature from related domains, such as cognitive psychology, medicine, policing, and management. First, we review how forensic experts process information and make casework decisions, including how cognitive and human factors, such as stress, can impact experts' decision-making processes. Then, we identify three factors (decision parameters, internal factors, and external factors) that are likely to affect how experts make inferences and conclusions under stressful conditions, with examples from different yet allied disciplines. Next, we consider how different types, levels, and contexts of stress may moderate these effects. Throughout the paper, we offer practical recommendations as well as suggestions for future research. Ultimately, we hope that this paper provides a basis for researchers and practitioners to continue advancing our understanding of how occupational stress impacts forensic expert performance, including ways to pre-empt and manage its negative impacts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">How stress influences forensic expert decision-making</head><p>Like all humans, forensic experts take in visual information <ref type="bibr">(e.g., bloodstains, fingerprints, toolmarks, and other patterns;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dror &amp; Cole, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Taylor et al., 2016</ref>) via a process called bottomup processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Bruner &amp; Goodman, 1947;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gregory, 1970)</ref>. In so doing, people do not typically process all the of information that is available to them simultaneously; instead, we process its constituent features sequentially until we reach some threshold for making a decision <ref type="bibr">(Dror &amp; Langenburg, 2019)</ref>. For instance, when an expert compares a latent fingermark and a reference fingerprint, they cannot process the entire fingerprint all at once; instead, they examine the features within those prints until they feel that they have detected enough similarities (or dissimilarities) to warrant a decision <ref type="bibr">(Dror &amp; Langenburg, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, a forensic expert may not necessarily examine all of the information contained within a trace before reaching a conclusion. This phenomenon is not unique to forensic experts and has been shown to occur across many domains (see Decision Field Theory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">1993</ref>).</p><p>After we absorb information via bottom-up processing, that information travels from the sensory organs (e.g., eyes) to the brain and cognitive system where we interpret it via a complementary process called top-down processing <ref type="bibr">(Dror &amp; Bucht, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kassin et al., 2013)</ref>. During this process, different people (or even the same person at different times) may evaluate and interpret the same information in different ways (e.g., notice different features and/or reach different conclusions about the same evidence; Dror, 2023) depending on their knowledge, experience, expectations, motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kassin et al., 2013</ref>)-and indeed, stress level <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Jeanguenat &amp; Dror, 2018)</ref>. Generally speaking, our reliance on top-down processing is adaptive. Because the brain does not have unlimited capacity to process information, top-down mechanisms serve as cognitive "shortcuts" to help us process large amounts of information more efficiently. For instance, when faced with a great deal of information at once, we use selective attention to process only the sensory information that is deemed most relevant based on our prior experiences, while ignoring other information that we expect to be less relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Kahneman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Saks et al., 2003)</ref>. In essence, then, the process of becoming an expert in any domain (including forensic science) entails acquiring more knowledge, training, and experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Morgan, 2017b</ref>) so as to gradually develop finely-tuned top-down mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Growns &amp; Martire, 2020)</ref> that improve performance beyond that of novices <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Busey &amp; Dror, 2011)</ref>. That is to say, experts develop heuristics (mental shortcuts, such as selective attention) that enable them to process information in a more automatic and efficient way and thus complete tasks more quickly and easily <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>However, the same top-down mechanisms that allow experts to process information very efficiently can also create vulnerabilities that increase the risk of misinterpretation-and in some cases, error <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Busey &amp; Dror, 2011)</ref>. One such vulnerability is cognitive bias, which refers to "the class of effects through which an individual's pre-existing beliefs, expectations, motives, and situational context influence the collection, perception, or interpretation of evidence, or their resulting judgments, decisions, or confidence" <ref type="bibr">(Spellman et al., 2022, p.5</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kassin et al., 2013)</ref>. For example, if a forensic expert begins an analysis with an expectation of what the result will be, they may experience "tunnel vision" <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Spellman et al., 2022)</ref>, such that they search for information that fits their expectation and ignore or disregard information that refutes their expectation, which can lead to a misinterpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Kerstholt et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, top-down mechanisms are useful to make efficient decisions, but they can also contribute towards subconscious bias and systematic errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kassin et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>To manage stress in the workplace, we must first understand how and why stress can influence forensic experts' decisions, so as to eventually increase awareness about potential stressors and their negative effects. Relatedly, being aware of the limitations of human decision-making can reduce the potential for a "bias blind spot" (wherein people recognise bias as a problem for others but not for themselves; <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Kukucka et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Pronin &amp; Kugler, 2007)</ref>, which presents a barrier to organizational change. In other words, greater awareness of bias in the forensic community stands to increase willingness to engage with workplace measures designed to mitigate bias and the negative impacts of stress. It is critical to emphasise that the aforementioned biases in how humans process information are natural, unintentional, and subconscious, and discussion of cognitive bias should not be confused with incompetence, carelessness, or intentional dishonesty <ref type="bibr">(Dror &amp; Cole, 2010</ref>; see also Dror, 2020, for a more comprehensive account of factors, including stress, that can unconsciously affect expert decision-making).</p><p>We hope that an enhanced understanding of bias and stress in forensic settings will also encourage researchers to carry out more empirical research on these phenomena and how to counteract them. While some sources of cognitive bias in forensic science are now relatively well understood, others-including sources of stress-remain more elusive. Take, for example, cognitive choice overload, wherein decision-makers who are faced with too many options may end up making a suboptimal decision, or no decision at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Buchanan &amp; Kock, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Chernev et al., 2023)</ref>. This phenomenon may prove applicable to forensic experts who are presented with myriad information and options with respect to a given forensic trace (e.g., case materials, discussions with supervisors, calls from investigators) and may thus be unable to process every single aspect in depth. Some researchers have started exploring other related factors, such as fatigue (e.g., making decisions in the afternoon vs. in the morning; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Busey et al., 2015)</ref>, but there remain many unanswered questions in this area as well, such as comparing forensic decisions made after a poor quality of sleep, or shift work vs. workday decisions, to name a few.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Three Factors Affecting Decisions under Stress</head><p>As explained in section 2.1, the impact of stress on performance is complex. In this section, we consider what happens at a cognitive level when forensic experts make decisions under stress. At the core of this process is the decision-maker-the forensic expert who performs forensic casework and analysis-whose decisions made under stress conditions may be influenced by three factors: decision parameters, internal factors, and external factors <ref type="bibr">(Dror, 2007</ref>; see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>Decision parameters pertain to the nature of the forensic decision itself. Examples may include the complexity of the task or evidence in question (e.g., examining mixtures of DNA from multiple contributors), ambiguity of the decision (e.g., having incomplete or degraded bullets for comparison), and the number of informative features therein (e.g., the type and number of minutiae that are discernible in a latent fingermark). All of these examples illustrate parameters that are related to the decision problem space itself. Forensic experts-as is true of all peoplehave limited cognitive resources to examine every possible feature or alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Kahneman, 2003</ref>)-but despite these limitations, they must nonetheless reach either a definitive (e.g., "exclusion") or non-definitive (e.g., "inconclusive") decision.</p><p>Internal factors include any personal or inherent characteristics of the decision-maker themselves that may play a role in their stress response (see Model of <ref type="bibr">Stress at Work;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cooper &amp; Marshall, 1976)</ref>, such as one's state or trait level of anxiety, tolerance to ambiguity, emotional state, or confidence level <ref type="bibr">(Dror, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Raptis et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Saposnik et al., 2017)</ref>. In one study, for example, researchers found that the introduction of stressors (i.e., time pressure and negative feedback) affected stress feelings of individuals with low and moderate trait anxiety, but not individuals with high trait anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Almazrouei et al., 2022)</ref>. Although decision parameters and internal factors are distinct, they also interact with one another <ref type="bibr">(Dror, 2007)</ref>. For instance, with respect to complex and time-pressured decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Helsloot &amp; Groenendaal, 2011)</ref>, such as collecting traces from ambiguous crime scenes <ref type="bibr">(de Gruijter et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">van den Eeden et al., 2019)</ref>, the very same stressors may have a more pronounced impact on forensic examiners who tend to be more averse to ambiguity (i.e., those who dislike events of unknown probabilities; Levy et al., 2010) as opposed to examiners with greater tolerance for ambiguity.</p><p>External factors pertain to the circumstances in which forensic experts work and make decisions.</p><p>These may include forensic-specific stressors (e.g., being exposed to horrific case details) as well as stressors that are not specific to forensic science (e.g., lack of career advancement). Time pressure, whether from investigators and/or supervisors, is another common external cause of stress among forensic experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Almazrouei et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Helsloot &amp; Groenendaal, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Zou et al., 2021)</ref>. Notably, external factors could also interact with both decision parameters and internal factors <ref type="bibr">(Dror, 2007)</ref>. For instance, time-pressure (an external factor) could make the same task more cognitively demanding (a decision parameter; Dror et al., 1999), and even more so for examiners who are less tolerant of ambiguity (an internal factor).</p><p>In turn, this combination of factors (decisional, internal, and external) could affect examiners' available cognitive resources and their decision thresholds in forensic pattern-matching tasks (e.g., comparing cartridge cases, handwriting samples, etc) or forensic recognition tasks (e.g., recognizing bloodstain patterns, examining/triaging items from crime scenes, etc.). As Thompson (2023) recently explained, even seemingly minor shifts in examiners' decision thresholds can have a significant impact on their performance:</p><p>"small shifts in forensic examiners' decision thresholds can dramatically affect their error rates and the probative value of their evidence, which can in turn affect the accuracy of the legal system. For example, small reductions in the threshold for identification, which might plausibly arise from an examiner's exposure to taskirrelevant information [which may include workplace stressors], can dramatically increase the risk of convicting an innocent person." <ref type="bibr">(Thompson, 2023, p.1</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Three factors that affect forensic expert decision-making. These include decision parameters (e.g., task complexity), internal factors (i.e., examiners' inherent characteristics), and external factors (i.e., elements of the environment in which the examiner works). These factors also interact with each other in ways that can amplify the effects of stress.</p><p>Each of these three factors offers a potential intervention point to assist and enhance forensic expert decisions. The first point of intervention may focus on decision parameters: For instance, forensic labs might triage traces that are relatively difficult to assess (like unclear handwriting or an incomplete shoe mark) for more intensive analysis (e.g., additional and/or blind verification) in a way that other less ambiguous traces are not (Dror, 2013; US Bureau of Justice Assistance, 2019). A second point of intervention may focus on the experts' state of mind: For example, training could incorporate realistic simulations that force experts to navigate ambiguous and challenging court testimony. This sort of practice with handling ambiguity builds tacit forms of knowledge that are learnt by doing <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Morgan, 2017b)</ref> and may increase confidence and resilience (especially among experts with lower pre-existing tolerance for ambiguity). Recruitment and selection procedures might also consider and prioritize candidates who are naturally better situated to cope with stress. A third intervention point may focus on the environment in which decisions are made: For example, forensic labs may benefit from measures that promote wellbeing and combat fatigue in the workplace, such as flexible schedules and employee wellness programs that focus on protecting employees' physical and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Busey et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Zou et al., 2021)</ref>. The examples offered here are not exhaustive; they are meant to illustrate the possible interventions (targeting three different points) that forensic service providers may consider, depending on their specific context and resources available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Type, Level, and Context of Stress</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Type of Stress and Forensic Decision-Making</head><p>Research suggests that some types of stressors can enhance decision-making in the workplace, while other types can degrade it. To explain, we will draw upon the Challenge-Hindrance Stressor Framework (CHSF; Cavanaugh et al., 2000)-a widely accepted and empirically-supported framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(LePine, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Podsakoff et al., 2023</ref>) that combines several work-related stress theories, such as the transactional theory of stress and coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref> and the conservation of resources theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. CHSF Part (I) acknowledges that we must consider how people react to and appraise work-related demands in order to understand the effect of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Cavanaugh et al., 2000)</ref>. Work-related demands that are perceived to contribute to personal development and/or achievement (such as reasonable time pressures and valued responsibilities) are considered positive or "challenge" stressors. Conversely, work-related demands that are perceived to interfere with professional development (e.g., role conflict, role ambiguity, office politics) are considered negative or "hindrance" stressors (LePine, 2022; <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Podsakoff et al., 2023)</ref>. This distinction is critical; not all stressors are negative, and there are potential benefits of challenge stressors. Unfortunately, some forensic science literature has perpetuated a uniformly negative view of stress. For example, the terms "stress-mitigation" or "stress-minimization strategies" might inadvertently suggest that workplace stress is always detrimental and must always be reduced (e.g., "management can take steps to mitigate this stress;" Busey et al., 2021, p.4; "providing multiple types of interventions to mitigate occupational stress;" Goldstein &amp; Alesbury, 2021, p.4). Instead, CHSF Part (I) recognizes that there might be occasions when increasing stress in forensic science workplaces may actually enhance rather than hinder expert performance. Indeed, a recent exploratory study found that experimentally increasing fingerprint experts' stress levels actually improved their performance on some fingerprint matching tasks, especially when the prints were 'difficult' <ref type="bibr">(Almazrouei et al.,</ref> Page of 44 2023). For this reason, we use the terms "stress management" or "stress optimization" in this paper to more appropriately capture the dual effects of stress. CHSF Part (II) explains that people often perceive the same stressors in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>. Situational factors (e.g., job content, supervisory support) as well as individual-level factors (e.g., tolerance to ambiguity, personality) moderate an individual's appraisal of stress (LePine, 2022), similarly to how both external and internal factors can affect forensic decisions, as discussed in Section 2.2. These moderating factors are critical in the forensic science context. For instance, a long-standing and widespread concern in forensic science is stress originating from having too large of a caseload <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Houck, 2020</ref>; National Institute of Justice, 2019), yet not all forensic experts-even those within the same laboratory-perceive this as highly stressful <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Almazrouei et al., 2020)</ref>. This suggests that there are individual-level differences in how forensic experts evaluate the same stressors, which warrants further investigation. Along these lines, preliminary studies have documented how higher-performing crime scene examiners tend to be relatively stress-resilient <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Kelty, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kelty &amp; Gordon, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">, 2015</ref>. In one study, for example, high performing crime scene examiners described their own strategies for managing stressors at work (e.g., using "black humour" to cope with unsettling situations, or using outside hobbies to disengage from work-related stress; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Kelty &amp; Gordon, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Once a person has appraised a stressor, CHSF Part (III) recognizes that several different mechanisms could explain how they respond to that stressor. One possible mechanism follows from the conservation of resources theory, which explains that people are motivated to reserve their time and energy for work tasks that matter to them <ref type="bibr">(Crawford et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Hobfoll, 1989</ref>).</p><p>According to this theory, individuals will work for longer hours and invest more energy in facing positive challenge stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Baethge et al., 2019)</ref>, if they feel that this additional work is likely to reap rewards in their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Porcelli &amp; Delgado, 2017)</ref>, such as positive feedback from supervisors <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Harper, 2022)</ref>. However, spending too many resources can have negative consequences. In one study, for example, police officers who faced very high levels of challenge stressors exhibited poorer wellbeing outside of work, such as difficulty 'switching off' during nonwork hours and poor sleep quality (Durham University, 2022). Hence, even positive "challenge" stressors can have negative effects when experienced in excess.</p><p>Similarly, experts can decide whether (or how deeply) to engage with any given task by considering whether it will be worth the energy that it will require-i.e., whether it will ultimately be rewarding (LePine, 2022). In forensic science, high profile or serious cases may have additional pressures and require more time and energy (Office of the Inspector General, 2006), but some published research suggests that fingerprint experts are especially motivated to work on high profile cases because they produce stronger feelings of contributing to justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Charlton et al., 2010)</ref>. In contrast, hindrance stressors-such as dealing with unsupportive supervisors <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Holt et al., 2017</ref>)-can cause disengagement and deplete resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Podsakoff et al., 2023)</ref>. Stress management strategies should therefore enable experts to replenish their resources when/if practically possible (e.g., by encouraging time off, flexible schedules, and/or limiting availability to designated working hours; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Giurge &amp; Bohns, 2021)</ref>, which should benefit experts' wellbeing and performance.</p><p>On that note, CHSF Part (IV) identifies two key outcomes of the stress-and-appraisal process, namely performance and well-being outcomes (LePine, 2022). In the forensic science context, performance would often include a consideration of the quality of decisions made, levels of engagement in forensic tasks, timely completion of cases, meeting ISO 17025 standards, and other pragmatic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Almazrouei et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dror &amp; Pierce, 2020)</ref>. However, effective strategies for optimizing performance may be less clear. For example, to address high casework pressures, some researchers have suggested that forensic science organizations could institute quotas on turn-around times for cases, which may enhance the performance of some experts by creating a "challenge" stressor-but it may lead others to cut corners to meet deadlines (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Busey et al., 2021)</ref>. Another related example is the reduction in turnaround times for DNA analysis that were reported after the closure of the Forensic Service Services in the UK, but at the same time there were serious concerns voiced about fewer DNA analysis requests, and the potential for evidence not being collected at crime scenes due to funding constraints (House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee, 2019). The point here is that simply mandating turnaround times or quotas (i.e., potentially challenge stressors) may well have unintended negative consequences.</p><p>The second key outcome, well-being, pertains to forensic experts' feelings of fatigue and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Slack, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Wood &amp; Michaelides, 2016)</ref>, which can affect their subjective happiness, job satisfaction, and sense of purpose <ref type="bibr">(Layard &amp; De Neve, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Wellbeing Movement, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Not surprisingly, there is ample evidence that work-related stressors can and do affect forensic experts' well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Holt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Holt &amp; Blevins, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Yoo et al., 2013)</ref>. In turn, an expert's wellbeing can affect their work performance, and vice versa (e.g., De Neve et al., 2023). To illustrate, one study showed that fingerprint experts terminated their search for minutiae more quickly if they were fatigued, suggesting that suboptimal well-being may lead to suboptimal decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Busey et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To summarize, the CHSF framework can help researchers and practitioners to develop and test effective ways to manage stress at work. Prior work has described primary, secondary and tertiary occupational stress management interventions <ref type="bibr">(Cooper &amp; Marshall, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Richardson &amp; Rothstein, 2008)</ref>. Primary interventions aim to identify and directly address sources of workplace stress, for example by redesigning job tasks or changing work shift hours. Secondary interventions aim to reframe how individuals perceive, react to, and/or cope with stress, such as participating in cognitive behavioural therapies, meditation, or other activities that encourage the development of effective coping mechanisms. Finally, tertiary interventions aim to manage severe and/or chronic impacts of stress, such as posttraumatic stress disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Schiro et al., 2023)</ref>, through measures such as prescription medication or counselling <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Lambert et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Richardson &amp; Rothstein, 2008)</ref>. In other disciplines, such as medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Smoktunowicz et al., 2021)</ref>, management <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Lambert et al., 2022)</ref>, and policing <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Patterson et al., 2014)</ref>, there is literature to suggest the efficacy of these and similar stress management interventions. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in the forensic sciences remains a promising and important area for future research, as most existing suggestions to manage stress and optimize decisionmaking are based on subjective outcome measures (e.g., professional opinions, past experiences, etc) rather than objective measures of job performance and/or satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Busey et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Jeanguenat &amp; Dror, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kelty et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Level of Stress and Forensic Decision-Making</head><p>In addition to the type of stress (i.e., positive/challenge vs. negative/hindrance), one must also consider how the level of stress may affect performance. Stress level can be considered to be a function of the number of exposures, frequency, severity, duration, or some combination of these (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Slavich &amp; Shields, 2018)</ref>, and the level of stress that an individual experiences has been shown to affect decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Raio et al., 2022)</ref>, and in turn, performance.</p><p>The Yerkes-Dodson law is a classic psychological model that posits an inverted U-shaped relationship between stress level and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Yerkes &amp; Dodson, 1908)</ref>, such that stress at work could enhance or hinder expert decision-making, depending on its current level <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Kowalski-Trakofler et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Paton &amp; Flin, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Yerkes &amp; Dodson, 1908)</ref>. According to this law, performance tends to be poor under very low levels of stress, and as the stress level increases, so too does performance, until it reaches some moderate/optimal level of stress, which has been called the "eustress stage" <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Quick &amp; Henderson, 2016)</ref>. At the eustress stage, performance is optimized because this moderate level of stress is motivating but not debilitating. For example, individuals under eustress are most likely to meet work-related deadlines <ref type="bibr">(Benson &amp; Casey, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Jeanguenat &amp; Dror, 2018)</ref>. In forensic science settings, this theory suggests the value of 'nudging' or otherwise incentivizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2009)</ref>  Working memory-i.e., the cognitive system that allows people to temporarily maintain and process a limited amount of information (e.g., remembering a person's phone number for enough time needed to dial it)-is thought to be a key mechanism through which stress levels affect cognitive functioning and performance (see Deligkaris et al., 2014, for a review). In one study, for example, police officers who had just completed a 10-day work cycle exhibited significantly lower scores on a working memory test compared to baseline measures, i.e., the first day of the twoweek work cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Gutshall et al., 2017)</ref>. Working memory plays a critical role in cognitive functions that facilitate performance, such as attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Baddeley &amp; Logie, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Deligkaris et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gutshall et al., 2017)</ref>, although the effect of stress on attention is not always straightforward (Deligkaris et al., 2014). On the one hand, some research has found that stress narrows attention (i.e., causes tunnel vision), leading decision makers to streamline their information processing in ways that focus more on central information and miss or ignore peripheral information that may be important nonetheless <ref type="bibr">(Dror, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Kowalski-Trakofler et al., 2003)</ref>. However, other research has found the opposite-that stress increases susceptibility to distraction by broadening one's attention span and focusing too much on peripheral/nonessential information <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Keogh &amp; French, 2001</ref>). Given these conflicting data, it may be the case that the effect of stress on attention depends on various contextual or individual factors, such as those described in Section 2.2. However, given that stress level can be operationalised in various ways (e.g., intensity, duration), it is important to note that acute stress (i.e., intense short-term stress) and chronic stress (i.e., longer-term in its nature) could impact decision-making in different ways. With respect to the latter, a recent study suggested that forensic science professionals experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at a much higher rate than the general US population <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Schiro et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>It stands to reason that the common symptoms of PTSD-such as difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, memory impairments, and apathy (e.g., Weathers et al., 2013)could interfere with decision-making and performance. These effects have been described in the contexts of policing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Lees et al., 2019)</ref> and nursing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Rodney et al., 2022)</ref>, amongst others.</p><p>Moreover, the formal diagnostic criteria for PTSD require direct or vicarious exposure to traumatic event(s), which explicitly includes "repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of traumatic event(s)" (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Accordingly, PTSD and its effects on performance may be a particular concern among field-based (rather than laboratory-based) forensic service providers, who tend to report higher levels of exposure to traumatic scenes, evidence, and other case material <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Levin et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Schiro et al., 2023)</ref>. Research in other domains has suggested effective ways to ameliorate (e.g., various psychotherapies; Stergiopoulos et al., 2011) or even pre-empt (e.g., trauma resilience training; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Arnetz et al., 2009)</ref> the negative effects of work-related trauma, and others have proposed protective measures for forensic experts specifically (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Almazrouei et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Harper, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Jeanguenat &amp; Dror, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Slack, 2020)</ref>, but the efficacy of these interventions remains to be tested.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Uncertainty: Ambiguity and Risk</head><p>Finally, the impact of stress may depend on the context in which it is experienced. Decision contexts vary in their levels of (un)certainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Levy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Morgado et al., 2015)</ref>: Sometimes the consequence of a decision is clear (e.g., paying $5 for a sandwich will result in having a sandwich), but other times the consequence is difficult or impossible to predict (e.g., gambling $5 in a casino which could result in a win or loss). Many forensic decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Georgiou et al., 2020)</ref> insofar as 'ground truth' (e.g., what actually happened at a scene, whether two fingermarks/cartridges actually belong to the same person/gun) is typically unknown. External sources of stress and uncertainty may therefore interact to affect decisionmaking. For instance, when working on a high-profile case, time pressure (an external stressor) might force a crime scene investigator to decide to collect some traces but not others, which will limit the scope of the analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Helsloot &amp; Groenendaal, 2011</ref>).</p><p>Individual differences in tolerance for uncertainty may also affect examiners' decisions <ref type="bibr">(Mannering et al., 2021)</ref>. Particularly relevant here is a form of uncertainty that behavioral economists call ambiguity <ref type="bibr">(Ellsberg, 1961)</ref>. In real-life situations where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the probabilities of the different possible outcomes are not typically known (as is the case with tossing a coin or rolling a die) but rather there is some ambiguity around their relative probability. A number studies have documented a trait called ambiguity aversion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Levy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Raptis et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Saposnik et al., 2017)</ref>, which also varies across individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Tymula et al., 2013)</ref>. It therefore stands to reason that some forensic examiners are naturally less comfortable with ambiguity than others.</p><p>Differences in ambiguity aversion may lead experts to make different decisions even with similar information and circumstances. That is to say, individual experts may gravitate toward decisions that are more conservative or more risky, especially in situations where they can anticipate the consequence of their decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Levy et al., 2010)</ref>. For example, deciding that a bullet found at a crime scene 'matches' a reference bullet (i.e., an identification) typically has a foreseeable consequence-i.e., correctly implicating the perpetrator or wrongly implicating another personthough importantly, the 'ground truth' is rarely ever known in such situations, which makes this a relatively risky decision. In contrast, 'inconclusive' decisions may be considered less risky because the outcome of those decisions is less clear <ref type="bibr">(Dror &amp; Scurich, 2020)</ref>. For that reason, differences in examiners' dispositional aversions to ambiguity and risk-which could be amplified under stressful conditions-may predict how often they reach inconclusive decisions. This is a critical point because, again, even very small fluctuations in an examiner's decision threshold can dramatically affect their performance (i.e., decision accuracy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Thompson, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Human decision-making also involves risk-taking under conditions of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Kerstholt, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Maule et al., 2000)</ref>. In the policing domain, for example, a police officer might decide to shoot a person who could be innocent, or might decide not to shoot a person who could then harm others <ref type="bibr">(Dror, 2007)</ref>. Risk-taking involves a complex equation of assessing different alternative choices and their consequences before making a decision, which has been called the "payoff matrix" <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Kornbrot, 1988</ref>; see also the three cognitive factors in Section 2.2). A similar risk-taking calculus may underlie forensic science decision-making; for example, <ref type="bibr">Dror and Langenburg (2019)</ref> suggested that fingerprint experts may opt for the less risky "inconclusive" decision because they are not typically subjected to peer review or challenged in courts, whereas identification decisions raise the possibility of disagreement and/or criticism. Examiners' tendency for conclusive rather than inconclusive decisions-and the role of stress therein-is an especially important consideration in light of ongoing debates over the use of inconclusive judgments in error rate calculations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dror &amp; Scurich, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Kukucka, 2022)</ref>, including the legal ramifications of such judgments and the question of whether should ever be considered "correct" or "incorrect" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Arkes &amp; Koehler, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Biedermann et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Biedermann &amp; Kotsoglou, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dror &amp; Langenburg, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Even within the same examiner, the same situation may produce different decisions insofar as research suggests that humans utilize two distinct decision-making systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kahneman, 2011)</ref>:</p><p>System 1, which is faster and more automatic/intuitive, and System 2, which is slower and more effortful/logical <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kahneman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Osman, 2004</ref>, who argues that these systems are two ends of a continuum rather than two distinct processes). This dualsystem model is helpful in understanding how stress affects human decision-making, including risk-taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Reyna, 2004)</ref>: For instance, decision-makers are more inclined to use System 1 when resources (e.g., time) are limited because it offers a fast and efficient decision based on familiarity and experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Kahneman, 2003)</ref>, but these decisions may be more idiosyncratic and therefore less consistent or accurate. Instead, decisions should ideally involve both systems because each system grants distinct benefits; in other words, decisions that incorporate both prior experience (System 1) and logical deliberation (System 2) are likely to be the highest-quality decisions <ref type="bibr">(Dror, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">The Environmental Context</head><p>Decision-making does not happen in vacuum, and stress can be dependent on the interaction between an individual and their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Epel et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Kelty &amp; Gordon, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>. Indeed, the role of context has recently been identified as a limitation to the Challenge-Hindrance Stressor Framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(LePine, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Podsakoff et al., 2023)</ref> insofar as the framework does not recognise that the same stressor may be a positive challenge stressor in some contexts, but a hindrance in others <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bakker &amp; Sanz-Vergel, 2013)</ref>. Identifying context-specific sources of stress can therefore result in policies that target specific stressors. For example, digital forensics experts appear to experience stress by virtue of their frequent exposure to distressing imagery in case materials (e.g., depictions of extreme violence, suicide, and child exploitation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Burruss et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Holt &amp; Blevins, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Sunde &amp; Dror, 2019)</ref>. Accordingly, laboratories might amend their standard operating procedures to limit the frequency and/or duration of examiners' exposure to especially unsettling materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Kelty et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to creating psychological distress, exposure to gruesome imagery has the potential to bias and undermine forensic experts' decision-making, as numerous studies have demonstrated (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dror et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Osborne et al., 2014)</ref>. For that reason, some have cautioned against showing potentially disturbing crime scene images to forensic experts unless those images are directly relevant to their decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Dror et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Lidén &amp; Almazrouei, 2023)</ref>. In some cases, the content of horrible images may be simultaneously distressing, potentially biasing, and potentially relevant to the examiner, which raises the question of whether the benefits of viewing the images outweigh the risks. To balance these concerns, examiners could follow a Linear Sequential Unmasking (LSU) approach <ref type="bibr">(see, Dror et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dror &amp; Kukucka, 2021)</ref>, wherein they review the information that is most directly relevant to their decision before considering other information that may be somewhat relevant, but also potentially biasing (e.g., distressing crime scene photographs). All the while, examiners using LSU should document their decisions, confidence in those decisions, and any changes to their decision for the sake of transparency (see also the forensic disclosure model; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Almazrouei, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Almazrouei et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>It is also relevant to consider the social context in which decisions are made. During casework, forensic experts communicate with and receive feedback from various parties <ref type="bibr">(e.g., judges, lawyers, ISO auditors, regulators, family, victims, etc.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Almazrouei et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dror &amp; Pierce, 2020)</ref>. Within the investigative domain, for example, forensic experts may communicate with law enforcement or attorneys to provide timely information on forensic science results <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Raymond &amp; Julian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Roux et al., 2012)</ref>. Interactions with different parties may generate different types of stressors (e.g., adversarial allegiance with lawyers <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Murrie et al., 2009)</ref> that may require context specific solutions. Approaches, such as Systems Thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Forrester, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Houck, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Midgley &amp; Lindhult, 2021)</ref> or Social Network Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Campana, 2016)</ref> may be helpful in better understanding such interactions. This is because these approaches suggest assessing the individuals (e.g., the forensic expert) in connection within the broader working context in which they operate, rather than in isolation.</p><p>It is also helpful to consider how such interactions, and thus stressors, have differential impacts on forensic scientists who are mainly working in the lab (such as, DNA examiners, fingerprint experts), as opposed to those who operate mainly in the field (such as, crime scene examiners) (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Levin et al., 2021)</ref>. Field-based practitioners might feel stressed from work shifts and the lack of ability to organize work-life schedules <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kelty &amp; Gordon, 2015)</ref>. In contrast, lab-based practitioners typically do not operate in work shifts, but they might have other stressors, like being expected to respond to communicate or engage with work-tasks after the 9am-5pm working hours (e.g., email urgency bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Giurge &amp; Bohns, 2021)</ref>). In the next sub-section, we will dig deeper into one important type of environmental interaction: the experts' interaction with technology at work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.1">Human-Technology Interaction</head><p>Forensic experts' work often requires them to interact with both common technologies (e.g., phones, emails, internet) and specialized technologies (e.g., DNA and forensic chemistry instruments, and Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)). While these technologies can surely improve the efficiency of communication, documentation, and analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kloosterman et al., 2015)</ref>, they may also prompt stress in other respects (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kelty et al., 2021)</ref>. In this section, we consider the potential for so-called "technostress" in forensic workplaces, which refers to the negative consequences of human-technology interactions on behavior and health <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Brod, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>"Technostress" occurs when overreliance on technology heightens cognitive demands on individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Berger et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Sellberg &amp; Susi, 2014)</ref>, and it can happen in any professional workplace, including forensic science. Notably, researchers have proposed interventions to address technostress in other domains (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Berger et al., 2023)</ref>, which may be suitable for adaptation to forensic science contexts. To be exact, researchers have identified four risk factors for technostress in the workplace that can be addressed, including information overflow, continuous partial attention, availability, and useability <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Sellberg &amp; Susi, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Information overflow refers to the possibility of forensic experts becoming overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information that they must receive and manage on a daily basis-for example, when frequent voicemail and e-mail messages produce a constant stream of work-task interruptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Waldhauser, 2019)</ref>. In forensic science, both the amount and type of information from technologies may contribute to overload, since (as noted above) forensic experts often experience secondary traumatic stress by virtue of their routine exposure to distressing messages and/or images <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Levin et al., 2021)</ref>. To date, the potential impact of such information has been considered more extensively in digital forensics <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Burruss et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Holt &amp; Blevins, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Seigfried-Spellar, 2018) than in other forensic science disciplines.</p><p>Continuous partial attention refers to employees' ill-fated attempts to manage multiple tasks simultaneously in an effort to improve performance-for example, by continuously checking and responding to emails while completing other tasks. However, multi-tasking in this manner tends to hinder focused attention to any given task (i.e., 'partial attention'; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Appelbaum et al., 2008)</ref>, such that overall performance suffers. In forensic science, this could manifest as an examiner unconsciously missing key details of a case report if they are trying to simultaneously attend to a second task (e.g., checking e-mails). However, this possibility has not yet been empirically tested in forensic science specifically.</p><p>Availability refers to the fact that technology (e.g., smartphones with e-mail access, virtual meeting platforms) has made it much easier for employees to remain in contact with their employers, such that employees are often expected to be virtually available even when they are not physically present and/or outside of traditional working hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Giurge &amp; Bohns, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Sellberg &amp; Susi, 2014)</ref>, which has blurred the once-clear boundary between work and non-work times (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Giurge et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Giurge &amp; Bohns, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Wood &amp; Michaelides, 2016)</ref>. To cope with this pressure, research has suggested that employees may opt to work longer hours (i.e., be more available) or work faster, but neither strategy was found to be effective, as the former decreased engagement while the latter increased irritation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Baethge et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, useability refers to the constant need to ensure that one's technological knowledge is upto-date by regularly learning new programs or instruments, which creates cognitive load.</p><p>Relatedly, switching from one technology to another can cause frustration and irritation, especially if the process is slow or lacks integration. There is already some evidence of this among digital forensic examiners <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Kelty et al., 2021)</ref>, who recommended "for agencies to explore whether digital forensic staff [and perhaps, experts in other forensic specialties] have the technology that they need to work effectively, and whether they have the capacity built into their workloads for regular upskilling, as digital crime becomes more sophisticated" <ref type="bibr">(Kelty et al., 2021, p. 6)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Path Forward</head><p>There is growing interest in the role of workplace stress in forensic science-and for good reason, given the aforementioned links between stress and performance. In this paper, we aimed to unpack the ways in which stress might affect forensic experts' decisions, draw upon literature from other domains to suggest ways to manage stress in forensic contexts, and draw attention to productive avenues for future research. However, it is also important to recognise that every workplace is different, and what is effective for one agency may not be ideal for another, depending on their cultures, contexts, and available resources. Below, we consider what forensic science stakeholders can do now to address the detrimental effects of stress, and we look ahead to other interventions that may be possible in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">What can be done now?</head><p>An important first step is for forensic science agencies to acknowledge that occupational stress can negatively affect experts' decisions and create undesired organisational costs if left unaddressed. To that end, it may be useful to reconceptualize stress not as an inevitable part of the job (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Webb et al., 2002)</ref>, but rather as a human resources matter that warrants continuous monitoring. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic prompted greater emphasis on flexibility and employee wellbeing, some private corporations (such as Google) had already begun taking research-based steps to pre-empt the negative impacts of stress in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Schaufenbuel, 2015)</ref>, and those agencies now provide a model for others to follow. Along these same lines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Roux and Weyermann (2020)</ref> argued that forensic science practitioners and researchers should learn valuable lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of preparing for challenges and designing effective workplace environments that protect experts' wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Roux &amp; Weyermann, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>To that end, some helpful resources for forensic practitioners and supervisors/managers already exist. For instance, the Forensic Technology Center of Excellence (2023) has compiled resources to raise awareness about occupational stress in forensic science and how to manage it (e.g., through webinars, podcasts and reports). In addition, the Office for Victims of Crime (2023) has issued a Vicarious Trauma Toolkit that includes resources for dealing with traumatic experiences from work-related tasks. In addition, interventions that have proven useful in managing workplace stressors in domains similar to forensic science (e.g., medicine and policing <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Lambert et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Lees et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Patterson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Richardson &amp; Rothstein, 2008</ref>) may be adapted for use in forensic science. Anecdotally, forensic laboratories that have implemented employee wellness programs-including elements such as healthy nutrition, yoga/fitness classes, social events, and/or flexible schedules-have lauded the benefits of doing so, and we hope that they will publicize their successes in this regard for others to emulate. The authors of this paper are also happy to provide access to any non-open-access journal articles on stress management interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">What can be done in the future?</head><p>Once there is widespread acceptance of the issue and motivation to address it, then policies to manage stress and thereby optimize decision-making will naturally follow. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> may prove useful to practitioners in considering interventions or policies to implement. Sweeping Organizational-level interventions (i.e., "primary" interventions) are likely to be helpful but they Page 23 of 44 may be met with resistance, so it is important to emphasise that even incremental changes can be beneficial. If it proves difficult to minimize work-related stressors (at least at first), then resources might be allocated to "secondary" interventions (e.g., stress management training, mindfulness techniques, peer support, etc) that do not require changes to existing procedures and are meant to help forensic practitioners better cope with stress. For environments that entail more intense and/or persistent stressors, "tertiary" interventions may involve contracts with counselling services to provide ongoing support to address vicarious trauma. Organizational-level ("primary") interventions target sources of stress, including both challenge and hindrance stressors. Individual-level ("secondary") interventions target reactions to stress, with the aim of encouraging positive appraisals and developing adaptive behaviours (e.g., coping strategies).</p><p>Regardless of the intervention, it is important to consider how stress can affect the decisions that forensic experts make-which is the goal of this paper. Although we have focused largely on the negative effects of stress, we reiterate that some degree of stress can be motivating <ref type="bibr">(Benson &amp; Casey, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Yerkes &amp; Dodson, 1908)</ref> and therefore enhance performance for some experts and/or under certain conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Almazrouei et al., 2023)</ref>. Hence, forensic science providers should take steps to ensure that their experts' work is appropriately challenging and valued, and perhaps incentivize or 'nudge' experts when/if appropriate, so as to promote optimal stress levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Relationships with managers/supervisors should be supportive so as to moderate the stress felt by forensic experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Harper, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Holt et al., 2017)</ref>. Indeed, having a supportive supervisor has been identified as a key organisational stress-optimisation strategies in the forensic science workplace: <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kelty et al. (2021)</ref> reported that supervisors could buffer stress by being proactive in necessary actions, such as becoming an integral part of the team, being flexible, not micromanaging, being knowledgeable on specific tasks and building mutual trust. It has also been suggested that managers should develop skills and abilities to be emotionally intelligent so that they can manage emotions and stress at an individual level with forensic experts (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Harper, 2022)</ref>. In such supportive environments, managers could adapt a human-centred approach rather than a task-centred one. Enhancing emotional intelligence may enable managers to actively listen and build confidence with forensic experts so as to manage their stress and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Harper, 2022)</ref>, which may result in enhanced performance on forensic science tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Conclusion</head><p>In some respects, the reality of crime labs may be different from what research is capturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Stout, 2023)</ref>, including the role of workplace stress and its influence on decision-making. We understand that resources, working cultures and stress factors vary across forensic science organisations, disciplines, and even individuals within the same organisation, and it is therefore difficult to recommend a one-size-fits-all solution. However, this heterogeneity should not discourage efforts to manage stress, which can be detrimental to the organisation (e.g., in terms of employee retention), the individual (e.g., experts' wellbeing), and the administration of justice more broadly (i.e., the quality of forensic decisions). Even seemingly small investments in managing stress are likely to reap benefits in these respects. We therefore call on researchers to further identify and evaluate specific stressors in forensic science contexts, with an eye toward developing practical and flexible interventions to address them. <ref type="bibr">Dror, I.
