<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a pervasive public health crisis that impacts individuals across the gender spectrum. Traditionally, IPV is conceptualized through a gendered lens, with men as the perpetrators and women as the victims. The current study explored the association between perpetrator/victim sex, prosecutor gender role attitudes, and prosecutorial decision-making in a case of alleged IPV. We hypothesized prosecutors with more traditional gender role attitudes would be more lenient, and this effect to be exacerbated in cases involving a female perpetrator. Criminal prosecutors across the U.S. (N = 94) completed the Male Role Norms Inventory-Revised and read case materials describing the alleged IPV between a heterosexual couple (e.g., arrest report, medical records). The victim/perpetrator sex was manipulated to involve either a female-(male victim) or male-(female victim) perpetrated IPV case. Results indicate gender role attitudes were not associated with prosecutorial decisionmaking. However, prosecutors perceived the violence as more serious and the perpetrator as more likely to reoffend when the perpetrator was male; further, they attributed more blame to the female victim. An interaction between perpetrator sex and prosecutor gender role attitudes indicates those with more traditional beliefs were more likely to blame the female (rather than male) victim. These data suggest extralegal factors related to the perpetrator (i.e., perpetrator sex), rather than prosecutor individual differences (i.e., gender role attitudes), are associated with prosecutor discretionary decision-making. In tandem with real-world disparities in the prosecution of IPV based on perpetrator sex, the current research stresses the importance of exploring a diversity of factors that account for these observed differences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Violence</head><p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive problem that impacts approximately one in three men and women in the United States at some point in their lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Smith et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the prevalence of IPV, it is likely underreported <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hart &amp; Klein, 2013)</ref> and underprosecuted, with some estimates suggesting less than one third of IPV sexual assault cases referred for prosecution actually result in criminal charges <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(O'Neal et al., 2015)</ref>. Although the discrepancy in IPV arrests and criminal charges is likely due to myriad factors, one avenue worthy of empirical investigation concerns prosecutorial discretion. Legal scholars and social scientists have long commented on the extensive discretion allotted to prosecutors and their role as "gate-keepers" in the criminal legal system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kerstetter, 1990)</ref>. With some notable exceptions, prosecutorial discretion is codified into law and generally goes unchecked. Although several studies have explored how extralegal factors such as victim and perpetrator characteristics relate to case outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kutateladze et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Romain &amp; Freiburger, 2013)</ref>, few studies have focused on specific prosecutor traits that may interact with case processing and outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceptions of IPV</head><p>Considering IPV is traditionally conceptualized as a 'gendered crime' 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Russell et al., 2009)</ref>, prosecutor attitudes regarding sex and gender roles may be of particular interest. IPV occurs in same-sex relationships at equal rates as heterosexual couples, and female-perpetrated IPV against males is more prevalent than conventionally believed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Archer, 2000)</ref>. Despite this, the conceptualization of IPV remains highly gendered <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Russell et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, research consistently shows that lay people perceive female-perpetrated violence as significantly less serious than violence perpetrated by males <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cox et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Poorman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Russell et al., 2015)</ref>. Further, violence involving female victims, compared to male victims, is typically deemed more serious and worthy of intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hamby &amp; Jackson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stanziani et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Erickson and colleagues (2017)</ref> found males are perceived as more blameworthy for their victimage, suggesting support for the schema of males as the abusers and females as the abused.</p><p>Although some scholars estimate up to 70% of reported IPV is bidirectional (e.g., individuals involved both experience and inflict violence; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Straus, 2008)</ref>, lay people rarely deviate from the male abuser/female victim conceptualization even when presented with bidirectional violence scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hine et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Some maintain the perceptions of victim/perpetrator sex discrepancies reflect a real-life difference in severity and harm inflicted (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Miller, 2001)</ref>. For example, police officers evaluated victim injury as much more severe in IPV scenarios depicting male-to-female violence than female-to-male violence <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Russell &amp; Sturgeon, 2019)</ref>. Such a perception aligns with findings from actual cases that men inflict a greater number of injuries, and women comprise a majority of victims of IPV-related homicides <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hamel, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kingsnorth &amp; MacIntosh, 2007)</ref>. However, research highlights the reality of women as primary aggressors or "co-abusers" in some heterosexual IPV incidences, with women more likely to use a weapon <ref type="bibr">(Kingsnorth &amp; McIntosh, 2007;</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Cox and colleagues (2022b)</ref> review the intricacies of this debate, highlighting both research supporting real-life differences as well as alternative theories and research. They conclude an inflexible approach to IPV conceptualization may act as a barrier to legal intervention that ensures the protection of all victims and execution of equal justice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender Role Attitudes and IPV</head><p>Variation in perception of IPV seriousness may also be due to individual beliefs of gender role attitudes and hegemonic masculinity. Hegemonic masculinity refers to traditional ideology of male role norms, such as the avoidance of femininity, endorsed aggression toward others, disdain for same-sex attraction, and pursuit of success and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Levant et al., 2007)</ref>. In contrast, women are expected to be compliant, sexually fragile, and unwaveringly nurturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Connell &amp; Messerschmidt, 2005)</ref>. Thus, an extreme extension of this ideology could include a demure, delicate woman subservient to an aggressive, domineering man. It follows that hegemonic masculinity is theorized to play a role in IPV justification. In a study of undergraduate men, <ref type="bibr">McDermott and Lopez (2012)</ref> found adult male attachment styles and IPV acceptance was mediated by gender role stress (i.e., rigid compliance with traditionally defined masculinity). A longitudinal study of college students extends the connection between gender role attitudes and actual perpetration of IPV; although traditional attitudes were significantly (albeit minimally) related to later perpetration of IPV, IPV perpetration was a stronger predictor of eventual traditional attitudes justifying violence <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Nabors &amp; Jasinski, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Research exploring explicit gender role beliefs and IPV cases primarily focus on college students and community members as "mock jurors." For example, Stanziani and colleagues (2020) measured traditional gender role beliefs and provided participants with a vignette describing a case of alleged IPV. Among the male community members, higher endorsement of hegemonic masculinity was related to lower ratings of crime seriousness. Further, those who espouse more traditional gender role attitudes may be more likely to rate an alleged case of IPV as less serious, attribute more responsibility to the victim, and justify the perpetrator's violence <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Erickson et al., 2017)</ref>. Sampling both Chinese and U.S. college students, <ref type="bibr">Lin and colleagues (2016)</ref> determined those who supported traditional, patriarchal ideology were less likely to deem certain behaviors abusive (e.g., throwing objects at a partner). Importantly, some researchers found gender role attitudes to be the largest explanatory variable for attitudinal responses to IPV, predicting IPV acceptance above and beyond factors such as religiosity, spirituality, and participant sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Erickson et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, <ref type="bibr">Cox and colleagues (2022a)</ref> investigated the interaction between victim sex and prosecutor implicit gender associations (using the Gender-Career Implicit Association Task [IAT]) on decision-making in a case of IPV involving opposite-sex and same-sex couples. The authors did not find an interaction effect and posited null findings may be a result of the measure's unsubstantiated predictive validity or the deliberative nature of prosecutorial decisionmaking (i.e., deliberative decision-making allows one to override their implicit biases). While research generally finds a positive correlation between implicit and explicit measures, some theorize deliberative processes may more closely align with explicit, rather than implicit, attitudes (see Greenwald and Lai, 2020 for a review).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prosecutorial Decision-Making in IPV Cases</head><p>While it is likely that prosecutorial decision-making in IPV cases is largely driven by the legal statutes regulating the criminal adjudicative process (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cox et al., 2022b)</ref>, there are innumerable factors that also influence these decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Messing (2014)</ref> reported police officers' decision to take the alleged aggressor into custody immediately following the IPV incident was significantly related to prosecutorial charging decisions, such that the likelihood that prosecutors filed formal charges increased six-fold. In addition, the presence of a weapon or severe victim injury may make criminal prosecution more likely <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Henning &amp; Feder, 2005)</ref>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, victim cooperation may serve as a key factor in prosecution. Qualitative data from attorney charge evaluation forms at one California District Attorney's office indicate prosecutors cited a lack of victim cooperation as a reason for declining to move forward with charges (O <ref type="bibr">'Neal &amp; Spohn, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The extant research on prosecution of female-perpetrated IPV is mixed. For example, in a study analyzing opposite-sex IPV in a southern U.S. city, nearly half of female-perpetrated IPV cases were rejected by prosecutors, a number significantly outweighing the rate for maleperpetrated IPV . This pattern emerges in other research, with prosecutors more likely to proceed with IPV cases involving male, rather than female, arrestees <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kingsnorth &amp; MacIntosh, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lantz, 2020)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr">Cox, Daquin, &amp; Neal (2022)</ref>, of which a subsample of data is used in the current study, certain points of prosecutorial decision-making were impacted by victim sex, such that when prosecutors read case files depicting IPV against a female, they were more likely to apply the most severe charge both initially and in plea bargaining.</p><p>However, other studies have found more punitive prosecutorial responses for femaleperpetrated violence. Specifically, <ref type="bibr">Henning and Feder (2004)</ref> reported women were more likely to use a weapon and, conceivably as a result, were more likely to be charged with a felony.</p><p>When finding that women were less likely to have their cases dismissed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Romain and Freiburger (2013)</ref> posited gender-inconsistent behavior (e.g., violence) as a factor for disparate prosecution.</p><p>Finally, prosecutor sex may be related to discretionary decisions in IPV cases. <ref type="bibr">Cox and colleagues (2021)</ref> presented 107 U.S. prosecutors with a vignette describing an alleged physical altercation between intimate partners. Researchers manipulated the sex and sexual orientation of the couple involved to explore if these factors are related to case processing decisions. Although manipulated variables were unrelated to charging and plea decisions, prosecutor sex predicted plea offer type, with female prosecutors 67% more likely to offer the harshest plea bargain, regardless of experimental condition. This is consistent with mock jury research indicating women are more punitive in IPV and sexual assault cases (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Devine, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of Diversity Related to the Reviewed Research</head><p>IPV conceptualization is often steeped in patriarchal ideology, which serves in its justification while simultaneously invalidating experiences of non-prototypical victims. Further, emerging research indicates IPV disproportionately affects those with traditionally underprivileged identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Whitfield et al., 2021)</ref>. As such, exploration of the factors that perpetuate IPV, particularly as it relates to legal responses, is important in its deconstruction.</p><p>Some of the reviewed literature actively incorporate the voices of those with underrepresented identities and/or aim to address differential legal responses based on these identities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stanziani et al., 2018)</ref>. However, a significant portion of the literature reviewed focuses on heterosexual, cisgender individuals and employs primarily White, educated samples (see <ref type="bibr">Cox et al.,</ref> in press for a discussion). Accordingly, the generalizability of the reviewed research to diverse populations is significantly limited (see Bent-Goodley, 2021).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study</head><p>Previous research suggests perceptual differences exist between male-versus femaleperpetrated IPV; however, studies typically utilize convenience samples of undergraduate students (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Seelau et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Poorman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">c.f. Stanziani et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stanziani et al., 2020)</ref>, resulting in limited generalizability to legal decision-making populations. Further, previous research has identified gender role attitudes as an important mechanism of IPV perception and justification <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Stanziani et al., 2020)</ref>. However, there is a dearth of data considering how explicit prosecutor gender role attitudes may relate to IPV case processing decisions. The present study investigated whether prosecutor gender role attitudes, as measured by the Male Role Norms Inventory -Revised (MRNI-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levant et al., 2007)</ref>, are related to prosecutor decision-making in a hypothetical IPV case of a heterosexual couple. We also considered if the interaction of prosecutor gender role attitudes and perpetrator sex (male vs. female) impacts decision-making. We hypothesized: H1: Participant MRNI-R scores will predict prosecutorial decision-making, such that higher scores will be associated with a lower likelihood of seeking a criminal indictment as well as associated with prosecuting under the least severe criminal charge and choosing the most lenient initial plea offer.</p><p>H2: There will be an interaction between perpetrator sex and gender role attitudes, such that higher MRNI-R scores will be associated with more leniency when the perpetrator is female.</p><p>Importantly, the direct effects of biasing information may be elusive when considering ultimate legal decisions but may be more pronounced when considering the attitudes and perceptions of the decision-makers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cox et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Neal &amp; Cramer, 2017;</ref>. Thus, consistent with previous research, we aimed to consider prosecutor perceptions of the crime, perpetrator, and victim to explore if these perceptions are associated with prosecutor gender role attitudes and perpetrator sex. We hypothesized: H3: Participants in the male perpetrator condition will perceive the act of aggression as more serious, the perpetrator as more likely to reoffend, and IPV (in general) as more serious. Participants in in the male perpetrator condition will also rate the victim as less blameworthy for the IPV for choosing to stay in the relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4:</head><p>Participant MRNI-R scores will predict perceptions such that higher MRNI-R scores will be associated with rating the aggression as less serious, the perpetrator as less likely to reoffend, and IPV (in general) as less serious. In addition, higher MRNI-R scores will be associated with rating the victim as more blameworthy for the IPV for choosing to stay in the relationship.</p><p>H5: There will be an interaction between condition and MRNI-R scores such that higher MRNI-R scores will be associated with ratings of the aggression as less serious, the perpetrator as less likely to reoffend, and IPV (in general) as less serious in the female perpetrator condition. In addition, for the female perpetrator condition, higher MRNI-R scores will be associated with rating the victim as more blameworthy for the IPV for choosing to stay in the relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>This study drew from a larger project focusing on implicit biases and prosecutorial decision-making. All study procedures were approved by our institution's non-medical Institutional Review Board. Materials and deidentified data for the larger project are available via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/bdtkv/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants included 94 attorneys currently working as prosecutors and recruited from all nine U.S. geographic regions. Consistent with the broader district attorney population in the United States, participants were mostly male (61.7%) and White (89.4 %; 5.3% Black or African American; 5.3% "Other"). Most participants identified as heterosexual (91.5%; 2.1% Gay/Lesbian; 4.3% Bisexual; 1.1% "Other") and married (72.3%; 14.9% Single; 5.3% Separated/Divorced; 7.4% Not married but in a committed relationship). Participants reported an average age of 40.44 years (SD = 9.09) and 10.21 years (SD = 8.67) working as a prosecutor.</p><p>Approximately 5% of participants identified as experiencing domestic violence and over half of all participants (53.2%) indicated that someone close to them has experienced domestic violence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Questionnaire</head><p>A questionnaire assessed participant demographic and background information.</p><p>Questions included participant demographics (e.g., sex, age, race, sexual orientation, relationship status), career information (e.g., "How many years have you worked as a prosecutor?"), and personal experiences with domestic violence (e.g., "Have you ever been the victim of domestic violence?").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Male Role Norms Inventory -Revised</head><p>The Male Role Norms Inventory -Revised (MRNI-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levant et al., 2007</ref>; current sample Cronbach's alpha = 0.97) assessed gender role attitudes. The MRNI-R is a 53 item self-report measure of traditional masculinity ideology. Example Likert-scale items include, "It is important for a man to take risks, even if he might get hurt," and "Men should be able to fix things around the house." In general, prosecutor self-reported gender role attitudes as measured by the MRNI-R (M = 2.28, SD = 0.85) are comparable to previous community samples (e.g., M = 2.65, SD = 0.15; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Levant et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case File</head><p>Prosecutors reviewed a file including documentation of an alleged IPV incident. To increase ecological validity, documents were created in consultation with a prosecuting attorney and included materials typically available to prosecutors when making charging determinations, including the arrest report, hospital records, statements from the victim and accused, and criminal history reports for the accused. Conditions were manipulated so that the alleged IPV was either perpetrated by a male (female victim) or a female (male victim) 2 ; apart from victim and perpetrator sex, stimulus materials were identical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criminal Statutes</head><p>Participants were provided with generic criminal code definitions including terms related to "Domestic Violence" (as labeled by the criminal statute), "Deadly Weapon," and "Serious Physical Injury." Participants also reviewed definitions and criteria for six different criminal statutes ranging in severity from Domestic Violence in the First Degree (Class A Felony) to Assault in the Third Degree (Class A Misdemeanor).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case Evaluation</head><p>Prosecutors indicated if they would proceed with charges and, if so, what criminal statute (Class C Felony, Class A Misdemeanor, etc.) they would apply. Prosecutors also indicated if they would engage in plea negotiations and what plea offer, from a list of three options, they may consider. Finally, participants responded to statements or questions to ascertain their attitudes regarding the case, perpetrator, and victim (e.g., "If the abused partner does not leave the relationship, they are somewhat to blame for the violence").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>Prosecutors were recruited via email and were vetted by the research team to determine eligibility. If eligible (i.e., practicing prosecutor in the United States), participants were given a limited version of the purpose of the study to control for social desirability effects. Specifically, potential participants were told researchers were interested in "prosecutorial decision-making in a case of alleged IPV." All study procedures took place remotely across two sessions, approximately 3-7 days apart. During the first session, participants completed the demographic questionnaire and MRNI-R, along with measures unrelated to the current study question. During the second study session, participants were randomly assigned to study condition (male-tofemale IPV or female-to-male IPV), reviewed the Case File and Criminal Statutes, and completed the Case Evaluation Form. Prosecutors were debriefed on the true purposes of the study and given the option to withdraw their data from the research study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Relationships between the control variables and each dependent variable were tested.</p><p>Participant sex was significantly related to some dependent variables and was included in analyses accordingly. Ordinal or binomial logistic regression analyses examined our hypotheses.</p><p>Notably, binomial logistic regression served as an alternative analysis when the assumption of proportional odds was violated; dependent variables were dichotomized into those who agreed versus disagreed, or those with moderate versus extreme responses. These levels were also collapsed due to a low n observed in some levels of the dependent variables, which produced low or zero cell sizes in the bivariate and multivariate analyses.</p><p>We hypothesized that MRNI-R scores would predict prosecutorial decisions. However, this hypothesis was not supported, as MRNI-R scores did not predict prosecutors' decision to press charges, the severity of charges, decision to offer a plea deal, or type of plea offered (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Hypothesis 2 concerned an interaction between gender role attitudes and perpetrator sex. This hypothesis was not supported, with nonsignificant models emerging for prosecutors' decision to press charges and engage in plea negotiations (both decisions to offer and the severity of plea offered; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Although the model assessing the initial charge severity decision was statistically significant, the interaction term was nonsignificant.   Note. Reference coding is male defendant/female victim condition (0) compared to female defendant/male victim condition (1).</p><p>Additional coding is available upon request. Reference coding is male defendant/female victim condition (0) compared to female defendant/male victim condition (1).</p><p>Additional coding is available upon request.</p><p>Results examining the impact of perpetrator sex and participant gender role attitudes on perceptions of the perpetrator, victim, and crime are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. Consistent with hypothesis 3, prosecutors were over five times more likely to rate the male-perpetrated IPV case as significantly more serious than the female-perpetrated IPV case. Similarly, prosecutors were about 4.7 times more likely to strongly agree that the male perpetrator would reoffend than the female perpetrator. However, in contrast to a priori predictions, participants were over 11 times more likely to agree (than disagree) that the female victim in the male perpetrator condition was blameworthy for the IPV for choosing to stay in the relationship compared to the male victim of the female perpetrator. No differences emerged regarding participant perceptions of the seriousness of IPV in general as related to MRNI-R scores.</p><p>We also hypothesized an association between MRNI-R scores and the attitudinal statements. In general, analyses did not support this hypothesis (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). However, MRNI-R scores predicted participant perceptions of victim blameworthiness should the victim choose to stay in the relationship, such that prosecutors with higher MRNI-R scores were nearly two and a half times more likely to blame the victim for the IPV if the victim chose to stay in the relationship.</p><p>Finally, we expected an interaction such that higher MRNI-R scores in the female perpetrator condition would be associated with lower ratings of aggression seriousness, lower ratings of the perpetrator's likelihood to reoffend, lower ratings of IPV seriousness (in general), and higher ratings of blameworthiness for the (male) victim than when compared to the male perpetrator (female victim) condition. As seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, this hypothesis was unsupported. Most models were nonsignificant; however, the interaction term between experimental condition and MRNI-R scores was significant for the attitudinal statement on partner blameworthiness for staying in the relationship. This result was in the opposite direction than hypothesized, such that participants with higher MRNI-R scores in the male perpetrator (female victim) condition were more likely to blame the female victim for staying in the relationship compared to prosecutors in the female perpetrator (male victim) condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the U.S. criminal legal system, prosecutors are necessarily afforded a significant amount of discretion in case processing decisions. However, such discretion could allow for attitudes and biases to influence decision-making. The purpose of the current study was to explore the association between explicit gender role attitudes, perpetrator sex, and prosecutorial discretion. With an exception for perceived victim blameworthiness, explicit gender role attitudes did not predict attitudes toward the case, victim, and perpetrator. It is possible that the MRNI-R is an inadequate measure for assessing the specific gender role beliefs pertinent in this context. Specifically, the MRNI-R focuses on traditional masculine ideology, with subscales measuring aggression, extreme self-reliance, dominance, and restrictive emotionality, among others. Other research has highlighted the complexities of measure selection when investigating gender role attitudes and IPV. For example, McDermott and Lopez (2012) found inconsistencies within their measure of gender role stress, noting only certain domains were significantly associated with IPV justification. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nabors and Jasinski (2009)</ref> posit particular forms of gender role traditionalism, such as benevolent sexism and chivalry, are negatively associated or unrelated with IPV justification. Indeed, the very nature of traditional masculinity as a construct may have complicated or obscured findings.</p><p>Alternatively, perhaps the MRNI-R is an appropriate measure of gender role attitudes, yet prosecutors are sufficiently able to attend to, and overcome, potential biases when engaging in legal decision-making processes. <ref type="bibr">Monteith and colleagues (2002)</ref> note that prejudice reduction is highly dependent on one's ability to monitor their response and consider how this response is, or is not, consistent with egalitarian goals. Thus, deliberative, thoughtful decision-making may allow prosecutors to engage in bias detection and challenge preconceived notions about gender roles and behaviors.</p><p>Another consideration is whether non-explicitly mentioned perpetrator/victim characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity) were associated with perception of the roles and expectations of the couple. Notably, the study did not specify the couple's race but utilized names with European origins. Some research employing White undergraduate students note the interaction between participant gender role attitudes and the race of the couple, such that traditionalists were less likely to perceive an incident as abusive and assigned less credibility to a Black, rather than White, victim <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Esqueda &amp; Harrison, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Willis et al., 1996)</ref>. Accordingly, it is possible the results represent prosecutor's ability to attend to and overcome gender role biases specifically as this pertains to White couples.</p><p>Consistent with previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cox et al., 2022a)</ref>, prosecutors perceived maleperpetrated IPV to be more serious, such that prosecutors rated the male perpetrator as more likely to reoffend and the IPV in this condition as more aggressive. These perceptions are unsurprising; traditional characterizations highlight IPV as a "gender-based" phenomenon that occurs between abusive men and victimized women <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Russell et al., 2009)</ref>. Further, although researchers estimate female-perpetrated IPV occurs at higher rates than traditionally presumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Archer, 2000)</ref>, women make up only a small minority of all IPV arrests (National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 2020), suggesting prosecutors are more likely to have experience with male IPV perpetrators. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hamby and Jackson (2010)</ref> argue gender asymmetry may be one explanation for the differential treatment of IPV perpetrators. Specifically, men are typically perceived to be physically stronger than women, and men perpetrators may inflict greater injury on women victims <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kingsnorth &amp; MacIntosh, 2007)</ref>. Further, some posit that most women IPV perpetrators act in self-defense, and some research suggests women are more likely to be dually arrested (i.e., arrested alongside a partner also believed to be an aggressor; . Miller <ref type="formula">2001</ref>interviewed criminal legal professionals and social service providers regarding their experiences with IPV cases and determined gender biases may, at least in part, explain differential arrest rates. Notably, participants in the current study did not differ across conditions regarding their perceived seriousness of IPV in general but viewed the case file with a male perpetrator as significantly more serious than when a female perpetrator was presented. This suggests prosecutors may demonstrate objectivity when thinking abstractly but are subject to biases when attending to actual cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>These data should be considered within the context of study limitations. Although recruiting acting prosecutors allowed for greater external validity, this population is generally difficult to access. The sample size was likely sufficient to test group differences across conditions but may not have allowed enough statistical power to detect interaction effects. Power concerns were particularly striking when additional variables (i.e., participant sex) were included in analyses as covariates. We conducted an a priori power analysis for the larger study; however, this research question was developed subsequent to data collection and post hoc power analyses are problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zhang et al., 2019)</ref>. As such, future research exploring interactions between prosecutorial attitudes and perpetrator sex in IPV cases is warranted.</p><p>As Sales and Krauss (2015) note, methodologically rigorous psychological research is largely absent from the prosecutor decision-making research. As such, we recruited participants via email solicitations and via a "snowballing" approach. However, the response rate (~3% of those contacted to participate in the study) was somewhat lower than rates reported in similar studies (e.g., 9%; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cox et al., 2021)</ref>, and participants with particular interest in prosecuting IPV may have self-selected into the study. Relatedly, we did not assess participant experience with prosecuting IPV cases. It is possible that prosecutors with more experience, perhaps via domestic violence units within the district attorney's office, may handle cases differently. Thus, the extent to which these data are generalizable is an area for future investigation.</p><p>Generalizability concerns further present themselves when turning to sample characteristics. The majority of the sample were White, heterosexual males whoby nature of the jobwere highly educated. While this largely reflects the observed demographics in U.S. states reporting prosecutor demographics, the American Bar Association (ABA, 2020) reported increased representation in prosecutors from various gender identities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, and races within the past decade. Yet, there remains drastic underrepresentation when compared to census data. In addition to a lack of diversity within our sample, how the sample conceptualizedand accordingly processed -IPV cases may similarly lack diversity. The case involved a heterosexual couple with European-originating names, which may have primed prosecutors to perceive the couple as individuals with traditionally privileged backgrounds (e.g., White, non-Hispanic; see <ref type="bibr">Cox et al., in press)</ref>. As such, this study may not generalize to how prosecutors perceive, process, and ultimately prosecute cases with couples with historically marginalized identities. As those with minority identities are disproportionately impacted by IPV <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lipsky et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Whitfield et al., 2021)</ref>, this is particularly limiting to the application of the present findings.</p><p>Another notable limitation concerns the artificial nature of the outcome variables.</p><p>Specifically, after determining whether to proceed with charges, prosecutors were given a list of statutes and statutory definitions. However, many jurisdictions provide flexibility in case processing; the prosecutor has many tools in their toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buzawa &amp; Buzawa, 2003)</ref>. For example, deferred prosecution is a contract between the perpetrator and prosecutor's office outlining specific requirements the perpetrator must meet (e.g., mental health treatment, restitution). Typically, if a perpetrator successfully completes the requirements during a specific period of time, charges are dropped. This toolbox varies by jurisdictional statutes, community resources, and prosecutor office culture. As such, it is unknown the extent to which these data generalize to jurisdictions with multiple avenues for case processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Directions</head><p>The current study is part of a small yet necessary research base on legal decision-making within prosecutor offices. These data are generally consistent with decades of jury decisionmaking research concerning the importance of victim sex in cases of IPV and sexual assault (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Devine, 2012)</ref>. However, recent investigations of prosecutorial decision-making specifically (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cox et al., 2021)</ref> are less definitive. Future studies should incorporate other measures of gender role attitudes to understand how different facets of gender roles (i.e., traditionalism) may interact with prosecutorial decision-making in cases of IPV. Further, in agreement with pleas from Greenwald and Lai (2020), we believe understanding the relationship between implicit and explicit measures, as well as the pipeline of biases to behavior, are critical areas for future research particularly relevant to prosecutorial decision-making.</p><p>Research on prosecutorial decision-making and IPV are both inherently nuanced; prosecutors are afforded discretion, allowing for necessary consideration of contextual information when processing individual cases. These individual cases also include their own idiosyncrasies, background information, and nuance. As such, future empirical research should focus on parsing out what contextual factors most influence prosecutorial decision-making. For example, weapon use, victim injury, and victim cooperation may be of particular interest (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Henning &amp; Feder, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">O'Neal et al., 2015)</ref>, while sexual orientation may be more futile (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cox et al., 2021)</ref>. Necessarily, studies should sample prosecutors from diverse backgrounds and curate study materials to include perpetrator/victim identities representative of those most impacted by IPV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The current study is a necessary extension and replication of legal decision-making research, which primarily utilizes convenience samples of undergraduate students to act as legal decision-makers. Importantly, these data suggest prosecutorial gender role attitudes do not impact discretion, whileconsistent with research including mock legal actor samplesprosecutors generally perceived male-perpetrated IPV as more serious <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Poorman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Russell et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stanziani et al., 2018)</ref>. Such attitudes could have substantial consequences as prosecutors wield enormous power to determine case outcomes (i.e., the severity of charges the perpetrator will face, the opportunity to plea to a lesser charge), yet, the mostly null results regarding gender role attitudes highlight the need for more research with active prosecutors to understand what factors influence their decision-making.</p></div>
