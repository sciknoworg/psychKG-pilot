<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction Intersession Processes in Psychotherapy</head><p>The effect of a session of psychotherapy should extend beyond the duration of the session.</p><p>This basic statement is independent of the theoretical orientation of the therapist, the treatment goal or the individual problems of the patient. If one compares the time a patient spends in the sessions with the remaining waking time, it quickly becomes clear how important the processes indicating therapeutic change between the sessions should be. Thus, the terms "Intersession process" (ISP) or "Intersession experience" (IE) were proposed for the description of these phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Orlinsky, Geller, Tarragona, &amp; Farber, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schr√∂der, Wiseman, &amp; Orlinsky, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The psychometric structure of ISP was studied in two independent samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hartmann, Orlinsky, &amp; Zeeck, 2011)</ref> using the "Intersession Experience Questionnaire" (IEQ, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Orlinsky &amp; Tarragona, 1986</ref>). The IEQ makes it possible to describe and measure ISP in a comprehensive form.</p><p>ISP cover a wide range of cognitive, behavioral and emotional processes related to current psychotherapy. For example, patients can recall the contents of their last session or reflect on possible contents of the next session. At the behavioral level, ISPs include attempts to implement therapy content in practice. On the relationship level, a desire for contact with the therapist can develop between sessions. These dimensions of content can in turn be of different emotional valence and occur in different situations. ISP have been shown to predict treatment outcome in studies using weekly pre-session IEQ measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hartmann, Orlinsky, Weber, Sandholz, &amp; Zeeck, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">A. Zeeck et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Almut Zeeck &amp; Hartmann, 2005)</ref>. Because at least some aspects of ISP are reported by more than 90% of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Orlinsky et al., 1993)</ref>, they may be well suited to monitoring the course of therapy not only in terms of expectations of success. In ongoing therapies, they could also be an appropriate goal to adapt interventions without relying on symptom-focused techniques. Currently, there are no empirical studies on the complete absence of ISP. Although it is rare, there may be patients who do not report any form of ISP. The reasons for this may vary depending on the stage of therapy and the method but are probably related to the patient's detachment from their therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New approaches in modeling individual data</head><p>Proponents of psychology as an idiographic science argue that a large proportion of phenomena -processes -studied in psychology cannot be examined on the group level <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Molenaar, 2013</ref>). These processes have been shown to be not homogenous, meaning that their correlational structure is not uniform across individuals. Processes also show changes in mean and variance over time, further complicating group-level study designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Molenaar, 2004)</ref>. These properties violate the assumptions of group-level study designs. Instead, small-N designs or case studies were proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fisher, Medaglia, &amp; Jeronimus, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Molenaar, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Smith &amp; Little, 2018)</ref> including statistical methods that adequately model intraindividual variation.</p><p>The treatment of mental disorders, including psychotherapy, psychiatry or clinical psychology, can profit from this person-based approach as well. Statistical methods can be applied to individual psychometric data, like questionnaires administered via mobile devices (ecological momentary assessment, EMA) daily, or even several times a day <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fisher, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Molenaar, 1985)</ref>. This way, insights with high ecological validity about an individual's psychopathology can be gained and used for treatment. Time-series models can reveal which symptoms influence other symptoms, so that the "root cause" of a disorder can be targeted directly using personalized interventions. Although the utility of various parameters of network models for targeting interventions has been disputed from a methodological point of view (Fried, 2017), a small number of studies investigated the use of individual time-series models, including network models, in interventions <ref type="bibr">(Epskamp, van Borkulo, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kroeze et al., 2017)</ref>. One possible application would be the assessment of symptoms before treatment onset, so that information from individual time-series models can be used for tailoring treatments, as proposed und the name "dynamic assessment treatment algorithm" (DATA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fernandez, Fisher, &amp; Chi, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fisher &amp; Boswell, 2016</ref>). This approach works by grouping symptoms by using factor analysis and then modeling their temporal dynamics with multivariate time-series analysis. Using coefficients from these models, information about how symptoms influence one another can be derived, offering possible information on which symptom to target first.</p><p>Another method of analyzing complex data is network analysis. It has been used to study mental disorders as network structures of interacting symptoms. First proposed and later refined and extended by <ref type="bibr">Borsboom (2008</ref>, the "network theory of mental disorders" proposes that mental disorders are best understood as networks of interaction between different components (i.e. symptoms) that are linked thorugh direct causal connections. The theory also states that certain symptoms have stronger connections in the network and that some symptoms can be grouped together in communities. Various applications in psychopathology were reported, like a network analysis of depressive symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory <ref type="bibr">(Bringmann, Lemmens, Huibers, Borsboom, &amp; Tuerlinckx, 2015)</ref>, social anxiety disorder <ref type="bibr">(Heeren &amp; McNally, 2017)</ref> or post-traumatic stress disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(McNally, 2017)</ref>. When applied to large, cross-sectional datasets, network models of DSM-IV symptoms, network models provide insights into comorbidity between psychiatric disorders on the population level (Boschloo et al., 2015).</p><p>However, as other methods that have been introduced here, network analysis is not limited to cross-sectional data. If applied to individual time series, network analysis can offer insights into the dynamic structure of psychopathology. In ongoing treatments, personal network models have been studied as a means of psychoeducation and as a feedback tool for clinicians. One case study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kroeze et al. (2017)</ref> reported that a personalized network motivated a treatment-resistant patient suffering from anxiety and depression to undergo an exposure intervention. A graphical representation of the model was used to educate the person about body discomfort being the probable root cause of her problems. David, Marshall, Evanovich and Mumma (2017) derived a network structure for a patient suffering from major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder, which revealed the underlying functional relations of the client's disorder. The authors showed that tension, worry and trouble concentrating were important in this network, leading them to suggest muscle relaxation and mindfulness exercises.</p><p>Recently, a new interpretation method called "bridge expected influence" (BEI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jones, Ma, &amp; McNally, 2017)</ref> has been proposed for network models. It was developed to identify "bridges" linking communities of nodes in networks. For example, a study on complicated grief symptoms and posttraumatic growth identified the item indicating a "change of worldview due to loss" as a bridge node between both communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bellet, Jones, Neimeyer, &amp; McNally, 2018)</ref>. In this study, BEI will be used to identify aspects of ISP that are linked to symptom stress. This offers a convenient method to interpret patients' intersession engagement with session content. A positive process-symptom BEI indicates that increased symptom stress and ISP co-occur. For example, a positive BEI for remembering events from last session would indicate that higher scores for this item positively influence symptom stress. Conversely, a negative BEI for imagining a dialogue with the therapist means that this item scores lower on days with higher symptom stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current issues in process monitoring</head><p>Human change processes are non-ergodic. This means that intraindividual variation of these processes over time is different from interindividual variation across persons <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Molenaar &amp; Campbell, 2009)</ref>. In non-ergodic psychological processes, the underlying models are not homogeneous: they vary greatly from person to person. Moreover, they are not stationary, so their statistical characteristics change over time. In non-ergodic psychological phenomena, traditional statistical research methods working at the group level often reach their limits. It has also been argued that human change processes are characterized by non-linearity <ref type="bibr">(Schiepek et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Input and output in a non-linear system are not proportional to each other. The future behavior of a non-linear system cannot be predicted with high accuracy. New idiographic methods and modeling approaches therefore continue to face the challenge of sudden changes in system dynamics <ref type="bibr">(Schiepek, Heinzel, Karch, Pl√∂derl, &amp; Strunk, 2016)</ref>. In EMA-based monitoring, one main advance has been made by Schiepek and colleagues by offering clinicians a comprehensive software solution called "Synergetic Navigation System" (SNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Maurer, Aichhorn, Leeb, Matschi, &amp; Schiepek, 2010)</ref>. In inpatient settings, this method reached good compliance values for patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schiepek et al., 2016)</ref>. The SNS enables researchers to administer web-based questionnaires on a regular basis. The questionnaires are automatically scored and the results displayed graphically so that the clinician can evaluate them conveniently. Regular feedback discussions with the patient are an integral part of SNS-based monitoring. The data from the daily surveys are interpreted by the patient himself, while the therapist is mainly involved in assisting the patient in structuring their interpretation. SNS-based feedback and the accompanying treatment procedure proposed by the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Schiepek, Eckert, Kravanja, Wallot, &amp; Haussmann, 2014)</ref> is greatly based on the theory of synergetics. Thus, it offers various ways to analyze the recorded time-series using non-linear methods. However, it is unclear whether therapists who work with SNS use the synergy-based functions (recurrence plots, dynamic complexity) of SNS in their daily clinical practice, or use the daily records rather "atheoretically", like a therapy diary.</p><p>One methodological challenge in the application of these methods in everyday clinical methods is how to enable clinicians to utilize these feedback tools. A recent assessment of attitudes towards process monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kaiser, Schmutzhart, &amp; Laireiter, 2018)</ref> showed that only roughly one third of psychotherapists are willing to use process monitoring in their clinical practice. Therapists were particularly concerned about the workload for patients, as daily questionnaires could burden them. Most often, however, it was stated that the interpretation of process data was too complex to be introduced into everyday clinical practice. This objection is not unjustified: therapy process data are multivariate, non-linear time series. Their analysis requires complex statistical procedures. The use of process monitoring could probably be facilitated if monitoring systems process the complex data in such a way that clinicians can understand it independently of their theoretical orientation.</p><p>This should be done without the system making too strong specifications, which render the clinical experience of the practitioner a secondary matter. Network models could be a promising candidate, as they are relatively easy to interpret visually, interpretation aids like centrality are readily available and they can be used independent of a clinician's theoretical approach to psychotherapy.</p><p>The theory of intersession processes was directly derived from ambulatory clinical practice and is well-established through decades of theoretical and empirical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Stewart &amp; Schroder, 2015)</ref>. In this study, we combine new methods of intraindividual dynamic network analysis and a theoretical framework that can be used to describe the degree to which patients are engaging in therapy between their sessions. According to the theory behind ISP, patients form mental representations of their therapy over time. Recurrent activation of these representations between sessions can occur due to a variety of reasons, but were reported to occur most frequently during periods of painful affect and conflict . Thus, it can be expected that ISP and symptom stress covary to some degree. However, this finding was reported based on cross-sectional data that is unfit to represent individual cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals and Aims</head><p>In this paper, we try to validate the classic, cross-sectional finding that ISP and increased psychological distress covary. For this purpose, we will conduct idiographic assessments of short symptom scales and intersession process scales with high (i.e. daily) temporal frequency. Second, we examine the utility of combining high-frequency assessment of ISP and symptom stress with current methods of network modeling as a means of intraindividual data analysis that is fruitful for psychotherapy process research. In this study we will explore the dynamics between intersession processes and symptom load in order to take the first step for future monitoring applications. To achieve this, we demonstrate a method of moving-window network analysis that focuses on the within-person correlations between intersession process and symptom stress. Monitoring of networks that change over the course of therapies has already been suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">David, Marshall, Evanovich and Mumma (2017)</ref>. As a first demonstration of possible monitoring applications, we will demonstrate a moving-window technique of idiographic network analysis to show the change of process-symptom-connections over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment and participants</head><p>All patients were treated in the outpatient clinic of the University of Salzburg. During admission, they received information about the planned study. Treatment was delivered in a manualized form of transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy of emotional disorders ("Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emtional Disorders", <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barlow, 2011)</ref>. The diagnostic instruments at admission and termination included the structured clinical interview MINI-DIPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Margraf, 2013)</ref> and the Hamilton rating scales for anxiety and depression (HAM-A, HAM-D, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hamilton, 1959</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamilton, , 1960</ref>. All participants fulfilled diagnostic criteria for either depression, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or combinations of those. The exclusion criteria were current substance dependency, bipolar disorder, acute suicidality or psychosis. Treatment length was between eleven and 35 weeks with variations due to number of treatment sessions, vacations or rescheduled sessions. Raw scores for HAM-A and HAM-D at intake and after treatment will be reported. We calculated reliable change index (RCI) scores using coefficient alpha and standard deviations reported for German samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Maier, Buller, Philipp, &amp; Heuser, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Maier, Philipp, &amp; Gerken, 1985)</ref>. For HAM-D, a coefficient alpha of .73 and a standard deviation of 6.95 was used, resulting in a change of 9 points or more to be considered reliable. For HAM-A, an ICC of .74 and a standard deviation of 16.08 was reported, so that a change of 17 points or more will be considered reliable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily assessments</head><p>Network models were fit to item-level time series. Depending on the diagnosis of the patient (depression, generalized anxiety disorder and/or social anxiety disorder), patients received one or more brief symptom scales. Additionally, a short intersession process scale was used to measure therapeutic processes. PHQ-9. For daily measurement of symptom stress, we decided to use a well-validated measure of major depression <ref type="bibr">(Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001</ref>). This nine-item questionnaire was used successfully in previous studies with similar settings <ref type="bibr">(Burns et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Torous et al., 2015</ref>). The PHQ-9 was scored according to the two-factor structure reported by Guo et al. <ref type="formula">2017</ref>, who found an affective and a somatic component to be of ideal fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GAD-7.</head><p>For daily assessment of anxiety symptoms, we used another short measure, the GAD-7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; L√∂we, 2006)</ref>. Just like the PHQ-9, the GAD-7 was shown to be of good psychometric quality regarding its reliability and validity. It consists of seven items that follow the DSM-IV criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, even though it has successfully been used with other anxiety disorders as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, Monahan, &amp; L√∂we, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAD-D.</head><p>For social anxiety symptoms, we used a ten-item severity measure based on DSM-5 criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Knappe et al., 2014)</ref>. This scale assesses cognitive, behavioral and affective symptoms of social anxiety disorder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Intersession Process Scale (SIPS).</head><p>The SIPS is a short scale with ten items for assessing various aspects of intersession processes in psychotherapy . The SIPS was developed specifically for ambulatory assessment studies on intersession processes. The items of the SIPS were selected so that they convey enough meaning in single-item interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>All daily assessments were conducted using the assessment module of the DynAMo software package <ref type="bibr">(Kaiser &amp; Laireiter, 2017)</ref>. Data was transmitted over a secure connection and saved to an online storage only accessible to the authors. All items in daily measures were assessed on a 0 to 100 visual analog scale. Patients received text messages including a personalized URL every 24 hours. Messages were sent out between 5 and 10 pm. The exact time was the patients' choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network modeling</head><p>Data preparation. All time series were tested for linear trend components using the KPSS test <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, &amp; Shin, 1992)</ref>. The KPSS test is used for testing the null hypothesis that a time series has a linear trend component. Time series that have trend components violate the assumptions of the statistical approaches used in this study. Thus, linear detrending was applied in the case of a significant test result before calculating the correlation matrix. If a patient missed their daily assessment or the delay was so large that they filled out the questionnaire after midnight, this resulted in unequally spaced time series. To correct for this, we applied cubic spline interpolation. If the delay was larger than 24 hours, this day was treated as missing.</p><p>Network estimation. We used the R-package qgraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Epskamp, 2018)</ref> to estimate contemporaneous network structures of intersession process and symptom scores. We estimated regularized partial correlation networks using the EBICglasso procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Epskamp, Borsboom, &amp; Fried, 2017)</ref>. Partial correlation networks indicate how strong the relationship between two variables is after the influence of all other variables has been controlled for. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was applied to reduce the false-positive rate. This procedure reduces small edge weights to zero. Shrinkage parameters are chosen so that the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) is minimized. In simulation studies this method was shown to reduce the false-positive rate of connections in networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Epskamp, Waldorp, M√µttus, &amp; Borsboom, 2016)</ref>. Thus, EBICglasso can be seen as a conservative approach to model estimation when data are sparse. To further minimize the false-positive rate, we employed a thresholding rule recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jankova and van de Geer (2018)</ref>. Under this rule, weak edges in the network are set to zero, enforcing high specificity. We computed a network density coefficient for every patient's network. Network density is the fraction of the number of edges in a patient's network divided by the total number of edges that would theoretically be possible in the network.</p><p>Graphical representation. Networks contain nodes (symptom and intersession process items) and edges (contemporaneous correlations between scores). In the network graphs, nodes are connected by edges of varying thickness. The thicker an edge, the higher the partial correlation coefficient between two items. Blue edges indicate positive correlations while red egdes indicate negative correlations. Nodes are placed using the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fruchterman &amp; Reingold, 1991)</ref>. This algorithm places more strongly connected nodes closer to each other and nodes with stronger connections more to the center of the graph. This allows easy visual interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Centrality. Interpretation of network models is facilitated by various measures of centrality.</head><p>These measures are good indicators for determining the relative importance or influence of specific nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Epskamp, Borsboom, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Epskamp &amp; Fried, 2016)</ref>. This is helpful for interpretation, as they summarize multiple connections of a node into one measure. In non-directed networks, three main indicators of centrality are generally used: betweenness, closeness, and strength. Betweenness indicates the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes, thus "relaying information" between those nodes. Strength is the sum of absolute edge weights of a node, which shows how strong the influence of this node in its network is. Closeness is the reciprocal of the sum of shortest path lengths between a node and all other nodes. Bridge expected influence will be estimated to get quantitative indicators for the strength of connection between intersession processes and symptom stress.</p><p>Moving window centrality analysis. Since a large amount of data was available for one patient, we chose this for the illustration of the moving-window technique. Using the methods described above, a series of network models for windows of analysis with the size of 100 time points will be calculated for this patient's data set. This means that we estimate network models for time point 1 to 100, point 2 to 101, 3 to 102, and so on. Average BEI values will be calculated for each of the models, resulting in a series of BEI values. This way we can demonstrate how the strength of the bridges between process and symptoms changes over time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual network model results</head><p>Contemporaneous partial correlation networks were successfully estimated for all patients. Network models will be presented as graphs using the following color scheme: symptom stress item nodes are colored blue, ISP items are colored yellow. Positive associations between nodes are blue, negative associations are red. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> provides a key of node names for all network models.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P01.</head><p>The patient reported more frequent thoughts about topics (isp3) for her next session. When inspecting the network graph, thoughts about the next session's content (isp3) were strongly linked to being "annoyed and irritable" (gad6), suggesting that this is currently a core problem the patient would like to discuss. Conversely, thoughts about "things that she could not express freely" in the last session (isp1) was negatively connected to this item. The relatively high bridge centrality of these items (BEIisp3 = 0.34; BEIisp1 = -0.25) could also indicate that the patient expresses her intention to use her therapy sessions for addressing her problems with irritability.</p><p>Thoughts about her therapist (isp4) were also positively linked to symptom stress via the "trouble relaxing" item (gad4), while positive treatment-related emotions (isp9) were negatively connected. This indicates that the patient evaluates her treatment more positively on days with low symptom stress. P02. This patient showed increased levels of problem solving (isp7) under increased symptom stress (BEIisp7 = .25), which suggests that he uses skills he learned in therapy sessions outside of the therapy room. The strong connection of this item to "being restless" (gad5) could indicate that this patient successfully implements relaxation techniques learned in treatment. Solving problems was less likely on days with higher depressive affect (phq2) or sleep problems (phq3). Additionally, he is more likely to recreate the therapeutic dialogue (isp5) under this condition. P03. Under increased symptom stress, this patient reported more positive, treatment-related emotions (isp9) and more reflection on the next session's content (isp3). This could mean that the patient starts to represent her treatment as something positive and is actively involved in the treatment process. Solving problems as discussed in sessions (isp7) was less likely under increased symptom load, especially when feeling "anxious, worried or nervous about social situations". This</p><p>indicates that the patient still shows some avoidance when attempting to deal with aversive situations. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Network model of patient P03.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P04</head><p>. This patient reported more problem solving under increased symptom stress (BEIisp7 = 0.19) and also seemed to reflect on session content more frequently (BEIisp3 = 0.11). She also reported more imagined dialogues on days with increased symptom stress (BEIisp5 = 0.23). Still, the patient did not achieve reliable change after termination. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. Network model of patient P04.</p><p>P05. In this case, both items referring to the past therapy session were positively linked to increased symptom stress (BEIisp1 = 0.32, BEIisp6 = 0.30), while both items involving the therapist were less likely to be reported on days with increased symptom stress (BEIisp4 = -0.33; BEIisp5 = -0.17). P06. For this patient, only three bridge nodes were observed, all of which are positively linked to symptom stress: thinking about things that she could not express freely last session (BEIisp1 = 0.19), and negative treatment-related emotions (BEIisp10 = 0.16) and thoughts about basic conditions (BEIisp2 = 0.04). These links indicate a mainly negative treatment evaluation with little to no helpful representations the patient has access to. Interestingly, this patient also did not achieve reliable change in her treatment. P07. The network model of this patient is densely interconnected, and all ISP items have connections to her symptoms. The ISP items isp2 (thoughts about basic conditions, BEIisp2 = 0.41), isp6 (remembered events from last session, BEIisp6 = 0.31) and isp7 (solving problems as discussed in therapy, BEIisp7 = 0.35) were especially high when symptom stress increased, while item isp3</p><p>(thinking about possible contents of the next session) was low under increased symptom stress (BEIisp3 = -0.41). <ref type="figure">. 7</ref>.

Items 3 (thought about topics for next session, BEIisp3 = 0.26), 4 (thought about therapist, BEIisp4 = 0.33) and 6 (remembered events from last session, BEIisp6 = 0.63) are most strongly linked to symptom stress. This indicates that the patient at least began to form a representation of his therapy that he can use to engage with symptom stress.

The item isp1 (Thought about things that you could not express freely last session) has a strong bridge connectivity (BEI = .61), which is likely to result from the strong connection to sad6 (Avoidance of social situations). The item isp7 (Solving problems as discussed in sessions) is a strong negative bridge, which is negatively linked to two SAD items (sad5: Muscle tension, restlessness in social situations; sad8: Excess time preparing for social situations). (remembered events from last session, BEIisp6 = -0.19) and isp7 (solving problems as discussed in sessions, BEIisp7 = -0.35) were negatively connected. This patient had more thoughts involving the therapist or dialogues with him under higher symptom stress, while he reflected more on the content of past and future sessions and engaged in more problem solving under lower symptom stress. Moving-window network analysis. Due to the large amount of data available for patient P06, she was selected for demonstrating the concept of moving-window network analysis. We obtained a series of 148 network models. For each of these models, we calculated the average bridge expected influence. As illustrated in figure 11, the strength of connections between ISP and symptom stress peak after day 50 and substantially dropped over time. We provided a video animation showing the change in network models over time in the supplementary material. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Using data from ten courses of psychotherapy, we explored and demonstrated an approach to modeling psychotherapeutic processes and symptom stress in ongoing psychotherapies. To the author's knowledge, this is the first study that explores how intersession processes and symptoms interact on a daily basis on an idiographic level. Although the available data come from a relatively homogeneous sample, it was shown that the intraindividual relationships of relevant variables vary greatly. Network models are a valuable method in providing detailed insights into idiographic dynamics in psychotherapy. We discovered individual bridges between ISP and symptom stress for every patient, but also discovered a high interindividual variability. These bridges can provide important insights for psychotherapy process research, as they can describe patients' treatment and problems on a temporally high-resolution level.</p><p>Our study validates the finding by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Geller and Farber (1993)</ref> that predicted a covariation of ISP and symptom stress. Additionally, our findings indicate that there is substantial variation in how exactly symptom stress and ISP interact. This could show that the representation of the therapy has a different function for each patient. Patient P06, for example, showed little ISP activation under increased symptom stress and did not achieve reliable change in her treatment. The few process-symptom bridges were rather negatively colored. In the moving-window network analysis, we showed that the process-symptom bridge strength dropped over the course of treatment. It is possible that this patient could not establish a stable working relationship or found the therapy unsuitable for her own problem so that, over time, the patient increasingly detached herself from the therapeutic process. Earlier studies on ISP and treatment outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hartmann et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zeeck et al., 2016)</ref> reported that a composite variable of negative treatment-related emotions and recreation of the therapeutic dialogue was predictive of treatment failure. With our approach, we provide further insights into this finding. If the retrieval of the representation of psychotherapy is associated with negative emotions, this could be an aversive stimulus. The patient tries to avoid this aversive stimulus, which is likely to reduce the frequency and intensity of recall. However, if the representation is activated too infrequently, it also means that it is not retrieved at decisive moments -for example, when the symptoms are more severe. Especially in such situations, representations could be useful either by leading to the application of therapeutic skills or by recalling a supportive, caring therapeutic relationship. This also aligns with the finding that negative treatment-related emotions suppress ISP activity on subsequent days reported by .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Because we used daily sampling, we decided to estimate only contemporaneous (intra-day) networks. All items set "today" as the time frame, so patients were instructed to judge a whole day retrospectively. Intraday fluctuations of symptoms are common, as many EMA studies have demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ebner-Priemer &amp; Trull, 2009)</ref>. The same is likely to be true for intersession processes. For example, an early survey study on ISP has shown that individual ISP events generally last for about one minute to a few seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Farber &amp; Geller, 1994)</ref>. Thus, temporal dynamics of process and symptom variables are probably much more fine-grained than daily assessment could capture. Modeling temporal associations would have been likely to result in mostly autoregressive associations under these conditions. For this reason, the exact causal direction of associations in networks remains unclear. This is partly compensated by the fact that we can use bridge expected influence to estimate the influence of individual items on node communities.</p><p>The statistical power of the network models is limited by a low number of observations.</p><p>Because we used regularized, thresholded partial correlation networks to estimate sparse, conservative models, it is likely that some of the weaker connections were set to zero and thus do not occur in our models. This can be resolved by increasing the sample size in future studies, possibly by including patients from long-term interventions in the measurement process. Due to the low sample size, the estimation of spurious edges cannot be ruled out completely. In order not to put too much strain on patients, we selected very short scales for daily assessments. Thus, certain aspects of both the patients' disorders and intersession processes might not occur in our models.</p><p>Generally, dense networks lead to higher values of bridge centrality for all items. Thus, bridge centrality values should be interpreted relative to the overall network density or the average value of bridge centrality for one patient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook</head><p>Future work should study the utility for high-frequency monitoring of these processes more thoroughly. Especially for providing feedback to therapists, network models can be promising, but much more work is needed before possible implementations are ready for clinical practice. The approach demonstrated here is promising because even with a relatively low number of variables, network models convey additional meaning by putting the focus on associations. For example, a cognitive-behavioral therapist might be interested if their patient applies new behaviors on days with increased symptom stress. In more relationship-focused approaches like psychodynamic or interpersonal therapy, associations between positive, treatment-related emotions and relationship processes could indicate the development of a positive therapeutic alliance.</p><p>On the client side, daily questionnaires over the whole course of psychotherapy can be straining. Unlike inpatient settings, ambulatory psychotherapy does not provide a fully controlled environment, so everyday tasks could reduce compliance when completing questionnaires. The clinical utility of network-based monitoring and feedback applications have to justify the additional strain put on patients.</p><p>Methodologically, the approach proposed in this article could be extended to dynamic networks that model both time-lagged associations and contemporaneous correlations after partialling out time-lagged influences. One way to perform such analyses is graphical VAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Epskamp, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion.</head><p>Taken together, the results provided in this study present a fine-grained examination of intersession processes in psychotherapy. As predicted, ISPs and symptom severity showed covariation in most patients. The application of bridge expected influence provided further details on how this covariance looks like when studied with greater detail. This represents another step in psychotherapy process research, as we have shown that these processes interact with symptom stress on an intraindividual level and that this interaction varies over time. While causality cannot be established in such networks, the idiographic approach we proposed can be seen as a new direction in this field. Future studies should test the clinical utility of these findings with larger samples, possibly examining the predictive utility of network model data for treatment outcome or dropout.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Network model of patient P01.</figDesc></figure>
