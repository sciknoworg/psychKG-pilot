				<p>Background Cognitive dysfunction is common in mental disorders and represents a potential risk factor in childhood. The nature and extent of associations between childhood cognitive function and polygenic risk for mental disorders is unclear. We applied computational modeling to gain insight into mechanistic processes underlying decision making and working memory in childhood and their associations with PRS for mental disorders and comorbid cardiometabolic diseases. Methods We used the drift diffusion model to infer latent computational processes underlying decision-making and working memory during the N-back task in 3707 children aged 9-10 from the ABCD Study. SNP-based heritability was estimated for cognitive phenotypes, including computational parameters, aggregated N-back task performance and neurocognitive assessments. PRS was calculated for Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD), bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease (CAD), major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes. Results Heritability estimates of cognitive phenotypes ranged from 12 to 39%. Bayesian mixed models revealed that slower accumulation of evidence was associated with higher PRS for CAD and schizophrenia. Longer non-decision time was associated with higher PRS for AD and lower PRS for CAD. Narrower decision threshold was associated with higher PRS for CAD. Load-dependent effects on non-decision time and decision threshold were associated with PRS for AD and CAD, respectively. Aggregated neurocognitive test scores were not associated with PRS for any of the mental or cardiometabolic phenotypes. Conclusions We identified distinct associations between computational cognitive processes to genetic risk for mental illness and cardiometabolic disease, which could represent childhood cognitive risk factors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Mental disorders are highly complex, heritable, and polygenic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Aggregating many small effects of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mental disorders from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allow for the construction of polygenic risk scores (PRS), reflecting an individual's cumulative genetic risk for a given trait or disorder. Mapping PRS for adult-onset disorders to relevant phenotypes in childhood represents an opportunity for discovering the expression of genetic liability in premorbid phases.</p><p>Cognitive functions are also heritable traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>, and cognitive deficits are frequent in patients with mental disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. Working memory dysfunction is commonly reported in mental disorders including schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, bipolar disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> and major depressive disorder (MDD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, while impaired decision making is observed in, among other, obsessive-compulsive disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>, MDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref> and schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13)</ref>.</p><p>Deficits in cognition have been found to precede the onset of illness, in some cases during childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>. Whether cognitive aberrations during childhood are associated with genetic liability for mental disorders is currently being explored. Recent studies have found PRS for schizophrenia to be positively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref>, negatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref> and not <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21)</ref> associated with general cognitive function in childhood and adolescence, while others have reported negative associations between PRS for AD and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref> and between PRS for schizophrenia and emotion identification and verbal reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>. It is currently unclear how cognitive variability in childhood is reflected in genetic liability for other mental disorders. Further, it is unclear how cognitive function relates to polygenic risk for cardiometabolic disease, which is highly comorbid with mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, an improved understanding of cognitive deficits during childhood for mental and cardiometabolic diseases with adult onset could give insight into the mapping between cognition and disease, and ultimately aid individual prediction.</p><p>Cognitive abilities are often inferred from observed behavior such as task accuracy or response time. Although identifying associations between mental disorders and observed behavior can have predictive value, measures of task accuracy and response time are inherently agnostic about their computational origins. Poor accuracy could for example result from impulsive decision-making or from a low signal-to-noise ratio in information accumulation. Computational approaches, in contrast, allow for model-based delineations of latent cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>, and have provided insight into the computational cognitive processes underlying aberrant learning and decision-making in clinical groups (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref>). Further, individual-level parameters from computational models have been shown to be more sensitive to diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref> and clinical outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref> than task accuracy and response time.</p><p>Computational modeling could thus aid in identifying mechanistic cognitive processes associated with genetic liability for mental disorders. To this end we took a computational psychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(32)</ref> approach to map associations between latent cognitive processes and PRS for mental disorders. We applied the drift diffusion model (DDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(33)</ref> to performance on the N-back task, a decision-making task probing working memory capacity, from 3707 children aged 9 to 10 in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development SM (ABCD) study <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(37)</ref> baseline sample. DDM analysis allowed us to estimate individual computational parameters during two load conditions (0-back and 2back), including evidence accumulation, speed-accuracy tradeoff, response bias and time spent on motor and perceptual processes. PRS were calculated for AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(38)</ref>, bipolar disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(39)</ref>, MDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(40)</ref>, OCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(41)</ref> and schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(42)</ref>. In addition, driven by the high occurrence of somatic comorbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(43)</ref>, the genetic overlap between cardiometabolic disease and mental illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(44)</ref>, and associations between cardiometabolic disease and cognition (45), we calculated PRS for coronary artery disease (CAD) (46) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(47)</ref>.</p><p>We used genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(48)</ref> to assess whether DDM parameters represent heritable traits. Next, we tested for associations between DDM parameters and PRS using Bayesian linear multilevel models, which allowed us to describe uncertainty in estimates. To provide a comparison to DDM parameters we also tested for associations with response time and task accuracy as well as aggregated neuropsychological scores as a proxy for general cognitive ability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The total sample consists of 11875 children aged 9-10 years. We analyzed data made available through the curated data release 2.0.1 (DOI:10.15 154/1504041). Informed written consent for child and parent was obtained from parents, and child participants separately completed a written assent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>N-back task</head><p>The Emotional N-back task <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">50)</ref> consisted of 160 trials divided into 2 runs. The task was performed in the scanner while collecting functional MRI data. Each run consisted of 8 blocks, each with 10 trials. The objective was, for each trial, to decide whether the current stimulus matched a target stimulus <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1a</ref>). In the 0-back condition the target stimulus was presented before the first trial in each block, and the participants were asked to decide whether the current stimulus matched the target stimulus. In the 2-back condition participants responded whether the stimulus on the current trial matched the stimulus presented 2 trials back. The stimulus and target matched in 20% of the trials. For the remaining trials the stimulus did not match the target, and the stimulus on the current trial either had (lure, 25% of trials) or had not (non-lure, 55%) been presented earlier in the block.</p><p>Stimulus-category (house and happy, fearful or neutral faces) varied across blocks, but was not incorporated into the current analyses, as it would result in too many parameters for reliable subject-level estimates. Information regarding the condition (and for the 0-back condition the target stimulus) was presented for 2500 ms at the start of each block. The stimulus was preceded by a plus sign presented for 1000 ms. The stimulus and the stimulus-response mapping were presented for 2000 ms.</p><p>The analysis included data from participants with recorded response on at least 50 of the total 160 trials to ensure reliable measures of performance. 8077 participants fulfilled this criterion. Data on one or more variables of interest were missing from 248 participants (Supplemental <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>), for which data were imputed using the R package mice (51). Participants with a task accuracy below 60% (N=468) were excluded, resulting in a sample of 7609 participants. Next, since the PRSs were derived from samples of 6 European ancestry we excluded participants of non-European origin. The final sample included 3707 participants. Illustrated here are three simulated decisions, one for each stimulus type (lure, non-lure and target). The rate and direction at which evidence is accumulated depends on the drift rate. Here, sample paths were simulated with a drift rate of -2.5 (lure), -2.3 (non-lure) and +3.05 (target). NDT = non-decision time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drift diffusion model</head><p>We analyzed trial-by-trial choice and response time data on the N-back task with the DDM, a cognitive process model that describes two-alternative forced choice decisionmaking as a noisy accumulation-to-bound process ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref>). The DDM provides good fits to observed choice and response time distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(52)</ref>. The accumulation-to-bound processes proposed by sequential sampling models, including the DDM, have been shown to correlate with neural firing patterns during decision-making in primates, suggesting that the model captures neural implementations of decision-making, providing a link between behavior and neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(53)</ref>.</p><p>The DDM has four main parameters. Drift rate (v) reflects the rate of evidence accumulation, where stronger drift rate leads to faster and more accurate decisions, due to less impact of noise. Decision threshold (a) captures the speed-accuracy tradeoff, where wider decision thresholds require more evidence to be accumulated to reach a decision.</p><p>This will lead to slower, but more accurate decisions. The starting point bias parameter   Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures S2 and S3</ref> show the distribution of the included variables across participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drift diffusion model</head><p>We used the python package HDDM (57) to model choice and response time data from the N-back task with Bayesian hierarchical estimation. As running all subjects in a single model would be too time-consuming, we randomly assigned subjects to one of 40 groups and ran Bayesian hierarchical models for each of these 40 groups.</p><p>Three chains, each with 2000 samples, were estimated for each group. The first 1000 samples were discarded as burn-in, to allow the sampling process to identify the region of best-fitting values in the parameter space. The models were estimated to be reliable, meaning that rerunning the models yielded similar parameter estimates. This was measured with the Gelman-Rubin statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(58)</ref>, which was below 1.1 for all group and subject parameters, indicating convergence. Scripts for HDDM analyses can be found at https://osf.io/ubezy/.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Polygenic Risk Scores</head><p>Using PRSice v2 (62) we calculated polygenic scores for AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(38)</ref>, bipolar disorder (39), CAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(46)</ref>, MDD (40), OCD (41), schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(42)</ref> and T2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(47)</ref>. We processed the GWAS summary statistics using a standardized pipeline (https://github.com/precimed/python_convert) and ran PRSice using default settings. We performed principal component analysis on PRS across all p-thresholds and used the first component of this analysis to associate to cognitive phenotypes.</p></div>

None of the polygenic scores were associated with the first principal component from the NIH toolbox <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1</ref>). Our analyses revealed several associations between DDM parameters and polygenic scores. Despite identifying associations also to response time and accuracy, computational modeling gives insight into the latent computational processes that give rise to alterations in observed behavior. Higher polygenic scores for AD were associated with slower responses, which were captured by the DDM as longer non-decision.</p></div>

The only polygenic associations to working memory load was altered adjustment of speed-accuracy tradeoff for CAD and changes in non-decision time for AD, which was not reflected in task accuracy or response time.</p><p>Although the first principal component from the NIH toolbox was estimated to be more than twice as heritable as phenotypes from the N-back task, we found no associations to polygenic scores. These results are in line with previous studies not reporting associations between polygenic risk for mental illness and general cognitive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">70)</ref>. Future investigations of follow-up data from the ABCD study can indicate whether speeded decision-making, and not WM capacity or general cognitive ability, are predictive of mental illness in adolescence.</p><p>The work described here is not without limitations. First, the computational parameters from the DDM cannot identify the separate contributions of working memory components, including the active maintenance and updating of target stimuli, and the inhibition of non-N stimuli. Although biophysical models of these processes exist (72), to our knowledge, they cannot be used for model fitting on a subject level (although see <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(73)</ref> for computational modeling of an alternative working memory task). Second, due to the block design used for fMRI scans, which does not allow insight into trial-by-trial brain</p><p>activity, we did not analyze the accompanying fMRI data and therefore cannot describe the association between computational parameters and their neural underpinnings.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified associations between computational cognitive processes and polygenic scores for mental illness and cardiometabolic disease in children aged 9-10 years. Recent studies have shown that the associations between psychological variables and mental disorders in large datasets typically are small <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(74)</ref>. The results reported here are no different. However, mapping the associations between computational cognitive processes and genetic load for mental disorders can improve our understanding of the small but robust effects that do exist, and in parsing the massive heterogeneity of mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">76)</ref> and thereby improving prediction of individual vulnerability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>a, Emotional N-back task.

Lastly, non-decision time (ndt) captures the time spent on encoding the stimulus and motor response, where shorter nondecision time reflects that less time is spent on stimulus encoding and motor response.The parameters of the DDM can be estimated using the Wiener first passage time likelihood function<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(54)</ref>, and thus allows inference on how parameters vary between groups, individuals, and task manipulations.N-back DDM: For the N-back task we assumed that participants could be biased towards responding target or non-target, and therefore coded upper bound responses as target responses and lower bound responses as non-target (Figure 1b). We allowed the rate of evidence accumulation to differ across stimulus type, and thus estimated separate drift rates for target, lure and non-lure stimuli. Further, to capture effects of load we estimated all parameters separately for the 0-back and 2-back conditions. In total, 12 parameters were estimated per subject in a mixed model using the Wiener first passage-time distribution to calculate the likelihood of the response times of choices x, ( ) ~ ( , , , , , , , , ), where a = decision threshold, c = condition (0-back or 2-back), ndt = non-decision time, RT = response time, s = subject, stim = stimulus (target, lure, non-lure), v = drift rate, x = choice (target or non-target), z = starting point bias. In addition, we estimated group-level variability parameters for non-decision time.From the 12 parameters we computed overall scores for each of the 4 cognitive processes, i.e., an average individual value for a, ndt, v and z across conditions and stimuli. We further calculated load-effects for each parameter by subtracting estimates for the 0-back from the 2-back condition.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>2a and b show that the model fit was good, and that predicted choice, response time and response time distributions (SupplementalFigure S1) across conditions closely matched the observed data. Briefly,Figure 2cshows that reduced accuracy and slower response times in the 2-back compared to 0-back condition was reflected as lower drift rate in the 2-back condition, with the strongest effect for lures, likely reflecting a higher propensity to mistake lures for targets. Participants were more biased towards responding target in the 2-back condition, reflected in an increased starting point bias towards the target boundary. Lastly, participants increased the decision threshold in the 2back compared to 0-back condition, which counteracts the effect of higher difficulty on accuracy but also leads to slower responses.</figDesc></figure>

NIH toolbox Participants completed the NIH toolbox (http://www.nihtoolbox. org), a computerized test battery comprising 7 tasks spanning executive function, working memory, episodic memory, attention, processing speed and language (55). We performed principal component analysis on uncorrected scores from all 7 tasks and included the first component in analyses as a measure of general cognitive ability.

Models were run for all combinations of cognitive phenotypes and polygenic. Further, we tested the effect of load by computing the difference between parameter estimates (and response time and accuracy) between the 2-back and 0-back conditions. All models included sex and age as fixed effects and scanning site, family (siblings and twins) and model group (40 pools of subjects used for DDM analysis) as random effects: Models also included 10 genetic ancestry PCs and genetic batch as covariates. Priors strongly centered around 0 (M = 0, SD = 0.5) were used for all coefficients to reduce the likelihood of false positives. All variables were standardized prior to analysis.

Discussion Cognitive impairments are frequently observed in patients with mental disorders, and often precede the emergence of clinical symptoms (66). While not included among the diagnostic criteria, mapping specific cognitive functions to polygenic scores for mental illness in children could provide new knowledge on the cognitive architecture of psychopathology. We used computational modeling to identify and associate latent variables of decision-making and working memory in 3707 children to polygenic scores for mental 10 −0.05 0.00 0.05 −0.10 −0.05 0.00 0.05 −0.10 −0.05 0.00 0.05 −0.10 −0.05 0.00 0.05 −0.10 −0.05 0.00 0.05 −0.10 −0.05 0.00 0.05 −0.10 −0.05 0.00 0risk scores illness and cardiometabolic disease. Individual variation in computational parameters were reflected in genetic variability, suggesting the parameters represent heritable phenotypes. We found small but robust associations between DDM parameters and polygenic scores for mental illness and cardiometabolic disease. The cognitive measures associated with PRS were related to task performance across load-conditions, and to a lesser extent to effects of load, suggesting a link to decision making in general, and not to aberrations in working memory. We did not find any associations of genetic liability to general cognitive function, as reflected in the first principal component of the neurocognitive battery.</figDesc></figure>
