			<abstract>
				<p>Humans possess a remarkable ability to perceive emotional stimuli, particularly those evoking fear. However, the underlying cognitive and computational mechanisms that facilitate this perceptual process remain unclear. The classic &quot;low road&quot; hypothesis postulates that a subcortical neural pathway sensitive to low spatial frequency (LSF) visual signals is responsible for the rapid detection of fearful stimuli. However, the extent of its influence on behavioral perception is still debated. Furthermore, considering that threats frequently manifest within familiar contexts, where our attention is attuned to their presence and absence, it is imperative to explore whether signals supposedly from the low road plays a crucial role in fear perception under emotion-guided attention. Across four experiments (N = 199), we systematically investigated perceptual decision making when emotional faces were presented in low (LSF), high (HSF), and broad (BSF) spatial frequency (SF) under emotion and nonemotion guided attention. Our findings revealed a remarkable decrease in performance in detecting LSF emotional targets under emotion-guided attention, while HSF emotional targets remained unaffected. Drift Diffusion Modeling (DDM) further uncovered that emotion-guided attention suppressed the accumulation of evidence for LSF emotional information. These results unambiguously contradict the hypothesis that perceptual decision-making of emotional stimuli under top-down emotion-guided attention relies on the low road. Our findings shed new light on the intricate interplay between bottom-up and top-down factors involved in emotion perception, provide novel insights into the dual-pathway model of emotion processing, and bear significant implications for emotion theorization and its potential clinical applications.</p>

This subcortical pathway is thought to be faster than the cortical route to the amygdala, enabling the rapid bottom-up passaging of fearful information <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Burra et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">LeDoux, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Morris et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Vuilleumier et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vuilleumier et al., , 2003</ref>. The classic dual-pathway model is in line with the basic emotion theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ekman, 1999)</ref>, providing an explanation of how threatening stimuli effortlessly capture our attention. However, threatening stimuli often occur in contexts where we anticipate them and are therefore attentive to such context-relevant information. Indeed, recent evidence supporting the constructivist view of emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrett, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barrett, 2017)</ref>, highlights the influence of top-down factors on threat-related perceptual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Glasgow et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Imbriano et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Sussman, Jin, et al., 2016)</ref>. A critical question emerges when considering both bodies of literature, that is whether fearful signals from the low road plays an important role in fear perception when attention is endogenously focused on fear or emotion in general. Elucidating the cognitive and computational processes of this fundamental affective function is pivotal to inform ecologically valid models of emotion.</p><p>The determinant in accessing the low road is spatial frequency (SF) of the visually presented stimuli. According to the dual-pathway model, the low road consisting of primarily magnocellular neurons is sensitive to low spatial frequency (LSF) but not high spatial frequency (HSF) visual signals. Neuroscience research has supported the low road hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carretié et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Ruiz-Soler &amp; Beltran, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. Notably, a study utilizing human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) demonstrated that LSF fearful faces elicited shorter latency reactivity in the amygdala compared to the fusiform face area (FFA), specifically for fearful faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016)</ref>. Similarly, non-invasive neuroimaging and psychophysiology studies examining the effects of SF on threat detection have supported the low road in expediting the passage of threat-related information <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Azevedo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carretie et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. However, fast access to the amygdala does not warrant a reliance on LSF signals for threat perception. Contrary to neuroimaging findings, behavioral evidence regarding the importance of the low road in threatrelated perceptual decision making remains inconclusive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Smith and Schyns (2009);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Stein et al. (2014)</ref>). In fact, no behavioral differences between LSF and HSF stimuli were found in the neuroimaging studies showing prioritized amygdala response to LSF fearful signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mendez-Bertolo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, a crucial but understudied aspect of perceptual decision making regarding fearful stimuli is that they are rarely encountered suddenly, without any forewarning or prior knowledge. Instead, they often arise in familiar contexts where other environmental cues are present, and the observer has prior knowledge. For example, a speaker presenting to a group of notoriously critical experts would expect to see stern facial expressions when scanning the audience. Preexisting contextual knowledge aids observers in anticipating and detecting such threats. One way in which prior information influences threat detection is by endogenously directing attention towards anticipated signals, and as a results, the perceptual sensitivity of the attended object or feature is being sharpened <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Jiang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Summerfield &amp; Egner, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>A growing body of literature has shown that attention, when purposefully and voluntarily directed towards fearful (compared to neutral) targets, enhances fear-related perceptual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Glasgow et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Imbriano et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mohanty et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sussman, Szekely, et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sussman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Szekely et al., 2017)</ref>. On a neural level, this endogenous fearful-guided compared to neutral-guided attention evoked greater late positive potential (LPP) activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Weinberg et al., 2012)</ref>, indicating enhanced emotion processing.</p><p>Moreover, this fearful-guided attention increased amygdala responsivity to subsequently presented fearful stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Sussman et al., 2017)</ref>. These recent findings, in stark contrast to the classical model focusing on the bottom-up stimulus-driven pathway, have evidenced the modulation effect of top-down endogenous attention.</p><p>Effects of top-down modulation in emotion processing is consistent with the predictive processing framework, which suggests that the brain predicts relevant and likely information based on the context, and a percept is formed when top-down predictions align with bottomup sensory signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Friston, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mesulam, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Summerfield &amp; Egner, 2009)</ref>. Therefore, threat perception is influenced by both the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the endogenous attention that shapes top-down predictions. In this framework, LSF and HSF signals may play distinct roles in the interplay between bottom-up and top-down information processing. LSF signals are thought to carry coarse information to higher-order brain regions, which generate hypotheses about the visual objects within a context. Subsequently, HSF signals are used to test these hypotheses and reach a final conclusion about the identity of the visual objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bar, 2004)</ref>. This suggests that if attention is already directed towards a specific target in a top-down manner and prediction is formed, LSF information may not be necessary, and only HSF information would be relevant for hypothesis testing.</p><p>To date, the behavioral consequences of the low-road hypothesis under emotion-guided attention remains unexamined. Consequently, it is unknown how different SF signals affect perceptual decision making under endogenous emotion-guided attention. Two competing hypotheses naturally arise when considering the low-road hypothesis under the predictive processing framework. The first hypothesis (hypothesis 1) is that the top-down fear-guided attention leverages the low road, such that LSF signals, instead of HSF signals, would drive the fear-related perceptual decision making. This would lead to a better behavioral performance of LSF than HSF fearful stimuli, especially under fear-guided attention. Alternatively (hypothesis 2), under endogenous fear-guided attention, the brain may directly employ HSF signals to determine whether the fearful target is present, which would lead to a better performance of HSF than LSF stimuli. In terms of the computational mechanism, it has been demonstrated that endogenous fear-guided attention enhances the efficiency of evidence accumulation (drift rate) and shifts the starting point to facilitate perceptual decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>. Based on these findings, we further hypothesize that 1) fearguided attention compared to neutral-guided attention may enhance the drift rate of LSF fearful than HSF fearful signals, and shift the starting point of LSF than HSF signals towards a fearresponse decision, supporting hypothesis 1 , and 2) alternatively, fear-guided compared to neutral-guided attention may enhance the drift rate of HSF fearful than LSF fearful signals, and shift the starting point of HSF signals towards a fear-response decision, supporting hypothesis 2. We conducted four behavioral experiments to test these two hypotheses and to unveil the computational mechanisms. Below we presented a novel paradigm to examine perceptual decision making regarding emotional (fearful and happy) and neutral stimuli manipulating the SF content of the stimuli and endogenous attention (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[F]earful-, [H]appy-, [N]eutral-attention).</formula><p>If the first hypothesis was supported, we would expect to see better performance in decisions about LSF than HSF stimuli, particularly for fearful stimuli under F-attention. If the second hypothesis was supported, we would expect to see better performance of HSF than LSF stimuli under F-attention. We then applied drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to examine the computational process leading up to the decision. Furthermore, given that the low road is supposed to be unique to fearful signals, and does not apply to positive signals, throughout our investigation, we also examined whether fear-related findings were unique by including happy-related decisions as a control. Finally, we ruled out alternative explanations of our main findings (Experiments 2-4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In Experiment 1, young adult participants (N = 53, female = 73.1%, mean age = 23.4 years old, SD = 5.3) viewed briefly presented HSF, LSF and broad (B)SF images of fearful (ff), neutral (nf) and happy (hf) faces ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. Their task was to decide whether presented faces were "fearful or not" in F-attention condition, "neutral or not" in N-attention condition and "happy or not" in H-attention condition. Such "A or Not A" design has been established in eliciting endogenous object-or emotion-guided attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Summerfield et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sussman et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, participants rated trial-by-trial confidence regarding their decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 | Experimental paradigms. A. Task description for the four experiments.</head><p>In Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, top-down endogenous attention is manipulated towards Fearful (F), Neutral (N), and Happy (H) emotion by asking participants to make decisions about whether faces are 'fearful or not' in the fearful-attention blocks, 'neutral or not' in the neutral-attention blocks, and 'happy or not' in the happy-attention blocks by pressing the 'YES' or 'NO' response keys as accurately and quickly as possible. In Experiment 3 participants decide whether the presented face is fearful or neutral, in Experiment 4 whether it is male or female, by pressing the 'F' or 'N' and 'M' or 'F' key, respectively. B. Stimuli space. 3 x 3 design for stim SF : Broad Spatial Frequency (BSF), High Spatial Frequency (HSF), and Low Spatial Frequency (LSF) and stim emo : fearful face (ff), neutral face (nf), and happy face (hf). For Experiment 4 happy stimuli are removed. C. Sample trial timeline. A fixation cross was presented for 1000 ms followed by the face stimulus for 100 ms, which is sandwiched between forward and backward visual masks for 300 ms each followed by a fixation cross. Participants are then asked to rate their confidence about the prior decision on a four-point scale from low to high confidence.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2A)</ref>, people performed the worst in detecting LSF fearful targets.</p><p>Specifically, detecting LSF ff was worse than detecting HSF and BSF ff (t(52) = 10.71, p &lt; .001 for HSF, t(52) = 15.59, p &lt; .001 for BSF) and was also worse than rejecting LSF nontargets (nf and hf) (t(52) = 12.81, p &lt; .001 for ff vs nf and t(52) = 13.83, p &lt; .001 for ff vs hf).</p><p>In contrast to LSF, both HSF target and non-target stimuli were well decided (t(52) = 1.63, p = .996 for ff vs nf and t(52) = 4.43, p = .011 for ff vs hf  <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. In contrast, no differences were found among attention conditions for HSF trials (all ps &gt; .674). Similar to HSF, differences across attention conditions for d' were more attenuated for BSF trials (t(52) = 4.45, p = .001 for F vs H, t(52) = 1.50, p = .851 for F vs N, t(52) = 2.09, p = .494 for H vs N).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emotion-guided attention induces conservative bias about LSF but not HSF information</head><p>As revealed in the decision criterion (c) of SDT, endogenous emotion-guided attention biased decision-making, an effect particularly strong for LSF (F(2.83, 147.05) = 55.60, p &lt; .001, = .52, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2C</ref>). Overall, for LSF stimuli, participants endorsed a "no, not target" decision for both F-and H-attention but not N-attention, a pattern even more pronounced for Fcompared to H-attention (t(52) = 4.41, p = .002 for F vs H, t(52) = 8.31, p &lt; .001 for H vs N).</p><p>The differences in c-criterion across attention conditions were again attenuated for HSF trials (t(52) = 4.80, p &lt; .001 for F vs H, t(52) = 4.40, p = .002 for N vs H, t(52) = 0.40, p = 1.000 for F vs N) and BSF trials (t(52) = 4.89, p &lt; .001 for F vs H; t(52) = 3.65, p = .016 for N vs H, t(52) = 0.76, p = .997 for F vs N). Also, under F-attention and H-attention, decisions were most conservative for LSF stimuli (all ps &lt; .001), while more liberal decision-making for LSF compared to BSF and HSF was observed under N-attention (ps &lt; .019).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low confidence is reported for decisions about LSF stimuli</head><p>In addition to objective measures of performance, we also assessed subjective perception of decision-making performance using self-report measures. There was an interaction between stim emo and stim SF (F(2.97, 154.49) = 53.53, p &lt; .001, = .507).</p><p>Consistent with accuracy and d', confidence was noticeably lower for LSF than HSF (all ps &lt; .001), which in turn was lower than BSF (all ps &lt; .01) across all attention and stim emo conditions.</p><p>For LSF conditions, the confidence ratings were lower overall, with minor differences among attention conditions (see Supplementary). For HSF, confidence was higher for emotional (ff and hf) than neutral (nf) stimuli and was not affected by endogenous attention (ps &lt; .001). BSF showed a similar trend to HSF, as emotional were generally rated with higher confidence than their neutral counterpart (ps &lt; .001). Overall, people showed consistently low confidence for decisions regarding LSF images, regardless of attention status and whether the presented stimulus was a target or non-target. Next, we used a hierarchical drift diffusion model (HDDM) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wiecki et al., 2013)</ref> to examine the computational mechanisms underlying the behavioral results. Given the behavioral findings, it was expected that drift rate would be faster for HSF than LSF towards the "yes" decision under F-attention and H-attention, an effect dampened or nonexistent for Nattention. By comparing three models fit to the reaction time (RT) and decision data, we tested this computational hypothesis against alternative hypotheses that endogenous attention affects decision making by inducing a starting point bias (M2) and decision-threshold reflected in boundary separation (M3). For all models, we allowed drift rate to vary by stim SF (see</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Methods).</formula><p>Model convergence for the best fitting model was assessed visually and quantitatively (the Gelman-Rubin % statistic showed that all values were close to 1 and did not exceed 1.1, indicating the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains for all group-level and subjectlevel posterior parameter values converged successfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Ulrichsen et al., 2020)</ref>).</p><p>Supporting our DDM hypothesis, model comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Spiegelhalter et al., 2002)</ref> showed that the best-fitting model (M1) had drift rate vary as a function of attention, stim SF and trial type (represented in congruency: target-present decisions as "congruent" vs targetabsent decisions as "incongruent") (  Note: Three models (M1 -M3) were tested. Drift rate, v, represents the speed or efficiency of evidence accumulation in reaching either of the two decision boundaries. Starting point bias, z, represents the initial amount of bias in favor of either of the two decision choices, either "yes, this is the target face" or "no, this is not the target face". Boundary separation, a, reflects the distance or discriminability between the two subjective decision boundaries. Congruency: trial type property, based on actual stimulus emotion within attention blocks, resulting in "congruent" and "incongruent" trials. SF = Spatial frequency. DIC = Deviance Information Criterion, lower values indicate better model fit.</p><p>For all three attention conditions, the posterior parameter estimates of the best fitting model revealed that drift rates were the slowest for LSF compared to HSF and BSF trials for  We depict the evidence accumulation process supported by the winning model. Note that the drift rates for LSF target-presents trials were negative ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Supplementary Table 1</ref>), hence they are directed to the lower boundary as indicated by an asterisk (*). The bias against detecting LSF emotional target cannot be explained by imbalanced</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>trial frequency</head><p>The ratio of target-present to target-absent trials was 1:2 in Experiment 1 to ensure an equal number of trials across stim emo . However, this may raise the question of whether the low detection rate of LSF emotional targets and the drift rate results were due to a response bias, although the imbalanced trial numbers applied to HSF and BSF trials as well. In Experiment 2</p><p>(N = 31, female = 74.2%, mean age = 24.8, SD = 9.9), the target-present and target-absent trials were equalized. The primary results for decision accuracy, model comparison, and drift rates of the winning model were strikingly similar to Experiment 1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A, B</ref> and <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 3</ref>-5), reinforcing our findings.  LSF fearful information is misperceived as neutral.</p><p>Given the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it is possible that the low detection rate for LSF emotional targets was due to a response bias of making a "no" decision because LSF images were simply difficult to detect. Experiment 3, therefore, asked participants (N = 55, female = 74.5%, male = 23.6, non-disclosed = 1.8, mean age = 22.71, SD = 5.72) to focus on the emotion of the stimuli, this time making a "fearful or neutral" decision ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4C</ref>, the accuracy for LSF ff was significantly lower than HSF (t(54) = 10.18, p &lt; .001) and BSF (t(54) = 13.47 p &lt; .001). More importantly, the accuracy for LSF nf was much higher than LSF ff (t(54) = 8.09, p &lt; .001) and the detection rate of the LSF ff was comparable to Experiments 1-2. These results supported that the low detection rate of LSF ff in our main experiment were not explained by a simple response bias towards "no". Instead, LSF ff stimuli were more likely to be perceived as neutral.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Threat-related perceptual decision-making under emotion-guided attention does not rely on the low road.</head><p>Given its evolutionary salience, processing threat-related information has been of persisting interest in affective science research. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms is crucial in improving theories of emotion. The role of the low-road has been proposed to explain how threatening signals are prioritized and has also been debated in the past two decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Maior et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Maior et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Öhman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pessoa &amp; Adolphs, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Shang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tamietto &amp; De Gelder, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Van Le et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wei et al., 2015)</ref>. Contrary to the rich neuroscience literature, behavioral studies directly examining the importance of the proposed low-road has been sparse, and the findings are inconclusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(McFadyen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Stein et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. Importantly, existent neural and behavioral studies have mostly focused on the bottom-up process, wherein identifying the emotion is not the task at hand. However, basic and affective science research has shown that sensory information processing is heavily influenced by top-down factors, such as endogenous attention and goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cohen &amp; Maunsell, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gilbert &amp; Sigman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hopfinger et al., 2000)</ref>. Thus, the present study sought to investigate the impact of the purported low road on perceptual decision making when identifying the emotion is the focus of attention.</p><p>To our knowledge, the current study is the first empirical work directly comparing HSF and LSF channels under endogenous emotion-related vs non-emotion-related attention conditions. We found no evidence supporting signals from the low road driving perceptual decisions under emotion-guided attention. Instead, when participants attended to fear, HSF fearful targets were detected with drastically lower accuracy (lower than chance), poorer perceptual sensitivity and more conservative response bias compared to LSF fearful targets.</p><p>Moreover, participants tended to misperceive LSF fearful stimuli as neutral. This indication is further supported by the subjective confidence rating being substantially lower for LSF trials.</p><p>We also ruled out the alternative explanations of imbalanced ratio of target present to target absent trials (Experiment 2), and pure "no" response bias due to inability to discriminate between emotional and neutral stimuli (Experiment 3). Results showed that this inferiority of LSF signals is specific to emotion but not gender identification task (Experiment 4). Using computational modeling, we found that when attending to fear, evidence accumulation for LSF is less efficient towards the fear-present decision, but more efficient towards the fear-absent decision compared to HSF.</p><p>Our results support previous research showing a bias for HSF images over LSF images in tasks that require identification of whether facial stimuli are expressive or not expressive <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Schyns &amp; Oliva, 1999)</ref> and require emotion identification between smiling and grimacing faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Deruelle &amp; Fagot, 2005)</ref>. While prior research had suggested possible roles of HSF in emotion processing and emotion perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Cesarei &amp; Codispoti, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pessoa &amp; Adolphs, 2010)</ref>, the computational mechanisms remained unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. The current findings clearly showed that when making emotion-related perceptual decisions, participants were less sensitive to emotional signals carried in LSF compared to HSF, impairing their evidence extraction which resulted in impaired emotion-related decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When does endogenous attention facilitate emotion-related perceptual decision making?</head><p>For the BSF trials, fear-guided attention did not lead to better perceptual decision making or faster evidence accumulation than neutral-and happy-guided attention, which appears to be inconsistent from the recent literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ozturk et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sussman et al., 2017</ref> Generalization to positive emotions.</p><p>While the low road seems to be specific to threatening stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Öhman, Lundqvist, et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Öhman &amp; Mineka, 2001</ref>), the present study showed that poor detection of LSF emotional targets under endogenous attention is also occurs for happy stimuli. This suggests detecting emotional targets, threatening or happy, when endogenous attention is guided towards emotion, relies on HSF signals. In contrast to the two high-arousal emotions, when attention is guided towards neutral, people are more readily to endorse a neutral decision if the signals are in LSF <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Experiments 1-3)</ref>. In other words, LSF emotional signals are more likely to be perceived as non-emotional under emotion-guided attention. This suggests a potential functional dissociation of the two pathways such that the low road appears to be specific to bottom-up threatening information processing whereas HSF information carries both positive-and negative-valenced emotional information for top-down modulated processing. This is in line with prior research showing that distinct neural substrates have been evident for the processing of emotional stimuli depending on the relevance of the emotional content to the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Critchley et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Keightley et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lange et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Scheuerecker et al., 2007)</ref>, implying that different brain regions and, thus, different modes of processes are recruited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reconceptualizing the dual-pathway model in emotion-related perceptual decision making under predictive processing</head><p>Our results demonstrate that LSF emotional information processing is suppressed under emotion-guided attention, leaving HSF emotional information to drive the perception. In light of the current findings and considering previous research supporting the low road hypothesis, it is plausible that when humans are not paying attention to emotion, threatening object captures attention via sending the "gist" through the low road, relying on the LSF information <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Cesarei &amp; Codispoti, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. Here, the amygdala may serve the function of saliency detection, responding to the LSF threatening signals by broadcasting the salient information to higher-order brain regions (e.g., prefrontal and temporal regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pessoa &amp; Adolphs, 2010)</ref>, leading to re-orientation of attention to the salient object through the attention network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adolphs, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vuilleumier, 2005)</ref>. A topdown hypothesis about what the object might be is likely generated in the prefrontal regions (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been shown to carry the top-down perceptual set <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Summerfield et al., 2006)</ref>). HSF signals in the occipital-temporal areas are then needed to confirm such predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bar, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. When endogenous attention is already on emotion, higher order brain regions can directly use the finer HSF signals for emotion identification. Previous neuroimaging research has shown that BSF fearful faces evoked stronger amygdala response under top-down fear-attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Sussman et al., 2017)</ref>, which may be driven by HSF fearful signals, post processing of ventral face-sensitive regions.</p><p>From a predictive processing perspective, the saliency of an unexpected threat can be carried out by a large prediction error, signaled by the amygdala, as shown in the classic low road findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. Under emotion-guided endogenous attention, the brain focuses on the HSF signals to drive the perceptual decision, suppressing the LSF signal processing to save energy. Such flexibility in top-down modulated bottom-up information processing aligns well with the constructivist view of emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrett, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lindquist et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions</head><p>We do not claim from the current study that the magnocellular-mediated low road is inactive under top-down emotion guidance. It remains an empirical question whether LSF threatening stimuli still evokes an earlier and/or stronger amygdala response under emotionguided endogenous attention. If LSF-preferred amygdala response is not present, it would indicate that the top-down modulation happens either at the amygdala or earlier stages, blocking the low-road threat-related information to the amygdala. Future neuroimaging research is needed to examine these possibilities. In addition, future research may investigate whether other top-down factors, such as probability-or context-induced expectations show similar or distinctive influences. Another limitation is the nature of the stimuli used. Human facial expression is a widely used type of stimuli to study emotion perception. It is also particularly well-suited for studying the low-road hypothesis, as these faces contain evolutionary saliency <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. However, future research using other types of intrinsically threatening stimuli, such as snakes and insects, is needed for testing the generalizability of the current findings. Finally, our participants are largely Asian with the majority of them being female. Future research investigating the generalizability of the current findings to other demographic populations is needed.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for emotion-related psychopathology, such as seen in anxiety disorders, which are characterized by hypersensitivity to detecting threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bar-Haim et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bradley et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010)</ref>. Attentional biases towards threat have long been a focus of anxiety psychopathology research. However, such biases have been largely studied using the bottom-up, stimulus-driven approach. This is antithetical to the cognitive behavioral models of anxiety, which highlight top-down anxious apprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Engels et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nitschke et al., 1999)</ref>. Recently, individual differences in using threat attention to guide subsequent threat-related perceptual decision making has been linked to clinical anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Glasgow et al., 2022)</ref>. Based on the current findings, individuals with hypersensitivity of threat may have impairments dampening the reliance on LSF channels under top-down guidance. Future studies shall examine whether this variance is related to anxiety sensitivity or anxious apprehension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Perception of the emotional nature of an object is a primitive in emotional experience <ref type="bibr">(Russell, 2003)</ref>. Building on the bottom-up stimulus-driven, and top-down attentionmodulation literatures, the current study investigated the psychological and computational mechanisms of threat-related perceptual decision making under endogenous attention guidance and expanded the examination to include positive emotion. Findings from this study do not support the classic low road hypothesis in perceptual decision making under emotion-guided attention and are in line with the predictive processing framework and the constructivist view of emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett, 2017)</ref>. These findings provide important insights into the cognitive processes of emotion perception, cast novel questions for future affective neuroscience research, and will help theorization of psychological emotion processing.</p></div>

Facial images consisting of fearful (ff), neutral (nf), and happy (hf) face expressions (i.e., stim emo : ff, nf, hf) were selected from the HKU Face Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chuk et al., 2017</ref>) consisting of two female and three male identities (ID). These fifteen color images (5 IDs x 3 stim emos ) were first processed using Adobe Photoshop to create 300 x 300-pixel jpeg grayscale images cropped to include eyebrows and lips and exclude hair, which were touched up manually. Using a proprietary MATLAB (R2020b) script, each of the fifteen grayscale images was normalized for luminance and contrast (root-mean-square contrast, RMS = 0.25).</p><p>Using Fast Fourier Transform to equalize all images, the average amplitude spectrum of all fifteen broad spatial frequency (BSF) images and the phase spectrum of each individual image were obtained. Using second-order Butterworth filters, the 15 BSF images were filtered into 15 low spatial frequency (LSF) images using a cut-off of 6 cycles/image and 15 high spatial frequency (HSF) images using a cut-off of 24 cycles/image as represented by the sample stimuli space in <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>. Forward-and backward-masks were created by randomly rotating BSF images by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees or 360 degrees and adding phase perturbed noise patterns using a random von Mises distribution to the individual phase spectrum.

In Experiment 1 participants completed a novel computerized perceptual decision-making task delivered using PsychoPy version 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Peirce et al., 2019)</ref>. Endogenous attention was manipulated at the block level by instructing participants to decide whether each face presented in the block was "fearful or not" in the fearful (F)-attention blocks; "neutral or not" in the neutral (N)-attention blocks; or "happy or not" in the happy (H)-attention blocks <ref type="figure">(Figure 1A)</ref>.</p><p>Each trial began with a fixation cross for 1000 ms, followed by a forward-mask for 300 ms, the face stimulus for 100 ms, and a backward-mask for 300 ms. Upon stimulus onset, participants responded as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing one of two adjacent keys, marked by "yes" (is the target emotion) and "no" (not the target emotion), on a qwerty keyboard using the index and middle fingers of their dominant hand. Next, participants rated how confident they were about the preceding decision from low to high on a four-point scale using a slider on the screen <ref type="figure">(Figure 1C)</ref>. Their initial decision, response time (RT), and confidence rating (1 -4, on a 4-point scale) were recorded.</p><p>Each block consisted of 27 trials (three trials per stim SF and stim emo condition). Stimuli presentation was pseudo-randomized such that the same stimulus emotion (ff, nf, hf) and the same SF (BSF, HSF, LSF) were not presented consecutively more than two times. Each set of blocks consisted of one F-attention block, one N-attention block and one H-attention block, with the exact same trial sequence.

Two-way attention x stim SF rmANOVAs were conducted for (d'), (c), hit rate (HR), and false alarm rate (FAR).</p><p>Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Model (HDDM) Analysis. After establishing the behavioral findings, we used the drift diffusion model (DDM) to investigate the hidden computational processes in Experiment 1-2. DDM has been used to model the cognitive processes that describe a 'simple, relatively fast, single-stage, two-choice' decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Evans &amp; Wagenmakers, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>. In contrast to the SDT measures, which only considers choice data, DDM uses the composite of choice and RT data to evaluate the perceptual decision-making process. According to the DDM theory, decision choices result from comparing and accumulating evidence in favor of one or another alternative until the evidence accumulated surpasses the subjective decision boundary of one of the two options.</p><p>The duration of the encoding and response stages are combined and captured by a single nondecision parameter, often denoted as Ter. The decision-choice comparison stage is usually parameterized by three variables: drift rate, denoted as v; starting point bias, denoted as z; and boundary separation, denoted as a. Drift rate reflects the speed or efficiency of evidence accumulation in reaching either of the two decision boundaries. Starting point bias reflects the initial amount of bias in favour of one option. Boundary separation reflects the distance or discriminability between the two subjective decision boundaries. The speed of any decision trial, given by RT, comprises the duration of the above stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Ratcliff &amp; Tuerlinckx, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The experimental paradigm was formulated such that the upper decision boundary represented the "Yes" decision and the lower decision boundary represented the "No" decision.</p><p>Based on this setup, a positive drift rate would indicate evidence accumulation towards the "Yes" boundary and a negative drift rate would indicate evidence accumulation towards the "No" boundary. A starting point located equidistant between the upper and lower decision boundaries would indicate no starting point bias. In contrast, a starting point located closer to the upper decision boundary would indicate a starting bias favoring the "Yes" decision, while a starting point located closer to the lower decision boundary would indicate a starting bias favoring the "No" decision.</p><p>For DDM analysis only, individual trials with RTs greater than 4000 ms were excluded (trials excluded = 181, 0.8% for Experiment 1, and trials excluded = 74, 0.44% for Experiment 2), yielding across all participants a total of 21,284 valid trials for Experiment 1, and 16,740 valid trials for Experiment 2. Some studies using HDDM have excluded fast trials less than 150 ms to 300 ms and slow trials greater than 2500 ms to 5000 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lawlor et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Son et al., 2019)</ref>.

We chose a compromise, noting that a lower cut-off at 150 ms would have excluded 8 trials (0.04%) for Experiment 1 and 53 trials (0.32%) for Experiment Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods to fit a given model to the choice and RT data by generating the joint posterior distributions for the estimated parameters. For each model tested, 2,000 samples were drawn from the posterior distributions of v, z, a, and Ter with 1,000 burnin samples for chain stabilization and thinning at 5 using the hddm.HDDM function. To ensure robustness against outliers, all models assumed 5% of trials were outliers from a uniform distribution, not generated from the DDM process <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Ulrichsen et al., 2020)</ref>.

Since the focus of this study pertained to the decision-choice comparison stage in decision-making, all models specified in the analysis were constrained using a subject-level estimate for Ter across all conditions. Models 1-3 reflected our hypotheses regarding what decision-making components were influenced by emotion-guided attention, stim emo , and stim SF .

As the task required participants to decide whether sensory signals match the target of the attention, we allowed drift rate to vary by trial type (target-present or target-absent) for all models. We then further considered the following aspects for hypothesis testing. For Model1 (M1), the following factors were considered. If the top-down prediction had a preferred stim SF , then splitting drift rate by stim SF would yield a good fitness of the model. Also, based on previous research showing that attention sharpens perceptual sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Summerfield &amp; Egner, 2016)</ref> We further evaluated the best-fitting model by conducting a posterior predictive check (PPC), comparing the actual data and the simulated data generated by the best-fitting model (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 2</ref>).

These DDM results provided a computational mechanistic explanation for behavioral findings, supporting that emotion-guided attention biased against accumulating LSF emotional evidence. Also, under emotion-guided attention, emotion-related evidence accumulation relies on HSF instead of LSF signals.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, we hypothesized that attention would further affect drift rate. As such, M1 was formulated to allow the drift rate to vary as a function of trial type (target-present and target-absent), stim SF (LSF, HSF, and BSF) and attention (F, N, and H). Compared to M1, Model 2 (M2) tested whether endogenous attention affected the starting point bias instead of the drift rate. The rationale was that detecting a fearful or happy target contains evolutionary saliency. Thus, it is possible that under F-and H-attention the starting point was biased towards a "Yes" decision boundary compared to under N-attention condition. Consequently, M2 was formulated to allow the drift rate to vary as a function of trial type and stim SF and starting point to vary as a function of attention. Finally, Model 3 (M3) tested whether endogenous attention affected boundary separation. Boundary separation is affected by the speed-accuracy trade off. It is possible that people needed less evidence to make a decision under F-and H-attention compared to under N-attention due to their salience. Thus, attention might affect boundary separation instead of starting point or drift rate. As such, M3 was formulated to allow drift rate to vary as a function of trial type and stim SF and boundary separation to vary as a function of attention. Model comparison would provide empirical evidence delineating the roles of stimSF and emotion-guided attention in decision-making. Specifically, comparing among Models 1, 2 and 3 would provide empirical evidence on whether attention was best conceptualized as affecting evidence accumulation efficiency, inducing a starting point bias, or changing the amount of evidence needed.</figDesc></figure>

The current study was instead focused on how endogenous attention interacts with physical stimulus features to influence perceptual decision making. Therefore, the present study did not equalize the perceptual thresholds between fearful and neutral, or between different SF levels. Our contrast level was fixed and equalized across stimuli and subjects. Combining the current findings with the existing literature indicate that the facilitatory effect of fear-guided attention on fear-related perceptual decision making may be pronounced only when the stimuli are degraded, and the processing of bottom-up signals is equalized at the subjective perceptual level. When physical properties are equalized objectively, there may not be a stronger facilitatory effect for fear-guided attention compared to neutral-guided attention.</figDesc><table><row><cell>).</cell></row><row><cell>A key difference in design may help explain this discrepancy.
