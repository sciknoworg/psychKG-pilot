			<abstract>
				<p>Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are associated with pervasive cognitive impairments, including deficits in decision-making under risk. However, there is inconclusive evidence regarding specific mechanisms underlying altered decision-making patterns. In this study, participants (33 SSD and 28 non-SSD) completed the Columbia Card Task, an explicit risk-taking task, to better understand risk preference and adjustment in dynamic decision-making. We found that while there is no group difference in overall risk-taking, risk preference, or optimal decision-making, risk adjustment to contextual factors (e.g., loss probability) is blunted in SSD. We also found associations between risk-taking/suboptimal decision-making and disorganized symptoms, excited symptoms, and role functioning, but no associations between decisionmaking and working memory. These results suggest that during a complex, dynamic risk-taking task, individuals with SSD exhibit less adaption to changing information about risk, which may reflect risk imperception.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) and a key determinant of functional outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Halverson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kahn &amp; Keefe, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kharawala et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McCleery &amp; Nuechterlein, 2019)</ref>. One way in which these cognitive impairments manifest is in aspects of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Evans et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kurtz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mosiołek et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sterzer et al., 2019)</ref>. Particularly, considerable evidence suggests that decision-making under risk, an important aspect of cognitive functioning, is altered in schizophrenia (see <ref type="bibr">Purcell et al., 2022 for review)</ref>. In this context, risk refers to the degree of variance in all potential outcomes of a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Schonberg et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Trepel et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Mathematically, a normatively superior decision would entail maximizing the expected value (EV) of an outcome, calculated as the probability of a state occurring multiplied by the outcome of such a state <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Trepel et al., 2005)</ref>. However, leading decision theories suggest that individuals do not strictly adhere to normative EV maximization when evaluating choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Rather, differences emerge in risk preferences, a latent construct depicting how risk-seeking or risk-averse an individual is <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dave et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pennings &amp; Garcia, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Weber &amp; Milliman, 1997)</ref>. While there is evidence of an association between cognitive abilities and risk preference differences, some studies suggest that this correlation may be spurious, and can be accounted for by the relationship between cognition and decision errors, such as choice inconsistency and randomness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andersson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mechera-Ostrovsky et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Olschewski et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, empirical research has yielded mixed findings regarding whether schizophrenia is characterized by increased risk-seeking or risk-averse attitudes, suggesting that other mechanisms may underlie risky decision-making in schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Purcell et al., 2022)</ref>. A recent, novel theory-the risk imperception hypothesis-attempts to reconcile these mixed findings by positing that schizophrenia is characterized by risk imperception, a relative inability to integrate risk-related information to make optimal decisions, which precedes the formation of risk preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Purcell et al., 2022)</ref>. Converging empirical evidence substantiates this notion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heerey et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Martin et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pedersen et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, many studies reported a difference in risk adjustment between groups. For instance, in one study, individuals with both chronic and first-episode psychosis adjusted their bets to a lesser extent in response to changing probability compared to controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hutton et al., 2002)</ref>. Another study found that individuals with adolescent-onset schizophrenia made fewer optimal choices and adjusted their behavior less according to negative outcomes on the previous decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this work, much remains unknown about risky decision-making in schizophrenia. For example, to what extent are differences in risk-taking due to risk imperception versus other factors (e.g., risk preference)? How are risky decision-making deficits related to psychotic symptoms and functioning?</p><p>Towards better understanding these issues, here, we aimed to (1) examine patterns of risky decision-making among individuals with and without a SSD, and (2) evaluate correlates of decision-making under risk, including symptoms, working memory, and functioning. To do so, we used the Columbia Card Task (CCT), a risk-taking task developed by <ref type="bibr">Figner and colleagues (2009)</ref>, which to our knowledge, has not been used before with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder sample. Importantly, the CCT has several advantages compared to other risky decision-making paradigms, in that (1) as an explicit risk-taking task, no learning is involved in the CCT, and all risk-taking parameters are known or calculable; (2) different components of factors affecting risky decision-making, including probability and magnitude of loss, are analytically decomposable and unconfounded; (3) risk dynamically increases with actions taken; and (4) the task disentangles risk-taking from optimal normative choice, where choices with higher EV are not necessarily riskier <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Figner et al., 2009)</ref>. Past research using the CCT has also shown that decreased working memory is associated with increased risk-seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buelow, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Figner et al., 2009)</ref>, thus creating an opportunity to test this in a clinical sample and examine whether altered risk-taking in schizophrenia is associated with difficulty in holding and manipulating information during dynamic decision-making.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were 33 SSD and 28 non-SSD individuals between the ages of 18-65 years and fluent in English <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>; see Supplemental for additional information on recruitment and eligibility criteria). SSD participants met criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as determined with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders (SCID-5; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">First et al., 2015)</ref>. Non-SSD participants were screened with SCID-5 and did not have any current psychiatric disorder, any current/past psychotic disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalization, or first-degree relatives with SSDs. This study was approved by the University of Rochester's Research Subjects Review Board.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Columbia Card Task</head><p>Decision-making under risk was assessed with the "hot" version of the Columbia Card Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Figner et al., 2009)</ref>. During each of 24 trials, participants were presented with 32 face-down cards on the screen and instructed to maximize points by selecting "gain" cards and avoiding "loss" cards. Throughout each trial, participants were shown how much gain cards were worth (+10 or +30), how much loss cards were worth <ref type="bibr">(-250 or -750)</ref>, and how many loss cards were present (1 or 3). These three parameters were randomized independently across trials. Each trial ended when participants voluntarily terminated the trial or if a loss card was selected, in which case the trial automatically ended, and the loss amount was subtracted from points earned in the current trial.</p><p>Following other work using the CCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Schaefer et al., 2022)</ref>, we evaluated two outcomes. First, we quantified overall risk-taking as the number of cards turned over each trial. Second, because the number of cards selected do not directly speak to optimal decision-making given trial parameters, following Schaefer et al. <ref type="formula">2022</ref>, we calculated trial-by-trial deviation from the optimal number of cards to turn over (hereafter, "deviation") that would maximize EV (based on the normative solution described in <ref type="bibr">Figner et al., 2009 1</ref> ).</p><p>A deviation score of 0 indicates that the optimal number of cards were selected; a positive-going score suggests more cards were selected than optimal, indicating risk-seeking; and a negative-going score suggests fewer cards were selected than optimal, indicating risk-aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Schaefer et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>

See Supplemental for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Data were analyzed in R Statistical Software (R Core Team, 2022) and RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020). Following others who have used the CCT in various applications (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Schaefer et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Somerville et al., 2019)</ref>, the two outcomes-number of cards turned over and deviation-were analyzed at the trial level with group, gain amount, loss amount, loss probability, and all two-way interactions between group and the three task variables as the predictors. Categorical variables were sum-to-zero contrast coded. To account for the repeated-measures nature of the dataset, we analyzed the data using Bayesian mixed-effects models with maximal random effects structure (i.e., including a random intercept for participant, random slopes for all within-subjects effects, and all random covariance terms; Barr et al., <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The normative solution to maximize expected value is calculated as !"#$%&amp;' = 32 −</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( !"## %&amp;'(# * *+ )&amp;*+ &amp;,"-+. ,' !"## &amp;,"-+. - + )&amp;*+ &amp;,"-+.</formula><p>. To derive the deviation score used in the analyses, we subtracted the actual number of cards selected from the optimal number of cards to turn over that would maximize expected value (noptimal), and multipled that value by -1. 2013). To account for the fact that the data were right-censored in that trials ended when a participant selected a loss card even though they may have turned over additional cards if a loss card was not selected, we used the censoring function in brms. Regression coefficients were considered statistically significant when the 95% credibility interval (CI) did not include zero. Since data were right-censored, we report estimated marginal means (EMM) and their 95% CI from the respective models. We note that these model-predicted values generally align with the raw data. See Supplemental for additional details.</p><p>Next, we evaluated whether the two task outcomes were associated with symptoms (the five PANSS dimensions), working memory (digit span backwards and sequencing), and functioning (Global Functioning Scales Social and Role score). To do so, we conducted similar Bayesian mixed-effects model previously described that also included a term for each of the variables described above (in separate models), their interaction with group (except for models that included the five PANSS dimensions since it was only administered to SSD participants), their interaction with each of the task variables, and a threeway interaction with group and each task variable. Continuous variables were z-scored in all models.</p></div>

However, non-SSD and SSD participants differed significantly in their degree of risk-seeking depending on loss probability and loss amount ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>). Both groups demonstrated less optimal decision-making when the probability of loss was higher versus lower <ref type="figure">(Figure 2A)</ref>, and when the loss amount was higher ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). However, the degree of deviation from optimal decision-making was more stable across both task parameters for non-SSD participants (a 26.6% reduction in risk-seeking from high to low probability of loss, and a 40.7% reduction in risk-seeking from high to low loss amount) than it was in SSD participants (a 47.4% reduction in risk-seeking from high to low probability of loss, and a 53.8% reduction in risk-seeking from high to low loss amount), meaning that SSD participants did not modify their behavior to the same degree as non-SSD participants.</p></div>

The three-way interaction was characterized by a significant difference in the association between functioning and deviation between the two gain conditions, 10-point gain B=6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present study, we examined risky decision-making with the Columbia Card Task in a sample of SSD and non-SSD individuals. Consistent with past studies using the CCT, all participants were riskseeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Figner et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Schaefer et al., 2022)</ref>. Collapsing across task parameters, we observed no group differences in risk-seeking. Rather, group differences in risk adjustment emerged. While both groups selected more cards when loss probability was lower, the degree of this adjustment was significantly larger in non-SSD participants. Our findings were largely consistent with past studies regarding altered risk adjustment in schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heerey et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hutton et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Li et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Martin et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pedersen et al., 2017)</ref>. Notedly, when comparing risk-taking separately during 1-loss-card and 3-loss-card conditions, we observed no group differences in either risk-taking or deviation from optimal decision. This suggests SSD participants were still sensitive-although to a lesser extent compared to non-SSD participants-to trial variations and changing task parameters, highlighting that risk adjustment, but not risk preference or general task comprehension, may contribute to altered decision-making in SSDs. These findings add to the growing evidence that SSD is linked to a relative difficulty in integrating information and adjusting decisions accordingly, as proposed in the risk imperception hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Purcell et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Contrary to prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buelow, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Figner et al., 2009)</ref>, working memory was not associated with task performance. There are two potential explanations for this discrepancy. First, our sample may have behaved atypically. While there was an overall trend toward selecting more cards when gain amount was larger and loss amount was lower, in contrast to prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Schaefer et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Somerville et al., 2019)</ref>, these effects were not significant. This might mean that our sample relied more on intuition during the CCT, thus reducing the impact of working memory load on decision-making. Second, the role of working memory in altered risky decision-making is largely unknown in SSD. Although past studies have found that digit span performance contributes to group differences in altered valuation of outcomes between SSD and non-SSD participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heerey et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Martin et al., 2015)</ref>, it is possible that motivational or affective processes, which we did not measure, may have had an impact on decision-making over and above any impact of working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Martinelli et al., 2018)</ref>. Future studies are needed to examine the role of working memory, and other affective processes like motivation, more closely in relation to decision-making in SSD.</p><p>In subsequent analyses, we examined the relation between risky decision-making and psychotic symptoms. Disorganized and excited symptoms were significantly associated with increased risk-taking and less optimal decision-making during the CCT. In addition, the association with disorganized symptoms was stronger during trials with a greater gain amount. When considering cognitive functioning in SSD, disorganization is strongly linked to information synthesis and various neurocognitive impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Minor &amp; Lysaker, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ventura et al., 2010)</ref>. For instance, on a sensory processing level, disorganization is related to impaired organization of visual information in relation to context, which is a non-generalized deficit in SSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Silverstein et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Silverstein &amp; Keane, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, disorganization is related to increased random exploration, which stems from impaired evidence integration in a changing environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cathomas et al., 2021)</ref>. Similarly, our findings suggest that disorganization may be related to overall decision-making deficits, where individuals with more severe disorganized symptoms deviated further from optimal decisions in a complex, dynamic risk-taking task.</p><p>In addition, our findings suggest that altered risky decision-making in SSD may be related to functional outcomes, although in different ways depending on diagnostic status. Specifically, the SSD group showed a negative-going association (better role functioning associated with more optimal decisionmaking characterized by less deviation), while the non-SSD group showed a positive-going association between deviation and role functioning. Although both slopes were not statistically significant, this could suggest that for SSD individuals, optimal decision-making under risk is associated with role functioning in a direct manner. Meanwhile, for non-SSD individuals, other important processes might be at play that mitigate the potential impact of risk-seeking on functioning (e.g., cognitive ability, motivation, social skills).</p><p>The three-way interaction between group, role functioning, and gain condition is more challenging to interpret, but could also speak to the importance of behavioral flexibility-i.e., tailoring decision-making strategies to the context-for role functioning, and its reduction in SSD.</p><p>In conclusion, findings from the current study suggest that risk adjustment, but not risk preference, is altered in SSD, providing tentative support for the risk imperception hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Purcell et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Further, risky decision-making may hold real-world clinical and functional implications in schizophrenia.</p><p>Greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in risky decision-making may help to identify treatment targets.</p></div>
