				<p>Episodic memory forms a key source of information to guide our choices in everyday life. However, throughout a lifetime we gather a vast number of different experiencesand most of these are irrelevant for any one decision. How then do we retrieve relevant experiences without relying on a computationally implausible exhaustive search? Based on five key principles underlying the storage and retrieval of episodic memories we propose a framework of Cascading Episodic Sampling (or CASES for short). At the core of this framework is the ability to sample prior experience by performing a random walk through episodic memory-space. Through three naturalistic experiments we provide empirical evidence to support the unique predictions of this random walk. We next illustrate how the CASES framework supports theory integration by providing a parsimonious umbrella for a range of previous methods, findings and models in (memory-based) decision-making and sheds new light on a range of behavioural regularities.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During many decisions in everyday life our behavior in novel situations can be informed through the recall of previously experienced events. But which memories do we draw upon? Many everyday events are simultaneously rich and sparse . They are rich in that any single event can consists of different combinations of what, where and when. The expected outcome associated to any decision typically depends on a complex interplay of which elements are present and absent in a given situation. Paradoxically, each individual experience is sparse: any one situation only contains a small fraction of all possible elements that can be encountered throughout a lifetime. Similarly, any one element occurs in only a small fraction of all experiences. As a result of this sparseness, most combinations of elements are observed infrequently or never occur at all. This combined richness and sparseness of many experiences implies that many decision-contexts are likely only encountered once or (at most) a limited number of times. This uniqueness of experiences limits our ability to rely on statistically learned regularities: for many decisions, there are simply too many possible conjunctions of features with too few previously observed repetitions to allow for a gradual extraction of statistical regularities. Instead, our behavior for these decisions has to be guided by drawing on discretely remembered prior experiences. That is, by drawing on the sub-part of our memory system pertaining to the recollection of episodic memories: memories of specific events <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Tulving, 1972)</ref>.</p><p>Throughout the course of a lifetime, we gather a large store of episodic memories to draw upon when making a decision in a novel context. As only a limited number of these episodic memories may be relevant for any one decision, leveraging these previous experiences requires that we have the ability to determine which memories are applicable to the current situation. That is, we face the computational challenge of finding a few needles of relevant memories in a haystack of irrelevant experiences. Selecting these relevant memories therefore requires us to search through our memory. However, as our memory search is limited by bounded cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Kahana, 2020)</ref>, such a search through a large number of accumulated memories places a substantial cognitive burden on our everyday decisions. Yet in everyday life we possess the ability to draw upon previous experiences to guide our choices, apparently with relative ease. How then do we retrieve episodic memories to guide our choices, without placing an excessive computational burden by exhaustively searching through all our memories?</p><p>Here we address this question by starting from a first principles approach. We build on recent insights in memory-neuroscience and synthesize this research into five key principles describing the functioning of the episodic memory system. We next formalize these principles into a framework of Cascading Episodic Sampling (CASES), which samples previous experiences by implementing a random walk through episodic memory-space. Empirical evidence to support this framework is provided in the form of three naturalistic experiments. In all experiments, participants were first trained to interact with a set of four unique fantasy animals ("Fennimals"). Participants were next presented with a set of four new Fennimals, each of which shared an overlapping element with exactly one previously encountered Fennimal. By systematically varying the features of each Fennimal, we provide behavioral evidence that participants relied on directly and as well as indirectly related experiences in an unfamiliar decision contextsupporting key predictions of our proposed framework.</p><p>The CASES framework details a bottom-up sampling mechanism that mitigates the computational burden of episodic memory-search and provides a computationally plausible model to capture our ability to leverage episodic memories to support decisions in unfamiliar environments. The framework supports theory integration between diverse topics in memorybased decision-making by providing a parsimonious bridge that connects a range of previously distinct theoretical islandsmerging insights from a range of similarity-based models, sequential sampling models, Query Theory and various flavours of reinforcement learning. Finally, the framework sheds a new light on the computational mechanisms underlying a range of previously observed behavioural regularities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principle 1: Episodic memories are stored as a conjunction of features</head><p>At the neural level, an individual episodic memory is stored in the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Squire et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Tulving, 2002)</ref>. Of particular interest is the hippocampus (HPC), a sub-region which functions as a multi-modal convergence hub <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Backus et al., 2016)</ref>. The HPC stores each episodic memory as a distinct (i.e., pattern-separated) representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chadwick et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Leutgeb et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Yassa &amp; Stark, 2011)</ref> in the form of engrams or traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dudai, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Josselyn et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Tonegawa et al., 2015)</ref>. Within the MTL, memories are stored as a set of references <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Teyler &amp; Rudy, 2007)</ref>; that is, each episode is stored as a set of weighted connections between the elemental features that make up the memory, with the strength of the connections determined by the salience of that feature within the memory. This representation of memories as the conjunctions of their components allows the HPC to assign value to configurations of elemental cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Duncan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Honey et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Iordanova et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Iordanova et al., , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Rudy &amp; Sutherland, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Sutherland &amp; Rudy, 1989)</ref> by combining the what, where, and when of an episodic memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Eichenbaum, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ergorul &amp; Eichenbaum, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Horner &amp; Doeller, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We summarize this literature via the principle of conjunctive encoding: individual episodic memories are stored in the MTL as conjunctive representations of the memory's constituent features. We formalize this principle through the assumption that any memory m is stored as a vector of elements, such that m = <ref type="bibr">[f1, …, fF]</ref>. Here F represents the set of all possible elements, with each element f ∈ F representing a different place, context, or time and where mi ∈ <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref> represents the salience of element i in memory m.</p><p>For the remainder of this work, we will describe any single element of F as a feature. Furthermore, we assume that a feature fi may either be entirely absent (corresponding to fi = 0), may be present and maximally salient (corresponding to fi = 1), or can have any value inbetween. Intermediate values thus represent features which are present but are not maximally salient.</p><p>Principle 2: Multiple overlapping episodic memories are integrated into an associative network The next principle relates to the storage of a system of multiple episodic memories. Neuroscience studies on the organization of such systems reveal that features which are shared between memories are consistently encoded in the same neural nodes across experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(McKenzie et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(McKenzie et al., , 2014</ref>. Consequentially, episodic memories with shared features are interconnected via their overlapping neural populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chadwick et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">McKenzie et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Schlichting &amp; Preston, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Shohamy &amp; Wagner, 2008)</ref>, such that two (or more) unrelated episodes may be linked via a mutually related third episode <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Garvert et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Schlichting &amp; Preston, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zeithamova, Dominick, et al., 2012)</ref>. This interconnected coding scheme plays an important part in the recollection of memories. Events which are wellconnected with other memories have a higher probability of being recalled <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Horner &amp; Burgess, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Horner &amp; Doeller, 2017)</ref>, allowing the recombination of previously encountered event details when encountering new experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Shohamy &amp; Daw, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zeithamova, Dominick, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Zeithamova, Schlichting, et al., 2012)</ref>. In turn, such flexible retrieval has been argued to allow the HPC to generalize knowledge across related episodes (H. C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barron et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Shohamy &amp; Wagner, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>We capture this literature with the principle of associative storage, where multiple overlapping memories are integrated into an associative network. We formalize this by assuming that a system of memories can be represented as a matrix M. This matrix represents an associative network and has a unique row for each episodic memory, a unique column for each previously observed feature, and its value Mm,f denotes the salience of feature f in memory m.</p><p>Principle 3: Episodic memory recall is discrete, singular and refractory. While the first two principles describe the organizational structure of episodic memories in the MTL, they do not provide details regarding the recollection of these memories. Experimental observations in both value-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bornstein &amp; Norman, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mack &amp; Preston, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Wimmer &amp; Büchel, 2016)</ref> and perceptual <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gershman et al., 2012)</ref> decisionmaking have previously suggested that these processes are informed by a small number of discretely sampled memories as opposed to diffuse and gradually learned associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Erev et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>These observations are captured in the principle of discrete and singular recall, which holds that the recollection of a memory is a binary affair. That is, following the activation of its constituent features, a memory can either be discretely activated or remain inactive. To prevent interference between the concurrent activation of multiple memories, we further include the simplifying assumption of singular recall: at most one memory may be recalled at any one moment in time (although different memories may be sampled in consecutive periods in time). Finally, we include the assumption of refractory periods on memory recall. That is, we assume that once a memory has been recalled at any one moment in time, it is unable for an additional recall in the nearby future.</p><p>We formalize the discrete, singular and refractory nature of memory recall by assuming that memories are recalled through a two-step function, denoted as α. In the first step, this function determines which memories are a candidate for recollection by representing them in a vector C. This vector has one element for each memory such that Ci ∈ {0,1} determines whether memory i is a candidate. The probability that a memory i is a candidate is stochastically given by P(Ci = 1) = √(miφ t=1 ). Since all features are strictly smaller than 1, we include the square root to re-normalize the recall probabilities. In line with the assumption of refractory periods we assume that a memory cannot be a candidate if it has been recalled in a sufficiently recent previous recall process.</p><p>The recall function α returns a vector r with a one element for each memory. In this vector, at most one memory is discretely recalled, and its corresponding element is represented as a value of 1, while all other memories are represented with a value of 0. If there are no candidates for recollection, then r will consist entirely of zeros. If only one memory is a candidate, then this memory (and only this memory) has a corresponding value of 1. If there are multiple candidates for recollection, then in the second step α selects a single candidate for recall based on the relative strength of each candidate's activation as compared to the strength of activation of all the other candidates. In formal terms, the recall-state of each memory i is determined by selecting a single candidate for recall through a normalized softmax function: P(ri = 1) = (miφ t=1 ) / sum(Mφ t=1 C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principle 4: Upon the recollection of an episodic memory, a pattern-completion process reinstates all its constituent features.</head><p>While the third principle governs the events that lead up to the recollection of a memory, it does not provide a suggestion of the events that unfold after an episodic memory has been recalled. Previous research provides ample evidence for the involvement of the MTL in general (and the HPC in particular) in a mnemonic pattern completion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Marr, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Norman &amp; O'Reilly, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">O'Reilly &amp; McClelland, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Rolls, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Rolls, , 2016</ref>. Upon activation, the HPC reinstates the contents of the recalled memory across the MTL via a process of scene construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Robin &amp; Moscovitch, 2017)</ref>. Such reinstatement of context has been documented across modalities, with supporting evidence for both location-based context in spatial navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Miller et al., 2013)</ref> as well as the reinstatement of temporal context in episodic recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dragoi &amp; Buzsáki, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Manning et al., 2011)</ref>. Of particular relevance is a recent study observing that the HPC-based activation of memories results in a holistic reinstatement of the contents of the memory in upstream neurons in the perirhinal and the parahippocampal cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Horner et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mack &amp; Preston, 2016)</ref>, two MTL regions which implement a predominantly feature-based coding scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ballard et al., 2019)</ref>. We capture these findings in the principle of pattern-completion upon recall: the activation of a memory results in the reinstatement of all that memory's constituent features, including any features which are not directly observed.</p><p>Principle 5: evidence is accumulated over time until a decision is reached While the first four principles govern how memories are recollected in the MTL, they do not govern the integration of potentially conflicting information. The outcomes of selected actions in everyday life are typically subject to noise, and different recalled memories may result in the preferential selection of different actions.</p><p>Capturing the formation of judgements in such noisy environments has been the aim of a range of sequential sampling models (SSMs), such as the drift diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>, decision field theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993)</ref> and leaky competing accumulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Usher &amp; McClelland, 2004)</ref>. Although their implementations vary, these models share a common core: judgements are formed by sequentially sampling the environment for noisy information signals, which are accumulated over time until a critical threshold has been reached in favor of one judgement. These sampled signals are typically modeled as a random walk with a drift, with this drift corresponding to the average strength of the evidence in favor for a judgement.</p><p>We summarize this literature via the principle of accumulated information: during the decision process, recalled memories provide evidence in favor for (or against) the selection of a single action from a range of alternatives. This evidence is accumulated over time via an attractor state network <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Rolls, 2010)</ref>; that is, evidentiary signals are accumulated over time until a single action has been selected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The interaction of these principles implies a cascading episodic sampling (CASES)</head><p>The interplay of the five aforementioned guiding principles provides a ready-made mechanism for sampling prior experiences to inform decisions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref> provides a graph-based representation of this mechanism. As an abstraction, here we assume that a decision-maker observes a stimulus ω, has to select a single action a from a set of alternatives, and that she does so by sampling her episodic memories in discrete time steps. We capture the decisionmaker's memories in two matrices. As per Principle 2, the binding of features within memories is given by the associative memory network M. In addition, we represent the association between memories, actions and rewards through a matrix U. This matrix has one row for each possible action, one column for each individual memory, and Ua,m denotes the remembered utility of taking action j in memory m. Note. The CASES framework as represented in a graph consisting of three layers (A) Matrix M represents the salience of features within different memories, matrix U represents the remembered outcome of taking an action in a memory. The top layers accumulate these remembered outcomes until a critical threshold has been reached. (B) The observation of an external stimulus ω results in a feed-forward activation process, stochastically resulting in the recall of any memory that shares features with ω. Upon activation, these memories return a feed-back signal to all their constituent features through a pattern-completing process. This new set of activated features then triggers another feed-forward process, resulting in the recall of a different memory, which triggers an additional feed-back process and so forth. (C) At any time t, the cascading recall process samples any memories that contains the features activated at t-1. As a result, the cascading process follows a random walk through episodic memory-space (to facilitate visualization, here we simplify memory-space to two arbitrary dimensions).</p><p>The dynamic state of the associate network is represented via two vectors. First, the level of activation for all features is denoted with φ t , which contains one element for each feature such that φf t ∈ [0,1] denotes the degree of activation of feature f at time t. Analogously, μ t denotes the (binary) state of all memories and is a vector containing one element for each memory, such that μm t ∈ {0,1} denotes whether or not a memory m is recalled at time t. Finally, we represent the total evidence accumulated in favor for taking any action as a vector E, where Ea t ∈ ℝ denotes the accumulated evidence in favor of taking action a at time t. This evidence is accumulated until any one element in E reaches a critical threshold τ, at which point the corresponding action will be selected.</p><p>The process of memory recollection is initiated when the stimulus is observed. This stimulus is represented as a vector of length F where ωi represents the salience of feature i in the stimulus. Thus, at time t=1 the set of activated features is equal to ω. The activation of these features next triggers a feed-forward activation process, whereby the observed stimulus may trigger the recollection of previous experiences. We represent this feed-forward process with equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">μ t=1 = α(Mφ t=1 ) (1)</formula><p>Here the recall function α represents the two-stage recall function captured in Principle 3, which yields a vector with at most a single value of one, and all other values equal to zero. If no memories are a candidate for recollection, then the sampling process is terminated. If a memory is recalled, then the total evidence in favor of each action is then updated in line with equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E t = E t-1 + Uμ t . (2)</formula><p>If any element in E has a value exceeding τ, then the action corresponding to this value will be selected for execution. Otherwise, the retrieval process continues to the next time step.</p><p>At the start of the next period, the recalled memory triggers a feed-back process in line with the principle of pattern completion process (Principle 4), thereby reinstating all of its constituent featuresincluding those features which were not present (i.e., had a value of zero) in ω. For each feature, the strength of this feedback signal is proportional to the total (summed) salience of the feature with the recalled memories. Formally, we capture this feed-back process with equation <ref type="formula">3</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">φ t+1 = M T μ t (3)</formula><p>This updated set of activated features in turn results in a secondary feed-forward process in line with an updated equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">μ t+1 = α(Mφ t+1 ) (4)</formula><p>In line with the assumption of refractory recall, α has the additional constraint that the memory which was recalled during the preceding time period is automatically disqualified from becoming a candidate. If a new memory is recalled, then this results in the accumulation of additional evidence in line with equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>. The recalled memory next turn triggers its own feed-back process and so forth. This process continues until either an action has been selected or until the sampling process fails to retrieve any candidates for recollection. If the latter occurs, one of three outcomes may be selected: the decision can end in a state of inaction (which may be a reasonable outcome for some decisions), a choice may be made on the final values of E, or the decision-process can be re-started by again observing the stimulus ω. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of the sampling process, this is likely to result in a different set of sampled memories upon every restart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cascading sampling results in a random walk through memory-space</head><p>The combination of equations (3) and (4) forms a dynamic system of memory sampling. That is, if memories are stored in an integrated associative network, and the activation of a memory results in a process of pattern completion whereby all of its constituent features are reinstated, then it follows that the activation of memory results in a cascading spread of activation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1B)</ref>. During this process the recall of a memory induces the recall of additional related memories, such that the memory recalled at period t functions as a starting point for sampling a memory at time t+1, and so forth.</p><p>A key insight into the dynamics of this cascading recall process follows when visually representing the associative network M as a memory-space ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C)</ref>. The observation of ω first results in the recall of any memories that are sufficiently close to this point in this memoryspace. Following equation <ref type="formula">4</ref>, the cascading dynamic evolves by 'jumping' from any recalled memory to its nearest neighbors in memory-space. Whether or not the cascading process jumps from a recalled memory to any of its neighbors is stochastic, but with a probability inversely proportional to their proximity in memory-space. Thus, the cascading process performs a biased random walk through episodic memory-space; analogous to the drunk man, it consecutively staggers between episodic memories which are closely related in memory-space.</p><p>This random walk is self-terminating, even when no value in E ever exceeds τ: because the same memory cannot be sampled in sequential steps and no two memories are identical, it follows that at any step the probability of recalling a next memory is strictly smaller than one. The number of steps taken before the sampling process is terminated depends on both the value of the decision threshold τ and on the local density of the associative network around the observed stimulus. In familiar situations many memories may exist in close proximity to the stimulus and the cascading recall process may sample a larger number of experiences. Conversely, in unfamiliar situations, the local network is sparse around the observed stimulus and the cascading process is likely to terminate after only a limited number of samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Empirical Test of the CASES Framework</head><p>The exact behavioral predictions of the CASES framework depend on the structure of the associative network M, previously selected actions and rewards U, the decision threshold τ and the observed context ω. However, the proposed random walk through episodic memory-space of the CASES framework yields three parameter-free predictions that, when combined, provide unique and testable predictions to validate the framework.</p><p>First, the feed-forward process outlined in equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>implies that when we are faced with a novel decision context, we do not recall all of our previous experiences and select the action which is statistically most likely to result in a positive outcome. Instead, the cascading search process preferentially samples memories that share features with the observed context and results in the selection of any actions that were positively evaluated during these similar past experiences.</p><p>Second, if these initially sampled memories do not yield sufficient information to warrant a decision, then the interplay of equations (3) and (4) implies that we next sample additional memories through a random walk. That is, CASES predicts that if the action(s) favored by the recalled memory at the first step of memory sampling is not available, then we instead selected any actions favored by the memories sampled at consequent time periods.</p><p>Finally, evidence in favor of different actions is accumulated over time until a threshold is reached in favor of any one action. While the degree of evidence required depends on a free parameter τ, the sequential nature of the random walk predicts a difference in reaction times and accuracy rates depending on the number of steps that the random walk needs to take before converging on an action. All else being equal, actions based on memories that only require a single step in memory-space requires less time to reach τ than actions guided by memories which require more sequential sampling steps. Moreover, as the random walk is stochastic, there is more variability in which memories are sampled during later steps in the walk.</p><p>Here we support all three predictions of the cascading recall process through a novel experimental paradigm ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) in which participants naturalistically engage with previously unencountered stimuli and are given minimal instructions. Across three experiments, participants viewed a series of fantasy animals called Fennimals, which were constructed with different forms (henceforth referred to as the Fennimal's type) and color-schemes/background combinations (henceforth color). The training phase consisted of 5 blocks, each containing the same 4 training-Fennimals, presented in random order. This was followed by a quiz block, where participants had to select the correct toy (out of four options) to give to the Fennimal. Failing this quiz resulted in an additional training block, followed by an additional quiz (and so on). Upon passing the quiz participants continued to the test phase and interacted with 4 new Fennimals. The experiments concluded with a final block in which participants encountered the original training-phase Fennimals and could select one of four toys.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Experimental Design</head><p>Procedure. All three experiments consisted of two phases: a training phase followed by a test phase. During the training-phase, participants learned to positively associate different toys with unique Fennimals. Upon passing a quiz indicating that they had correctly committed all Fennimal-item associations to memory, participants were presented with a set of four new Fennimals in the test phase. Each of these new Fennimals shared either a color or a type with exactly one previously encountered Fennimal. Participants were tasked to choose one toy to give to each of these new Fennimals. As the different items were previously associated with different training-phase Fennimals, this allowed for an inference as to which training-set Fennimals were recalled based on the item selected by the participant. In order to ensure that participants had to flexibly rely on episodic recall during the test phase, we provided minimal instructions to participants; during the training phase participants were not informed about the need to sample and generalize the learned associations to a novel context.</p><p>Participants and power analyses -All three experiments were conducted online via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) with non-overlapping participant pools. Based on the effect sizes observed in pilot experiments we conducted a power simulation for each experiment to determine the minimal sample size required for an 80% power. As these simulations indicated a low minimally required sample size, and for reasons of prudence as well as due to low cost per observation, we a-priori registered a tenfold multiplication of these minimal sample sizes. This resulted in the targeted collection of 100, 200 and 200 participants for the three experiments respectively.</p><p>Participants were excluded from analysis if they had any form of colorblindness (as this may have reduced their ability to differentiate between the Fennimals' colors) or if they minimized or otherwise lost focus on the experimental window during one or more test trials (as this may indicate that the participant had been distracted during these trials). Finally, at the end of the experiment participant once again interacted with the original four Fennimals observed in the first phase of the experiment and were asked to match these Fennimals with the toys they originally liked. Participants were excluded from further analysis if they made one or more errors, as this may indicate that participants did not properly memorize the training stimuli. All reported results are robust to the inclusion of these participants.</p><p>Analysis. In each experiment the training phase consisted of four trials and all three experiments were constructed such that the CASES framework predicted the selection of exactly one toy per trial. In all three experiments we collapsed the data across all participants and tested whether the predicted toy was selected at above-chance levels. In an alternative statistical approach, we controlled for the clustering of trials within a participant by calculated the mean number of predicted choices per participant. We compared these scores to a simulated testdistribution based on 10 6 simulated samples in which we assumed a chance-level performance. These alternative statistical tests yielded identical results as those reported below. We therefore opted to exclusively report the conceptually most straightforward tests in which we aggregated over all participants.</p><p>Preregistration and data-availability. All experimental designs, corresponding analyses, and the exclusion criteria were pre-registered prior to data collection. The preregistrations, experimental software, raw data and analysis scripts (including the alternative statistical approach) are freely available at https://osf.io/fcqhr/.</p></div>

Following from equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>, the random walk is predicted to be more likely to visit memories which are proximately related to the observed stimulus in episodic memory-space, while likely omitting memories further removed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3: Setup and results for the first experiment</head><p>Note. During the training phase participants encountered four non-overlapping Fennimals, two of which were positively associated with the same toy (x), while the other two Fennimals were associated with unique toys (y and z). During the test phase, participants encountered a novel Fennimal which shared a direct overlap with either of the latter two Fennimals (sharing either a type or a color), and then decided which one of four toys to give to this new Fennimal. Results indicate that participants were more likely to select a toy if it was previously associated to a similar Fennimal (the highlighted option, toy y or z depending on the trial), selecting this toy in 71% of all trials. In contrast, the overall statistically most common toy (x) was only selected in only 18% of all trials. Pictured Fennimals are an example only; all Fennimals and item-associations were randomized on a between-subject basis. Highlighted options for illustration only, none of the options were highlighted on the participant's screen.</p><p>Four Fennimals were presented during the training phase of the first experiment, two of which (Fennimals a and b) were associated with the same item (x), while the other two (Fennimals c and d) were each associated with different items (y and z, respectively). The new Fennimals presented during the test phase had either the same type or color as either Fennimal c or Fennimal d. If all training-phase Fennimals were equally likely to be recalled, then participants would be more likely to select the item which was most commonly associated to a positive outcome (item x). In contrast, if our hypothesis was supported and participants selectively recalled the directly similar experiences, then they would be more likely to select the item associated to the one training-phase Fennimal with an overlapping feature (either items y or z, depending on the trial).</p><p>Methods and results. Of the 100 collected responses, the responses of 3 participants were lost due to software errors. Based on the exclusion criteria we excluded 23 participants from further analysis, leaving 74 valid responses. We conducted a one-sided exact binomial test to test whether participants were more likely to select the predicted toy than the more commonly observed toy x. The results were consistent with an increased recall of directly similar experiences: in 71% of all trials in the test phase participants selected the toy associated with the overlapping training-phase Fennimal, while the toy which was most frequently observed during the training phase was selected in only 18% of trials (one-sided exact binomial p &lt; .001).</p><p>Discussion. In line with the recall process outlined in equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>, the results of the first experiment demonstrate that the observation of a novel situation triggers the recollection of directly related prior experienceseven if other items have been observed to result in a positive outcome at a higher frequency. Such a similarity-based sampling of prior experiences is predicted by CASES, but is also consistent with a range of previously proposed models of similarity-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bordalo et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cox &amp; Criss, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dougherty et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">I. Gilboa &amp; Schmeidler, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gonzalez et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Thomas et al., 2008)</ref>. In these models, the decision-maker exhaustively iterates through all her memories and judges the similarity between the memory and the current decision context. The impact of each previous experience is then weighted by this similarity measure, resulting in a similarity-weighted expected value for each available action alternative. Thus, while such similarity-based weighting is built upon different assumed cognitive processes, it yields identical predictions as the CASES framework: in novel decisions, similar prior experiences are weighted more heavily than dissimilar experiences.</p><p>Experiment 2: Participants rely on indirectly related memories when directly similar experiences are insufficiently informative As the preferential sampling of similar prior experiences is consistent with a range of previous models, the results from experiment 1 do not uniquely support the predictions of CASES framework. The random walk of the framework can be differentiated from these models when directly similar previous experiences do not provide usable evidence in favor of any one action. In these scenarios similarity-based models do not offer a clear prediction of which actions are preferred. In contrast, CASES predicts that the sampling process continues to draw upon memories through the application of equations (3) and (4). That is, as the sampling process develops over time it samples additional memories which do not share any features with the observed context itself, but which are similar the previously recalled experience.</p><p>The sampling of prior experiences through such a random walk through episodic memoryspace is consistent with an involvement of the MTL (and HPC in particular) in the co-activation of features which have never been directly co-observed but only share an indirect connection <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Gupta et al., 2010)</ref>. Crucially, the recollection of a memory has been observed to prime the HPC to activate additional memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Duncan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Duncan &amp; Shohamy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Patil &amp; Duncan, 2018)</ref>. Consistent with the predictions of a cascading process, these additionally activated memories may include memories that are only indirectly related to the observed stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Duncan et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, the cascading retrieval of indirect experiences is consistent with a previously observed autocorrelated sampling process whereby earlier sampled memories influence which additional memories are sampled later in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bornstein &amp; Norman, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, this ability to draw upon indirectly related experiences is consistent with previous findings on associative inferences (A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gilboa et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Shohamy &amp; Wagner, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Wimmer &amp; Shohamy, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zeithamova, Dominick, et al., 2012)</ref>: if stimulus A is associated to stimulus B, and B is associated to C, then participants can infer that A and C are associated, even though this pair is only indirectly related. A rich literature on category learning further indicates that participants can extract communalities between groups of stimuli based on directly and indirectly shared features <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ashby &amp; Maddox, 2005</ref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, these findings only provide circumstantial evidence for the behavioral implications of the CASES framework. The experimental paradigms used in these studies typically require a large number of repeated trials and (in contrast to the current paradigm) often include explicit instructions for participants to rely on indirect associations. The observed effects of indirect experiences may therefore result of alternative cognitive mechanisms such as the gradual learning of semantic categories and/or the learning of exemplar stimuli (more discussion of these mechanisms follows at the end of this paper). The observation that we can rely on indirect experiences in repeated decisions and/or following specific instructions thus does not provide conclusive evidence to support our hypothesized cascading recall process. In a second experiment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4)</ref> we extended the above findings to provide such a naturalistic evaluation of the framework's predictions. Methods and results. During the training phase, the four Fennimals were each associated with a different item. In contrast to the first experiment, these training-set Fennimals were paired in two groups, such that two Fennimals shared a color scheme and two Fennimals shared a type. During each trial in the test phase, we restricted the items available for selection such that the items which were positive associated with the overlapping training-phase Fennimals were not available. In this setup, the random walk induced by the cascading recall mechanism predicts that participants would select the item associated with any indirectly associated training-set Fennimal. In contrast, if participants did not rely on indirectly related experiences, then they would instead select any of the three available items with equal probability.</p><p>Of the 200 collected responses, the responses of 3 participants were lost due to software errors. Based on the exclusion criteria we excluded 61 participants from further analysis, leaving a total of 136 valid responses. Participants could select one of three available items during the test phase, corresponding to a one-in-three probability that by chance alone the participant would select the singular item associated to the indirectly related Fennimal. We conducted a one-sided exact binomial test to test whether participants selected the predicted item at an above-chance level. The results were consistent with our hypothesized cascading recall process: during the test phase, participants selected the item indirectly associated with the training-set Fennimal significantly above chance level (49% of all trials versus 33% random chance, one-sided exact binomial p &lt; .001).</p><p>Discussion. In line with the cascading sampling process outlined in equations (3) and (4), the results of the second experiment support our hypothesis that that participants draw on indirectly related experiences when any directly related experiences do not warrant a decision by themselves. It is this key prediction that differentiates the CASES framework from previously proposed models of memory-based decision-making based on measures of similarity. Importantly, this reliance on indirectly related experiences occurred in a naturalistic choice environment where participant's decisions in the second phase of the experiment were oneshot, where decisions were not provided with outcome feedback, where participants were given minimal instructions and where participants had to adaptively recall indirectly relevant prior experiences without being told to do so during the initial learning phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3: Our results are robust to an alternative interpretation and self-replication</head><p>While experiment 2 supports the sampling of indirectly related experiences, there exists potential alternative explanation of the observed results. During the training phase, participants could have observed that the Fennimals in the training set were grouped together: one group which shared a color, and another which shared a type. During the test-phase, participants could have decided to select an item from either of these two groups at random: selecting either one of the two items available from the group that did not contain the directly similar Fennimal, or selecting the only available item from the group that did contain the directly similar Fennimal. Such a cluster-based strategy would yield a 50% chance of picking the item associated with the indirectly related Fennimal, and a 25% chance for each of the two alternative items, which is in line with the observed data. A third experiment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>) was conducted to exclude this alternative explanation of the data. Crucially, this was also designed to allow for a withinsubject comparison in reaction times between trials in which the participants could rely on directly or indirectly related past experiences. In direct trials, the Fennimal shared a feature with the two unpaired training-phase Fennimals (a or b) and participants selected the toy associated with the directly overlapping Fennimal (with two other toys available). In indirect trials, the Fennimal shared a feature with one of the two paired training-phase Fennimals and participants could either select the toy associated with the indirectly related Fennimal, or could select one of two other toys. The results replicated both previous experiments, with participants selecting the toy associated with the similar Fennimal significantly above chance levels (33%) in both the direct trials (79%, indicated by the blue highlighted items) and in the indirect trials (55%, highlighted purple). These results are consistent across all four test trials. Participants were significantly faster to select the predicted item in direct trials than in indirect trials. We observed no difference in reaction times for trials in which participants selected one of the not-predicted toys. Nine trials with response times exceeding 22s are excluded in the rightmost figure. Pictured Fennimals are an example only; all Fennimals and item-associations were randomized on a between-subject basis. Highlighted options for illustration only, none of the options were highlighted on the participant's screen.</p><p>Methods and results. During the training phase, each Fennimal was associated with a different item. Two of these Fennimals (a and b) did not share any features with other Fennimals (mimicking the first experiment), while the other two Fennimals (c and d) shared a color scheme with each other (mimicking the second experiment). During the test phase, two of the new Fennimals shared an overlap with Fennimals a or b, and the toy associated with this directly related Fennimal was available (one of the other toys was removed to prevent experimental demand effects). The other two test-phase Fennimals shared a type with either Fennimals c or d, and, as in the second experiment, the toy associated with this directly associated Fennimal was not available. Note that the training phase of this experiment did not consist of two sets of related Fennimals, excluding the alternative explanation outlined above.</p><p>Of the 200 collected responses, the responses of 5 participants were lost due to a software error. Based on the exclusion criteria we excluded 55 participants from further analysis, leaving a total of 140 valid responses. In all trials participants could select one of three toys, with one of these toys being associated to the directly or indirectly overlapping training-set Fennimal. As before, this corresponded to a one-in-three chance probability. We conducted two one-sided exact binomial tests to test whether participants had an above-chance likelihood to select the item associated to the direct or indirect Fennimals, respectively.</p><p>The observed results supported the previous two experiments. If the item associated with the directly similar Fennimal was available, then it was selected by participants in 79% of all trials (versus 33% chance level, one-sided exact binomial test p &lt; .001). If the item associated with the directly related training-set Fennimal was not available, then participants selected the item associated with the indirectly related Fennimal in 55% of all trials (versus 33% chance level, one-sided exact binomial p &lt; .001). These results replicate the previous findings, but exclude the alternative explanation of the second experiment -indicating that the previous findings are robust to deviations in the experimental design. Furthermore, two permutation-tests indicated that if participants correctly selected the associated item, then they did so significantly faster when relying on a directly similar experience than when relying on an indirectly similar experience (permuted p &lt;.001 with 10 6 samples). We observed no such difference in reaction speeds when participants selected an incorrect item (permuted p = .76 with 10 6 samples). These results are robust to the exclusion of 6 outlier trials where reaction times were greater than two standard deviations above the median.</p><p>Discussion. In the third experiment we replicated the findings of the first two experiments and ruled out a potential alternative explanation. The inclusion of trials in which participants could rely on either direct or indirectly related experiences allowed for a within-subject comparison of both error rates and reaction times. As the random walk through episodic space is sequential in nature, indirect experiences are recalled only after the recollection of direct experiences. This sequential order predicts that the recall of an indirectly related experience will require more time than the recall of a directly related experience. The reaction times observed supported these predictions: selecting the correct response required significantly more time during when relying on indirectly related experiences than when relying on directly related experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The results of the three experiments provides support for the three parameter-invariant predictions of the CASES framework: during decisions in novel contexts with a limited amount of training and minimal instructions, participants relied on similar previous experiences, even when other alternatives were more frequently observed to result in a positive outcome. If directly similar experiences were not available, participants instead relied on indirectly related experiences. Finally, participants were substantially faster and more likely to select the toy associated to a directly similar experience than the item associated to an indirectly associated experience.</p><p>While our findings provide evidence supporting the cascading sampling of memories through a random walk in episodic memory-space, our naturalistic experimental paradigm is subject to a number of limitations. Due to the online nature of the experiments, we had limited experimental control over the participant's environment. While we excluded any participants who minimized the experimental interface during the test trials, nonetheless an online environment potentially induces a substantially larger degree of distraction than a highly controlled laboratory set-up. However, these distractions are unable to explain our results, as they would increase the noise in participant's responseshence reducing any observed effect of indirectly related experiences. Additionally, as all three experiments were of limited duration, participants were only briefly exposed to the different stimuli. While we excluded participants who did not successfully commit all training-phase Fennimals to memory, these memories may be rapidly forgotten as time passes. While this degradation does not negate participant's general ability to rely on indirectly related experiences, future research is needed to test the degree to which much older (and partially forgotten) memories can be retrieved during the decision process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASES Forms a Bottom-Up Mechanism to Sample Episodic Memories</head><p>This paper started by asking how we can draw upon relevant memories from our large collection of mostly irrelevant prior experiences. We proposed that the combination of memory storage in an associative network, together with the cascading interplay of the feed-forward memory recall and feed-back pattern-completing mechanisms, constitute a ready-made sampling mechanism by implementing a random walk through memory-space. This random walk allows for a sample-based mechanism as an alternative to an otherwise computationally intractable exhaustive top-down memory search. The key computational advantage of this random walk lies in its ability to form a contingent sampling strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Biele et al., 2009)</ref>; that is, a sampling strategy where the probability of recalling a memory at step t is contingent on which memory was previously sampled at time t-1. As a result, the cascading recall process visits only a small fraction of all memories throughout the decision processvastly reducing the computation burden of retrieving relevant prior experiences.</p><p>Such a stochastic search strategy dovetails with previous computational strategies aimed at addressing similar problems of high-dimensional search spaces across mathematics, statistics and artificial intelligence. Research in these areas has increasingly demonstrated that a reasonable approximation to exhaustive searches can often be obtained through a stochastic simulationthat is, through the application of a random walk. Such simulated approximations allow for computationally simplified heuristics in cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Sanborn &amp; Chater, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In related literature, the application of a random walk to memory selection has been shown to approximate a Bayesian-optimal evaluative process <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Vul et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Zhu et al., 2020)</ref>, without imposing an unrealistic computational burden on the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Sanborn &amp; Chater, 2016)</ref>. The cascading process matches this conceptual approach and suggests a psychologically and neurologically plausible mechanism that underlies such a random walk. By doing so, the random walk through episodic memory-space allows us to adaptively tap into the (often implicit) predictable and autocorrelated nature of reality. After all, similar actions in similar situations tend to result in similar outcomes, and the best predictor of future states of the environment is typically the environment's recent past. Due to this autocorrelated nature, experiences which are closer in memory-space are more likely to be predictive or informative than more distant ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The CASES Framework Bridges a Range of Theoretical and Empirical Islands in Memory-Based Decision-Making</head><p>The sampling of memories via a random walk in episodic memory-space is situated within the broader context of memory-based decision-making. This field of study merges insights from the intersection of (cognitive) neuroscience, psychology and economics. While this interdisciplinary nature allows for a wide diversity of new insights, it comes at a cost of a diversity in jargon, statistical and methodological approaches and, occasionally, a duplication of efforts in different fields. This diversity places limits on the cross-talk between different approaches, resulting in a degree of theoretical and empirical 'islandism', in turn limiting the degree to which insights in any one area of memory-based decisions can foster novel perspectives on theoretical work in related areas. From a wider perspective, such a lack of integration between diverse theories and findings mimics a wider concern of a theory crisis in psychological research <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fiedler, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gigerenzer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Muthukrishna &amp; Henrich, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Oberauer &amp; Lewandowsky, 2019)</ref>. In the remainder of this work, we argue that the CASES framework contributes to theory integration by offering a parsimonious umbrella theory to bridge a number of these previously disconnected empirical and theoretical islands on the topic of memory-based decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASES relaxes the assumption of mutual inhibition in models of hippocampal generalization</head><p>The architecture of the CASES framework shares a substantial conceptual overlap with the recurrency and episodic memory results in generalization (REMERGE) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kumaran &amp; McClelland, 2012)</ref> and related models that include a 'big loop recurrence' in hippocampal activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Schapiro et al., 2016)</ref>. These models have been proposed to capture the apparently conflicting dual roles of the HPC in both pattern separation and pattern completion. As in the CASES framework, these models are built on the observation that individual memories are stored in the MTL as a pattern-separated conjunction of their constituent features. Additionally, just as in the CASES framework, the activation of a conjunctive neurons results in a patterncompletion process which triggers the activation of feature-coding neurons in the entorhinal cortex, which in turn activate additional HPC conjunctions. This combination of pattern separation and completion allows the hippocampus to engage in rapid generalization of associations learned through single-shot events.</p><p>However, REMERGE and related models (henceforth we will use REMERGE to refer both to the original model and similar recurrent models) occupy a different computational niche from the CASES framework. REMERGE captures decisions in environments with a limited number of features and a constrained number of possible different conjunctions. A crucial difference between REMERGE and CASES lies in the inclusion of lateral inhibition between conjunctive elements in the former, such that the activation of a single conjunction decreases the probability of activation for all other conjunctions. This lateral inhibition is included in REMERGE to prevent an explosion of activation across the associative network, which would result in the activation of all (or a large fraction of) its constituent elements. The assumption of lateral inhibition is therefore included to allow these models to converge on a stable state, thereby selecting a single output for the network.</p><p>In contrast, CASES describes memory-based decisions in environments where the number of relevant prior experiences is limited and where relevant memories have to be sampled from a large collection of mostly-irrelevant memories. In such situations with a sparse mnemonic network, only a limited number of prior experiences are likely to be (in)directly similar to a novel situation. These decisions thus typically lack the fuel for an explosive burst of recalled memories. In contrast, and in opposition to the mutual inhibition in REMERGE, our proposed framework relies on an uninhibited cascade to access additional samples in such unfamiliar decision contexts. Relaxing this assumption of lateral inhibition uncovers the key dynamic at the heart of the CASES framework: the random walk through episodic memory-space. Note that in contrast to REMERGE, CASES does not converge on a singular outcome-state. Instead, different iterations of the walk may result in different memories being recalledand the evidence in favor for different actions is accumulated over time until a decision threshold has been reached. By relaxing this assumption of lateral inhibition between activated conjunctions, the CASES framework can therefore be broadly considered as a generalization of these models to the sampling of relevant memories in everyday life decisions, where memories have to be drawn from a large collection of (mostly) irrelevant experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASES capturesand extends upona range of similarity-based models</head><p>As outlined in the discussion of experiment 1, the first prediction of the CASES framework (a preferential sampling of directly similar previous experiences) is consistent with a wide class of previously proposed similarity-based (SB) models. These models assume that a decisionmaker bases her decision in a novel situation by iterating through her previous experiences and weighting the relevance of each memory based on its similarity to the current context.</p><p>Such similarity-based weighting of experience is consistent with the sampling of memories via a random walk through episodic memory-space. First assume that the similarity between the observed context and any one memory is proportional to their salience-weighted overlap in features. If we take an infinite number of one-step random walks (equation 1) from the observed context, then we can track the relative frequency of each memory being recalled. As the number of these samples trends towards infinity, the relative frequency by which any one memory is sampled will approximate its similarity to ω. That is, in the limit the first step of the random walk approximates a similarity-based model. Consequentially, the CASES framework can be conceptualized as applying a binary and one-sample version of an SB-model.</p><p>The CASES framework offers several novel insights to SB-models. The consecutive steps of the random walk additionally allow for the inclusion of previously documented associative inferences (A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gilboa et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Shohamy &amp; Wagner, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Wimmer &amp; Shohamy, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zeithamova, Dominick, et al., 2012)</ref>: if stimulus A is associated with stimulus B, and B is associated with C, then participants can infer that stimuli A and C are associated, even though this pair is only indirectly related. Such indirect preferences are computationally intractable for SB models, as they would require the decision-maker to not only evaluate the similarity of any one memory to the observed stimulus, but also the similarity of memories to each-other (for second-order associative inference) and so on (for higher order inferences). However, the CASES framework can readily account for such indirect associations, as they follow naturally from the random walk through episodic space described by equations 3 and 4.</p><p>Although a range of similarity-metrics have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Goldstone &amp; Son, 2012)</ref>, the SB models above typically conceptualize similarity based on the Euclidian distance between two situations. Euclidian-distance measures are symmetric: the judged similarity between situations i and j is identical to the judged similarity between j and i. However, there are long-standing empirical findings on the asymmetrical judgement of similarities, whereby the similarity of i to j is not the same as the similarity of j to i <ref type="bibr">(Griffiths et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tversky, 1977)</ref>. CASES is consistent with such asymmetries. Assume that the judged similarity between i and j depends on the probability of recalling one experience given observation (or recall) of the other. If such memory recall is exclusively based on the feature-based similarity between these situations, then the probability that the recollection of memory i results in the activation of memory j is given by Ni,j ∝ MM T , where M T represents the transposition M. This matrix is symmetric, such</p><p>that Ni,j = Nj,i. In the CASES framework this symmetry is broken by the discrete recall of a single memory. By applying a softmax function to memory recall (Principle 3) the probability of recollecting memory i given memory j is proportional to an asymmetric matrix R, which can be obtained by dividing Ni,j by the sum of its rows. That is, in CASES the probability of recalling memory i given memory j is not the same as the probability of recalling memory j given memory i.</p><p>In addition, measures of Euclidian distance do not readily generalize to the high dimensionality of everyday life, as they suffers from the curse of dimensionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bellman, 1961)</ref>. When comparing different memories in sufficiently high-dimensional spaces, all similarities trend to zero and Euclidean distance ceases to be a useful metric to differentiate similar from nonsimilar experiences. The CASES framework instead proposes an alternative measure of similarity based on R: the conditional probability of recalling one experience given another.</p><p>Finally, a key distinction between the similarity-based models and the CASES framework lies in the nature of the memories recalled. In similarity-based models, inferences are formed through the summed and gradual weighting of many different memories. In contrast, in the CASES framework inferences are formed by drawing from a limited number of discretely activated experiences. Such reliance on a limited sample of memories is consistent with the research outlined Principle 3, as well as the previously proposed decision-by-sampling framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Stewart et al., 2006)</ref>. Thus, the CASES framework extends the insights derived in similarity-based models and extends them to fit in accordance with a range of previous findings on the retrieval of experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASES provides a source mechanism for sequential sampling models</head><p>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the application of sequential sampling models (SSMs) to static environments such as (economic) value-based decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hare et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Krajbich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011)</ref>. However, despite their empirical success, static (economic) decisions are typically perceptually unambiguous, and all available information is presented at the onset of the decision processleaving it unclear why there should be any gradual accumulation of evidence at all. While previous evidence suggests that this evidence may be drawn from the episodic memory system <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Mack &amp; Preston, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Shadlen &amp; Shohamy, 2016)</ref>, SSMs do not describe the cognitive mechanisms underlying which memories we evaluate at what timenor do they provide a clear reason as to why SSMs provide such a good empirical fit for economic decisions. In other words, while SSMs offer a description of the process by which information is accumulated during economic decisions, they lack a description of the source of this information.</p><p>The random walk through episodic memory-space offers such a source mechanism. Consecutively recalled memories are likely to be closely related in memory-space. If similar actions in similar situations result in similar outcomes, then this autocorrelated sampling suggests that the signals between consecutive periods will also tend to be correlated. In order words, the cascading process provides a mechanism to explain why there is a drift rate in sequential sampling models. This conceptualization of the episodic random walk as a source mechanism for the sampling of evidence signals during value-based decision-making is consistent with the difference in reaction times observed during experiment 3, where decisions based on indirectly related experiences took longer to complete than decisions based on directly similar experiences. That is, our reaction time data putatively reflects the number of recall steps required to sample directly (one step) or indirectly (two steps) related prior experiences.</p><p>On a conceptual level, the extension of SSMs with the cascading process accounts for a range of observations in value-based sequential sampling research. Decisions require a longer deliberation time if the available alternatives have a highly similar expected subjective value <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Shadlen &amp; Shohamy, 2016)</ref>, and such increased decision difficulty correlates with an increased activation of the HPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bakkour et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gluth et al., 2015)</ref>. This is consistent with temporal accumulation via a cascading recall process: if two or more choice alternatives have a similar subjective value, then (all else being equal) recalled memories do not overwhelmingly favor any one accumulator. As a result, additional memories need to be sampled before any one accumulator reaches a threshold noderequiring more iterations of the cascading process and the activation of a larger number of hippocampal representations. Thus, the random walk of the CASES framework can readily account for the observed empirical fit of SSMs even in unambiguous and static (value-based) decisions where no new information is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASES is consistent withand extendsprevious models of reinforcement learning</head><p>The models discussed above rely on an in-the-moment evaluative process in which (a selection of) prior memories is analyzed. But what if our cognitive processes are instead shaped by a gradually formed set of representations through a process of trial-and-error learning? This is the approach taken by models of reinforcement learning (RL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998)</ref> and related models of statistical learning. While the menagerie of proposed RL models is far too diverse to be fully captured byor even consistent with -the cascading recall process, there is a shared conceptual core between the CASES framework and RL models: as the number of experiences increase, actions will be gradually adapted to reflect accrued knowledge. In RL models this learning takes place through the updating of statistical decision values, whereas in CASES this learning occurs via the enrichment of the associative network. This common core allows the CASES framework to particular insights into two flavors of RL: successor representation RL and episodic deep RL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Successor representation reinforcement learning</head><p>Models of RL have traditionally been designed with the assumptions of a low-dimensional state-space and high number of repetitions. However, recent years have seen an increased traction of RL-based models which are designed to mitigate these assumptions. Of particular interest is successor representation reinforcement learning (SR-RL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dayan, 1993)</ref>, in which the agent tracks the probability of transitioning from the current state of the environment to any future state. At the core of SR-RL lies the representation of a successor matrix S, such that Si,j that denotes the probability of transferring from state i to state j.</p><p>The values of this matrix are observed through repeated interactions with the environment, where many repeated transitions eventually coalesce into a stable matrix S. While computationally and conceptually straightforward, the development of S requires a large number of repeated encounters for each state of the environment; an assumption that may not hold during everyday life, where experiences (that is, states of the environment) are both unique, rich and sparse. Thus, in many everyday contexts, there are simply too many states, encountered too infrequently, to allow the estimation of all elements of S.</p><p>However, the ability of the cascading process to perform a random walk through memoryspace offers potential mitigation to this issue of experiential scarcity. Instead of relying on S to represent the observed states of the world, it could be supplanted with a matrix describing the probability of transitioning between remembered instances of different states. That is, S can be substituted by the memory-transition matrix R, introduced above. Note that these two matrices have an important distinction: whereas S represents the learned (but perfectly remembered) probability of transitioning between two (latent) states, R represents the probability of recalling one experience given the recollection of a different experience. Nonetheless, if we include the assumption that any experiences drawn from the same state of the environment are more likely to share features with each other than with memories drawn from different states, then sequential draws from R offer an approximation of S.</p><p>The reliance on sampled memories matches recent observations highlighting a crucial role of the MTL in the representation of S <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Lengyel &amp; Dayan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Momennejad et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Stachenfeld et al., 2017)</ref>. This overlap suggests that instead of learning this predictive matrix through repeated observation, we could initially approximate this transition matrix via cascadebased simulation -as a result making optimal use of our (limited) set of relevant memories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Episodic (deep) reinforcement learning</head><p>A second contribution of the CASES model to the field of RL-models is related to recent work on episodic deep reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Botvinick et al., 2019)</ref> and other versions of episodic reinforcement learning, including the use of memory traces . In these implementations of RL, the agent does not store previously observed events into a set of statistical decision values, but instead maintains a non-parametric cache of memories. That is, the agent maintains an episodic memory store in the form of a list of previously encountered states, actions, and observed rewards. During novel decisions, the agent iterates through this store to compare the similarity between each remembered state and the current state. This similarity is then applied to the remembered action and outcome, resulting in a similarityweighted expected value for each action.</p><p>Interestingly, although derived independently from the similarity-based models discussed above, these models apply a conceptually identical approach: the application of a similarityweighted statistical function to inform current decisions by exhaustively searching through previously experienced individual episodes. While this class of RL models mitigates the richness-and uniqueness-related issues of "classical" RL, their reliance on a memory-bymemory evaluation of similarity to the current context introduces the same limitations faced by models based on the judgment of similarity, as discussed above. Accordingly, the CASES framework adds to this literature in the same way as it does to the topic of similarity-based models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASES provides a retrieval mechanism for Query Theory</head><p>In the current framework, the recollection of previous experiences is a dynamic process in which the recall of memories at any point in time influences which memories are retrieved during consecutive moments. Such a temporal interdependence of memory-sampling is consistent with Query Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Johnson et al., 2007)</ref>, which proposes that (value-based) decisions are formed by repeatedly probing (querying) our memory for relevant experiences. The results of these queries then shape the next set of queries and so forth. Originally formulated to capture the endowment effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Johnson et al., 2007)</ref>, Query Theory has since yielded insights into both temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Weber et al., 2007)</ref> as well as framing effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hardisty et al., 2010)</ref>. Recent work has suggested that a combination of Query Theory and sequential sampling models provides a particularly good fit for the sampling of (semantic) considerations in a range of naturalistic decisions, beating out a large number of competing models <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Zhao et al., 2022)</ref>. However, despite these empirical successes, the cognitive mechanism underlying that underlie the formation of queries is poorly understood; what process determines which queries to draw?</p><p>Although the empirical predictions of Query Theory are typically validated using semantic recall tasks, its sequential sampling process is conceptually closely related to the interdependence in episodic recall proposed in the CASES framework (a discussion on the interplay between episodic and semantic follows below). Within the context of episodic memory retrieval, such interdependent recall of previous experiences is consistent with the random walk of the CASES framework. Due to the pattern-completing process, the retrieval of experiences at any one moment in time predicts the retrieval of subsequent experiences. The CASES framework therefore offers a plausible set of neural and computational mechanisms that give rise to this interdependence in the sampling of episodic memories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Limitations of a Random Walk Offers Novel Insights into a Range of Behavioral Regularities in Memory-Based Decisions</head><p>While the cascading sampling process offers a computationally tractable and bottom-up alternative to an exhaustive top-down search through our episodic memories, it does so at a cost. By sampling a limited set of previous experiences, the random walk through episodic memory space may not visit (i.e., retrieve) all relevant memories. As a consequence, the random walk introduces a number of distortions to the retrieval process. Here we argue that these distortions originating from the random walk process offers new insights into a range of well-known behavioral regularities commonly observed across a range decision contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The cascading process samples a limited number of discretely recalled experiences</head><p>A range of previous work has illustrated how a wide range of observed behavioral regularities results from our reliance on a limited sample of our prior experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Erev et al., 2023)</ref>. The regularities include the difference in behaviour between decisions-from-description and decisions-from-experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Biele et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009)</ref>, our propensity for probability-matching in risky choices (G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barron &amp; Erev, 2003)</ref>, the hyperbolic discounting of future rewards, the diminishing marginal utility of wealth, loss aversion, the overweighting of small probabilities and underweighting of large probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Stewart, 2009)</ref> and the wavy recency effect of experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Plonsky et al., 2015)</ref>. The cascading recall process offers both a cognitive mechanism and a rationale to support such limited sampling: the reliance on a limited number of experiences reflects a cognitive strategy to the relative scarcity of relevant memories in everyday life, where we typically only have but a few relevant (in)directly related experiences to draw upon. In order to account for this scarcity, a decision-maker can adopt an adaptive sampling strategy through which only a small number of available experiences are recalled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cascading sampling results stochastic choices</head><p>In contrast to 'traditional' models that rely on deterministic preferences to derive predictions of human behavior, long-standing research has demonstrated the inherently probabilistic nature of choice-behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993)</ref>. Consequentially, recent observations indicate that stochastic models of preferential decisions provide a consistently better fit of behavioral data than deterministic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Rieskamp, 2008)</ref>. The CASES framework offers a computational explanation for this stochasticity. By its very nature, the random walk implies a stochastic sampling process. As a result, different iterations of the cascading process may result in different sets of sampled memoriesin turn resulting in different selected actions. The framework thereby offers an environmentally meta-rational explanation for stochastic choicebehavior: the observed stochasticity of (human) decision-behavior is not a bug but the result of a mnemonic strategy that reduces the computational demand of an exhaustive memory search in favor of the stochastic sampling of a limited number of prior experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cascading sampling results in framing effects</head><p>Similarly, long-standing research has highlighted the existence of framing and anchoring effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">, 1981</ref>, whereby small changes in a decision context translate to a different set of selected actions or judgements. This impact of contextual features offers a valuable clue regarding puzzling recent findings on the instability of economic preferences. In contrast to a (frequently implicitly assumed) stable nature of preferences, individual choice preferences have been shown to be deeply context-dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Galizzi &amp; Navarro-Martinez, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Loewenstein, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Slovic, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Stewart et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Vlaev et al., 2011)</ref>, and measured preferences differ depending on the methodology through which they are elicited <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Pedroni et al., 2017)</ref>. Such context-dependence readily follows from the stochastic nature of the random walk through episodic memory-space: different elicitation methods offer different decision contextsand hence result in different sets of sampled experience and different selected actions. Small and seemingly unimportant changes in the decision context ω may result in a different memory being recalled at the first step of the random walk. In turn, this different initial path has a large impact on which memories are sampled throughout consecutive steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cascading sampling induces a representativeness heuristic</head><p>A well-documented regularity in the formation of (probabilistic) judgements is the representativeness heuristic and the associated neglect of base-rate information <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1972)</ref> and the conjunction fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1983)</ref>. By preferentially sampling similar previous experiences, the random walk through episodic memory-space offers a putative mechanism underlying these regularities. Imagine 100 memories, 90 of which are far-removed in memory-space from the current context and favor action A, whilst 10 memories are closer to the current context and favor action B. By selectively sampling memories from the second group, the cascading process has a high probability of favoring action Beven though the vast majority of prior experiences favor action A. Additionally, when observing a context containing both features c and d, the cascading process is more likely to recall memories containing both of these features than any memories containing either c or d. As a result, the cascading process samples memories as if the conjoint probability c and d is larger than both the occurrence of either c or da clear example of the conjunction fallacy. The ability of the CASES framework to account for these behavioral regularities suggests that these distortions in our judgments are a logical consequence from our need to preferentially selected a limited number of relevant prior experiences from a large collection of irrelevant memories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling-to-threshold induces an availability heuristic</head><p>A related literature has developed around the availability heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. That is, the meta-cognitive information provided by "the ease by with instances or occurrences can be brought to mind". Such availability follows from the CASES framework. As evidence is accumulated until a decision threshold has been reached, the ease through which memories are recalled provide a potential cognitive mechanism underpinning this heuristic. Depending on the level of this threshold, possibly only a small fraction of all memories will be sampled during the decision process, lending an exaggerated importance to memories which are activated early in the cascading chain. That is, to memories which are relatively similar to the decision context and thus come to mind more readily. For sufficiently low levels of the decision threshold τ, the recall of these early memories may saturate the threshold, resulting in the decision-maker behaving in accordance with the availability heuristic. Consequentially, the random walk of the CASES framework suggests a putative computational underpinning for the availability heuristic, re-conceptualizing this heuristic as a consequence of a bottom-up memory search process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cascading sampling can capture both fast and slow decisions</head><p>Previous research in decision science has proposed dual-system approaches in which decisionmakers can utilize either a fast and automatic, or slow and deliberative, decision system <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Kahneman, 2011)</ref>. The CASES framework suggests a putative mechanism whereby both systems can be captured though a different parameterization of the same underlying cognitive process, that is, both 'systems' may result from different levels of the decision threshold τ. Decisions (or individual actions within a decision) with a low threshold require a limited number of memories to be sampled before an action is selectedresulting in a fast reaction time and an action being selected on the basis of the availability heuristic. In contrast, decisions (or individual actions) with higher thresholds levels require a larger number of sampled experiences to reach this thresholdresulting in slower decision times, a mitigation of the availability heuristic and a wider 'exploration' of episodic memory-space. Different thresholds can thus result in the selection of different actions at different decision speeds. Consequentially, CASES re-conceptualized both fast and automatic, as well as slow and deliberative decisions as different outcomes of a single underlying memory-sampling system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding Remarks</head><p>In this work we outlined a framework to capture our ability to sample episodic memories to inform everyday decisions. Starting from five key principles regarding the storage and retrieval of memories, we proposed a framework of Cascading Episodic Sampling. The random walk through memory-space that results from this framework allows for the selective sampling of relevant experiences in everyday life. Moreover, the framework offers a parsimonious umbrella to bridge between previous models of memory-based decisionsas well as offering a series of novel perspectives on previously observed behavioural regularities.</p><p>By supporting the bottom-up sampling of relevant episodic memories, CASES fills a limited yet important niche within our complex decision-making machinery. This is not to imply that there are no other sources of information that range beyond the retrieval of episodic memories. Abstract associations and statistical regularities can be extracted across multiple memories, which has previously been explored in a range of theoretical works describing the learning of abstract categories of features, either through the formation of abstract prototypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Homa &amp; et al, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Posner &amp; Keele, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Reed, 1972)</ref> or exemplars <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kruschke, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Medin &amp; Schaffer, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Nosofsky, 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Nosofsky, , 1988</ref>. Of particular note is previous research suggesting that such abstracted information may be retrieved through a random walk in semantic memory-space <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hills et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Howard &amp; Kahana, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lohnas et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Polyn et al., 2009)</ref>, as well as evidence suggesting that these abstract representations of communalities can be used to limit which memories may be evaluated during the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Humphreys et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Osth &amp; Dennis, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Polyn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The combination of CASES with such abstract representations suggests a rich and dynamic system of interactions between the recollection of episodic memories and abstract knowledge; the episodic random walk reinstates memories and their constituent features, whilst the abstract representations bias the activation of features along abstract communalities learned across multiple memories. Future explorations of the interplay between the random walks in episodic memory-space, semantic memory and learned categories therefore offers a fertile ground for new insights into the complex interactions between these systems during decisions made in everyday life.</p><p>The mechanisms outlined in this work are certainly simplifications and omit many of the nuances inherent to the subfields covered in this article. Following George Box ("all models are wrong, but some are useful"), our goal in the current work was not to provide a detailed blueprint of all memory-based decisions. Instead, our aim was to illustrate the core idea that cascading recall is a compelling candidate to underpin our ability retrieve relevant prior experiences to guide decisions in novel situations, as well as allowing for the integration of previously disparate views, findings, and theories of the processes that allow for decisionmaking in daily life. By doing so, CASES offers a novel perspective on the cognitive processes that support our ability to navigate the rich reality of everyday day life. It is our hope that the CASES framework will spark a cascade of research of its own, leading to new ideas and models to explore the varied role of episodic memories in everyday life.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The Cascading Episodic Sampling (CASES) Framework.</figDesc></figure>
