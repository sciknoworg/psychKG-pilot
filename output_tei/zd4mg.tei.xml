				<p>Adolescents take more risks than adults in the real world, but laboratory experiments do not consistently demonstrate this pattern. In the current study, we examine the possibility that age differences in decision making vary as a function of the nature of the task (e.g., how information about risk is learned) and contextual features of choices (e.g., the relative favorability of choice outcomes), due to age differences in psychological constructs and physiological processes related to choice (e.g., weighting of rare probabilities, sensitivity to expected value, sampling, pupil dilation). Adolescents and adults made the same 24 choices between risky and safe options twice: once based on descriptions of each option, and once based on experience gained from sampling the options repeatedly. We systematically varied contextual features of options, facilitating a fine-grained analysis of age differences in response to these features. Eye-tracking and experience-sampling measures allowed tests of age differences in predecisional processes. Results in adolescent and adult participants were similar in several respects, including mean risk-taking rates and eye-gaze patterns. However, adolescents&apos; and adults&apos; choice behavior and process measures varied as a function of decision context. Surprisingly, age differences were most pronounced in description, with only marginal differences in experience. Results suggest that probability weighting, expected-value sensitivity, experience sampling and pupil dilation patterns may change with age. Overall, results are consistent with the notion that adolescents are more prone than adults to take risks when faced with unlikely but costly negative outcomes, and broadly point to complex interactions between multiple psychological constructs that develop across adolescence.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>During adolescence, increased autonomy confers opportunities for independent decision making.</p><p>Although adolescents sometimes make adult-like choices, teens are often confronted with risky choices where their actions can lead to dangerous outcomes (e.g., whether to take drugs at a party, whether to get in a car with a driver who may have been drinking). In such real-world contexts, heightened adolescent risk taking is well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Although numerous laboratory studies have also sought to characterize age patterns of risk taking, the degree to which adolescents take more risks than adults varies markedly across studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In recent theoretical work, we have considered how parameterization of laboratory tasks is likely to influence whether or not the expected age pattern in risk taking is observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Specifically, the way in which participants must learn about risk, through description or experience, appears to differentiate tasks in which adolescents take more risks than adults from tasks that less often evince this pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>To illustrate these two paradigm formats, consider a choice between risky and safe options: 1) an 80% chance of winning $4 but with a 20% chance of winning $0, versus 2) a 100% chance of winning $3. A decision from description (referred to simply as description in this manuscript), would involve merely choosing between these two options, with full knowledge of the probabilities and possible rewards associated with each option. In these types of tasks, at least as typically implemented in experimental studies, adolescents and adults often make similar choices. Conversely, in decisions from experience (referred to as experience), participants make repeated choices from unlabeled options to learn about the probabilities and outcomes associated with each one (e.g., samples from 1) $4, $4, $4, $0, $4…; samples from 2) $3, $3, $3, $3…). Typically, in experience tasks, adolescents take more risks than adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, we empirically test how the same adolescents' and adults' choices vary in description compared to experience formats. In this pursuit, we move beyond examining just the overall effects of age on risk taking to gain insights into psychological constructs (e.g., probability weighting, loss aversion, expected-value sensitivity) that may moderate the effects of age on risk preferences across format (description, experience). Another goal of the present study is to explore age differences in decision processes that might yield insights into risk-taking behavior. To this end, we examine age differences in process measures, including eye tracking and pupillometry in description (e.g., does looking more at the risky option correspond to an increased likelihood of choosing that option for both adolescents and adults?) and how participants search for information in experience (e.g., at what point do participants stop sampling and make a choice?).</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, our results do not provide evidence for straightforward age differences in decision making. In fact, our findings were in some ways counter to our expectations: Broadly, in our sample, age differences in choice were more pronounced in description than in experience. We acknowledge that the absence of significant effects in some analyses may have been due to lack of adequate statistical power, and take care not to overinterpret null results. Nonetheless, we contextualize our findings within a broader literature on adolescent risk taking, and hope that our work can be useful in beginning to leverage ideas from the study of adult decision making to understand adolescence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological constructs that influence risky choice</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability weighting</head><p>The notion that there may be different age patterns in description versus experience echoes a finding in the adult judgment and decision making literature-that adults choose differently based on whether risk information is learned through description or experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. In description, adults tend to make choices consistent with Prospect Theory (PT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. A key component of PT of primary interest in the present investigation is probability weighting, which refers to the idea that probabilities are distorted in decision making. According to PT, people tend to overweight rare (i.e., low-probability) outcomes.</p><p>To illustrate the idea of rare-outcome overweighting, we return to the choice problem described above. According to PT, participants will overweight the rare 20% chance of winning nothing, leading them to favor the safe option over the risky option ("risky" is defined here according to the economic definition: the option with higher variability in possible outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. While PT is the predominant model describing choices from description, research on experience-based choice demonstrates that adults tend to exhibit the opposite pattern of behavior with respect to probability weighting when they learn about risk through sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. That is, in experience, where participants draw repeated samples to learn about outcomes from unlabeled options, adults make choices indicating that they underweight rare outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. In experience, relatively lower weighting of the 20% chance of winning nothing would therefore make the risky option more attractive, biasing participants toward taking the risk. This difference in choice biases based on whether information is learned through description or experience is known as the Description-Experience (D-E) gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Importantly, rare-weighting patterns manifest in differential risk preferences based on the relative favorability of the rare outcome. In the case of the choice problem presented above, the rare outcome ($0 with 20% likelihood) is unfavorable relative to the frequent outcome ($4 with 80% likelihood). In such contexts with unfavorable rare outcomes, rare-overweighting biases decrease the likelihood of risk taking, while the opposite (rare-underweighting) biases increase the likelihood of risk taking. Conversely, in contexts with a rare favorable outcome (e.g., a 90% chance of winning $0 and a 10% chance of winning $32, vs. a 100% chance of winning $3) overweighting the rare $32 outcome would lead to more risk taking, whereas underweighting that outcome would lead to less risk taking. Studies can test for rareweighting biases by comparing participants' choices across a set of problems that vary systematically as a function of rare-outcome favorability. This framework can be applied to real-world scenarios, including those that are relevant to adolescent behavior. For instance, if an adolescent is deciding whether or not to drink at a party, the possible harmful outcome is typically rare (e.g., the rare and unfavorable outcome of getting caught, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig   5   1</ref>, top row). In such rare-unfavorable contexts, rare-outcome overweighting would result in a lower likelihood of drinking <ref type="figure">(Fig 1, top left)</ref> while rare-outcome underweighting would lead to an increased likelihood of drinking <ref type="figure">(Fig 1, top right)</ref>. On the other hand, individuals may encounter situations in which a rare outcome is favorable, as is the case in buying lottery tickets (a favorable and rare outcome of winning the lottery; <ref type="figure">Fig 1, bottom row)</ref>. In such contexts, rare-outcome overweighting would lead to a higher likelihood of buying lottery tickets <ref type="figure">(Fig 1, bottom left)</ref>, while rare-outcome underweighting would lead to a lower likelihood of buying tickets <ref type="figure">(Fig 1, bottom right)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig 1. Illustration of rare-weighting biases in relation to choices encountered in the real world.</head><p>Rare-outcome weighting as a function of decision format has been extensively discussed in the adult literature on the D-E gap (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). In the present study, we explore developmental differences in rare-outcome weighting, a topic that has received little empirical attention, and that may be helpful in understanding age differences in risk taking. Although there is a rich literature on risk taking in adolescents relative to adults, most of the studies in this literature do not include problems with rare outcomes, do not systematically vary the favorability of rare outcomes across problems, or report summarized data that obfuscate age-dependent effects with respect to rare outcomes. However, a handful of prior description studies presented data such that rare-weighting patterns could be inferred, and found that adolescents' choices diverged from PT predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Moreover, some experiencebased studies include only options with an unfavorable rare outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, and adolescents tend to take more risks than adults in these studies. In such contexts with unfavorable rare outcomes, risk taking may result from relatively enhanced underweighting of rare outcomes in experience.</p><p>Additional guidance on possible age differences in choice as a function of task format is provided by a small number of studies directly comparing adolescent to adult decision making in both description and experience. While an early study <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> found that adolescents, like adults, exhibit a D-E gap, elements of the problem set were varied across age groups and the data were not presented in a fashion that permitted contrasts between adolescents and adults. Three other studies, however, provide evidence regarding decision behavior in both description and experience formats in adolescents relative to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref>. In all three studies, relative to adults, adolescents exhibited behavior deemed riskier <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loss aversion</head><p>The present study also offered an opportunity to examine how age differences in choice vary as a function of outcome valence; whether choices involve gains or losses. In description, adults exhibit loss aversion, another component of PT, referring to the idea that losses loom larger than gains that are equivalent in magnitude, and which results in more risk taking in order to avoid a loss than to pursue a win <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Although loss aversion is frequently observed in adult studies of description-based decision making, it is not typically observed in experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The available developmental literature that indexes loss aversion in description has demonstrated that adolescents are as loss-averse as adults <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expected-value sensitivity</head><p>It is also important to consider whether age patterns in description or experience vary according to the relative advantageousness, or Expected Value (EV), of each option, computed as the sum of each possible outcome value, multiplied by its probability of occurring. It may be the case that adolescents' heightened risk taking is due in part to difficulty computing which option is most advantageous <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, in many developmental risk taking tasks, it is not possible to disentangle risk taking from EV sensitivity because risky choices are confounded with EV (e.g., the risky option always has a lower EV <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, so age patterns in risk taking may be partially attributed to differences in EV sensitivity. Prior studies directly investigating adolescents' ability to choose the option with higher EV are inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision processes</head><p>Implicit in examining differences in decision behavior as a function of task format and age group is that the processes that support decision making might also change with age. For several decades, studies of adults' decision making have deployed a variety of process-tracing methods -behavioral or physiological methods that can provide insights into information processing prior to the decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Very few developmental studies (c.f. <ref type="bibr">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33]</ref>) employ process-tracing methods that are commonly used in the adult judgment and decision making literature, which can provide insights into predecisional processing (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>). A present goal was thus to use eye tracking and experience sampling to begin to understand how age differences in processes might relate to age patterns in choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye tracking in decisions from description: Gaze bias and pupil</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dilation</head><p>Eye tracking is frequently used to study decision making in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35]</ref>, especially in description studies, but is less often employed to study choice developmentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37]</ref>. A large literature demonstrates gaze biases, such that adults look longer at options they ultimately select, and that final fixations prior to making a choice are strongly biased towards the chosen option (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>). One study demonstrated similar effects in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. Pupil dilation, which can be measured simultaneously with eye gaze position, provides additional insights into physiological processing during decision making, as it is linked with noradrenergic activity in the locus coeruleus (LC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>). LC activity, and pupil dilation by proxy, is thought to reflect autonomic arousal, evoked emotion, attention or cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling experience: Uncertainty tolerance</head><p>In experience, participants learn about options through sampling, and sampling behavior itself can be scrutinized as a process measure in experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">46]</ref>. For instance, a large number of studies have found that adults rely on relatively few samples when making experience-based choices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), and one recent developmental study demonstrated that adolescents took fewer samples than adults <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The number of samples taken before making a choice is thought to reflect a participant's attitude towards uncertainty, with less searching reflecting a greater uncertainty tolerance, or a greater willingness to make decisions with less information <ref type="bibr">([21]</ref>; also see S1 for a related brief discussion and analysis of Sampling Error).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study approach and hypotheses</head><p>Groups of adolescent and adult participants in the present study were given the same 24 choice problems in both description and experience formats. Problems varied according to the relative favorability of the rare outcome, gain and loss valence, and the relative EV of risky and safe options, allowing us to infer whether psychological constructs related to choice change with age. We also collected eye tracking and experience sampling data to understand how choice processes may relate to age differences in behavior.</p><p>Our hypotheses are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. We expected that, overall, adolescents and adults would take risks at similar rates in description (H1.A.), but that adolescents would take more risks than adults in experience (H1.B.). We also hypothesized that both adolescents and adults would exhibit a D-E gap, and that the D-E gap would be similarly pronounced in adolescents relative to adults (H1.C.). We further hypothesized that more nuanced differences would emerge when taking into consideration problem-specific contextual features, which can reveal age differences in decision-making constructs and processes. In description, we hypothesized that adults would make choices consistent with overweighting rare outcomes, according to PT predictions, but that adolescents would not (H2.A.). In line with prior research, we expected a similar degree of loss aversion in adolescents and adults (H2.B.).</p><p>We did not have a strong prediction as to whether EV sensitivity would vary with age in our sample (H2.C.), as past results have been inconsistent in this regard. Process measures in decisions from description were derived from eye-tracking data, and we expected that adolescents would exhibit similar eye gaze patterns to adults (H2.D.). Our pupil dilation analysis was exploratory, so we did not posit any specific directional hypotheses given the dearth of prior research (H2.E.).</p><p>We predicted that, in experience, both adolescents and adults would make choices consistent with rare-outcome underweighting, but that this tendency would be exaggerated in adolescents relative to adults (H3.A.). Because loss aversion is not evident in adult experience-based choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we did not expect to find evidence of loss aversion in adults or adolescents (H3.B.). As in description, we did not have a strong hypothesis regarding age differences in EV sensitivity in experience (H3.C.). Finally, in examining experience-sampling process data, we expected that adolescents would take fewer samples than adults, reflecting relatively heightened uncertainty tolerance (H3.D.). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision-making task</head><p>Age differences in choice were assessed using a within-subjects paradigm, where participants encountered the same choices in both description and experience formats. Participants were presented with a series of problems requiring a choice between two alternative "point machines." In counterbalanced blocks, decisions were based on explicit descriptive information regarding the values and outcome probabilities assigned to each machine <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig 2.A.</ref>), or on experience obtained by sampling outcomes from those machines in the absence of explicit information about the machine values or probabilities <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig 2.B.)</ref>.</p><p>Each of the problems used in the task was presented in both formats, in pseudo-random order.</p><p>Participants completed a cognitively demanding filler task (Go/No-Go Continuous Performance <ref type="table">Task)</ref> between description and experience blocks to limit the likelihood of any carryover effects from problems encountered in the first-round format. sampled from the machines as many times as they wanted. After each sample, an outcome from that machine was drawn based on the underlying probability distribution and shown for 1s. Participants pressed enter to indicate they were ready to make their final decision and then indicated their choice on the final decision screen.</p><p>Decision Problems. In the present study, problems always included one risky option (a machine that produces a likely outcome paired with a rare outcome) and one safe option (a machine with one fixed outcome), as this type of problem is most likely to evince a D-E gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The 24 problems are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>. Four of the problems (1, 7, 13, and 19) originated from a seminal study on the D-E gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and have since been used in many D-E gap studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These four problems are also listed as the example problems in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. Our larger, more variable problem set preserved the core dimensions of the original problems, and varied according to rare-outcome favorability (favorable rare outcome or unfavorable rare outcome) and valence (gain or loss; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref>). This always consistent with the valence of the safe outcome). Finally, we varied the relative EV of risky and safe options: In some problems, the EV of the risky option was higher than the safe option, in some problems the opposite was true, and in some problems risky and safe options had the same EV. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability estimation</head><p>As a validity check on participants' ability to form outcome probability estimates from experience sampling, participants completed a probability estimation task (see S1). Adolescents performed similarly to adults on this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye tracking setup</head><p>To better understand decision processes in description, we measured eye gaze and pupil size using a Tobii T60XL eye-tracking system at 60hz. The environment (lighting, sound) was controlled across participants, and stimulus positioning (the position of the risky vs. safe option on the left vs. right;</p><p>the position of the point values and probabilities on the left vs. right and top vs. bottom) was randomized to account for biases in gaze patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>After obtaining written informed consent from adult participants, and written parental consent and child assent from adolescents, decisions from description and experience were administered in a counterbalanced fashion, with the Go/No-Go filler task separating choice formats. The probability estimation task always followed both decision formats. Finally, participants were asked a series of questions about the instructions (see S1) to ensure understanding. All procedures were approved by the Temple University Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Analyses were run in R version 3.5.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[49]</ref>. We assessed the D-E gap by computing chi-square tests on choices in description versus experience, as a function of problem type and age group ( Models used the BOBYQA optimizer, and estimates were computed with Gauss-Hermite approximation of the likelihood with integration points. We plotted all significant and marginally significant interactions for interpretation using sjPlot <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref>. Experience regressions included only trials where participants experienced all possible outcomes (the safe outcome from the safe machine and both the frequent and rare outcomes from the risky machine), 62% of trials on average. The percent of trials included did not differ significantly by age group (see Sampling Error section in S1). Effect sizes were very similar in when regressions included all trials.</p><p>In analyses of sampling (main text), along with RT, sampling bias and probability estimation (S1), we compared group means between adolescents and adults. Before running these tests, we removed outliers (greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range) within each individual's choices and took the mean of the remaining values for each individual. Then, we removed any participants who were outliers for that measure within their age group. We ran t-tests to compare age groups if they met assumptions. Otherwise, we ran non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye tracking in description</head><p>Eye tracking data could not be collected for one adolescent, who needed to wear thick glasses throughout the experiment, or for one adult due to experimenter error. Data were preprocessed using inhouse scripts in MATLAB (see S1) and then transferred to R for use as predictors in glmer models as described above. For 4 adolescents and 1 adult, fewer than 50% of eye tracking acquisitions were valid, so their eye-tracking data were excluded from all analyses. The final sample for eye-tracking analyses was therefore 25 adolescents and 28 adults. Within that final sample, there was not a significant age difference in the number of valid eye tracking acquisitions (Mdnadolescents=87%; Mdnadults=90%; W=263, p=.124). Because we excluded several participants and individual trials in these eye tracking regressions that were not excluded in the behavioral glmer regressions, we reran description behavioral regressions in the subset of participants and trials with valid eye tracking data. All behavioral effects from the full sample were significant within this subsample.</p><p>Computing change in pupil dilation. For each description problem for each participant, we first computed a baseline pupil diameter from the 100ms preceding stimulus presentation. Next, we measured the percent change from baseline diameter in the last 1/3 of the trial, the time period directly before the participant made a choice, and used this variable as a predictor in glmer models. In all regressions with pupil data, we included proportion of looking time in the brightest areas of interest (risky frequent and safe pie charts, which were mostly white in contrast to the black background) as a covariate, as looking more often at these areas would also increase pupil constriction due to increased light exposure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data availability</head><p>Data and analysis scripts will be available upon publication on the Open Science Framework. Next, we investigated whether participants exhibited a D-E gap, making choices consistent with rare-outcome overweighting in description but rare-outcome underweighting in experience. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2 displays</ref> choices for each "problem type" for each age group. In problems with rare outcomes that are unfavorable (types A and B), Prospect Theory (PT) predicts that participants will be more likely to choose the safe than the risky option. Conversely, for problems with favorable rare outcomes (types C and D), choosing the risky option over the safe option would be consistent with PT predictions. Based on the prior D-E gap literature, the proportion of participants choosing the PT-consistent option in description should be greater than the proportion of participants choosing that option in experience. We computed the D-E gap as: Description % Choosing PT Option -Experience % Choosing PT Option.</p></div>

Collapsed across all problem types in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, we found a highly significant D-E gap in both adolescents (X 2 =19.79, p&lt;.001) and adults (X 2 =54.24, p&lt;.001), such that participants chose the PT-predicted option more often in description (Adolescents: 49%, Adults: 60%) than in experience (Adolescents: 37%, Adults: 40%) format. Interestingly, in description, adolescents made fewer PTconsistent choices than adults (X 2 =17.47, p&lt;.001). The overall age difference in decision making did not significantly differ in experience (X 2 =1.52, p=.218). Importantly, this variability in choices across age groups, and within age groups across problem types, encouraged finer-grained trial-level analyses of the choice data, as well as process data, as presented below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decisions from Description</head><p>To gain further insight into age patterns in choice behavior during description, we ran several glmer models, which allowed us to test whether choices systematically differed by age group and/or as a function of contextual variables, while controlling for subject-level differences. In every regression, the outcome variable was whether or not the participant chose the risky option (risky choice was coded as 1 and safe choice was coded as 0). For each predictor, we estimate an Odds Ratio (OR), which can be interpreted as the odds of risk taking for the higher coded level of each predictor variable (or for the continuous variable,</p><p>for larger values of the predictor). Rare Favorability was coded as -.5 when the rare outcome was unfavorable and .5 when the rare outcome was favorable. Valence was -.5 for loss problems and .5 for gain problems. Expected Value (EV) difference was entered as a continuous predictor, computed as the difference in the EV of the risky option relative to the safe option. We started with a base model that included each of these predictors, along with age group (-.5=adolescents, .5=adults).</p><p>Results are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig 3.</ref>a. As expected, participants took more risks when the risky option had a higher EV than the safe option (b=0.16, OR=1.17, p=.002). Participants also took more risks in loss problems relative to gain problems (b=-0.34, OR=0.71, p=.002), evidence for loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Interestingly, there was no main effect of rare-outcome favorability, suggesting that in the full sample (mixing adolescents and adults) there was not a bias towards over or underweighting rare outcomes (b=0.16, OR=1.18, p=.204).</p><p>As observed in the ANOVA analysis, there was no main effect of age group on risk taking in description (b=0.07, OR=1.08, p=.636). We next tested whether each problem-type predictor interacted with age group to predict risk taking. There was a significant interaction between rare-outcome favorability and age group <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig 3.b.;</ref> b=0.96, OR=2.61, p&lt;.001), such that only adults' choices were consistent with the weighting pattern predicted by PT ( To ensure that we were not missing a more subtle age effect in description choices, we tested whether log-transformed response time (RT) varied by age group, and whether age group interacted with problem-level variables to predict RT in lmer regressions. None of these analyses yielded significant age differences in RT (ps &gt;.2; see S1).</p><p>We used eye tracking to understand whether gaze biases or pupil dilation can explain differential choice patterns in description. Consistent with past literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, we found a significant recency gaze bias, such that the last item fixated prior to choice was also more likely to be chosen (glmer model predicting risky choice with a binary variable coded for whether the risky option was last fixated, b=2.98, OR=19.63, p&lt;.001). There was no interaction between age group and last item fixated (b=0.01, OR=1.01, p=.982), suggesting that the recency effect was similarly strong in adolescents and adults.</p><p>We also examined whether participants looked more at the options they ultimately chose, and whether this effect differed with age. We indeed found evidence for a gaze bias, with a larger proportion of gaze time at the risky option predicting risky choice (glmer, gaze time main effect: b=5.31, OR=202.30, p&lt;.001). Interestingly, there was a significant interaction between looking time and age group, where adults' looking time at the risky option was more predictive of choice than adolescents' (b=2.47, OR=11.82, p=.040; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig 4)</ref>. Together, eye gaze results suggest that gaze biases are similar in adolescents and adults, but may be slightly more pronounced in adults (H2.D.). In decisions from description, a significant interaction between the proportion of looking time at the risky option and age group to predict the likelihood of choosing the risky option. Adults were more likely than adolescents to choose the option they looked at longer.</p><p>Next, we examined whether pupil dilation related to risk taking in description differentially as a function of age (H2.E.). We wondered whether whether pupil dilation in the moments preceding choice interacted significantly with age group and behaviorally significant problem-level variables (rare outcome favorability or EV; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig 5.a.</ref>). There was a significant three-way interaction between rare favorability, age group and pupil dilation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig 5.b</ref>., b=-13.33, OR=0.00, p=.003): in adolescents, higher pupil dilation was predictive of more risk taking when the rare outcome was favorable, whereas the opposite pattern was found when the rare outcome was unfavorable. Recall that adolescents took more risks when the rare outcome was unfavorable than when it was favorable. It seems that more dilation coincided with choices opposite to this decision strategy (e.g., when they decide to take a risk on a rare-favorable problem). This pattern also held true in the adult sample, although the effect was not as strong (i.e., the slopes of each favorability condition appear to be more similar). Because adults exhibited the opposite behavioral pattern from adolescents, the opposite-sloping lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig 5.</ref>b. indicate that adults' pupils dilated more for choices opposite to their decision bias (i.e., higher pupil dilation for a decision to take a risk when a rare outcome is unfavorable).</p><p>The interaction between EV difference, age group and pupil dilation was also significant <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig 5.</ref>c., b=-3.68, OR=0.03, p=.033). In adults, less pupil dilation was associated with less risk taking, especially when EV was much lower in the risky than the safe option. Adolescents took more risks when pupil change was higher and the EV difference was large (regardless of which option had a higher EV). In sum, pupil dilation patterns appear to reflect age differences in decision biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decisions from experience</head><p>To understand choices in the experience format, we ran a series of glmer models similar to those in description. In order to control for error in sampling (i.e., that the sampled outcomes differed for every participant), we computed the EV of each option based on the participant's sampling experience, rather than on the true underlying distribution.</p><p>Results are displayed in  In our analysis of problem-level contextual variables, we found a marginally significant interaction between rare-outcome favorability and age group (b=0.61, OR=1.84 p=.052; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 6b)</ref>, consistent with the hypothesis that adolescents exhibit more pronounced rare-outcome underweighting (H3.A.). Furthermore, adults appear to be marginally more sensitive to experienced EV than adolescents (b=0.07, OR=1.07, p=.055; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 6c;</ref> H3.C). The interaction between valence and age group was not significant (b=0.24, OR=1.27, p=.448; H3.B.).</p><p>We next turned to an analysis of sampling patterns in experience to understand how information seeking might change with age. In line with our expectations (H3.D.), adults sampled more than adolescents marginally overall (Mdnadolescents=10. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35</ref> sampling, we found that the degree of error in sampling (i.e., the difference between the sampled distribution and the underlying probability distribution) did not significantly differ with age (see S1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present study, we examined risky decision making in a sample of adolescents and adults.</p><p>Participants made the same 24 choices from both description and sampling experience. Decision problems varied systematically on contextual factors, including favorability of the rare outcome, valence (gain or loss), and expected value (EV) of the risky and safe options. This design allowed us to test how psychological constructs related to choice influence decision making as a function of age group. We also explored possible age differences in decision processing as indexed by eye-tracking measures in description, and by experience sampling behavior.</p><p>Although we found several age differences in decision making, which will be discussed in further detail below, many features of adolescent and adult decision making were similar, or at least effects of age group were not sufficiently large to be detected with the current sample size. Adolescents and adults took risks at overall similar rates in both description and experience, and the D-E gap was significant in both age groups. In description, both adolescents and adults took more risks in loss than gain problems, consistent with the idea that participants exhibited loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the degree of loss aversion did not differ by age group. Further, several of our process measures yielded similar results across age groups. In description, both adolescents and adults looked last at the option they ultimately chose, and there was no difference in description response time across age groups. In experience, although adolescents sampled less frequently than adults, the effect was small and did not result in a significant difference in sampling error. These process-level similarities suggest that adolescents made decisions that were as careful and informed as those of adults.</p><p>However, in further analyses that accounted for variation in choice as a function of problem-level contextual features, we found that adolescents' and adults' choices varied in several respects. Whereas adults made choices as if they overweighted rare outcomes in description-based decision making, which is consistent with predictions based on prospect theory (PT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>), adolescents did not exhibit this bias. In marked contrast, they appeared to underweight rare outcomes in description <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig 7)</ref>. This age-related difference in choice was also reflected in pupil dilation, which was greater immediately prior to choices that were counter to participants' choice biases. In experience, age differences in choice with respect to rare-outcome weighting were more subtle. Both adolescents' and adults' choices were consistent with underweighting of rare outcomes, but there was some evidence to support our hypothesis that adolescents had a more pronounced rareunderweighting bias than adults after controlling for individual differences in sampling experience.</p><p>Our results may also be understood by underscoring the relative consistency of adolescents' choice behavior in description and experience formats. Although the phenomenon was much more pronounced in experience than description, adolescents appeared to underweight rare outcomes in both contexts <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig 7)</ref>. In contrast, adults' behavior diverged more based on choice context: adults chose as if they overweighted rare outcomes in description but underweighted them in experience. Thus, the D-E gap observed in adults is explained by a shift from overweighting of rare outcomes in description to underweighting of those outcomes in experience, while the D-E gap observed in adolescents is driven only by a more exaggerated underweighting of rare outcomes in experience relative to description.</p><p>Together, this rare weighting pattern led to a significantly larger D-E gap in adults than adolescents.</p><p>We also found that adolescents were less sensitive to expected value (EV) than adults in description and marginally in experience. In other words, adolescents were less likely than adults to choose the mathematically advantageous option. However, among adolescents, advantageous choices coincided with greater pupil dilation, perhaps reflecting greater sensitivity to anticipated rewards, or, alternatively, reflecting increased attention or difficulty prior to making advantageous choices. Pupil dilation patterns with respect to EV were slightly different among adults, with greater pupil dilation associated with riskier choices. This effect was especially pronounced when the risky option had a lower EV, possibly reflecting heightened arousal before adults took a disadvantageous risk.</p><p>Our study provides new insights into the roots of adolescent risk taking by examining choices through the lens of the judgment and decision-making literature. In the majority of empirical studies, adolescents take more risks than adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, especially in experience-based tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This age pattern in risk taking emerges even in studies with similar sample sizes to our study (e.g., those discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>), and we did not find evidence for this pattern in our data. Rather, we found that risk taking depended on multiple problem-specific contextual factors that have been more comprehensively considered in the adult decision-making literature than in the developmental literature, and that reflect potential age differences in psychological constructs that drive choice. Of particular interest are our description results with regard to PT, which includes two major psychological constructs that we presently studied: loss aversion and probability weighting. Within description, prior research has found that adolescents and adults are similarly loss-averse [21-23], and we replicated this finding. However, our results indicate that probability weighting in adolescents is not aligned with PT predictions, such that adolescents slightly underweighted, rather than overweighted, rare outcomes from description. Although ours is the first developmental study to directly examine probability weighting by systematically varying rare-outcome favorability, a few prior studies presented data such that rare-weighting patterns could be inferred, and similarly found that adolescents' choices diverged from PT predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Our pupil dilation findings lend further support to the idea that adolescents and adults make different decisions with respect to rare outcome favorability.</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that loss aversion and probability weighting biases may develop independently of one another. Future work would benefit from directly charting the progression of PT biases from adolescence through adulthood.</p><p>Eye tracking is not often utilized in developmental decision making studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>, and our study demonstrated its utility for understanding choice processes in concert with behavioral data. Our eye-gaze data are well-aligned with the only prior study using eye tracking to index decision making processes in adolescents and adults during description <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. Specifically, we found that like adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, adolescents exhibit gaze biases such that they look at the chosen option immediately prior to choice. Furthermore, both adolescents and adults look longer at the option they ultimately choose, but this effect is less pronounced in adolescents than adults. This result suggests that there may be age differences in the dynamics of information integration during decision making. Our study makes a unique contribution by also examining pupil dilation, an index of autonomic arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44]</ref>, to aid in interpreting choice data. Both adolescents and adults appeared to exhibit weighting biases in decision making (rare-outcome overweighting in adults and underweighting in adolescents), and more pupil dilation coincided with choices opposite to that bias. Past work has shown distinct neural signatures when choices are opposite to an individual's decision biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref>, and such choices also evoke increased arousal and effort, along with pupil dilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53]</ref>. In sum, the differential choice patterns in adolescents and adults, paired with different arousal and effort patterns reflected in pupil dilation, lend further credence to the notion that PT biases are still developing in adolescents.</p><p>We also extended work on experiential decision-making paradigms in the developmental literature. The majority of developmental experience studies have involved some variant of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref>, which requires making sequential choices between two advantageous and two disadvantageous decks of cards. These developmental IGT studies typically show more choices from the riskiest disadvantageous deck in adolescents relative to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref>. However, in the IGT, the riskiest deck is also disadvantageous, so it is not possible to tell whether choices are driven by risk preference or lower sensitivity to the relative EV of the decks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In our analyses, which control for the relative advantageousness of risky choices, we found that adolescents did not take more risks overall relative to adults; rather, risk taking depended on other problem-specific factors, and especially on rareoutcome favorability. If, as we have found, adolescent participants tend to underweight rare outcomes more than adults, this would explain increased risk taking in this rare-unfavorable decision context. Based on IGT results, some have suggested that adolescents have a "frequency bias", such that they prefer options with infrequent losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref>, which may contribute to risk taking. The idea that adolescents experience exaggerated underweighting of rare outcomes in experience is aligned with the idea of a frequency bias, but is more general because it can be extended to situations with either favorable or unfavorable rare outcomes.</p><p>During experience-based decision making, we found only subtle age differences in sampling, supporting the idea that adolescents and adults may seek information similarly through experience. A prior study using a similar experience paradigm found significantly lower sampling in adolescence, aligned with the notion that adolescents have a relatively higher tolerance for uncertainty <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. However, the present age difference in sampling was only marginally significant. Further, as a manipulation check, we asked participants to sample from distributions and estimate the probabilities of those distributions (see S1). In this task, adolescents took more samples than adults and performed similarly to adults when estimating the sampled distributions. It is possible that when asked to make estimations adolescents can do so accurately, but that when rendering decisions without this explicit goal, they do not automatically make accurate probability estimations based on sampling. Paradigms that ask participants to estimate sampled probabilities intermittently throughout experience (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref>) would be helpful in better understanding the nuances of age differences in sampling and estimation.</p><p>In both description and experience formats, adolescents were less sensitive to EV than adults, although this difference was only marginal in experience. These results are aligned with prior literature suggesting that adolescents tend to make less advantageous choices than adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">58]</ref>. Moreover, the differential age patterns in pupil dilation with respect to EV provide further evidence to that EV is considered differently in teens' than adults' decisions. However, this finding is counter to a prior study reporting that adolescents are more sensitive to EV in description than adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and to other studies</p><p>showing that there is no difference between adolescents' and adults' advantageous decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>.</p><p>Notably, although relative EV in our decision problems systematically varied, the EV difference between risky and safe options was small and not always obvious. Perhaps the difficulty of identifying the higher-EV option made age differences more pronounced. Alternatively, if participants realized that the EV of risky and safe options was similar, perhaps other relevant contextual factors (e.g., favorability of rare and frequent outcomes) were prioritized in adolescents' decision making.</p><p>Several limitations in the current study should be highlighted and addressed in future research.</p><p>As already acknowledged, our study may not have been adequately powered to detect small effects.</p><p>Furthermore, because our primary focus was to run a traditional D-E gap experiment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>)</p><p>developmentally, we only included problems with rare outcomes (e.g., including an option with 10% or 20% likelihood). Using this limited problem set required us to make inferences about probability weighting based on patterns of decision making rather than using computational modeling to estimate loss-aversion and probability-weighting parameters. Next, although our study did not include a condition with both descriptions and experienced information, such a condition would be helpful in gaining a better understanding of how both forms of information are integrated. It possible that when adolescents combine information from descriptions and experience, underweighting of rare outcomes in decision making is exaggerated. Additionally, because the trial structure differed between description and experience (e.g., sampling in experience took more time than rendering a choice in description), we were not able to compare process measures across description and experience. Despite these shortcomings, we hope the current study inspires future developmental work to incorporate ideas from the adult decision-making literature. For instance, future research would benefit from directly probing physiological differences across description and experience in developmental samples.</p><p>Together, our findings highlight the utility of considering task format in conjunction with other contextual factors and age-dependent biases in understanding age differences in risky decision making.</p><p>To return to the decision-making scenario in this article's introduction, our results suggest that the adolescent deciding whether or not to drink at a party might underweight the rare possibility of getting caught in part based on their prior experience, and based on the descriptions of unfavorable rare outcomes that they may have learned from parents or in school. Although this finding might evoke a grim outlook on adolescent decision making (i.e., that adolescents will underweight the possible consequences of poor choices no matter the mode of information presentation), it is possible that descriptions can be helpful in emphasizing the positive aspects of prosocial risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[59]</ref>. Further, decisions in the real world are much more complex than those in our paradigm, typically involving both descriptions about and experiences with more than two options, with many possible consequences. Future work can build upon these findings to gain a more complete picture of when adolescents do -and do not -take more risks than adults.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Task schematic.
