				<p>Inequity aversion is a fundamental social preference. Concern for others&apos; welfare is yet another fundamental social preference. What do people prefer when maximizing others&apos; welfare creates an inequality that disadvantages them? Prior research has shown that people&apos;s preferences depend on their level of agency, that is, their control over the allocation. Behaviorally, agentic decision makers have been shown to be more likely to prefer allocations that give another person more than them, compared to non-agentic ones. However, the cognitive processes underlying this shift of preference remain unclear. Here, we used mouse-tracking and reaction times to investigate how agency shapes social preferences in such cases. We examined decision conflict, the level of conflict experienced in arriving at a given choice, as a way to uncover whether different underlying social preferences are at play when one has versus does not have agency. We predicted an interaction effect of agency and choice on conflict, where choosing the prosocial option would be associated with less conflict in the Agency condition compared to the No-Agency condition, and that the opposite would be true for the equitable option. In our task, on each of trial, participants were presented with two allocation options: an equitable option (e.g., 50 cents for self, 50 cents for other) and an inequitable and prosocial option, favoring the other participant over oneself (e.g., 50 cents for self, 70 cents for other). Agentic participants chose one option to be implemented, whereas non-agentic participants indicated their preference, knowing that the lab manager had already made the decision. In two studies (N = 586), including a preregistered one, an interaction effect emerged in both mouse trajectory and reaction time analyses. These results suggest that agency alters social preferences during the decision-making process, and challenge traditional inequity aversion models claiming that people inherently dislike inequitable outcomes. Granting agency may be a powerful tool for maximizing social welfare in situations where equity and prosocial behavior are at odds.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The Nobel laureate Amartya Sen tells the story of two boys who find three apples <ref type="bibr">(Sen, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr">slightly modified)</ref>. Boy A immediately takes two apples for himself, leaving one apple to Boy B. Boy B is upset and complains that the distribution is unfair. "Why?" asks Boy A, "How would you distribute the apples, if you were to choose rather than me?" "I would take one apple for myself, and give two to you," Boy B replies. Boy A is now triumphant: "Then what are you complaining about? That's exactly what you got!" Sen's story illustrates how social preferences regarding resource allocation may differ as a function of decision makers' agency, that is, their control over the allocation process. Boy B resents receiving one apple when he has no agency in the decision process, but says he would have chosen the very same allocation had he been the one to choose. This insight that agency alters social preference has been supported empirically. A central finding is that individuals that have no agency tend to say they would be more satisfied to find out that an equitable option was chosen (e.g., if they receive one apple, they say they would rather find out that someone else also received only one apple). On the other hand, individuals who have agency tend to choose prosocial allocations (e.g., they choose to give someone else two apples, even though they receive only one themselves) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Choshen-Hillel et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011</ref>. Previous research has documented an agency effect on decision makers' behavior, but has not studied the underlying cognitive process that might lead to the observed behavior. It has been argued that agency changes people's social preferences by making the prosocial alternative more rewarding, and by making the inequitable alternative less threatening <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011</ref>. However, this mechanism has not been put to an empirical test. Here we investigate the decision process leading to the decision. In particular, in two studies involving mouse-tracking, we examine whether and how agency modulates the degree of cognitive conflict people experience when facing equity-prosocial behavior tradeoffs. We predict that different social preferences are at play when people are agentic versus non-agentic, thus eliciting different conflicts, even in the cases where people reach the same ultimate decisions.</p></div>

If people are mainly averse to inequity, then they should prefer the equitable option of $10 to each. Yet if they care more about the welfare of the other person, then they should prefer that the other person be paid $20, even at the price of disadvantageous inequity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">The role of agency in social preferences</head><p>Research has found that people's preferences in cases that pit equity and prosocial behavior against each other critically depend on their level of agency. Agency is defined as the capability to exert "influence over one's functioning and the course of events by one's actions" <ref type="bibr">(Bandura, 2012, p. 11;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Karsh &amp; Eitam, 2015)</ref>. In the context of resource allocation dilemmas, agency refers to the level of control an individual has over her and other people's outcomes (Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011; de Hooge, 2014). In particular, it was found that agency in the resource allocation process leads participants to prefer more prosocial options to equitable ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Meron et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Shaw et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kardas et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, studies by Choshen-Hillel and Yaniv (2011) elicited participants' preferences between an equal option ($10 to self, $10 to other) and a prosocial one ($10 to self, $20 to other). Participants who were merely asked to indicate their preferences but could not affect the allocation in any way, and thus had no agency, typically showed inequity aversion, preferring the ($10, $10) option. By contrast, participants who could determine the outcomes themselves, and thus had agency, tended to choose the prosocial option ($10 to self, $20 to other). The effect of agency on social preference is observed in children as young as 7 years old <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Shaw et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Why are agentic decision makers (compared to non-agentic ones) more likely to choose the prosocial to the equitable option? According to Choshen-Hillel and Yaniv's (2011) theoretical framework, agency changes decision makers' social preferences. However, this claim has not been empirically tested yet. Here we test this hypothesis by examining the decision process itself. Specifically, we use decision conflict -the amount of conflict experienced in arriving at a given choice -as a way to uncover whether different social preferences are at play when one has versus does not have agency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Using decision conflict to understand preferences</head><p>Examining how people arrive at a decision reveals information about their preferences, information that may not be evident from their final choice alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Stillman et al., 2020)</ref>. Consider two participants that are asked to choose between an equitable and a prosocial option (say, either $10 to each or $10 to self and $20 to other). Making such a decision requires the decision maker to (implicitly or explicitly) integrate personal gain, equity concerns, and prosocial preferences, a process that inevitably elicits some conflict. Now, imagine that Participant A chooses the equitable option over the prosocial one without hesitation. Participant B struggles with the same decision and ultimately selects the equitable option, after much deliberation. Although both participants made the same choice, the level of conflict they experienced differs, suggesting that different underlying processes were at play for each of them. In other words, even if A and B ended up choosing the same option, their social preferences may have differed. Now imagine that Participant A in fact had agency over the allocation, whereas Participant B had none. Everything else being equal, the difference in the level of decision conflict between the two participants may suggest that agency changes not only choices, but also the underlying social preferences.</p><p>According to Choshen-Hillel and Yaniv's (2011) theoretical framework, agency changes decision makers' social preferences through two channels. First, agency makes inequity less threatening <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Choshen-Hillel et al., 2018)</ref>. In the No-Agency condition, the prosocial, inequitable option can be perceived as signaling favoritism and partiality by the allocator. This concern makes the prosocial option less attractive. This concern of favoritism is not present in the Agency condition, where the inequitable allocation is the result of the participant's own deliberate choice. Second, agency makes the prosocial option more internally rewarding by fostering a sense of generosity and warm glow <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011</ref>. Choosing to give more to a social counterpart might simply make people happy <ref type="bibr">(Dunn et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Harbaugh et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Consider a participant who chooses the prosocial option. We expect that choosing the prosocial option would be associated with less conflict in the Agency condition than in the No-Agency condition. This is because of the increased warm glow that agentic decision makers derive from giving to others, and their reduced concern with partiality. Consider now a participant who chooses the equitable option. We suggest that the same forces are at play, but their influence is reversed. Here, we expect more conflict in the Agency condition than in the No-Agency condition. In light of these considerations, we expect to find opposite effects of agency for prosocial and equitable choices.</p><p>Thus, our main hypothesis is that there is an interaction effect between Agency (Agency/No-Agency) and Choice (equitable/prosocial) on conflict. In particular, we predict that choosing the prosocial option will be associated with less conflict in the Agency condition compared to the No-Agency condition, whereas choosing the equitable option will be associated with less conflict in the No-Agency condition. Note that our prediction focuses on the interaction effect and makes no claims about the simple or main effects. A main effect of agency would mean that giving participants agency decreases their level of conflict overall, regardless of their choice. This does not follow from our theoretical model, which posits that the level of conflict depends on both agency and choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Mouse-tracking as an implicit measure of decision conflict</head><p>To quantify conflict in resource allocation decisions, we use a mouse-tracking paradigm. In the past two decades, mouse-tracking -measuring participants' computer-mouse movements while they make decisions -has emerged as a powerful method for capturing cognitive conflict (for a review see <ref type="bibr">Freeman, 2018a)</ref>. In the field of decision-making, mouse-tracking has been used to study topics such as temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dshemuchadse et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Stillman &amp; Ferguson, 2019</ref>), motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Enisman et al., 2024)</ref>, and efficiency-equity conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Gordon-Hecker et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In a typical mouse-tracking experiment, two choice options appear at the top corners of a computer screen. Participants are instructed to move their mouse upward as soon as the options appear on the screen, and to select one by clicking on it. The mouse location is continuously sampled as participants make their decisions. The curvature of the mouse trajectory is interpreted as a "competitive pull" from the unchosen option <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Spivey et al., 2005)</ref> and used as a proxy for conflict <ref type="bibr">(Freeman, 2018b)</ref>. When individuals are conflicted between two choice alternatives, they tend to drag their mouse toward the selected option in an arch closer to the non-selected option, whereas when they are less conflicted, they tend to drag the mouse in a straighter line. Thus, even though participants make discrete choices, the mouse-tracking data provide a continuous measure, at millisecond resolution, of how preference for a choice option develops over the course of a trial. Because mouse-tracking can be measured unobtrusively and does not rely on self-report, it is especially useful for studying processes that participants may not feel comfortable sharing with the experimenter or may not be fully aware of.</p><p>We use the two predominant measures in mouse-tracking. The first is maximum absolute deviation (MAD), the maximum perpendicular deviation between the actual mouse trajectory and the straight-line trajectory between the start and end points. The second is the area under the curve (AUC), the geometric area between the actual and the straight-line trajectory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010)</ref>. Both measures are typically reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Freeman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gordon-Hecker et al., 2021)</ref>. In addition, we also use a more recent approach, prototypical classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Wulff et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Wulff et al., , 2021</ref>. This method classifies trajectories into five prototypical trajectories associated with increasing levels of conflicts. The goal is to account for the complete trajectory shape rather than summarizing it into a single numeric value like MAD and AUC.</p><p>In addition to mouse movement, we also measure reaction time (RT), i.e., the time it takes to react to a stimulus. RT is also considered a measure of cognitive conflict, with longer reaction times indicating greater difficulty in overcoming conflicting responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berlyne, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Stroop, 1935)</ref>. Importantly, because mouse-tracking captures the dynamic process of decision-making, it can reveal hesitations, changes of mind, and competing cognitive tendencies that may not be fully captured by reaction time measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gordon-Hecker et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Spivey et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Stillman et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Stillman et al., , 2020</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Overview of the studies</head><p>We conducted two studies where participants had to make repeated choices between two resource allocation options for themselves and for another participant. The test trials presented participants with equity-prosocial behavior dilemmas, where one option was equitable (e.g., 50 cents for self, 50 cents for other) and one was inequitable and prosocial, favoring the other participant over oneself (e.g., 50 cents for self, 70 cents for other).</p><p>In Study 1, each participant experienced two conditions (within-subject design). In the Agency condition, participants were told that their decision would eventually determine the payments for them and for the other participant. In the No-Agency condition, participants were told that the lab manager would determine the payments for them and for the other participant, and merely had to indicate which option they would find more satisfying, had it been chosen by the lab manager. They knew that their payments depended only on the lab manager's decision. In Study 2, which was preregistered, each participant was assigned to either the Agency or the No-Agency conditions (between-subjects design).</p><p>In both studies, we used mouse-tracking and reaction times to measure the conflict participants experienced during the decision-making process. We predicted an interaction effect of Agency and Choice (equitable/prosocial) on conflict. Specifically, we predicted that the difference in conflict between the Agency and the No-Agency conditions would be higher for choices of the equitable option than for choices of the prosocial option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Study 1</head><p>In Study 1, we used mouse-tracking to test our hypothesis that agency affects the degree of conflict that participants experience when choosing an equitable option vs. an inequitable, prosocial one. Each participant was assigned to two conditions, Agency and No-Agency, in a within-subject design. Each condition consisted of 83 trials, including 40 test trials (included in the analyses) and 43 filler trials (used to create variety, but not analyzed). In each trial, participants were presented with two allocation options for themselves and for another participant, an anonymous social counterpart. In the test trials, on one side of the computer screen appeared an allocation option that awarded the same payment to both participants, while on the other side of the screen appeared an allocation option that awarded a larger payment to the other participant ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1)</ref>. In both conditions, participants were asked to indicate, using the computer mouse, their preference between the two options. In the Agency condition, they were asked to choose one of the options, and were told that their choice on one randomly selected trial would determine their payment and the payment of the other participant. In the No-Agency condition, participants were asked to merely indicate which allocation they would like to find out that the experimenter had chosen, and were told that their preference would not affect the payments in any way. We recorded mouse trajectories and used MAD, AUC, prototype classification, and reaction times as measures of conflict.</p><p>It should be noted that while this paradigm is similar to previously used social allocation tasks (Choshen-Hillel et al., 2018; Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011), it differs in several aspects. The first is the use of a repeated measure. Since multiple trials are necessary in mouse-tracking studies to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, participants made repeated choices, whereas the previous social allocation tasks were one-shot experiments. The second is the choice of a within-subject design, which offers increased statistical power sensitivity compared to between-subjects designs, but with the tradeoff of a potential carryover effect from the previous condition.</p></div>

Our final sample thus consisted of 102 participants (69 female (68%), mean age = 23.8 years, SD = 2.4 years).

In addition, they were told they could win a bonus depending on their choices and the choices of the experimenter (mean bonus = 10.85 NIS, SD = 1.98).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.3.">Main experiment</head><p>Overview of the paradigm: Participants engaged in 166 trials of an allocation task. They were told they had been paired with an anonymous participant (referred to as "Participant B"). In each trial, they were shown two allocation options for themselves and Participant B, on the top right and top left corners of the screen <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. In test trials, one option was always equitable (e.g., (4, 4), where the first number represents the payment to oneself, and the second the payment for Participant B), and the other option was inequitable. This second allocation, the prosocial option, offered a larger payment to Participant B (e.g., (4,5)). The specific instructions depended on the condition, Agency or No-Agency. All participants completed both conditions, in a counterbalanced order. The two boxes represent two allocation options. For each option, the payment to Self is presented in the upper row, and the payment to Participant B is presented in the lower row. Payment amounts are presented as numbers on a coin. In these examples, the option on the left side of each screen is equitable, and the option on the right is prosocial, that is, inequitable in favor of the other participant. The grey line is an illustration of a mouse trajectory. In A, the trajectory is curved, reflecting some internal conflict in the choice process. In B, the trajectory is straight, indicating less conflict than in A.</p></div>

They were informed that their bonus and the bonus for Participant B would be determined based on their choice in a trial that would be randomly selected at the end of the task. To emphasize that the bonuses were not predetermined but depended on the participant's choice, the experimenter displayed two unsealed, empty envelopes. One envelope was labeled "Participant A" and the other "Participant B." The experimenter explained that at the end of the experiment, she would place the bonuses in these envelopes according to the participant's choice in the randomly selected trial, and each participant would receive the envelope with their bonus. Participant B would receive their envelope when they came to perform their experiment.</p><p>The No-Agency condition included the same 83 trials as in the Agency condition. Participants were informed that allocation choices for each trial had already been made by the lab manager, a third party who was not present during the session. They were then asked to indicate which of the two allocation options they would find more satisfying, given that one of them had already been selected by the lab manager. It was made clear that their choice would have no impact on the lab manager's choice or the final outcome in any way. To emphasize this, the experimenter displayed two sealed envelopes labeled "Participant A" and "Participant B" and explained that the lab manager had already placed the monetary bonuses inside these envelopes.</p><p>Each condition block started with instructions being read aloud by the experimenter, 4 comprehension questions, and 4 practice trials. The experimenter then left the room, and participants completed the condition's 83 trials. At the end of the two conditions, participants were presented with a bonus screen displaying their bonus and Participant B's bonus for each of the conditions.</p><p>Trial timeline: At the beginning of each trial, two grey rectangles appeared on the top corners of the screen, along with a button with the word "Start" that appeared at the center of the bottom part of the screen. As soon as participants clicked the button, the grey rectangles disappeared and revealed two allocation alternatives, one with an equitable distribution of resources (e.g., 4NIS for self, 4NIS for Participant B), and the other with a prosocial, inequitable allocation (e.g., 4NIS for self, 5NIS for Participant B) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). The side (right/left) on which each allocation appeared in each trial was randomized.</p><p>In the Agency condition, the sentence "Which allocation do you choose?" was displayed on the screen. In the No-Agency condition, the sentence "Which choice of the lab manager would you be more satisfied with?" was displayed on the screen. Participants were instructed to start moving the mouse as soon as they clicked on the Start button (Kieslich et al., 2020). The trial ended when participants clicked on an option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial design:</head><p>In each condition, participants played 83 trials, including 40 test trials and 43 filler trials (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref> for the full design, and Supplementary File for the full list of trials). The same trial lists were used in both the Agency and No-Agency conditions. The trial order in each condition was randomized for each participant. As predetermined, only responses to test trials were analyzed. Filler trials were originally included in order to avoid automatic responses and to keep participants engaged.</p><p>In 43 test trials, as explained above, one option was always equitable, and the other in favor of Participant B. In 40 "advantageous inequity" filler trials, one option was equitable as in the test trials, but the inequitable option favored the self over Participant B (e.g., (5,4)). In both types of trials, to create more trial variety and make the task less repetitive, we manipulated the value of the equitable option (4/5/6/7 NIS for both Self and Other), the inequity size (the absolute difference between the payments to Self and Other in the inequitable option), and the cost of choosing the inequitable (vs. equitable) option for the disadvantaged side (no cost vs. cost). Finally, in 3 "dominant" trials, participants were presented with two equitable options, where one dominated the other (e.g., (4, 4) or (6, 6)). These trials were used to test participants' attention, as there was an option that favored both the self and Participant B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.4.">Exclusion criteria</head><p>The experiment was programmed so that participants who failed the comprehension test 3 times following the instructions did not proceed to the allocation task. In practice, no participant failed 3 times. We excluded participants who chose the dominated option in at least 2 of the 3 Dominant trials (1 participant) as well as participants who chose the right or the left allocation more than 20 times in a row (1 participant). Additionally, we rejected trials in which participants moved downward after pressing the Start button (instead of upward as instructed), and remained below the starting point for the first half of the trial duration (a total of 66 trials across 27 participants, i.e., &lt; 0.5% of all trials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Analytical approach</head><p>Mixed-effects model analyses were conducted using the "lme4" (Bates et al., 2020) and "lmerTest" (Kuznetsova et al., 2020) R packages. To account for the interdependence of participants' repeated measures, we included a random intercept for each participant in all analyses, based on all trials in the task. We also controlled for the following variables: Cost (1 = cost trial, 0 = no cost trial), Side (whether the inequitable option was presented on the right or the left; 1 = right, 0 = left), and Inequity Magnitude (the difference between the payment to Self and the payment to Other for the unequal option). The variables of interest and the control variables were estimated only for the test trials. In models including an Agency x Choice interaction effect, we used the "emmeans" R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lenth, 2022)</ref> to examine the marginal means when the interaction was significant. This analysis is appropriate for conducting pairwise comparisons in unbalanced designs based on linear mixed-effects model results <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Searle et al., 1980)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Choice data</head><p>To evaluate whether agency affects participants' tendency to choose the prosocial option, we used a logistic mixed-effects model with Choice (0 = equitable choice, 1 = prosocial choice) as the dependent variable and Agency (0 = No-Agency, 1 = Agency) as an independent variable.</p><p>To ensure that the order of the agency conditions had no carryover effect on our variables of interest, we conducted an additional analysis with Agency (Agency/No-Agency), Order (1 = 1st block, 0 = 2nd block) and their interaction as independent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Mouse-Tracking 2.4.2.1. Preprocessing</head><p>We followed common preprocessing steps. Following Kieslich and Henninger <ref type="formula">2017</ref>, and due to expected variability in both start and final cursor positions for each trial, we applied the following steps before calculating MAD and AUC: we applied space-normalization resampling, so that each trajectory starts at (0,0) and ends at (-1,1), in the top left corner <ref type="bibr">(Dale et al., 2007)</ref>. We then applied time-normalization resampling, so that each trajectory contains the same number of recorded coordinates (namely, 101, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref>, regardless of the trial response time. For trials in which the sampling time was not saved properly (about 10%), we applied a uniform sampling correction based on the correctly recorded response time for the entire trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.2.">AUC and MAD</head><p>We used two curvature indices for the mouse trajectory. The first is maximum absolute deviation (MAD), the maximum perpendicular deviation of the participant's actual mouse trajectories from the shortest mouse movement path between the start point and the end point. The second one is "area under the curve" (AUC), the geometric area between the participant's actual mouse trajectory and the shortest mouse trajectory between the start point and the end point (i.e., a straight line) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010)</ref>. Both measures are typically reported in mouse-tracking studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Freeman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gordon-Hecker et al., 2021)</ref>. MAD/AUC indices were Z-transformed before analyses. For each measure, we conducted a linear mixed-effects analysis with AUC or MAD as the dependent variable and Choice, Agency, and their interaction as independent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.3.">Prototypes</head><p>While AUC and MAD summarize trajectories into a single numeric value per trial, novel approaches aim to take into account the complete trajectory shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Wulff et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, in addition to AUC and MAD, we used one such approach, known as prototypical classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Wulff et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Wulff et al., , 2021</ref>. Actual trajectories are classified into five prototypical trajectories based on their shape. The set of prototypes comprises trajectories associated with increasing levels of conflict: a straight trajectory, a curved trajectory, and three "change of mind" trajectories (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 for details)</ref>. Actual trajectories are assigned to the prototype to which they have the smallest spatial Euclidean distance from and receive a "conflict scale" value from 1 (low) to 5 (high).</p><p>To examine the effect of Agency and Choice on the conflict scale, we conducted a mixed-effects analysis based on the cumulative link mixed-effects model <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Haubo &amp; Christensen, 2013)</ref>. We entered the five prototypes in ascending order of cognitive conflict (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>) as an ordinal dependent variable, and Choice, Agency and their interaction as independent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hepp et al., 2021)</ref>. We set the model thresholds to be flexible, and the link function to be logit.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Wulff et al., 2019)</ref>. The X and Y axes represent the coordinates of the prototype trajectories. Black lines represent mouse trajectories. All trajectories start on the black dot in the middle of the X axis, and end at the x in the upper left corner. Prototype trajectories are associated with increasing levels of conflicts from left to right. In addition to "straight trajectory" and "curved trajectory," the set includes three "change of mind" trajectories. Curved change-of-mind trajectories show an initial attraction toward the unchosen option, while maintaining a smooth curvature. Discrete change-of-mind trajectories are characterized by a straight trajectory to the unchosen option, followed by a horizontal move to the chosen option. Double change-of-mind trajectories first move to the chosen option, then horizontally to the unchosen option, and then back to the chosen option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3.">Reaction time</head><p>We calculated participants' reaction time (RT) as the duration between participants' initial click on the start button and their click on an allocation option. To examine the effect of Agency and Choice on RT, we conducted a linear mixed-effects analysis with the log-transformed RT as the dependent variable, and Choice, Agency, and their interaction as independent variables. The log transformation is commonly used in RT analyses to overcome the fact that RT is left constrained at zero and thus violates the linear mixed-effects model assumptions (Baayen et al., 2008).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1.">Behavioral results</head><p>A mixed-effects logistic regression showed that participants were more likely to choose the prosocial option (the inequitable allocation that favored the other participant) in the Agency condition (55%, SD = 28%) than in the No-Agency condition (50%, SD = 31%, OR = 1.41, p &lt; 0.001). These behavioral results conceptually replicate the basic finding of an agency effect (Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011). Next, as this was the first time that the two agency conditions were run in a within-subject design, we tested an order effect and an interaction effect of Order and Agency via an additional regression. There was a main effect of order (OR = 0.23, p &lt; 0.001), as well as a significant interaction between Agency and Order (OR = 6.97 p = 0.001), indicating that the effect of Agency on Choice depended on the order of the agency conditions. We thus examined the agency effect in the first and in the second block separately. Note that while our experimental design is withinsubject, these post hoc analyses are between-subjects. In the first block, participants in the Agency condition chose the prosocial option (61% of the trials, SD = 26%) more than participants did in the No-Agency condition (37%, SD = 27%, OR = 5.34, p &lt; 0.001). In the second block, the effect reversed: participants in the Agency condition chose the prosocial option (in 48% of the trials, SD = 29%) less than participants did in the No-Agency condition (62%, SD = 30%, OR = 0.71, p = 0.012) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3)</ref>. These results indicate that participants' preference in the first block carried over to the second block. The behavioral results indicated a carryover effect of the first block to the second block. We therefore focused the mouse trajectory analyses on the first block only. Results for Block 2 can be found in the Supplementary Materials <ref type="table">(Table S2)</ref>.</p><p>A visual inspection of the mouse trajectories <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4.A)</ref> indicates that, in line with our prediction, for prosocial choices, the mouse trajectories exhibit greater curvature in the No-Agency condition compared to the Agency condition, whereas the opposite pattern is observed for equitable choices.</p><p>We formally tested this using a mixed-effects linear model with MAD as the dependent variable and Choice, Agency, and their interaction as independent variables. We found a main effect of Choice, with higher MAD (i.e., more conflict) for prosocial choices (mean = 0.58, SD = 0.31) than for equitable choices (mean = 0.56, SD = 0.32; β = 0.25, p &lt; 0.001) and a main effect of Agency, with higher MAD for Agency trials (mean = 0.51, SD = 0.25) than for No-Agency trials (mean = 0.53, SD = 0.31; β = 0.16, p = 0.001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4.B)</ref>.</p><p>As hypothesized, the main effects were moderated by a significant interaction effect between Agency and Choice (β = -0.27, p &lt; 0.001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Study 1 discussion</head><p>Past research has shown that agency increases prosocial choices in equity-prosocial behavior allocation dilemmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011)</ref>. In Study 1, we tested whether agency modifies the amount of conflict associated with choosing a given allocation, in a within-subject design, where participants experienced both Agency and No-Agency conditions in two different blocks. We predicted an interaction effect of Agency and Choice (equitable/prosocial) on conflict.</p><p>Analyses of choice behavior showed that Study 1 conceptually replicated Choshen-Hillel and Yaniv's findings (Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011). Participants were more likely to choose the prosocial option in the Agency condition than in the No-Agency condition. However, this effect was driven by the first block. In the second block, the effect was reversed: participants in the Agency condition chose the prosocial option less than participants in the No-Agency condition. These findings suggest a carryover effect of participants' preferences in the first block to the second block (more on this below). Consequently, all conflict analyses focused solely on the first block. In that first block, our prediction was confirmed. We found an interaction effect between Choice and Agency for all the measures of conflict (MAD, AUC, prototypes, RT). Specifically, we found that equitable choices were associated with less conflict in the No-Agency than in the Agency condition, but that the reverse was true for prosocial choices. These results support the claim that Agency does not only change choice behavior, but also the valuation process leading to that choice.</p><p>As mentioned above, the condition that participants experienced in their first block shaped their choices in both blocks. This carryover effect cannot be explained by participants' misunderstanding of the instructions in Block 2, as participants had to pass a comprehension test at the beginning of each block. Rather, this effect could reflect participants' willingness to make consistent choices throughout the whole experience. Consistent behavior is associated with intellectual strength and positive personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allgeier et al., 1979)</ref>, and the desire to be or appear consistent can shape decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Falk &amp; Zimmermann, 2011)</ref>. This might be particularly true for participants who first experienced the Agency condition (where they frequently chose the prosocial option), as they might experience moral dissonance when they transition to the No-Agency condition where they might naturally lean toward the equitable option. Alternatively, this behavior might reflect participants' limited attention span: after deciding on a choice behavior in Block 1, and using this rule of thumb throughout 83 trials, participants might have been reluctant to exert the necessary effort to think about their preferences in light of the new agency instructions.</p><p>This carryover behavior indicates that between-subjects designs might be better suited for studying agency effects, despite the numerous advantages of within-subject designs. Betweensubjects designs are also more ecological: usually, in the context of a specific decision (e.g., distributing end-of-the-year bonuses to employees) an individual is either agentic or non-agentic. It is hard to think of instances in which one is asked to make a certain decision with agency, and shortly after an identical decision without agency (or vice versa). In Study 2, we aimed to replicate Study 1's findings in a between-subjects, preregistered, powered design. Study 2 was also conducted with a population sample from a different country, thus strengthening external validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Study 2</head><p>Study 1 replicated the finding that agency increases prosocial choices and supported our hypothesis of an interaction effect between Agency and Choice on conflict. However, the increase in prosocial choices was found only in the first block, whereas in the second block we observed a carryover effect from the first block. Study 2 was designed to replicate in a preregistered manner the findings of the first block of Study 1. Thus, Study 2 was very similar to Study 1, except that it used a between-subjects design where participants experienced either an Agency or a No-Agency condition. Other minor changes are detailed in the Methods section.</p><p>As in Study 1, we predicted an interaction of Agency x Choice on conflict measures. Specifically, we predicted that the difference in conflict between choosing the prosocial option and the equitable option would be smaller in the Agency condition than in the No-Agency condition.</p></div>

Eleven participants were excluded because they experienced technical difficulties during the experiment and their mouse-tracking data were not properly recorded.

The difference in prototype classification between Agency and No-Agency was higher for trials that ended with an equitable choice (Agency: mean = 2.62, SD = 0.76; No-Agency: mean = 2.60, SD = 0.74) than for trials than ended with a prosocial choice (Agency: mean = 2.64, SD = 0.82; No-Agency: mean = 2.70, SD = 0.87). The simple effect for equitable choices reached significance (ORequitable = 1.12, pequitable = 0.031; ORprosocial = 0.93, pprosocial = 0.227) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 8)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Study 2 discussion</head><p>Study 2 aimed to replicate Study 1's findings in a between-subjects, preregistered design. As in Study 1, and in line with Choshen-Hillel and Yaniv's results (Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011), participants were more likely to choose the prosocial option in the Agency condition than in the No-Agency condition. Notably, our main hypothesis on conflict was confirmed: there was a significant interaction between Choice and Agency for the MAD, prototypes, and RT analyses. There was a larger difference in conflict between Agency and No-Agency for equitable choices than for prosocial choices.</p><p>Study 2's results were weaker than those of Study 1, with smaller odd rations and larger p-values, and they did not replicate for the AUC measure of conflict (though the effect was in the expected direction). This is likely due to the fact that online experiments can be noisier than lab-based experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Peer et al., 2022)</ref>. Online participants might be less engaged and more easily distracted compared to those in the lab, which is especially critical for cognitively demanding tasks and experiments with many trials, as in Study 2. Additionally, we could not verify whether all participants adhered to the request to use a computer mouse, and the use of touchpads could have introduced additional noise. Nevertheless, Study 2 demonstrates the feasibility of conducting mouse-tracking experiments online. The vast majority of mouse-tracking studies have assigned prototype.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">General Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Summary of findings</head><p>The present research examined the role of agency in resource allocation decisions when equity and prosocial behavior are at odds. Previous research has established that decisions in such cases hinge on the decision maker's level of agency. Decision makers who have no agency or control over the resource allocation tend towards equitable allocations. Yet agentic decision makers who have influence over the allocation tend more towards prosocial allocations even when these are inequitable and favor someone else over themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hideg et al., 2011)</ref>. This behavioral tendency was replicated in our new paradigm. Here, we have also shown, for the first time, that the observed difference in behavior is driven by different cognitive processes that depend on one's level of agency. In particular, we examined whether agency impacts the level of conflict experienced when navigating such resource allocation dilemmas. We predicted an interaction effect of choice and agency whereby the difference in conflict between the prosocial option and the equitable one depends on one's agency. Specifically, this interaction is expected because choosing the prosocial option should be associated with less conflict under the Agency (vs. No-Agency) condition, whereas choosing the equitable option should be associated with less conflict under the No-Agency (vs. Agency) condition. Conflict was measured via mouse-tracking and reaction time. The predicted interaction was found in two studies. The convergence of mouse-tracking measures (MAD, AUC, prototype classification) and reaction time in showing the predicted interaction strongly supports the reliability and validity of our findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Agency and social preferences</head><p>The present results shed light on the mechanism underlying the agency-dependent shift in preferences in equity-prosocial behavior. They indicate that when agentic and non-agentic participants choose the same allocation, the cognitive process leading them to these choices differ. For agentic participants, choosing the prosocial option appears to be the default option: it is associated with the least conflict. Non-agentic participants also choose the prosocial option in some of the cases; however, in those cases, they experience more conflict than agentic participants, suggesting that different factors influence their decision-making process, or at least that these factors are weighed differently. These findings challenge traditional inequity-aversion models claiming that people dislike inequitable outcomes per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fehr &amp; Schmidt, 1999)</ref>. Rather, they suggest that inequity is weighed differently depending on context and, specifically, depending on the agency granted to the recipient of the inequitable allocation.</p><p>It has been previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Choshen-Hillel et al., 2018)</ref> that agency reduces the negative feelings of partiality and unfairness associated with inequity, and increases the appeal of the prosocial option through the "warm glow" effect -the positive feeling associated with benefiting others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andreoni, 1989)</ref>. While our results support this theoretical framework, our studies do not allow us to directly assess whether partiality aversion and warm glow are the specific forces at play, or whether there are others. Our design allows us to observe the sum of these forces without identifying their separate contributions.</p><p>The conclusion that agency shapes social preferences aligns with research showing that agency decreases the dissatisfaction reported after someone else receives more than oneself <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Choshen-Hillel et al., 2018)</ref>. In one experiment, participants who completed a task for $3 learned about a counterpart who received $4 for the same task. Participants who were agentic in deciding on this outcome reported greater satisfaction with their payments over five weeks compared to those who had no influence over the outcome. A similar effect of agency on post-choice satisfaction was observed in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Gordon-Hecker et al., 2022)</ref>. Whereas these studies support the idea that agentic decision makers prefer the prosocial option to the equitable one, they have two limitations. First, because they rely on self-reports of satisfaction, their results could reflect participants' willingness to appear prosocial in the eyes of the experimenter. Second, as they focus on the post-decision period, they might be confounded by choice-supportive bias: after a choice has been made, people often change their reported preferences to be more consistent with their decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brehm, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mather &amp; Johnson, 2000)</ref>. By contrast, our studies use an implicit measure of conflict resolution and focus on the decision-making process itself, thus avoiding the pitfalls of post-decisional biases. Together, these findings suggest that agency influences the perception of equity-prosocial behavior dilemmas not only after decisions are made but during the decisionmaking process, thereby shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms driving changes in allocation behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Social impact</head><p>The equity-prosocial behavior dilemmas described in our studies reflect real-life situations that people encounter daily. Consider, for example, a manager who must allocate one parking lot to two equally deserving employees, or a parent of two teenagers who managed to get only one ticket to a Taylor Swift concert. Allocating the scarce resource to one of the two potential recipients would create inequality and be seen as unfair, but not giving it to anyone would be a waste of valuable resources. The agency literature suggests that transferring agency from a third party (the manager/parent) to one of the recipients (worker/teenager) is a win-win situation: it fosters more prosocial and efficient resource allocation, makes the recipient less dissatisfied with the inequitable allocation, and alleviates the original agent from the burden of responsibility and their fear of appearing partial <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Choshen-Hillel et al., 2015)</ref>. Our research contributes to this conclusion by showing that when the decision is handed to one of the recipients, the prosocial option is more appealing, in principle, compared to an equitable option.</p><p>In terms of practical implications, the carryover effect observed in Study 1 is particularly interesting. Study 1 used a between-subjects design where participants were assigned to both the Agency and No-Agency conditions. We found that participants who were assigned to the Agency condition first continued to prefer the prosocial option at similar rates in the following No-Agency condition. This carryover effect suggests that experiencing agency on a given decision ("please decide who gets the extra cookie, you or your brother") could alter recipients' subsequent preferences, even when they are not agentic anymore ("I am giving the extra cookie to your brother"). Overall, our findings reinforce the idea that imbuing decision makers with agency is a simple and powerful tool that can be easily implemented by individuals, such as parents and educators, as well as organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">On repeated decisions and future directions</head><p>In our studies, we used a repeated decision paradigm to examine the impact of agency in resource allocation dilemmas, whereas previous studies have used single-decision paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Choshen-Hillel et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Choshen-Hillel &amp; Yaniv, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Gordon-Hecker et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Meron et al., 2020)</ref>. The persistence of the effect of agency on decisions across multiple trials underscores its robustness. Moreover, this approach paves the way for future research on the temporal dynamics of the agency effect, for example, by asking whether the agency effect decreases or increases with time and experience. Finally, the use of a repeated game structure demonstrates the feasibility of investigating this effect with other methodologies that necessitate multiple trials, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to further investigate the cognitive and affective processes underpinning the relationship between allocation choices, agency, and social preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Limitations</head><p>One notable limitation of our study is the noisiness of mouse-tracking data <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Scherbaum &amp; Dshemuchadse, 2020)</ref>. We believe that the quality of mouse-tracking data could be significantly improved by the removal of trials exhibiting anomalous trajectories (similar to conventions for physiological data such as EEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Luck, 2014)</ref> and pupillometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kret &amp; Sjak-Shie, 2019)</ref>). Although we have identified noisy trials via visual inspection, we opted not to reject them because there are no precise criteria for defining anomalous trajectories in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Wulff et al., 2021)</ref>. Establishing agreed-upon criteria would particularly benefit online mouse-tracking data, which is likely to suffer from high levels of noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Conclusion</head><p>We began this article with Amartya Sen's anecdote about two boys who found three apples. When Boy B protested that he received only one apple, Boy A retorted that had Boy B been in charge, he would have allocated the apples similarly, implying there was nothing to complain about. Our findings reveal that Boy A overlooks a crucial point: agency influences not only the final allocation but also the cognitive process leading to it. If Boy B had been in charge and had reached the same choice as Boy A, he would have experienced the decision-making process itself as less conflicting and more satisfying. Our results reinforce the idea that manipulating agency is a simple and powerful tool for individuals and organizations dealing with tradeoffs between equity and efficiency to increase overall satisfaction and prosocial behavior.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Illustration of choice screens. a.

In Study 1, we used the term "lab manager" for the person who made the allocations, to distinguish him/her from the in-person experimenter whom participants met. Study 2 was conducted online with no experimenter, so we used the term "experimenter" that was simpler.</note>
