			<abstract>
				<p>Disgust sensitivity is related to a wide variety of psychological constructs (e.g., moral decisionmaking, political ideology, person perception) and psychopathological disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders). In the present article, we aim to provide more insight into the basic information processing strategies associated with individual differences in disgust sensitivity by examining three attentional biases (vigilance, maintenance, and avoidance) for disgust stimuli. Using eye tracking methodology, two studies (N = 135 &amp; N = 149) found that the processing of disgust stimuli by disgust sensitive individuals is characterized exclusively by avoidance. This finding is in line with the idea that more disgust sensitive individuals have a more sensitive pathogen threat alert system. Interestingly, disgust sensitive individuals showed a similar attentional avoidance bias for other negative stimuli.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attentional Biases Associated with Individual Differences in Disgust Sensitivity: An Eye Tracking Study</head><p>A considerable amount of theoretical and empirical research has focused on determining the function, elicitors, and behavioral consequences of disgust (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Curtis &amp; Biran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rozin &amp; Fallon, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tybur, Lieberman, Kurzban, &amp; DeScioli, 2013)</ref>. Despite this interest, the basic information processes underlying individual differences in disgust sensitivity are largely unknown. This is surprising because disgust sensitivity is involved in many phenomena in social, political, and clinical psychology. We aim to provide more insight into these information processes by investigating the attentional biases for disgust-eliciting stimuli associated with individual differences in disgust sensitivity. We specify three hypotheses, each predicting unique relationships between disgust sensitivity and patterns of attention (i.e., vigilance, maintenance, and avoidance) regarding disgust stimuli and test these in two eye tracking studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disgust and Disgust Sensitivity</head><p>Disgust is thought to have originated as part of a food rejection system, discouraging the intake of harmful foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rozin &amp; Fallon, 1987)</ref>. However, people experience disgust to a substantially wider range of stimuli, including body products, animals, and norm violations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Curtis &amp; Biran, 2001</ref>). There is also considerable individual variation in the extent to which people are prone to experience disgust <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Haidt, McCauley, &amp; Rozin, 1994)</ref>. This so-called disgust sensitivity has been associated with various social psychological constructs, including moral decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wagemans, Brandt, &amp; Zeelenberg, 2018)</ref>, political ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Inbar, Pizarro, Iyer, &amp; Haidt, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shook, Oosterhoff, Terrizzi, &amp; Brady, 2017)</ref>, and person perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Crawford, Inbar, &amp; Maloney, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hodson &amp; Costello, 2007)</ref>. Similarly, a vast body of theoretical and empirical work has highlighted disgust sensitivity's involvement in several Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 4 psychopathological disorders, such as animal phobias and general anxiety, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Olatunji &amp; McKay, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Together, these findings show the many ways in which individuals high and low in disgust sensitivity differ. Yet, although attention has been devoted to documenting disgust and associated constructs, some of its basic cognitive processes still have to be examined. One such process is information processing of disgust-eliciting stimuli. While attentional biases have been found for other personality traits (e.g., trait anxiety) and for some disorders (e.g., depression), it remains largely unclear what attentional biases are associated with disgust sensitivity, if any.</p><p>Knowing these attentional biases can not only improve our understanding of disgust sensitivity itself, but can also provide insights into the mechanisms by which disgust sensitivity is related to constructs and disorders such as the ones described above. For instance, when designing targeted interventions for treatment of anxiety disorders, it is important to know whether the attentional biases associated with disgust sensitivity mimic those associated with trait anxiety (i.e., vigilance and maintenance) or are meaningfully distinct (i.e., avoidance). We will develop and test three hypotheses about attentional bias in information processing of disgust stimuli associated with individual differences in disgust sensitivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vigilance Hypothesis</head><p>The vigilance hypothesis is based on the more general observation that emotionally salient stimuli draw attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Asmundson &amp; Stein, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mogg, Philippot, &amp; Bradley, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ã–hman, Flykt, &amp; Esteves, 2001)</ref>. It predicts that disgust sensitive individuals will be more attentive towards disgust stimuli as these are more motivationally salient to them. This vigilant attention consists of two components: A quick initial drawing of attention to the disgust stimulus and continuous monitoring following its onset.</p><p>Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 5 Indirect evidence from research on attentional biases associated with trait anxiety shows that more anxious individuals have a stronger initial drawing of attention towards threatening stimuli (i.e., faces or words) compared to less anxious individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fox, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mogg, Millar, &amp; Bradley, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mogg and colleagues (2000)</ref> also show some indication of continuous monitoring of emotionally salient stimuli by anxious individuals. Subjects with generalized anxiety disorder more often direct their attention to threatening faces than subjects with depression disorder or healthy subjects. A similar vigilant attentional bias might be at play for highly disgust sensitive individuals, but, as far as we know, no study yet has directly tested that possibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintenance Hypothesis</head><p>The maintenance hypothesis predicts that disgust sensitive individuals will have more difficulty disengaging from disgust stimuli. Like the vigilance hypothesis, this hypothesis builds on the notion that emotionally salient stimuli attract attention. However, it differs in that it focusses on what happens after detection of a disgust stimulus. According to the maintenance hypothesis, disgust sensitive individuals are more likely to keep attending to the disgust stimulus.</p><p>While this might sound counterintuitive, there is empirical work showing that emotionally salient cues tend to retain attention longer. Individuals scoring higher on a depression inventory take longer to disengage from depression-related images <ref type="bibr">(Sears, Thomas, LeHuquet, &amp; Johnson, 2010)</ref> and fixate their attention longer on negative pictures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Caseras, Garner, Bradley, &amp; Mogg, 2007)</ref>. Similarly, anxious individuals have more difficulty disengaging from threat-related stimuli than non-anxious or less anxious individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fox, Russo, Bowles, &amp; Dutton, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Salemink, Van den Hout, &amp; Kindt, 2007)</ref>. There is some evidence that such a mechanism may be at play for disgust sensitivity and disgust stimuli. One Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 6 study reports an attention bias towards disgust words (e.g., feces <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cisler, Olatunji, Lohr, &amp; Williams, 2009)</ref> and another study shows sustained engagement with disgust stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Van Dillen &amp; Vanderveen, 2017)</ref> by more disgust sensitive individuals. However, these studies were either conducted with a small sample or used very brief stimuli exposure times (i.e., 120 ms), making it difficult to confirm that disgust sensitive individuals show prolonged engagement with disgust stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Avoidance Hypothesis</head><p>The avoidance hypothesis predicts that more disgust sensitive individuals will more strongly avoid disgust stimuli. The idea is that these individuals have a more sensitive pathogen threat alert system, which causes them to interpret even the slightest cue of pathogens as a threat, resulting in an avoidance reaction.</p><p>Disgust sensitivity has been related to behavioral avoidance in a variety of tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Deacon &amp; Olatunji, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Van Overveld, De Jong, &amp; Peters, 2010)</ref>, but the evidence for attentional avoidance of disgust pictures by disgust sensitive individuals is mixed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bradley, Costa, and Lang (2015)</ref> found that women's disgust sensitivity regarding sexual activities predicts shorter gaze durations for pictures of nude people. However, such a relationship was not found for men and was also absent in other domains of disgust sensitivity. That is, individual differences in disgust sensitivity regarding bodily products or mutilation did not predict viewing behavior of pictures of contamination and mutilation, respectively. Similarly, another study reportedthat individuals who scored higher, compared to lower, on the body envelope violation subscale of disgust sensitivity spent less time looking at blood injection pictures <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Woody &amp; Tolin, 2002)</ref>. However, the same study shows no such relationship between the animal disgust subscale and viewing time of spider pictures, even though these same subjects had responded with disgust (in addition to Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 7 fear) to pictures of spiders in a previous study (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tolin, Lohr, Sawchuk, &amp; Lee, 1997)</ref>. More convincing evidence for a general avoidant attentional bias associated with disgust sensitivity is found in a conditioning study conducted by Armstrong and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Armstrong, McClenahan, Kittle, &amp; Olatunji, 2014)</ref>. This study shows that more disgust sensitive individuals show shorter dwell times for disgusting, as compared to neutral, videos. However, because participants in this study were presented with one video at a time, this study does not necessarily provide evidence against a vigilance hypothesis (e.g., initial drawing of attention).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Studies</head><p>We test the three attentional process hypotheses with an eye tracking task. The benefit of using eye tracking technology over traditional tasks assessing attentional processes (e.g., dot probe or Stroop tasks) is that it can identify which stimuli grab attention, as well as measure the attention process continuously over time. We can therefore separate a vigilant attentional bias (i.e., initial orienting and subsequent monitoring) from a maintenance attentional bias (i.e., prolonged attention) towards a stimulus, while at the same time investigating the potential of an avoidant attentional bias (i.e., looking away).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Data collection took place at festivals in Tilburg, the Netherlands. A first sample was recruited at a music festival and a second sample was recruited at a social innovation festival.</p><p>Sample size was in both cases determined by the number of visitors that wanted to participate in our study during two festival days (i.e., four days of data collection in total). The data of these samples are combined for our analyses to increase the power of our study. Questionnaires, data, Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 8 and syntax used for data analysis can be found in the Supplemental Materials at the Open Science Framework (OSF).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample 1.</head><p>Participants. Data collection took place in a large, well-lit room at Festival Mundial. The equipment was set up in the corner of this room to minimize distraction and no music was played in this room during the experiment (although music from outside the building could be heard). A marketing team of the university approached festival visitors outside of the building with the request to participate in the study. After two days of data collection, 99 visitors had participated.</p><p>Participants were excluded when they did not fill out the survey (N = 5), did not participate in the eye tracker task (N = 2), and when they had substantial missing data in the eye tracking task (N = 1). This left us with a final sample of 91 participants (25 males, 66 females, Mage = 37.62, SD = 14.60). Although the festival context is not as well controlled as a lab environment, the participants were more diverse than typical student samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials.</head><p>To keep the questionnaire as short as possible, we used the pathogen disgust subscale of the Three Domain Disgust Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tybur, Lieberman, &amp; Griskevicius, 2009)</ref> to measure disgust sensitivity (7 items, Î± = .85). 1 All items were answered on a scale ranging from 1 = 'Not at all disgusting' to 7 = 'Extremely disgusting.' An example item of this scale is "Standing close to a person who has body odor." Forty pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lang, Bradley, &amp; Cuthbert, 2008)</ref> were used. Ten disgusting pictures (e.g., dirty toilet, cockroaches), ten positive pictures (e.g., puppies, ice cream), and twenty neutral pictures (e.g., shoes, clock) were selected.</p><p>Positive and disgust pictures were chosen for their similarity in complexity, the presence of animals, and the presence of people. For the eye tracking task, these pictures were presented in ten grids of four pictures (one disgusting, one positive, and two neutral). These grids were fixed in picture combination and order, meaning that each individual saw the same combinations of pictures in the same order. The eye tracking task was conducted with a Tobii T60 eye tracker (Tobii, Stockholm, Sweden).</p><p>Alcohol was available at the festival. To determine blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels we used the AlcoScan AL7000 breathalyzer (measuring BAC levels in permille). Eighteen participants had BAC levels above 0, with their mean BAC level being 0.375â€° (SD = 0.25). As a reference point, the Dutch legal limit for driving is a BAC level of 0.5â€°. Only four participants exceeded this limit. Excluding these participants from the analyses did not change any of our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample 2.</head><p>Participants. Data collection took place at the Dear Future, festival. On the first day, data collection took place in a well-lit and soundproof room. However, because the festival did not attract many visitors and the location of the room was not on the main path, equipment was moved to a more central location on the second day. Both days, the researchers themselves approached festival visitors with the request to participate in the study. After two days, 47 visitors had participated in the study. The same exclusion criteria as in Sample 1 were used.</p><p>Participants were excluded because they did not fill out the survey (N = 2) and because they had substantial missing data in the eye tracking task (N = 1). This left us with a final sample of 44 participants (20 males, 24 females, Mage = 36.73, SD = 14.15).</p><p>Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 10 Materials. Disgust sensitivity was measured with the 27-item Disgust Sensitivity Scalerevised <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Haidt et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">modified by Olatunji et al., 2007, Î± = .84)</ref>. The first 14 items of this scale are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = 'Strongly disagree (very untrue about me)' to 5 = 'Strongly agree (very true about me)'. An example item is "If I see someone vomit, it makes me sick to my stomach". The remaining 13 items are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = 'Not disgusting at all' to 5 = 'Extremely disgusting'. An example item is "You are about to drink a glass of milk when you smell that it is spoiled". The scale includes two filler items that are excluded from data analysis.</p><p>The same 40 IAPS pictures were used as in Sample 1, but we improved our design by randomizing picture presentation. More specifically, for each grid one disgusting, one positive, and two neutral pictures were randomly selected from the forty pictures (without repetition of pictures). Alcohol was again available at the festival, but none of the participants had BAC levels above 0. The same eye tracking equipment was used as in Sample 1.</p><p>Procedure. The procedure was identical in both samples. The first part of the study was administered on a tablet and consisted of informed consent and the disgust sensitivity questions.</p><p>At the end of the questionnaire, participants provided demographic information and were asked whether they had consumed alcohol. If so, the breathalyzer was used to determine the blood alcohol concentration level. The second part of the study consisted of the eye tracking task. A researcher seated participants about half a meter from the eye tracker display and started the eye tracking calibration. After successful calibration, participants started the free-viewing task. This set-up was chosen to encourage naturalistic information processing. At the start of each trial, participants saw a fixation cross at the center of the screen for 2 seconds. They were then Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 11 presented with one of the picture grids for 6 seconds (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). This was repeated for a total of ten trials. Participants were then debriefed and thanked for their participation.</p><p>Dependent variables. We looked at four different eye tracking measures: Time to first fixation, average visit duration, total visit duration, and visit count. We will explain these measures together with the exact predictions following from each hypothesis briefly below (see also <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Time to first fixation is the amount of time (in milliseconds) it takes participants to look at a specific area of interest (in our case, a certain picture) for the first time. In other words, this measure informs us about the detection speed of a given picture. The vigilance hypothesis follows from the idea that disgust pictures are more salient to highly disgust sensitive as compared to less disgust sensitive individuals. As such, this hypothesis would predict faster detection of, and thus a shorter time to first fixation on, disgust pictures by disgust sensitive individuals.</p><p>Average visit duration is the average time participants spend on each visit to a specific area of interest (in our case, a specific picture). A visit here means (re-)entering the area of a picture. One visit can consist of multiple fixations, as participants may look at multiple spots within a given picture without looking away from this picture. Average visit duration therefore gives us an indication of participants' viewing behaviors after detection of a given stimulus, which is relevant to both the avoidance and maintenance hypotheses. Importantly, these hypotheses make the exact opposite prediction regarding the relationship between disgust sensitivity and average visit duration of disgust stimuli. The avoidance hypothesis predicts that disgust sensitive individuals will have a stronger avoidance reaction to disgust stimuli, which would result in shorter average visit durations of disgust stimuli for disgust sensitive individuals compared to less disgust sensitive individuals. The maintenance hypothesis predicts the opposite; disgust sensitive individuals will have more difficulty disengaging from disgust stimuli, resulting in longer average visit durations of disgust stimuli for disgust sensitive, as compared to less disgust sensitive, individuals.</p><p>Total visit duration is the total amount of time (in milliseconds) spend within a specific area of interest. This measure is indicative of a general eye gazing strategy and can therefore again distinguish between an avoidance and maintenance hypothesis. The predictions following from these hypotheses on the relationship between disgust sensitivity and total visit duration of disgust pictures are in line with the predictions for average visit duration. While the avoidance hypothesis predicts that disgust sensitive individuals will have shorter total visit durations of disgust pictures, the maintenance hypothesis predicts that they will have longer total visit durations of disgust pictures.</p><p>Visit count is the number of times participants (re-)enter a specific area of interest (in our case, a certain picture). While findings regarding average and total visit duration will be able to distinguish between the avoidance and maintenance hypotheses, visit count will help us distinguish between the vigilance and avoidance hypotheses. According to the vigilance hypothesis, disgust sensitive individuals will continuously monitor disgust stimuli, leading to a higher visit count of disgust pictures for these individuals. The avoidance hypothesis, on the contrary, predicts a lower visit count for disgust sensitive individuals as these individuals are more likely to avoid, and therefore less likely to return to, a disgust picture.</p><p>For an overview of the predictions regarding the relationship between disgust sensitivity and each of the eye tracking measure per hypothesis, see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analytic Strategy.</head><p>As mentioned before, the two samples were analyzed together.</p><p>Although the two samples used different measures of disgust sensitivity, previous research has shown that the pathogen disgust subscale of the Three Domain Disgust scale has moderate to high correlations with all components of the Disgust Sensitivity Scale -Revised <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Olatunji et al., 2012)</ref>. Analyzing the data separately for each disgust sensitivity measure (i.e., sample) shows that the overall pattern of results is the same for both measures. However, the findings of sample 2 do not always reach significance, likely due to a small sample size.</p><p>Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effects of disgust sensitivity and picture type on three of the dependent variables (i.e., time to first fixation, average visit duration, and total visit duration), while taking into account random variance of participants, pictures, and samples. A mixed-effects poisson regression model was used to analyze the visit count data.</p><p>Because disgust sensitivity was measured with different answer scales in both samples, disgust sensitivity scores were standardized within each dataset (generating z-scores). A model including disgust sensitivity (DS; standardized), picture type (reference category = neutral pictures), and their interaction as independent variables was then fitted to the data to predict each of the dependent variables (i.e., time to first fixation; average visit duration; total visit duration; visit count). Below, the findings will be described for each of the dependent variables separately. The exact coefficients of all regressions models can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Time to First Fixation. The vigilance hypothesis predicts that more disgust sensitive individuals will be faster in detecting the disgust pictures (i.e., have a shorter time to first fixation for disgust pictures) than less disgust sensitive individuals. This prediction is not supported by the data (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2A)</ref>. The analyses reveal only a main effect of disgust pictures on time to first fixation, showing that individuals were faster in detecting disgust (M = 1,309 ms, Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 14 SD = 1,117) than neutral pictures (M = 1,673 ms, SD = 1,355), regardless of one's level of disgust sensitivity. There were no main effects of disgust sensitivity and positive pictures, nor any interaction effects between disgust sensitivity and picture type.</p><p>Average Visit Duration. The findings for average visit duration are in line with the prediction from the avoidance hypothesis, but go against the prediction from the maintenance hypothesis (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). There were main effects of disgust and positive pictures, showing that people Another main effect was found for disgust sensitivity, which indicated that disgust sensitive individuals spent less time on average per visit across all picture types. However, these main effects were qualified by a significant interaction effect between disgust sensitivity and disgust Total Visit Duration. The findings for total visit duration largely mimicked the pattern found for average visit duration (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>). Hence, these findings were again in line with the avoidance hypothesis, while going against the maintenance hypothesis. There was no main effect of disgust sensitivity, but there were main effects of both disgust and positive pictures, Visit Count. The vigilance hypothesis predicts that disgust sensitive individuals will visit disgust pictures more often than less disgust sensitive individuals will, while the avoidance hypothesis predicts exactly the opposite pattern. However, neither of these predictions were supported by the data (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2D</ref>). Main effects were found for disgust sensitivity, revealing that disgust sensitive individuals visited pictures more often, and positive pictures, showing that positive pictures (M = 1.84, SD = 0.82) were visited more often than neutral pictures (M = 1.66, SD = 0.74).. No interactions between disgust sensitivity and picture type were found (see <ref type="figure">Figure   2D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The data primarily support the avoidance hypothesis, showing that individuals high (versus low) in disgust sensitivity spend less time looking at disgust pictures. We found this pattern for both average and total visit duration of disgust pictures. The avoidance hypothesis also predicts that individuals high in disgust sensitivity will visit disgust pictures less often than individuals low in disgust sensitivity do, but this prediction was not supported. We found no support for any of the predictions following from either a vigilance or a maintenance hypothesis (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Study 1 was exploratory, so we aimed to replicate the findings in Study 2. We improved our study in three ways. First, Study 2 was conducted in a controlled lab environment. Second, we Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 16 included negative, but not disgusting, pictures, so that we can test whether the effects found for disgust sensitivity in Study 1 are specific to disgust stimuli, or apply to negative stimuli in general. Third, to more precisely estimate our effect, we increased the number of trials in Study 2 from 10 to 20. After data collection, but before any of the authors looked at the data, we preregistered the three hypotheses and the analysis plan (see the preregistration file).</p><p>Participants. We ran the study for two weeks in the SP-lab at Tilburg University.</p><p>Sample size was determined by the number of students that participated in our lab study during this time, with a minimum sample size set at 120 participants. In the end, 149 students (43 males, 103 females, 3 not reported, Mage = 19.95, SD = 2.30, with 1 missing) participated in our study in return for course credit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials.</head><p>The same disgust sensitivity scale as in Sample 2 of Study 1 was used (i.e., Disgust Sensitivity Scalerevised; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Haidt et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">modified by Olatunji et al., 2007, Î± = .84)</ref>.</p><p>Eighty pictures (including the 40 pictures from Study 1) were selected from the International Affective Picture System <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lang et al., 2008)</ref>, evenly divided over four picture categories: Disgust 2 , negative, positive, and neutral. Examples of negative pictures are an airplane crash, a gun, and a shark. Picture presentation was randomized, while ensuring that each grid included one disgusting, one negative, one positive, and one neutral picture. The same eye tracking equipment was used as in Study 1.</p><p>Manipulation Check. To test whether our participants perceived disgust pictures to be more disgusting than negative pictures, they rated each of the disgust and negative pictures on disgustingness and negativity on a scale from 1 = 'Not at all disgusting (negative)' to 7 = 'Very disgusting (negative).' These ratings were used to calculate average disgustingness and average negativity scores for disgust and negative pictures for each participant. As intended, disgust pictures (M = 4.93, SD = 0.99) were rated as significantly more disgusting than negative pictures (M = 2.32, SD = 1.14, t(149) = 26.75, p &lt; .001). Disgust pictures (M = 4.84, SD = 1.16) were also rated as slightly more negative than negative pictures (M = 4.58, SD = 1.15, t(149) = 2.76, p = .01).</p><p>Procedure. Participants were seated in individual soundproof cubicles in the lab, where they gave consent and answered the questions measuring disgust sensitivity. They were then taken to another cubicle for the eye tracking task. A test leader seated participants about half a meter from the eye tracker display and started the eye tracking calibration. After successful calibration, participants started the free-viewing task. At the start of each trial, participants saw a fixation cross at the center of the screen for 2 seconds. They were then presented with one of the picture grids for 10 seconds. This was repeated for a total of 20 trials (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). After this free viewing task, participants provided the disgust and negativity ratings for each of the disgust and negative pictures. Participants were then debriefed and thanked for their participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Data Analytic Strategy. The data analytic strategy was identical to that of Study 1, except that there was no need to take into account random variance of samples. Statistical analyses were first conducted using neutral pictures as the reference category, but were also conducted using negative pictures as the reference category. By doing this, we could test whether the attentional biases associated with individual differences in disgust sensitivity are specific to disgust pictures or if they generalize to other negative pictures. The exact coefficients of all regressions models using neutral pictures as the reference category can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Time to First Fixation. As in Study 1, findings for time to first fixation did not support the prediction from the vigilance hypothesis that more disgust sensitive individuals will have shorter times to first fixation for disgust pictures (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3A</ref>). There were main effects of disgust, positive, and negative pictures. Regardless of their disgust sensitivity levels, participants were faster in detecting disgust (M = 1,539 ms, SD = 1,513), positive (M = 1,733 ms, SD = 1,588), and negative (M = 1,874 ms, SD = 1,637) pictures than neutral pictures (M = 2,249 ms, SD = 1,848). No main effect of disgust sensitivity was found, nor did any of the interaction effects between disgust sensitivity and picture type reach significance.</p><p>Average Visit Duration. Findings for average visit duration replicate the pattern found in Study 1. The data again support the prediction following from an avoidance hypothesis, but not the prediction following from a maintenance hypothesis (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>). There was no main  <ref type="bibr">-38.92, SE = 21.46, t[10892]</ref> = -1.81, p = .07, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-83.76, 3</ref>.01]).</p><p>However, simple effect analyses reveal that disgust sensitivity's relationship to average visit duration of negative pictures is not significantly different from 0 <ref type="bibr">SE = 51.67,</ref><ref type="bibr">t[133.15]</ref> = -1.42, p = .16, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-170.50, 43.39]</ref>), while its relationship to average visit duration of disgust pictures is <ref type="bibr">SE = 48.51,</ref><ref type="bibr">t[146.49]</ref> = -2.91, p = .004, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-229.22, -45.20]</ref>).</p><p>Total Visit Duration. The findings for total visit duration again mimicked the pattern found for average visit duration, and thus supported an avoidance, but not maintenance, hypothesis (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3C</ref>). There were no main effects of disgust sensitivity and disgust Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 20 Visit Count. The avoidance hypothesis predicts that more disgust sensitive individuals will visit disgust pictures less often, while the vigilance hypothesis predicts exactly the opposite pattern. In contrast to Study 1, in which neither of the predictions were supported, the data now clearly support the prediction following from the avoidance hypothesis (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3D</ref>). There were no main effects for disgust sensitivity and negative pictures. There were main effects for disgust pictures, showing that disgust pictures (M = 1.81, SD = 0.89) were visited less often than neutral pictures (M = 2.02, SD = 0.93), and positive pictures, showing that positive pictures (M = 2.26, SD = 0.95) were visited more often than neutral pictures. These main effects were qualified by significant, but small, interaction effects between disgust sensitivity and each of the picture types. More disgust sensitive individuals visited positive, as compared to neutral, pictures more often than less disgust sensitivity individuals. As predicted by the avoidance hypothesis, disgust sensitivity was negatively related to visit count of disgust, as compared to neutral, pictures.</p><p>However, also the effect of disgust sensitivity on visit count was not significantly different from disgust sensitivity's effect on visit count of negative pictures (b = -0.002, SE = 0.02, z = -0.08, p = .94, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.05]). Follow-up simple effect analyses also show that participants high in disgust sensitivity visited disgust (b = -0.09, SE = 0.03, z = -2.79, p = .005, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.15, -0</ref>.02]), as well as negative pictures (b = -0.09, SE = 0.03, z = -2.86, p = .004, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.15, -0</ref>.02]) less often than participants low in disgust sensitivity.</p><p>All predictions following from the avoidance hypothesis were therefore supported, while none of the predictions following from either a vigilance or a maintenance hypothesis were supported (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We examined the basic information processing strategies associated with individual differences in disgust sensitivity by testing three hypotheses that each predict different attentional biases for disgust stimuli as a function of individual differences in disgust sensitivity.</p><p>The first two hypotheses built on the notion that emotionally salient stimuli tend to attract our attention. The vigilance hypothesis predicts that disgust sensitive individuals are more attentive towards disgust stimuli, resulting in a quick drawing of attention towards and continuous monitoring of disgust stimuli. The maintenance hypothesis, however, predicts that disgust sensitive individuals have more difficulty disengaging from disgust stimuli, resulting in longer dwell times on disgust stimuli after detection. The third hypothesis, the avoidance hypothesis, predicts that disgust sensitive individuals have a more sensitive pathogen threat alert system, resulting in a stronger avoidance reaction. This hypothesis is incompatible with the first two hypotheses as it predicts that disgust sensitive individuals will spend less attention on disgust stimuli.</p><p>In two eye tracking studies, we found strong support for the avoidance hypothesis. More disgust sensitive individuals spent less time, per visit and overall looking at disgust-eliciting stimuli and less often returned their gaze to these stimuli. None of the predictions following from the vigilance and maintenance hypotheses were supported by our data (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our second study reveals that this attentional avoidance bias may not be specific to disgust stimuli. Disgust sensitive individuals showed a similar attentional avoidance bias for negative, but not disgusting, stimuli. One could interpret these findings as support for the idea that disgust sensitive individuals have a more (maybe over-)sensitive pathogen threat alert system, which detects pathogen cues in situations where others do not perceive them. We used the data of Study 2 on disgust sensitivity and perceived disgustingness ratings of negative stimuli Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 22 for a preliminary test of this idea. More, compared to less, disgust sensitive individuals indeed tended to rate the negative stimuli as more disgusting (b = 0.65, SE = 0.15, t(147.29) = 4.25, p &lt; .001). However, these disgust ratings do not explain why disgust sensitivity relates to viewing behaviors of negative stimuli (see Supplemental Materials for full mediation models). This is inconsistent with the finding by <ref type="bibr">Armstrong and colleagues (2014)</ref> that the experience of disgust in response to a stimulus explains why disgust sensitive individuals display stronger visual avoidance. In fact, we find that disgust ratings only mediate the relationship between disgust sensitivity and eye gazing behaviors in the case of total visit duration (but not average visit duration or visit count) of disgust pictures.</p><p>Alternatively, one might argue that more disgust sensitive individuals show an avoidant attentional bias for negative pictures because they turn to positive pictures for comfort after having seen disgust pictures. If that is true, disgust sensitive individuals do not necessarily avoid looking at negative pictures, but instead actively focus their attention on positive pictures. Our data only partially support such an explanation. In Study 2, but not in Study 1, we find interaction effects of disgust sensitivity and positive pictures, showing that more disgust sensitive individuals spent more time, on average per visit and overall, looking at positive pictures. However, to directly test whether disgust sensitive individuals display the same avoidant attentional bias for negative as for disgust stimuli, future research should examine them separately (i.e., in distinct trials or blocks), but with identical control stimuli (e.g., present them with the same neutral and positive stimuli).</p><p>The current findings also inform our understanding of psychopathological disorders in which disgust sensitivity plays a role. For example, several studies have shown disgust sensitivity's close involvement in anxiety disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">De Jong &amp; Merckelbach, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Matchett &amp; Davey, 1991)</ref>. However, the attentional bias we find for disgust sensitivity starkly contrasts those associated with trait anxiety. While we find that disgust sensitive individuals more strongly avoid attending to disgusting and other negative stimuli, research shows that anxious individuals display prolonged engagement with threat-related stimuli (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fox et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Salemink et al., 2007)</ref>. It might therefore be particularly interesting to investigate disgust sensitivity's and trait anxiety's attentional biases to disgust-eliciting and other negative stimuli concurrently and determine how these distinct information processing components complement each other in the development of anxiety disorders.</p><p>Another avenue for future research concerns the causal nature of attentional biases and individual differences in disgust sensitivity. One possibility is that individual variation in disgust sensitivity influences the perception of a pathogen cue. In this case, the stronger avoidant attentional bias displayed by more disgust sensitive individuals results from a lower threshold for detecting pathogen cues. However, the opposite could also be true. An individual's information processing strategy could create a vulnerability to certain emotional stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 2002)</ref>. In line with this reasoning, research on trait anxiety has shown that attentional training tasks can affect individuals' trait anxiety after several sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amir, Beard, Burns, &amp; Bomyea, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 2002)</ref>. It is therefore possible that consistently avoiding visual or physical contact with disgust stimuli hampers habituation, ultimately resulting in a stronger sensitivity to pathogen cues (i.e., higher disgust sensitivity).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Three attentional biases (vigilance, maintenance, and avoidance) towards disgust stimuli as a function of individual differences in disgust sensitivity were tested. We find that disgust sensitive individuals display a stronger avoidant attentional bias towards disgust stimuli, in line Running head: ATTENTIONAL BIASES AND DISGUST SENSITIVITY 24 with the idea that these individuals have a more sensitive pathogen threat alert system. A similar information processing strategy for generally negative stimuli was found, which cannot be explained by perceived disgustingness or negativity of these stimuli. These results suggest that disgust sensitivity might be indicative of a more general defense strategy, which might explain why disgust sensitivity plays an important role in many psychological constructs and psychopathological disorders. <ref type="table">Tables  Table 1</ref> Predictions of and support for the attentional biases of individual differences in disgust sensitivity (DS) per hypothesis.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>spent more time on average per visit looking at disgust (M = 803 ms, SD = 604) and positive pictures (M = 689 ms, SD = 445), as compared to neutral pictures (M = 544 ms, SD = 376).</figDesc></figure>
