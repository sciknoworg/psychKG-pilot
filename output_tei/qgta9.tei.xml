			<abstract>
				<p>Decisions are often accompanied by feelings of positive or negative valence with some intensity, also called affect. It has been proposed that affect functions as a monitoring signal, recruiting subsequent regulatory control processes. However, it&apos;s unclear what are the mechanisms that generate affect in decision-making. Inspired by control process theory (Carver, 2015), we model affect as the difference between expected and actual progress in an evidence accumulation framework. Actual progress is mapped onto the drift-rate parameter and expected progress onto a novel expected drift-rate parameter during a perceptual decision. Affect is computed as the difference between the expected and actual amount of accumulated evidence in a trial. We then test predictions of this model in a perceptual decision-making experiment, where expected and actual progress are experimentally manipulated. We find that affect reflects the sum of actual and expected progress, but not their discrepancy as predicted by control process theory. Comparing the empirical data with model predictions, we find that the model is able to simultaneously account for choice, reaction times, and affect in perceptual decisions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans have to make a multitude of decisions every day. Many of these decisions are accompanied by affective feelings, such that some decisions feel good whereas other decisions feel bad. It has been argued that these affective feelings are not merely epiphenomenal but instead serve a crucial functional role of regulatory signals for cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dignath et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Proust, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Velasco &amp; Loev, 2022)</ref>. Although affective impacts on decision-making can originate from decision-unrelated processes (i.e., incidental affect; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Västfjäll et al., 2016)</ref>, in the current work we focus on affect that arises as a function of the decision-making process itself (i.e., integral affect). We view affect as the dimension of experiences that ranges from positive to negative valence, with some intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Russell, 2009)</ref> reflecting the appraisal of a situation in light of various motives <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Uusberg et al., 2019)</ref>. Among the appraisals that can generate affect, we will focus on the role of a discrepancy between actual and expected progress in a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Velasco &amp; Loev, 2020)</ref>. We propose a novel accumulation-to-bound model (affectDDM) where affect generation is driven by the discrepancy between expectancy-and stimulus-driven accumulators. The model allows to make precise predictions for affect ratings and can capture the effects of expected and actual progress on decision-related affect in a perceptual decision-making task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect as progress prediction error</head><p>A core idea expressed explicitly (or implicitly) in different accounts of affect generation is the idea that affect is a regulatory signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Proust, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Velasco &amp; Loev, 2022)</ref>. Similarly to a signal inside a thermostat regulating the heating in a room, affect functions as monitoring signal, detecting discrepancies (e.g., conflicts, errors), and indicating the need to invest control to overcome them. One influential account, Control-Process theory (CPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1990)</ref>, further specifies the nature of the Affect generation in perceptual decisions 4 monitoring signal (and therefore the generation of affect), by suggesting that it reflects an evaluation of the discrepancy between the actual and expected progress in a task. This regulatory signal can be interpreted as reflecting the discrepancy between actual progress and the progress that is expected based on prior experience. For example, if a researcher expects to write 1000 words per day for their article, but actually manages to write 500 words, this lower-than-expected progress generates negative affect. On the other hand, if they manage to write 1300 words, this better-than-expected progress generates positive affect. In addition to academic and job satisfaction contexts this principle has found experimental support mostly on hypothetical scenario description or performance-feedback paradigms (see review of evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 2013)</ref> , where participants have to indicate how they would feel under different manipulations of actual and expected progress.</p><p>Although affect has been argued to play an important role in decisions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blanchette &amp; Richards, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003)</ref>, the CPT framework has not yet been applied to perceptual decisionmaking paradigms, which enable potentially strong tests of these theoretical claims. In a typical perceptual decision-making task, participants make hundreds of two-alternative speeded choices producing behavioral signatures that can be analyzed using a well-established set of conceptual and computational tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. Applied to these types of tasks, the CPT predicts that decision-related affect should track the discrepancy between expected and actual progress in an ongoing decision. For example, when a decision-maker expects a decision to be difficult, but it is actually an easy decision, CPT predicts that they will feel positive about their decision as the decision was easier than expected. On the contrary, if they expected an easy decision, but it was actually difficult to make a decision, it is predicted that they will experience negative affect.</p><p>Even though CPT provides a promising theoretical mechanism to explain decision-related affect, so far the theory has not yet been translated into a formal computational model, which enables evaluating the Affect generation in perceptual decisions 5 model in perceptual decision-making tasks. Doing so is important, because a computational model goes beyond a verbal description of the theory, and makes precise, unambiguous predictions, and it can reveal (hidden) assumptions in the theory <ref type="bibr">(cf. "open theory";</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guest &amp; Martin, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">van Rooij &amp; Baggio, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Given our focus on decision-related affect, we departed from the notion that many forms of decision have been successfully characterized as a process of evidence accumulation. This allows us to formalize the computations underlying affect on already well-established computational principles for perceptual decision-making and ground empirical testing of affect generation to a perceptual decision-making paradigm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence accumulation and actual progress</head><p>Evidence accumulation refers to the process of gathering noisy evidence with respect to possible decision options until one option is supported by sufficient evidence. Typically, decisions are taken once the accumulated evidence has reached a predefined level of evidence, which is referred to as the decision boundary. This idea has been formalized in various sequential sampling models, of which the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), a specific instance of the larger family of accumulation-to-bound models, has received much empirical support <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ratcliff et al., 2016)</ref>. In the DDM, the evidence accumulation process is described by a small set of latent parameters that explain variability in the decision outcomes accuracy and reaction time. The most important parameter for the current purpose is the drift rate, which characterizes the average rate of evidence accumulation. When there is a clear signal (e.g. high signal-tonoise ratio), drift rate will be high and so the evidence will accumulate very quickly towards the correct boundary (i.e. leading to fast and correct decisions). When the signal is unclear (e.g. low signal-to-noise ratio), drift rate will be low and evidence will accumulate slowly (i.e., slow and error-prone decisions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect generation in perceptual decisions 6</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence accumulation and expected progress</head><p>Given that the DDM has been very successful in explaining choice behavior, it is a good candidate for attempts to model decision-related affect. The CPT suggests that a viable model of affect in the context of perceptual decision-making may involve a discrepancy between a pair of latent variables, one representing actual and the other expected rate of progress in the decision. To formalize this insight, we propose an extension of the DDM, for convenience referred to as affectDDM, which enables simultaneous estimation of expected and actual drift rate of evidence accumulation in a decision. This approach formalizes expected and actual progress in decision-making context and enables precise predictions for decision-related affect.</p><p>The drift rate defined in the DDM provides a straightforward implementation of the concept of actual rate of progress. However, it is less clear how to implement the expected rate of progress. Although the DDM has proven to be a valuable framework to understand expectations about which response to expect (i.e response bias, which can be modeled by changing the starting point of the accumulation process; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mulder et al., 2012</ref>) the model does not have expectations about the rate of progress itself. Therefore, we add this expectation component to the DDM through another latent variable that represents the expected drift rate (for a similar approach in the field of decision confidence, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Drugowitsch &amp; Pouget, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fleming &amp; Daw, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Khalvati et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Van Marcke et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Suppose a decision-maker has to decide which direction a patch of dots is moving. During the presentation of the dots, the agent continuously gathers evidence, and this process, characterized by the actual drift rate, results in some amount of final evidence for a choice. At the same time, the decision-maker likely had some expectation about the rate of evidence accumulation (i.e. about the upcoming difficulty) of the current trial. The core idea behind affectDDM is that in addition to the stimulus-driven accumulator, there is an additional expectancy-driven accumulator which is controlled by the expected drift-rate.</p><p>Affect generation in perceptual decisions 7</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curent study</head><p>Inspired by CPT theory, we propose to extend the DDM with an expected drift rate yielding a novel affectDDM model that can also account for the generation of affect, in addition to explaining choices and reaction times. AffectDDM is the first computational framework that allows simultaneous modeling of choices, reaction times and affect. This model allows us to predict trial-by-trial changes in affect as a function of parameters of the evidence accumulation process and its manipulations. Specifically, given that affect reflects the difference between expected and actual rate of progress in evidence accumulation, the model predicts that both variations in actual task difficulty as well as in how difficult participants expect the task to be, should influence affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To examine if affectDDM is able to predict changes in affect judgments induced by manipulations of expected and actual progress, we constructed a random-dot-motion task, where people report their affect on a trialby-trial basis. The task <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref> consisted of 50 mini-blocks of 6 trials, where participants had to report the direction of a patch of dynamically moving dots and afterwards indicate their decision-related affect. Similar tasks without affect judgements have been extensively used in the study of perceptual decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007)</ref>. The main advantage of random-dot-motion tasks is their simplicity and elegant manipulation of the actual drift rate (or actual progress) through the manipulation of motion coherence. To influence participants' expected progress, we used a block-level manipulation. At the beginning of each mini-block of six trials, as well as before each trial, participants were informed whether they were currently in a hard or easy block. Easy blocks consisted of 75% easy coherence trials (and 25% hard coherence trials), and hard blocks of 75% hard trials (and 25% easy trials). In the following, we first analyse behavioral data to see if our Affect generation in perceptual decisions 8 experimental task and manipulations worked as intended. We then introduce the structure of affectDDM and compare its predictions to empirical data. Finally, we analyze whether fitted parameters from affectDDM confirm theoretical predictions from CPT. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Structure of the experimental task. On each trial participants indicated the direction of the random-dot-motion stimulus. The coherence of the stimulus was manipulated on 2 levels -0.05 (very low coherence -hard condition) or 0.4 (very high coherence -easy condition). For expected progress Affect generation in perceptual decisions 9 manipulation, the task was divided into 2 types of blocks, with block indicators before each trial. In hard blocks the probability of getting a hard trial was 75% and in easy blocks probability of getting an easy trial was 75%. Participants reported their affect on a 6-level scale after every trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reaction times and choice accuracy</head><p>To validate our experimental manipulations, we first analyzed choice reaction times and choice accuracy as a function of motion coherence (2 levels: high vs low; reflecting actual progress) and expected difficulty (2 levels: high vs low; reflecting expected progress) and their interaction. For choice reaction times, we found a statistically significant main effect of motion coherence (F(1, 38) = 34.82, p &lt; .001), but no effect of expected difficulty (F(1, 38.5) = 0.008, p = 0.928), nor an interaction between the two factors (F(1, 11404.9) = 2.96, p = 0.086). As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2A</ref>, reaction times were faster in easy motion coherence trials (M = 0.707) than in hard motion coherence trials (M = 1.01), while expected difficulty had no effect on choice reaction times (M = 0.920, M = 0.807). For choice accuracy, we found a statistically significant effect of motion coherence (χ2 (1) = 1113.056, p &lt; 0.001), but not of expected difficulty (χ2 (1) = 2.195, p = 0.139).</p><p>The interaction effect was not statistically significant (χ2 (1) = 2.251, p = .1335. As can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2B</ref>, choice accuracy was higher in trials with easy coherence (M = 0.894) compared to trials with hard coherence (M = 0.585), whereas accuracy did not differ depending on expected difficulty (M = 0.798 vs M = 0.669).</p><p>These results indicate that our actual progress manipulation worked as expected, whereas the expected progress manipulation did not influence behavioral performance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of expected and actual progress effects on affect</head><p>Our next analyses concerned the effects of motion coherence and expected difficulty, both of which we expected to have an influence on reported levels of affect. Indeed, we found that both motion coherence (F(1, 38) = 44.07, p &lt; .001) and expected difficulty (F(1,38) = 16.301, p &lt; .001) had a statistically significant effect on affect. The interaction effect was not significant (F(1, 11402) = 0.07, p = 0.792). As can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2C</ref>, affect was most positive in the easy motion coherence condition (M = 4.36 ) than in the hard motion coherence condition (M = 3.53 ). Similarly, affect was more positive in the easy expectation condition (M = 4.16) than in the hard expectation condition (M = 3.70). These results confirm that both our manipulation of expected and actual progress are indeed effective. Note that this empirical finding contradicts the predicted pattern by CPT, which predicts that progressing better than expected should result in more positive affect compared to progressing worse than the expected rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AffectDDM model structure</head><p>Having demonstrated that our experimental manipulations have the expected effect on both performance and the reported level of affect, we turned to computational modeling to examine whether the model could account for these findings. We model the actual decisions that people make as an accumulation-to-bound process <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>, with the strength of the accumulation controlled by the drift rate (v). In addition, the accumulation process is characterized by decision threshold (a -controlling the amount of evidence required to trigger a decision), starting point (z) -controlling initial bias towards one choice option and non-decision time (ter), capturing the perceptual and motor phase of the reaction time. To model affect, we assume an additional expectancy-driven accumulator, which races to the same thresholds (starting from the same starting point), with the only difference that the strength of its accumulation is not controlled by the stimuli presented on the screen, but by the expectation that people have about the upcoming trial (i.e., parametrized as an "expected" drift rate). The core idea behind affectDDM is that in addition to the stimulus-based accumulator, controlled by the drift-rate, we include another simultaneous expectancy-driven accumulator, controlled by the expected drift-rate.</p><p>In line with the proposal by CPT that affect reflects the discrepancy between expected and actual progress, decision-related affect in our model then reflects the difference in accumulated evidence in the stimulus-driven accumulator and the expectancy-driven accumulator. Our model is agnostic about the sign of the difference. The expectancy-driven accumulator is driven by the expectation that participants have about the upcoming trial, and thus results in an amount of expected evidence, given the context.</p><p>In addition, following perceptual metacognition literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Desender et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pleskac &amp;</ref> Busemeyer, 2010), we assume that for both accumulators, evidence continues to accumulate after reaching the decision threshold for a fixed amount of time. This modeling approach is also consistent with our design, in which participants report affect only after they committed to a decision, such that their appraisal of progress can still be informed by post-decisional evidence accumulation (see Methods for full details).</p><p>Affect generation in perceptual decisions 13 <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Structe of the AffectDDM model. Perceptual decisions are thought to be the result of a noisy process of evidence accumulation controlled by drift rate v, departing at starting point z, until one of two opposing decision boundaries a or -a have been reached. In addition to the stimulus-driven accumulator (characterized by actual drift rate) that is collecting evidence about the direction of dot motion, AffectDDM assumes that there is an additional expectancy-driven accumulator (characterized by expected drift rate), from which expected amount of evidence for a current trial is estimated. The difference between actual and expected amount of evidence underlies affect computation in the model (e.g affect = actual evidenceexpected evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect generation in perceptual decisions 14</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparing AffectDDM model fits to empirical data</head><p>We fitted the affectDDM model to our empirical data to see whether it could account for the patterns seen in behavior. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, we added the model predictions (in red) on top of the behavioral data <ref type="bibr">(black)</ref> in order to evaluate model fit. As can be seen, the model provided a good fit and accurately captured the distributional properties of both correct and error RT distributions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2E</ref>). In addition, the model showed a close correspondence with the empirical affect ratings ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2D</ref>). To formally test whether the model reproduces the specific patterns seen in the empirical data, we analyzed predictions from the model. Similar to the empirical pattern, the simulated data showed a significant main effect of motion coherence on reaction times (F(1, 38) = 26.23, p &lt; .001) but no effect of expected difficulty (F(1, 11620) = 0.076, p = 0.782) nor a significant interaction effect (F(1, 11620) = 0.096, p = 0.757). Similarly to behavioral results, there was a significant main effect of motion coherence on accuracy (χ2 (1) = 70.836, p &lt; 0.001) but no effect of expected difficulty (χ2 (1) = 0.798, p = 0.371). As on the behavioral level, accuracy was highest in the easy actual progress condition (M = 0.875) and lowest in the hard actual progress condition (M = 0.559).</p><p>Crucially, model-predicted affect showed similar effects of expected and actual progress as in the empirical data. Specifically, we found main effects of expected difficulty (F(1, 38) = 11.862, p &lt; 0.01) and motion coherence (F(1, 38) = 30.147, p &lt; .001) and no interaction effect on affect (F(1, 11582) = 0.647, p = 0.421). In the model predictions affect was again most positive, when expected and actual progress were both easy (M = 4.34) and the lowest, when both conditions were hard (M = 3.64). When the expected progress was hard, but actual progress easy affect was higher (M = 4.21) than when expected progress was easy and actual progress hard (M = 3.8).</p><p>Having established that our model closely captured the patterns seen in the empirical data, we next turned toward the estimated parameters ( <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In the model, we estimated two drift-rates per actual progress manipulation (v_easy and v_hard) and two drift rates per expected progress manipulation (v_e_easy and v_e_hard). In addition to standard DDM parameters (a -threhold, ter -non-decision time), we used a free parameter controlling the duration of post-decision evidence accumulation (Ɩ) and for adjusting idiosyncrasies of scale use (bias_m, bias_sd). <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Estimated means and standard deviations of the model parameters. Parameters are the following: a-decision threshold, ter -non-decision time, v_easy -drift-rate in the easy coherence condition, v_hard -drift-rate in the hard coherence condition, v_e_easy -expected drift-rate in easy blocks, v_e_hard -expected drift-rate in the hard blocks, Ɩ -duration of the post-decisional evidence accumulation, bias_sd -standard deviation of individual level affect ratings, bias_m -mean of individual level affect ratings. Note, within-trial noise sigma was fixed to .1.</p><p>Following the idea that affect is generated as a progress prediction error, we expected to see higher driftrates in easy coherence trials compared to hard coherence trials and higher expected drift-rates in easy difficulty blocks, compared to hard difficulty blocks. In line with much literature, we observed that drift rates were higher for high coherence trials (M = 0.187) than for low coherence trials (M = 0.027), t(38) = 10.581, p &lt; .001 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4A</ref>). More importantly, the expected drift rate significantly differed between blocks where participants expected an easy trial (M = 0.187) versus a hard trial (M = 0.209), t(38) = -3.678, p &lt; .001</p><p>Affect generation in perceptual decisions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>16</head><p>(see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4B)</ref>. Interestingly, the estimates for the manipulation effect on the expected drift were directly opposite (i.e lower expected drift rate on easy trials than in hard trials) to what we would expect based on control process theory. This further consolidates the previous finding that affect does not function as progress prediction error between expected and actual progress but rather as an addition between the two. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>What are the mechanisms that determine the valence of affective experiences in perceptual decisions? Following Control Process Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carver, 2015)</ref>, we computationally implemented a theoretical mechanism that characterizes affect as emerging from expected and actual progress in an evidence accumulation framework, referred to as affectDDM. We then evaluated the theory and model predictions in a perceptual decision-making task, where we manipulated expected and actual progress in a decision and measured changes in participants' affect reports. Our analyses indicated that the affectDDM is able to simultaneously and accurately account for choice reaction times, choice accuracy, and affect. Moreover, the model predicts similar affective responses to manipulations of expected and actual progress in a decision as we observed in the empirical data.</p><p>Our behavioral results confirmed that a higher actual rate of progress towards reaching a perceptual decision resulted in faster reaction times, higher choice accuracy, and more positive affect ratings. Manipulation of expected progress did not influence choice reaction times nor accuracy but, as expected, influenced affect. Importantly, the influence of expected progress on reported affect was in the opposite direction as predicted by the CPT. More specifically, CPT predicts that affect will be most positive in the "better-than-expected" condition, i.e. when participants expect a trial to be hard (low expected progress) whereas the trial was actually easy (high actual progress). We found no support for this prediction, as on average affect was most positive when participants expected the decision to be easy (high expected progress) and it actually was (high actual progress). This insight was further supported by the modeling analysis. The AffectDDM model was able to capture this behavioral finding by fitting the expectation manipulation effect on expected drift-rate in the opposite direction as predicted by CPT.</p><p>Under a naive interpretation, this finding would imply that participants expected higher progress in hard and lower progress in easy blocks. However, this interpretation goes against our behavioral data as well as common sense, thus further indicating the mismatch between CPT as implemented in AffectDDM and the present findings.</p><p>Instead, our behavioral and computational results indicate that in the present context, affect was not a function of progress prediction error, but rather reflected an additive combination of expected and actual progress. Affect was more positive when participants expected an easy trial (i.e. strong expectancy-driven accumulation) and when it was an easy trial (i.e., strong stimulus-driven accumulation). This pattern can be explained by assuming that expected and actual progress influence affect by integrating previous and current information about the progress: an expectation that progress will be harder biases affect slightly towards negative and when the actual progress turns out indeed to be hard, affect becomes even more negative. A similar dynamic also plays for positive affect: a high progress expectation slightly contributes to more positive affect and after learning that the decision was actually easy, this contributes even more to positive affect. It is important to note that although information about expectation and actual progress is revealed sequentially, the latter, although having a stronger influence on the final affect report, does not entirely override the expectation, but adds on top of it. This recency effect is similar to findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asutay et al., 2021)</ref> where most recent affective events had the strongest effect on the current experience. However, in our model, the stronger effect of the most recent event (e.g actual progress) does not necessarily come from averaging previous affect, but as an independent component adding to affect on top of prior expectations.</p><p>From this perspective, our results suggest that, at least in the context of perceptual decision, contrary to the traditional wisdom of having low expectations as a buffer against negative events, it might actually be beneficial to have positive expectations that independently of the actual event bias the affective experience towards more positive valence. These findings also align with the mood-as-momentum account <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Eldar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rutledge et al., 2014)</ref>, where mood or momentary happiness is conceptualized as reflecting a running average of reward prediction error and as consequence biases the perception of upcoming rewards as more positive or negative depending on prior experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contribution of the present work</head><p>Although there are some previous examples of using computational techniques to understand different aspects of affect generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hesp et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Loossens et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Roberts &amp; Hutcherson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rutledge et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Scherer, 2009)</ref>, these approaches have not focused on how affect arises in the context of decision-making as function of evidence accumulation. In recent work Givon, et. al 2020 analyzed affect reports as outcomes of the evidence accumulation process using a drift diffusion model. However, our framework differs from this approach because we do not treat affect as a decision, but rather as a signal emerging from the discrepancy between expected and actual progress in the decision and thus it directly emerges as a consequence of the decision process itself. In this way, the AffectDDM enables simultaneously and rigorously connecting multiple levels of analysis and grounding some seemingly opaque higher-level phenomena such as affect, to more basic processes. Affect generation has for a long time been theorized from an information-processing perspective, where different cognitive appraisals (e.g how congruent is the situation with my goals?) determine the affective response (e.g <ref type="bibr">Moors, 2013)</ref>. However, there have been few systematic attempts to actually model the appraisal process and affect generation under these assumptions. AffectDDM provides such an account, where affect emerges from a more general, perceptual evidence accumulation process and is tied to fundamental variables characterizing it (i.e expected and actual drift-rate).</p><p>AffectDDM enables precise estimation of latent constructs, which are often hard to measure but carry the central explanatory burden for a theory. For the Control Process theory, these constructs are Affect generation in perceptual decisions 20 expected and actual progress, which our model enables estimating from choice reaction times, accuracy and affect ratings. This enables asking precise questions about the core constructs (e.g whether some manipulation has an influence on those) but also opens up the option to simulate behavioral and empirical patterns under changes in the latent variables. Using the affectDDM model, it is possible to simulate the effects of changes in the evidence accumulation process on affect, but it also opens up the possibility to use the model as an implicit "no-report" affect measurement tool (e.g Tsuchiya et al., 2015), which could be useful to eliminate response biases or reporting demand.</p><p>The present findings suggest that the dynamics described in CPT require more careful definition of what is meant by "expected progress". Generally, the expectations that people form can be divided into two related but separate forms of expectation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hesp et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Klein, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moors et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Van de Cruys et al., 2022)</ref>. On the one hand, expectations can be purely descriptive, representing the best guess about how well one is likely to do in the task. On the other hand, however, expectations can also be conative, representing desired rate of progress. For instance, a person may hold an expectation of performing more or less poorly on an upcoming task while also holding a goal to be performing more or less well on the task.</p><p>In this study, we operationalized CPT by collapsing these two interpretations, so that by manipulating expected progress, we assumed that we also manipulate desired progress. However, it might be the case that, although our manipulation did influence expected progress, it did not influence desired progress. This could potentially explain the contradictory finding against CPT as even if participants experience (expected) progress prediction errors (e.g doing worse than expected) their desired rate of progreess remained the same. When the desired rate of progress remains the same, the goal discrepancy is only influenced by the actual rate of progress and affect should be more negative the higher the discrepancy, which corresponds to our results (i.e higher actual progress = lower discrepancy = more positive affect).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future directions</head><p>Given that affectDDM provides a novel computationally inspired approach to the study of affect, it opens up several avenues for future research. The repetitive nature of our experimental paradigm might drive specific patterns over time that might be invisible in the aggregate analysis, that are not the focus in this project. Future work could therefore focus on simultaneously modeling the dynamics of learning and its influence on affect. These constraints also leave open a lot of questions about the magnitude and direction of potential moderators of affect, such as uncertainty, multiple choices and option values. As we used a probabilistic manipulation of expected progress, which might have not induced robustly strong progress prediction errors (e.g even if it's unlikely that I'll progress fast in the next trial, it might still happen). This could be addressed in the future work by comparing binary vs probabilistic prediction errors effect on affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>More importantly, as the question about the differences between desired progress and expected progress</head><p>remains open, future work should focus on dissociating expected progress from desired progress and its consequences for affect. This could potentially be done by adapting paradigms, that enable manipulating participants performance goals (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balsdon et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hausmann &amp; Läge, 2008)</ref> while orthogonally manipulating expectations about their performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We found evidence that in perceptual decision-making affect does not arise as a progress prediction error but as an additive combination of expected and actual progress. We implemented a computational model -AffectDDM that provides a novel way to jointly model choices, reactions time and affectives responses in perceptual decision-making tasks as a function expected and actual progress in evidence accumulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The study was conducted online on the Cognition.run platform and participants were recruited using the Sona systems platform of the University of KU Leuven. Ethical approval was granted by the local Ethics Committee. Participants were recruited from the KU Leuven 1st year Bachelor Psychology students pool and received credits in return for participation. Expecting data loss and following <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brysbaert &amp; Stevens, 2018)</ref> suggestion that we needed at least 1600 observations per analysis cell to obtain 80% power, we initially collected data from 67 participants. Participants were excluded if they failed one of the following criteria i) overall accuracy below 60% (8 participants) ii) context checks below 60% correct (participants were asked at random times "Is the next trial probably hard or easy?") (20 participants). Note that behavioral findings remain qualitatively similar, when including participants who did not pass the context checks in the analyses.</p><p>In addition, on a trial-by-trial level we filtered out trials with reaction times below 100ms (0.24% of the data).</p><p>The final sample consisted of 39 participants (age range 18-30, mean = 18.85, sd = 3.46, mostly female (32 F, 7 M).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental task</head><p>The experimental task was programmed using jsPsych library (De Leeuw, 2015) and implemented online within the cognition.run (www.cognition.run) experiment-hosting environment. The random-dot stimuli were constructed using a plugin within the jsPsych library <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rajananda et al., 2018)</ref>. The code for the experimental task is available at [insert OSF link upon publication].</p><p>The experiment had a 2x2 within-subjects design, with expected difficulty manipulated on 2 levels (hard block vs easy block) and actual difficulty manipulated on 2 levels (2 levels of motion coherence: 0.05 -hard vs 0.4 -easy). These levels of coherences were established in a pilot experiment, so that the hard condition would produce on average ~60% and easy condition ~90% correct trials. The trials were divided into two kinds of blocks (hard and easy) that aimed to generate either low or high expected progress for the current trial. At the start of each block and trial, participants were informed about whether they were currently performing a streak of easy or difficult trials <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). Within each easy and hard block, there was a .75 probability of effectively seeing an easy or hard trial, respectively (e.g easy -easy -easy-hard).</p><p>Participants completed a total of 50 mini-blocks consisting of 6 trials. Before the beginning of each block, participants were informed that the next block is going to be mostly easy or hard trials respectively. The random sequences of trials within blocks and between blocks were generated using a fixed seed, so all participants proceeded through the same sequence of randomized trials and blocks.</p><p>Following the message on each trial, a fixation cross was shown for 800ms followed by random-dot motion stimuli for 5000ms. Participants had to respond within the 5000ms time limit, otherwise the message "Too late!" was displayed. Participants had to use keyboard buttons C and N with their thumbs to indicate leftward or rightward motion respectively.</p><p>On the decision level, we measured overall accuracy, i.e percentage of correct responses and reaction times, to establish that the experiment worked as expected. The main dependent variable, affect, was measured on a discrete 6-point scale. Participants responded using specific finger positioning, so that their ring, middle and index fingers of both hands were placed on numbers 1, 2, 3 for the left hand and 7, 8, 9 for the right hand.</p><p>We instructed participants to try to report even slight changes in their affective state on the scale.</p><p>The scale started with the prompt ("This trial made me feel...") and had the following discrete response options: "Rather negative", "Quite negative", "Slightly negative", "Slightly positive", "Quite positive" and "Rather positive". We did not use extreme labels (e.g very negative or very positive for the affect scale), as Affect generation in perceptual decisions 24 we expected participants to not experience large emotional responses on a trial-by-trial level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The general flow of the experiment is described in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Participants provided informed consent prior to the experiment, after which they completed a computer screen size calibration procedure ("the credit card method"). They were then shown a series of instructions about the task and how they should position their hands on the keyboard to give responses. Before moving to the experimental phase, all participants had to complete 2 training blocks, the first one consisting only of easy (0.4) coherence trials with a threshold of 75% correct to move forward to the next block. If participants failed the criteria, they could attempt the training block again. The second training block had an equal amount of low and high coherence trials, with 60% trials correct as the threshold. In these training blocks, participants only reported the direction of the moving dots, without any affect reports. Before moving to the experimental phase, participants were introduced to the scales to be used and had to pass 2 test questions ("Please indicate "Rather negative", "Please indicate Quite positive") before they could move on.</p><p>In separate phases of the experiment, participants were asked to report either affect or confidence, after having responded to the direction of the moving dots (counterbalanced across participants). In the current paper, we only analyze the affect reports. In the experimental phase participants got feedback about their performance after every 25 trials, during which they were also encouraged to take small breaks. After finishing the experimental phase, participants were required to fill out a short post-task questionnaire, in which their demographics (gender, age) and impressions about the experiment (importance of the task, current mood, boredom, explicit strategies used) were queried. Completing the whole experiment took on average about 50 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Behavioral analyses were conducted in RStudio using linear mixed-effect models for affect and reactions times and generalized linear mixed effects models for analyzing accuracy relying on the packages lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bates et al., 2009)</ref> and lmerTest <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kuznetsova et al., 2015)</ref>. To estimate statistical significance of the factors in the models, we used Satterthwaite's approximation with Type III Anova if the interaction effects were included. To find the best models, we started from a model with the full fixed effects structure and the maximum random effect structure and compared this to models with maximal random effects that would converge. If a model failed to converge, we did not include this in the comparison. We used BIC as criterion for model selection and picked the model with the lowest BIC value for final analysis. For all models, we checked that variation inflation factor (VIF) were below 5. The means reported in comparisons refer to averages computed from raw data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling</head><p>To model affect ratings as the difference between actual and expected rate of progress, we expanded the vanilla drift-diffusion model (DDM) with a second (independent) accumulator. The DDM describes the decision-process as a random walk process starting at starting point z, towards a boundary (a or -a) with the speed of the evidence accumulation being controlled by the drift rate (v). A non-decision time component (ter) accounts for non-decision related aspects (e.g. stimulus encoding, motor execution). We implemented the random walk process as starting from an unbiased starting point z, and updated evidence at each step until reaching either a or -a following equation (1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1) Δe = * +σ * √ * N(0,1) Affect generation in perceptual decisions 26</formula><p>Where Δe is the change in evidence at each timestep, v is the drift rate, is the step size, σ is withintrial variability and N(0,1) is Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. For our purposes, σ was fixed to 0.1, to 0.001 (s) and z to 0 in fitting the model. In addition to the stimulus-driven accumulator which accumulates evidence based on the stimulus presented to participants, we implemented a second accumulator the speed of which was controlled by the expected drift rate. Specifically, delta e in equation 1 was computed using the actual drift rate (v) for the stimulus-based accumulator and based on the expected drift rate (v_e) for the expectancy based accumulator The only difference between both accumulators is that their speed of evidence accumulation was controlled by the stimulus (i.e. amount of motion coherence) or by the expectation about the stimulus (i.e. easy or hard block), respectively.</p><p>Given that affect judgments were given post-decision, and during this time decision-makers could obtain new evidence, we allowed both accumulators to continue collecting evidence, after a decision boundary had been reached. The post-decisional evidence accumulation followed the same update rule as described in equation 1, using the same drift rates as the pre-decision phase. The post-decisional evidence accumulation terminated after a fixed amount of time, which was controlled by a free parameter Ɩ.</p><p>To produce an affect rating, the model computed the difference between the expected (generated by expectancy-driven accumulator) and actual (generated by stimulus-driven accumulator) amount of (postdecisional) accumulated evidence.</p><p>(2) Affect raw i = evidence (e t,i ) -expected evidence (e_e t,i )</p><p>Affect generation in perceptual decisions 27 Here, affect on trial i is computed as the difference between actual accumulated evidence on trial i at time t and expected accumulated evidence on trial i on time t, where t reflects the sum of RT and Ɩ. This operationalization of affect is directly informed by the theoretical mechanism proposed by CPT, where expected progress is compared to actual progress. To map raw affect predictions (which in theory range between -Inf and Inf) onto the affect scale used by participants, we used within participant standardization free parameters (bias_sd and bias_mean), that scaled affect ratings according to idiosyncrasies of the scale use of each participant (Equation 3, see Desender et al., 2022 for a similar approach). Finally, we obtained discrete values for predicted affect by dividing standardized predictions into equal ranges that determined the bins and mapping them onto a scale from 1 to 6 as in the empirical data.</p><p>(3) Affect i = affect raw i /bias_sd + bias_m</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fitting procedure</head><p>For each participant we estimated 2 expected and 2 actual drift rates. Separate (actual) drift rates were estimated for trials with high and low motion coherence; separate expected drift rates were estimated for trials expected to be easy or difficult. The other parameters (a, ter, Ɩ, bias_sd, bias_m) were fixed across conditions. To fit the parameters, we used quantile optimization, where we defined a simultaneous cost function in terms of the discrepancy between model-predicted reaction times and affect ratings. For reaction times, we separated the data into correct and error trials and computed the proportion of trials at 5 reaction time quantiles (.1, .3, .5, .7, .9) and compared these with model predicted quantiles. For affect ratings we computed the proportion of trials per level of the scale and compared these with model predicted ratings.</p><p>The cost function we used simultaneously minimized squared error for both quantities:</p><p>(4) cost = ∑(oRTq,i -pRTq,i) 2 + ∑(oAffectq -pAffectq) <ref type="bibr">2</ref> where oRT refers to observed proportions of reaction times in quantile q separately for error and correct trials (i) and pRT to predicted proportions of reactions times for quantile q for error and correct trials (i). Similarly, oAffect refers to observed affect ratings in for each discrete level (e.g from 1 to 6) and pAffect to predicted affect ratings in the respective bins. To fit this model we used the Differential evolution algorithm implemented in the DEoptim package <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mullen et al., 2011)</ref>. We set the number of populations to 100 and set the fitting stopping criteria either to 1000 generations or if no updates in cost function have been obtained with the last 100 attempts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Behavioral results and model fits.
