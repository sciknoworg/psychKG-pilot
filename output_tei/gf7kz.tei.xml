			<abstract>
				<p>Context frames such as describing a Prisoner&apos;s Dilemma as a &quot;community&quot; or a &quot;stock exchange&quot; game cause significant variation in cooperative behaviour. Here, we draw on recent advances in research on situation construal to propose that perceived conflict of interests is a mechanism underlying framing effects on cooperation in experimental games. Specifically, we argue that people readily think about situations in terms of conflicts of interests, and how people perceive the conflict of interests in different games predicts differences in cooperation across these games. In a formal model, we show that variation in perceived conflict of interests can affect cooperative decisions even when first-order beliefs and social preferences are static. We test this model across two studies (total N = 1,615). In each study, we elicited situation perceptions and beliefs about others&apos; behaviour in a framed game. The basic framing effect replicated in a dichotomous-choice Prisoner&apos;s Dilemma (study 1), but not in a continuous-choice Prisoner&apos;s Dilemma (study 2). Perceptions of conflict of interests mediated between framing and cooperative behaviour, whereas beliefs and preferences did not. Exploratorily, perceptions of conflict of interests had a causal effect on cooperative behaviour when induced orthogonally to the frame. This study provides evidence for perceptions of conflict of interests as a mechanism underlying framing effects and integrates framing effects with the wider literature on situation perception. Moreover, it supports a causal role of situation perception in social decision-making. However, the results also call into question the generalisability of framing effects.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Playing a different game:</head><p>Situation perception mediates framing effects on cooperative behaviour There have been considerable efforts in psychology and behavioural game theory to study how "the choice an individual makes is sometimes sensitive to the way it is presented, or 'framed', in the sense that even theoretically equivalent choices may elicit different responses when presented differently" <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Roth, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> as cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach, Jaeger, &amp; Hertwig, 2017)</ref>. Recently, a class of frames that evoke certain motivations or settings-so-called "context framing" effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gerlach &amp; Jaeger, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Levin, Schneider, &amp; Gaeth, 1998)</ref>-have received renewed attention. An example is Liberman, Samuels, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ross's (2004)</ref> seminal study showing that describing the Prisoner's Dilemma as a "community" versus a "stock exchange" game induced stark differences in cooperation rates.</p><p>The dominant explanation of context framing effects is that such frames affect beliefs about the behaviour of other players (first-order beliefs), which in turn induces conditionally cooperative players to change their behaviour (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fischbacher &amp; Gächter, 2010)</ref>. Alternatively, frames may alter player's preferences about others' outcomes (social preferences; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dreber, Ellingsen, Johannesson, &amp; Rand, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ellingsen, Johannesson, Mollerstrom, &amp; Munkhammar, 2012)</ref>. Here, we draw on recent advances in research on how people construe situations to put forward an alternative mechanism.</p><p>Specifically, players may use seemingly superfluous information provided to them explicitly or implicitly through the description of the task to infer aspects of their interdependence with the other player, particularly in terms of their perceived conflict of interests (i.e., the degree to which the best outcomes for each interaction partner are conflicting). Players then act on their perception of the game (i.e., the psychological situation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Balliet, Tybur, &amp; van Lange, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gerpott, Balliet, Columbus, Molho, &amp; de PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME Vries, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rauthmann, Sherman, &amp; Funder, 2015)</ref>. We propose an experimental test of this hypothesised mechanism and a comparison against a mechanism via framedependent first-order beliefs. Overall, we integrate research on situation perception with studies of framing effects, and propose a plausible mechanism underlying context framing effects across a wide range of frames and games.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed-Motive Games</head><p>Mixed-motive games are situations that involve both an opportunity for two (or more) players to cooperate for mutual benefit and to defect for personal gain. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The Prisoner's Dilemma is a commonly studied mixed-motive game. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1A</ref> shows the outcomes for two players for each combination of their individual choices to cooperate or defect. The Prisoner's Dilemma is defined by the rank order of the four outcomes such that Temptation (T) &gt; Reward (R) &gt; Punishment (P) &gt; Sucker's payoff (S). In this game, mutual cooperation maximises joint outcomes (as 2R &gt; T+S), but there is an individual incentive to defect for personal gain (as T &gt; R). This gives rise to a conflict of interest stemming both from greed (as T &gt; R) and from fear of being exploited (as P &gt; S). Other mixed-motive games are defined by a different rank order of the outcomes.</p><p>For example, the Stag Hunt game is defined by the rank order R &gt; T &gt; P &gt; S. In this game, the reward for mutual cooperation trumps the temptation of unilateral defection (as R &gt; T), hence conflict stemming from greed is eliminated from the game (but conflict stemming from fear remains as P &gt; S). To summarize, the rank order of 1 When originally introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Schelling (1958)</ref>, 'mixed-motive games' referred to games involving both conflict of interests and mutual dependence, like the game of Chicken; however, usage has widened to include games that involve a conflict between mutual benefit and individual gain. PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME outcomes defines different types of games.</p><p>Mixed-motive games differ in the degree of conflict of interests, both between and within types of games. The most prominent index of conflict of interests is the K index <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rapoport &amp; Chammah, 1965</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stivers, 2018,</ref>  formalises two intuitions: Higher benefits from cooperation (i.e., higher R and S) increase the index, and higher benefits from defection (i.e., higher T and P) decrease it. It can be shown formally that a lower degree of conflict of interests provides a greater area of cooperation-the area defined by the combination of social preferences and first-order beliefs for which cooperation is justifiable <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Murphy &amp; Ackermann, 2015)</ref>. Consistent with this, empirical results show that cooperation rates are strongly positively correlated with indices of conflict of interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hilbig, Kieslich, Henninger, Thielmann, &amp; Zettler, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rapoport &amp; Chammah, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Vlaev &amp; Chater, 2006)</ref>. In other words, games with different indices result in different behaviour. This suggests that an index of conflict of interests can help to advance the broader conceptual understanding of how people think about games.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Framing</head><p>The concept of framing encompasses a vast range of manipulations loosely held together by the shared notion that only the "surface structure" <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Wagenaar, Keren, &amp; Lichtenstein, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. Hagen &amp; Hammerstein's, 2006</ref>, notion of "implicit features") is manipulated while the "deep structure" (or "explicit features"; especially the outcome matrix) remains the same. To taxonomise the vast range of manipulations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gerlach and Jaeger (2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref> distinguish between three broad classes of frames: focal points, valence frames, and context frames. First, in games in which game theory is indeterminate because it leaves open multiple solutions, frames can provide focal points which players use to coordinate their choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bacharach &amp; Bernasconi, 1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME</head><p>Second, framing games in terms of gains and losses-so-called valence framing <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Levin et al., 1998)</ref>-induces systematic variation in choice behaviour (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreoni, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andreoni, , 1995</ref>; for further conceptual clarification see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Levin et al., 1998</ref>; for a meta-analysis of Public Goods games see <ref type="bibr">Zelmer, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al. (2017)</ref> describe a class they call context frames. This includes manipulations that aim to induce certain motivations, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Deutsch's (1957</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Deutsch's ( , 1958</ref> exhortation to consider only one's own or, conversely, others' welfare, as well as frames that evoke certain social settings, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Liberman et al.'s (2004)</ref> "community" and "stock exchange" descriptors. Other context frames highlight certain aspects of the player's identity, such as religion primes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Shariff &amp; Norenzayan, 2007)</ref>. Our central proposition in this manuscript is that these manipulations induce subjects to think differently about their interdependence with the other player(s), especially in terms of conflict of interests. We propose such perceptions of interdependence as a mechanism that underlies at least some, and potentially the vast majority of, context framing effects described in the literature.</p><p>Mechanistic explanations of context framing effects. Three major theoretical accounts of framing effects have arisen in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bernold, Gsottbauer, Ackermann, &amp; Murphy, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ellingsen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>, namely the coordination hypothesis, the variable sociability hypothesis, as well as a less formalised social norms perspective.</p><p>First, the coordination hypothesis suggests that frames affect behaviour by altering beliefs about other players' behaviour (i.e., first-order beliefs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ellingsen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>. Even players whose preferences are not altered by a frame may behave differently if they have certain social preferences and they come to believe that other players will react to the frame. In this case, frames serve as coordination PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME devices for players with relevant social preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dreber et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ellingsen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gerlach &amp; Jaeger, 2016)</ref>. Such players condition their own behaviour on the behaviour of others, for example by cooperating only to the degree that they believe other players will cooperate <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fischbacher &amp; Gächter, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fischbacher, Gächter, &amp; Fehr, 2001</ref>). The effect is that the Prisoner's Dilemma is transformed into a Stag Hunt with pure strategy equilibria at mutual cooperation and mutual defection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ellingsen et al., 2012)</ref>. These players may draw on social context to infer others' likely behaviour, especially in the absence of better information. For example, a conditionally cooperative player <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fischbacher et al., 2001</ref>) may believe that their partner is more likely to cooperate in a "community game", and may consequently be willing to cooperate themselves. In this way, framing could lead to cooperation via first-order beliefs, as long as players have social preferences.</p><p>The second perspective proposes that frames affect behaviour by modulating players' social preferences (with <ref type="bibr">Ellingsen et al., 2012, the variable sociality hypothesis;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. McCusker &amp; Carnevale, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">van Dijk &amp; Wilke, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Weber, Kopelman, &amp; Messick, 2004)</ref>. According to this view, preferences for cooperation are unstable across situations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Levitt &amp; List, 2007)</ref>, and can be changed by the framing of a game. For example, it is a common claim that humans readily classify others as inand out-group members, and are intrinsically motivated to behave altruistically towards in-group members (i.e., parochial altruism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balliet, Wu, &amp; de Dreu, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bernhard, Fehr, &amp; Fischbacher, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">de Dreu, Balliet, &amp; Halevy, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Yamagishi &amp; Mifune, 2016</ref>). If a frame induces such in-group favouring parochial altruism in a player, their preferences may thus change to positively or negatively value benefits obtained by the other, depending on their classification of the other player <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>. In this way, framing may affect cooperative behaviour via frame-dependent variable social preferences.</p><p>Formalising both the coordination and variable sociality hypothesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ellingsen et al. (2012)</ref> show that for various values of a social preference parameter, a Prisoner's Dilemma may be transformed into another game, such as the Stag Hunt, in utilities.</p><p>Alternatively, for players with (stable) social preferences, a Prisoner's Dilemma may be transformed into a Stag Hunt in utilities given a belief that the other player will cooperate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ellingsen et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Norm theories form a third class of theories that aim to explain framing effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bicchieri, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Biel &amp; Thøgersen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>. According to these accounts, individuals first identify the given situation as an exemplar of some class of situations. Classification makes accessible a script-beliefs about actions that are appropriate in this class of situations. Once a script is activated, people follow the norm embedded in the script when they believe others to do so (first-order beliefs, in descriptive norms) and/or when following the rule is what they believe others expect them to do (second-order beliefs, in social norms). Context frames may lead people to identify a game as an exemplar of different classes of social situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bicchieri, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>For example, a "community game" may be identified as an instance of communal sharing, whereas a "stock market game" may be identified as a case of market pricing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fiske, 1992)</ref>. These different classes of situations may then come with different decision rules, leading to frame-induced changes in behaviour. In this way, norms accounts can capture all framing effects; at the same time, they do not specify distinct mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gerlach &amp; Jaeger, 2016</ref>; note also that Gerlach et al., 2017 do not identify outcomes that would falsify a social norms account). Indeed, insofar as people follow descriptive norms-i.e., conditioning only on their first-order beliefs-the account makes the same predictions as the coordination hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior empirical tests of mechanistic accounts. Sequential games have been</head><p>exploited to test the coordination hypothesis, as changes in first-order beliefs are a plausible mechanism only for simultaneous games. In games in which players move sequentially (i.e., the first player's choice is known to the second player, as in the Trust Game) or in which the player's outcomes are independent of the other player's choices (such as the Dictator Game), first-order beliefs seemingly cannot explain framing effects. Some studies have used this to experimentally compare the variable sociality and coordination hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dreber et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ellingsen et al., 2012)</ref>. Evidence from sequential games is mixed, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al. (2017)</ref> provide meta-analytic evidence of framing effects on Dictator Game giving, which speaks against first-order beliefs as the sole mechanism underlying context framing effects. However, framing effects on elicited beliefs are also well-documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>. This opens up the possibility that beliefs may play a role even in non-strategic games where they should have no bearing on behaviour (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rabbie, Schot, &amp; Visser, 1989)</ref>. We take this finding to suggest that first-order beliefs may explain some, but likely not all variation induced by context frames.</p><p>Most evidence favouring the variable sociality hypothesis comes from the observation of framing effects on behaviour in Dictator and sequential games, in which beliefs ought to be irrelevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>. Frame-induced changes in Dictator Game giving, in particular, have been interpreted as evidence that frames affect social preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dreber et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ellingsen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>. However, while such studies can show that frames do not (or at least not entirely) enter behaviour through beliefs, they only provide indirect support for the variable sociality hypothesis.</p><p>Indeed, they do not exclude other explanations, such as social norms accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref> or a mechanism via perceptions of interdependence, as proposed here.</p><p>To test the variable sociality hypothesis directly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bernold et al. (2014)</ref> elicited social preferences using the social value orientation slider measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Murphy, Ackermann, &amp; Handgraaf, 2011)</ref>. Social preferences were not affected by framing.</p><p>However, this may be a matter of procedure: framing was implemented by varying the name of the game (between "Community" and "Wall Street", as well as two other conditions, "Environment" and a neutral treatment), but social preferences were elicited before the social dilemma task was explained to the participants. Overall, there is little empirical work directly studying how framing affects social preferences, so this pathway remains understudied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Framing Effects via Situation Perceptions</head><p>There has been surprisingly little work on how people think about the games they play (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Butler, Burbank, &amp; Chisholm, 2011)</ref>. Experimentalists put significant effort into making sure that players correctly understand the structure of the game before making a decision (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Guala, 2005)</ref>, and consequently the common assumption has been that players directly interact with the deep structure of the experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hagen &amp; Hammerstein, 2006)</ref>. Indeed, both the variable sociality and the coordination hypothesis tacitly assume that players accurately perceive their own material payoffs as well as those of the other player. Players are merely thought to transform the utility matrix under the influence of frames-such that a Prisoner's Dilemma becomes, for example, a Stag Hunt game in utilities. In contrast, we will argue that framing affects players' perception of conflict of interests-i.e. that framing leads players to think differently about the material payoff structure of the game. In this case, a player may perceive a Prisoner's Dilemma described as a "stock exchange" game as containing a greater degree of conflict of interests with the other player than the same matrix described as a "community" game. The player then plays this transformed game rather than the game described by the explicit features communicated to them.</p><p>Recently developed models of how people think about situations (such as an economic game) posit that people draw on many features of their environment as well as internal states to construct a psychological situation on which they act <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balliet et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rauthmann et al., 2015)</ref>. This psychological situation is not a matrix, but rather thought to be a set of dimensions on which situations-including games in the laboratory-differ. A number of different sets of dimensions have been proposed in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balliet et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gerpott et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Parrigon, Woo, Tay, &amp; Wang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rauthmann et al., 2014)</ref>. Functional Interdependence Theory-which draws on Interdependence Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kelley et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kelley &amp; Thibaut, 1978)</ref>-proposes a dimension of conflicting (vs. corresponding) interests that is explicitly thought to track the K index <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balliet et al., 2017)</ref>. Empirical results support the importance of this dimension. For example, people can easily describe situations high or low in conflict of interest and readily rate daily life and laboratory situations-including experimental games-on a corresponding scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gerpott et al., 2018)</ref>. Hence, we have good reasons to assume that perceptions of conflict of interests may indeed mediate the effects of explicit features of games on choice behaviour. For example, one study found that perceptions of conflict of interests fully explained the difference in cooperation rates between a Dictator Game and a Prisoner's Dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gerpott et al., 2018)</ref>. This supports the claim that (typical) players base their decision not directly on the payoff matrix of a game, but rather integrate the information in this matrix into variables representing the dimensions of interdependence. It is this psychological situation on which players base their decision. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Our argument also builds on previous research on the role of illusions in people's decision to cooperate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron (1997)</ref> observed that when presented with scenarios of social dilemmas in which cooperation is not in one's (monetary) selfinterest, participants would nevertheless insist that it was. This self-interest illusion is moderated by deep but irrelevant features of the game: When participants played a public goods game either with a single group or with two groups where one group's gain is the other group's loss (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bornstein &amp; Ben-Yossef, 1994)</ref>, individuals were more likely to (erroneously) believe that cooperation with their in-group was in their self-interest and that they would gain more money if they contributed to the group's public good in the 'conflict' condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baron, 2001)</ref>. In an extension of this work, we provide a perspective that integrates this single bias into a comprehensive account of situation perception and bring this perspective to bear on framing effects.</p><p>Formalising the situation perception mechanism. Previous work has shown that subjective perceptions of conflict of interests reflect differences in objective conflict of interest (i.e., deep structure) between different games, and may mediate the effect of such differences on behaviour. We propose that differences in the description of games (i.e., surface structure) are similarly integrated into the mental representation of the games, which becomes the basis for behaviour. For example, describing a Prisoner's Dilemma as a 'community game' may lead players to perceive the game as containing less conflict of interests, compared to a description of a 'stock exchange game'. This changes the area of cooperation-i.e., the degree of positive expectations and prosocial preferences required for a players to choose to behave cooperatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Murphy &amp; Ackermann, 2015)</ref>. We first establish a simple model of cooperation under different degrees of conflict of interests. Consider the Prisoner's Dilemma given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B</ref>. This matrix has parameters T (temptation) = 10, R (reward) = 8, P (punishment) = 4, and S (sucker's payoff) = 2; therefore, K = 0.5. This reflects the size of payoffs resulting from potential cooperation (i.e., R, S) relative to the size of payoffs resulting from potential defection (i.e., T, P), or in other words the severity of the conflict of interests. The degree of conflict of interests of a PD can affect a player's behaviour if (and only if) the player has positive social preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Murphy &amp; Ackermann, 2015)</ref>. Further, given a particular K index and a player's social preferences, the player's decision will also depend on their belief about whether the other player will cooperate <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Murphy &amp; Ackermann, 2015</ref>).</p><p>There exist various models of social preferences. For the sake of simplicity, we adopt the model used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy and Ackermann (2015)</ref>. The joint utility function for a player attaches a single parameter α to the other player's payoff:</p><p>(π , π ) = π + α × π .</p><p>( <ref type="formula">1)</ref>Here, πs is the player's own payoff, πo is the other player's payoff, and α is an index of social preferences.</p><p>Cooperation in the PD further requires a certain degree of trust; i.e., a belief β that the other player will also choose to cooperate. This belief must be sufficient so that the risk of unilateral defection is outweighed by the expected utility from mutual cooperation. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy and Ackermann (2015)</ref> propose a model of cooperation under social preferences and positive expectations. In this model, the expected utility from choosing to cooperate is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) = [β × ( + α × )] + [(1 − β) × ( + α × )].<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The expected utility from choosing to defect is, in turn,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) = [β × ( + α × )] + [(1 − β) × ( + α × )].<label>(3)</label></formula><p>These formulas allow the computation of values of α and β for which</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">cooperation becomes favoured [i.e., u(C) &gt; u(D)]</formula><p>given a specific PD matrix. The area of cooperation is the set of values (α, β) for which cooperation is favoured on any given matrix. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy and Ackermann (2015)</ref> observe that "as the K-index increases, the size of the cooperate area […] generally increases as well" (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>). In other words, games with a higher K index require weaker social preferences and/or less positive expectations to justify cooperation. Previous accounts of framing effects on cooperative behaviour have considered that either social preferences (i.e., α) or first-order beliefs (i.e., β) may be framedependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ellingsen et al., 2012)</ref>. Here, we propose that conflict of interests also enters behaviour via a psychological mechanism and that perceptions of conflict of interests may equally be frame-dependent. Specifically, we suggest that people do not respond to the matrix directly, but rather integrate cues from the deep and surface structure of the game into an internal index of conflict of interests, which in turn informs behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balliet et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Holmes, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rauthmann et al., 2015)</ref>.

In the following studies, we draw on a measure of perceived conflict of interests, the conflict subscale of the Situational Interdependence Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gerpott et al., 2018)</ref>, to measure , test the degree to which it is influenced by framing effects, and probe perceptions of interdependence as a mechanism underlying framing effects on behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Studies</head><p>In the following, we present two studies. Study 1 was independently preregistered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) before submitting this PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME manuscript. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">3</ref> The study involves preregistered sequential analyses for two waves of data ( 1 = 323; 2 = 205).

This means that framing will alter perceptions of conflict of interests, which in turn will lead to variation in cooperative behaviour. An alternative account is the coordination hypothesis, according to which framing affects behaviour via first-order beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ellingsen et al., 2012)</ref>. We therefore elicit beliefs about the other player's behaviour and test for mediation by conflict of interests while controlling for beliefs as an alternative mechanism.</p><p>H3: Conflict of interests mediate the effect of framing on cooperative choices after controlling for mediation by beliefs.</p><p>We test for causal mediation of framing by perceived conflict of interests without (model 1) and with alternative mediation by first-order beliefs (model 2).</p><p>Hypothesis 1 is tested by the average total effect in model 1. A failure to reject the null hypothesis of no total effect of framing treatment on cooperative choices will be interpreted as evidence against framing effects on cooperative behaviour in Prisoner's Dilemma games. Hypothesis 2 is tested by the average causal mediation effect in model 1. It is possible that there is a framing effect, but that perceptions of conflict of interests are not the underlying mechanism (i.e., no causal mediation effect in model 1).</p><p>Therefore, in case we observe a significant average total effect but no significant average causal mediation effect, we will test the effect of framing treatment on perceptions of conflict of interests, including all covariates included in model 1. A failure to reject the null hypothesis of no effect of framing treatment on perceptions of conflict will be treated as evidence against effects of changes to the surface structure of games-such as framing-on perceptions of interdependence. Hypothesis 3 is the central test to evaluate the proposed mechanism and is tested by the average causal mediation effect in model 2.</p><p>PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME</p></div>

In such a procedure, interim analyses are specified a priori, and α thresholds are adjusted for multiple testing to ensure consistent type I error control. This means that despite multiple testing, the total type I error rate remains fixed at five percent under this procedure. We therefore preregistered sequential analyses on up to two waves of data. We computed two-sided symmetric Pocock-type bounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Pocock, 1977)</ref> for k = 2 equally spaced time points and total α = .05 using the R package 'GroupSeq' <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Pahl, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pahl, Ziegler, &amp; König, 2006)</ref>.

We aimed to replicate the effect of framing a Prisoner's Dilemma as either a "stock exchange" or a "community" game. This framing was first used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Liberman et al.

The procedure is designed to avoid, as much as possible, problems with causal interpretations of mediation analyses (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kline, 2015)</ref>. The causal paths X → Y and X → M are assured by random assignment to treatments. The procedure is designed to preclude reverse causality between M and Y (i.e., Y → M) by establishing temporal precedence. Confounding of this path is addressed in the analysis.

Therefore, we aim to ascertain to the degree possible that reported situation perceptions precede the decision to cooperate. The procedure and different order treatments are summarised in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref>. In treatments 1A/B and 2A/B, participants were first instructed to imagine a hypothetical framed Prisoner's Dilemma game. This game is otherwise equivalent to the actual game.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Descriptive results. Based on the non-imputed data, participants cooperated more when the game was framed was a community game (cooperation rate p̂ = .684) than when it was framed as a stock exchange game (p̂ = .577; OR = 1.586). They had more positive expectations (rate of cooperative expectations, p̂ = .653 vs. p̂ = .610; OR = 1.202) and perceived the game as containing less conflict of interests ( ̅ = 4.156, SD = .757 vs. ̅ = 4.320, SD = .777; Cohen's = .214). Zero-order correlations between all treatments and measured variables are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Mediation analyses. To test the total treatment and the indirect effect, we used a mediation approach within the potential outcomes framework, which allows for a causal interpretation under the assumption of sequential ignorability <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Imai, Keele, &amp; Tingley, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kline, 2015)</ref>. Although this assumption cannot be tested, we report sensitivity PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME analyses which indicate the robustness of the presented model to confounding by unobserved variables. The key sensitivity parameter is ρ, the correlation of the residuals of the mediator and outcome regressions; the analysis indicates the level of ρ for which the average causal mediation effect is zero. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the mediation model fitted to each imputed dataset separately and the estimated sensitivity parameters for each model were averaged. The key hypothesis was that perceptions of conflict of interests mediate the effect of framing on cooperative behaviour. This hypothesis was tested by causal mediation analysis using the package 'mediation' for R <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Imai et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tingley, Yamamoto, Hirose, Keele, &amp; Imai, 2014</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). Perceptions of conflict account for 25.6% of the total framing effect. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the average causal mediation effect would be 0 when ρ = -0.2; i.e., for a confound inducing a correlation of -0.2 between the residuals of the mediator and the outcome regression. We also tested for heterogeneity of variances using plots of residuals versus fitted values using fitted regression models for the mediator and outcome variables; these plots were generated for each of the imputed datasets separately. Plots did not indicate heteroscedasticity for either model 1 or model 2. Note: ACME = average causal mediation effect; ADE = average direct effect.</p><p>In model 2, we tested whether this mediation holds even after accounting for beliefs about the other players' behaviour as an alternative mediator.

Since no significant average causal mediation effect was discovered, we did not further test for robustness of the mediation effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory analyses</head><p>Predictors of cooperation. The preregistered analyses showed an indirect effect of frames on cooperative behaviour via perceived conflict of interests; however, this effect was not robust to inclusion of beliefs as an alternative mediator. We therefore explored the effects of beliefs and perceptions of conflict on cooperative behaviour. For the exploratory analyses, we report 95% confidence intervals. We tested whether beliefs mediated the effect of framing on cooperative decisions, using a model analogous to model 1 with beliefs as the mediator. This yielded a significant average causal mediation effect <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 4)</ref> which accounts for 14.3% of the total effect. 8 Furthermore, we tested the individual paths of model 1 separately. This analyses showed that the framing affected perceptions of conflict of interests <ref type="bibr">(B = 0.192,</ref><ref type="bibr">SE = 0.067,</ref><ref type="bibr">t(520.522)</ref> = 2.869, p = 0.004). Moreover, individual differences in the perception of conflict of interest predicted cooperative decisions <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 5</ref>, model 1). After also entering beliefs, this effect remained significant. Beliefs, in addition, strongly predicted the rate of cooperation <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 5</ref>, model 2).

Interdependence Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kelley et al., 2003</ref>) describes people's interdependence in a given situation along multiple dimensions, of which conflict of interests is just one. We measured perceptions of conflict of interests using the Situational Interdependence Scale, which also contains subscales for four other dimensions of interdependence. Mutual dependence, in particular, is the degree to which interaction partners can control each other's outcomes through their choices. This dimension of interdependence may also be evoked by the reference to community in the frames we used.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We replicate the effect of framing a Prisoner's Dilemma as either a 'stock market' or 'community' game on rates of cooperation. Framing the game as a community game lead to an 11% point increase in cooperation relative to describing it as a stock exchange game. This effect is in line with the effect size reported in the metaanalysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al. (2017)</ref>, although the overall rate of cooperation was somewhat higher in our study.</p><p>As predicted, perceptions of conflict of interests mediated the effect of framing the Prisoner's Dilemma on the rate of cooperative decisions. Framing significantly swayed participants' perception of the game as involving a conflict of interests, and these perceptions translated into lower rates of cooperation under the 'stock exchange' frame. When we controlled for participants' beliefs, however, this indirect effect became statistically non-significant. 9 This may mean that perceptions of conflict are a spurious side-effect, while frames enter behaviour via first-order beliefs. However, it is also possible that perceptions of conflict of interests and beliefs are chained causal mechanisms. We further test this possibility in study 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>Our results from study 1 raise the question how perceived conflict of interests relates to the belief that one's interaction partner will behave cooperatively. Perceived conflict and beliefs showed a small zero-order correlation (r -.15, 95% CI = -.24, -.07]).</p><p>The most plausible explanation is that perceptions of higher conflict of interests lead to more negative expectations. After all, we have argued here that perceiving a conflict of interests should reduce, ceteris paribus, people's willingness to behave cooperatively.</p><p>Thus, perceptions of conflict of interests may affect behaviour via two routes: Once by reducing the willingness to behave cooperatively directly, and once by inducing more negative expectations about others' likely behaviour. Such a chained mechanism cannot be distinguished from confounding based on the data from study 1.</p><p>A solution to confounding by post-treatment covariates is to also experimentally manipulate the mediator. Specifically, in the parallel encouragement design, one half of the participants completes the standard experiment with a measured mediator. The other half undergoes a second manipulation, which randomly "encourages" them to take a high (vs. low) value on the mediator <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Imai, Tingley, &amp; Yamamoto, 2013)</ref>. The parallel encouragement design identifies the (unconfounded) causal mediation effect under a set of plausible assumptions . We thus experimentally manipulated perceived conflict of interests in a parallel encouragement design to test the causal mediation effect.</p><p>Another limitation of this first study is that beliefs and decisions were both elicited through binary choice tasks. Especially because participants were presented with these tasks directly after each other, it is likely that this introduced common method bias-i.e., the association between beliefs and decisions was inflated because they were measured in similar ways. Therefore, we used a continuous Prisoner's Dilemma game and elicited beliefs using the most likely interval rule <ref type="bibr">(Schlag &amp; van der</ref> Weele, 2015) to avoid common method bias.</p></div>

Entering standardised regression coefficients for the a (β = .125), b (β = -.500), and c' (β = -.150) paths obtained from the study 1 data suggested a necessary N = 666 for 90% power on the indirect effect. To account for uncertainty in the effect size estimate, we aimed to collect 1.5 times the minimum sample necessary for 90% power, i.e., N = 999 participants.</p><p>Sample characteristics.

The difference to the target sample size is due to oversampling on the side of the survey agency. Participants were largely naïve to the task; 86.03% did not know about the game before, and 90.90% had never participated in a game.</p><p>Materials. We again aimed to replicate the effect of framing a Prisoner's Dilemma as either a "stock exchange" or a "community" game. In contrast to study 1, we used a continuous Prisoner's Dilemma game in the exchange format <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Verhoeff, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yamagishi &amp; Kiyonari, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yamagishi, Terai, Kiyonari, Mifune, &amp; Kanazawa, 2007)</ref>. In this form of the Prisoner's Dilemma, each participant receives an endowment = 10€, of which they can transfer any sum 0 ≤ ≤ to the other player. The transferred sum is doubled. Cooperation is thus a continuous rather than a dichotomous variable. This is convenient because it allowed us to use different measures for decisions and belief elicitation, rather than to elicit both through binary choice tasks. This serves to reduce common method bias that might inflate the association between beliefs and choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME</head><p>Framing was implemented by describing the game as either a "community game" or a "stock market game", as in study 1.

The items on the original subscale of the SIS frequently refer to "preferences" or "preferred outcomes", which might lead to confounding between perceptions of conflict of interests and other-regarding preferences. To address the concern that this might have influenced the results of study 1, we therefore rewrote the items to refer to "best" or "most profitable" outcomes (Appendix 1). The scale showed acceptable reliability (Ω = .68).</p><p>Beliefs about the other player's behaviour were assessed using the most likely interval (MLI) elicitation rule . Using this rule, the participant is paid based on the width of the specified interval and on whether or not the eventual outcome falls within the interval. The scoring rule can be varied by a parameter γ, which specifies the degree to which a subject is penalised for providing a wider interval. When subjects state their beliefs about the value of x on the domain <ref type="bibr">[a, b]</ref> as the interval <ref type="bibr">[L, U]</ref>, which has width W, the payment received is denoted as SM(L, U, x), which depends on W and γ as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( , , ) = { (1 − − ) ∈ [ , ] 0 ∉ [ , ]<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where g = (1−γ)/γ . Thus, when γ = .5, payment is linearly decreasing with the width of the stated interval as a fraction of the domain of x. γ can be interpreted as the minimum confidence level, though the actual degree of confidence may be greater than γ if the subject is risk averse. Because risk-averse subjects can choose to specify a wider interval, the MLI rule is valid for all degrees of risk aversion of the subject.</p><p>We used the MLI rule with γ = .5 and maximum SM = 10€ to elicit participants'</p><p>beliefs about the amount transferred by the other player .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In study 2, we set out to show that framing a Prisoner's Dilemma as either a community game or a stock exchange game affects prosocial behaviour through a causal mediation by perceived conflict of interest, rather than changes in beliefs or preferences.</p><p>In contrast to study 1, there was only a very small, non-significant framing effect.</p><p>However, part of this framing effect was accounted for by perceived conflict of interests, and this indirect effect was statistically significant. In contrast, indirect effects via beliefs or preferences were non-significant. Hence, findings support our mechanistic account according to which frames enter behaviour via perceptions of conflict of interests, though we find no evidence to support an overall framing effect on cooperative behaviour.</p><p>Incidentally, our design comprised an orthogonal manipulation of perceptions of conflict of interests using a second, more targeted frame. This allowed us to test the causal effect of perceptions of conflict of interests on cooperative behaviour. Indeed, induced perceptions of conflict of interests predicted prosocial behaviour, and did so PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME even when controlling for first-order beliefs as an alternative mechanism. As in study 1, beliefs and preferences were correlated, and both were changed by the conflict frame.</p><p>However, in study 2, it is much more plausible to interpret the changes in first-order beliefs as a downstream consequence of changes in perceptions of conflict of interests.</p><p>Indeed, we find evidence for such a mechanism, although the results are not very robust to violations of key assumptions needed for a causal interpretation, as indicated by the small sensitivity parameter (ρ = .1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Discussion</head><p>Mere changes in the way a choice is presented can affect whether or not a person behaves cooperatively or defects-such context framing effects are well-supported in the economic and psychological literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>. In recent years, a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain how describing a game as a 'Community' rather than a 'Stock Market' game might lead to more cooperative choices. Most prominent among these are accounts positing framing-induced changes in first-order beliefs and in social preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ellingsen et al., 2012)</ref>. Here, we sought to test an alternative account: That frames change how people think about games, and specifically, the degree of conflict of interests people perceive in a game.</p><p>In study 1, we replicate the 'Community' vs. 'Stock Market' framing effect on cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma. We also find evidence that perceived conflict of interests, as well as first-order beliefs, can explain at least part of this framing effect.</p><p>However, our results are inconclusive about the relationship between perceived conflict of interests and first-order beliefs. In study 2, we find no support for an overall framing effect on cooperative behaviour in the continuous-choice Prisoner's Dilemma.</p><p>However, the results show that framing affected cooperative behaviour by changing PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME perceptions of conflict of interests. In contrast, our data do not support a mechanism via either first-order beliefs or social preferences.</p><p>Across both studies, we elicited three possible mechanisms: perceived conflict of interests, first-order beliefs, and-only in study 2-social preferences. We find a non-significant effect of framing on beliefs in both studies, and in study 2 also on social preferences. In contrast, framing the Prisoner's Dilemma as a "stock market game"</p><p>increased perceived conflict of interests in both studies. These results call into question the coordination hypothesis, according to which frames enter behaviour via first-order beliefs, although it is in line with the non-significant effect of conflict-related frames on first-order beliefs in <ref type="bibr">Gerlach et al.'s (2017)</ref> meta-analysis. We also find no relationship between framing and social preferences in study 2. To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly elicit social preferences alongside a framed game. However, given the non-significant framing effect on cooperative behaviour, we see a need for further studies investigating the relationship between framing and social preferences.</p><p>Our disparate findings from studies 1 and 2 are best explained by a seemingly minor difference in the experimental task. In study 1, we used a Prisoner's Dilemma with a dichotomous choice, whereas in study 2, we used a continuous-choice Prisoner's Dilemma. Importantly, the two games are formally equivalent. Yet, there is some evidence from comparing Prisoner's Dilemmas and Public Goods Games that framing effects might be weaker when prosocial behaviour is not a matter of cooperation and defection, but of degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gerlach et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al. (2017)</ref> estimated the framing effect to be 8.9% points smaller in Public Goods Games. However, this metaanalysis reported very few studies with two-player Public Goods Games, including only a single such study on conflict-related frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brandts &amp; Schwieren, 2009)</ref>. Thus, there is very limited prior direct evidence that framing more strongly affects choices when they are dichotomous rather than continuous. Since we do not test this idea directly, further research is needed to substantiate this explanation, and to provide an account of why the size of the choice set matters for the impact of frames.</p><p>While the main framing effect (i.e., changing the name of the game) was negligible in study 2, another framing effect, implemented by adding a simple note emphasising either conflicting or corresponding interests, did have an impact on prosocial behaviour. Notably, this manipulation is similar to the earliest conflict frames applied to the Prisoner's Dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Deutsch, 1957</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Deutsch, , 1958</ref>, and fits the definition of conflict framing developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gerlach et al. (2017)</ref>. We find strong evidence that this framing effect works by changing people's perceptions of conflict of interests.</p><p>Moreover, the effect cannot be accounted for by changes in beliefs. Indeed, insofar as frames change people's beliefs about the choices of others, they might do so because they change their perceptions of conflict of interests in the game. This provides first evidence that perceptions of interdependence have a causal influence on prosocial behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Across two studies, we tested the proposition that context frames, such as calling the Prisoner's Dilemma a 'Community' or a 'Stock Market' game, enter cooperative behaviour by changing people's perception of the conflict of interests involved in the game. We replicate this framing effect in the dichotomous-choice, but not in the continuous-choice Prisoner's Dilemma. Across both studies, we find evidence that this framing affects perceptions of conflict of interests, and that these changes translate into changes in cooperative behaviour, whereas first-order beliefs and social preferences do not. In addition, we find evidence that perceptions of conflict of interests have a causal PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME effect on prosocial behaviour, and that this effect cannot be accounted for by changes in social preferences or beliefs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The Prisoner's Dilemma.

For simplicity, we assume that = = = ; i.e., the frame equally affects different motivational factors of the game. However, asymmetries can easily be incorporated in the model. Replacing the K index in Murphy and Ackermann's (2015) simulation with , which responds to changes in K as well as to changes in the surface structure δ, we can see that frames may affect the rate of cooperative choices via perceptions of conflict of interests, even when (positive) social preferences and first-order beliefs are stable (see supplementary materials)</figDesc></figure>
