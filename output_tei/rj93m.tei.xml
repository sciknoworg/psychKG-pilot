			<abstract>
				<p>At present, most developmental psychology experiments use participants from a mere subsection of the world&apos;s population. Moreover, like other fields of psychology, many studies in developmental psychology suffer from low statistical power due to small samples and limited observations. Online testing holds promise as a way to achieve more representative and robust, better powered experiments. As participants do not have to visit in person, it is easier to access populations living further away from a developmental lab, enabling testing of more diverse populations (e.g., urban vs rural areas, various different nationalities or geographies), both within and beyond the researcher&apos;s home country. Furthermore, due to the codified nature of browser-based online testing, it is possible for multiple labs to carry out the exact same study, allowing for better replications. Because of these advantages, developmental researchers have started to move experiments online so that caregivers and their children can participate from their home environments. However, the transition from traditional lab testing to remote online testing brings many challenges. Laboratory studies of infant and child development are typically conducted under highly standardized conditions to control factors, such as distractors, distance to the screen, movement, and lighting, and often rely on specialized equipment for measuring behavior. In this book chapter, we provide a guide for researchers considering online testing of a developmental population. The different sections comprise an overview of the decision-making processes and the state-of-the-art advances associated with, as well as tangible recommendations for, online data collection.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in testing children remotely (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kominsky et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rhodes et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sheskin &amp; Keil, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sheskin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tran et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zaadnoordijk et al., 2021)</ref>. Remote or online testing takes different forms. The researcher may contact the participant and present the instructions and potential stimuli via video calling software, whilst simultaneously recording the answers or capturing the video. This method is known as moderated or synchronous testing. It allows the researcher to be in direct contact with the participant, which can be very helpful for certain paradigms, research questions, or populations, but it requires the researcher and the participant to be available at the same time. A second option, which resolves this problem, is unmoderated or asynchronous testing. This type of testing happens primarily via the browser. The participant logs into the testing platform and follows the instructions, while their responses are recorded via web forms (when testing adults or older children) or webcam recordings (when testing infants or younger children). Benefits of asynchronous testing are that participants can participate at a time convenient to caregiver and child and that data can be collected from multiple participants simultaneously. While this chapter will focus primarily on the aforementioned two forms of remote data collection, it is important to point out that data collection via mobile apps is another asynchronous way of acquiring data.</p><p>Interest in online testing methods has been boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic during which face-to-face testing was impossible. Indeed, online testing offered a possibility of acquiring data without the risk of infection. However, the online testing method has important benefits also outside of the context of the pandemic, relating to research cost, sample size, and sample diversity. Approximately 12% of the global population is western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD), but they make up 80% of participants in psychology experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Henrich et al., 2010</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nielsen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Singh et al., 2021)</ref>. Conclusions based on these participants thus may not generalize to the remaining 88% of the population. Since online testing can be done from any location, it has the potential to reach populations that do not live close to research laboratories or who cannot participate during regular working hours, increasing the diversity of the samples tested and the possibility for cross-cultural research. At the same time, it is important to recognize that online testing is not a miracle solution to the WEIRD problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lourenco &amp; Tasimi, 2020)</ref>. For participant recruitment, the reachability of different populations via, for example, internet advertising and social media presence, varies widely (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ozernov-Palchik, et al., in press</ref>). Furthermore, paradigms rely on different types of home equipment (e.g., a webcam, loudspeakers, etc.) and access to a device with an internet connection is always required. This may limit data acquisition in certain countries or parts of the population (e.g., low-income and minority households) due to the "digital divide" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lourenco &amp; Tasimi, 2020)</ref>. Fortunately, computers, webcams and internet connections are becoming increasingly accessible. Data from 2017 show that nearly 50% of the world population was using the internet. Moreover, among individuals ranked as having a low income, 16.3% were using the internet in 2017 compared to 2.2% just ten years earlier (data.worldbank.org).</p><p>In addition to the persistent WEIRD bias, many studies in developmental psychology suffer from low statistical power <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bergmann et al., 2018)</ref> due to small sample sizes and limited observations per participant <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Byers-Heinlein et al., 2021)</ref>. Online testing, especially when done asynchronously, allows researchers to test larger samples in less time because the study can be accessed by multiple participants in parallel, including those who cannot come to the lab. The replicability of studies increases as well, as codified and fully automatized online experiments are easily replicable and extendable. In asynchronous studies, all details related to the design, protocol, instructions, and testing session are specified in sharable and reusable code, materials, and text. Therefore, everyone can use the same protocol, which facilitates replications and collaborations between labs, and there is no need for specific lab equipment. Moreover, online studies are often cheaper. They are less labor-intensive and, when testing asynchronously, there is no need to spend time on scheduling the sessions, which reduces the number of researcher hours.</p><p>Furthermore, since the studies can be done at a suitable time for the child, the chance of successful data acquisition increases, leading to quicker completion of data collection. Therefore, with online testing, we can improve the study's accessibility, the sample diversity, the study's replicability, and the ease for both researcher as well as participant.</p><p>At the same time, online testing, especially with developmental populations, requires a different decision process compared to conducting studies in the lab. In many cases, the switch to online testing comes with new challenges, different procedures and novel considerations relating to aspects such as recruitment, data quality, and data protection. Moreover, not every research question is equally suitable for online testing. As online testing is new to many developmental scientists, which comes with many novel decisions and challenges, in this book chapter we will take the reader through the decision processes related to online testing of infants, toddlers and young children and highlight the benefits and downsides of the different options available within the current state-of-the-art. In doing so, the possibilities as well as the limitations of each approach will be flagged. We will further provide resources and reading recommendations for detailed enquiries into particular topics such as specific paradigms, populations, and research goals. As such, we aim to provide a guide for those who are new to online testing or who wish to update their knowledge on the current advances being made.</p><p>We first deal with practical questions relating to ethics and data protection (Section 2) and recruitment (Section 3), before diving into the scientific aspects of online testing. In Section 4, we describe the decision process regarding choice of paradigms for several common paradigms used for testing early development. Then, in Section 5, we discuss ways to improve data quality. Section 6 elaborates on decisions regarding technical aspects of online testing. Section 7 contains reflections on aspects of data analysis that differ from laboratory studies. Section 8 comprises an "encyclopedic" section with useful resources for anyone who wishes to engage with online infant testing. And finally, in section 9, we outline open questions and future directions for the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Considering ethics and data protection</head><p>Before any type of data collection, ethical aspects and various forms of data protection have to be considered. Online testing is no different in this respect. Regarding ethics, in many ways, online data collection does not differ from lab-based data collection, but a few unexpected facets have caused new challenges. In terms of data protection, there are some crucial differences that must be taken into account before data collection commences. Below, we will highlight these differences and offer possibilities for solutions.</p><p>Most asynchronous and many synchronous online studies use webcam recordings. This is identifiable data, which has consequences for the implementations regarding data security (more on this later). There are further ramifications that have to be taken into account. Caregivers cannot provide informed consent to the recording beforehand as their environment is less controlled than the lab and they cannot be certain what will be captured on the video. It is therefore a good practice to allow caregivers to view the video before submitting it to the researcher's server in case anything unwanted has been captured on screen (e.g., another family member passing by without clothes). In the same spirit, it is recommended to ask caregivers about their data sharing preferences after the experiment as they will have better insight into what has been captured and will be shared.</p><p>Acquiring data online also requires additional consideration regarding reimbursements. Finding a good general solution for the process of reimbursing participants has turned out surprisingly complicated for online testing. For reimbursing via monetary or material gifts it is necessary to collect more personal data than in the lab (e.g., bank details, addresses). Additionally, some countries have legal restrictions on monetary or gift card reimbursements or require a tax declaration over these reimbursements. On the other hand, reimbursing with a virtual gift (such as downloadable coloring sheets) or not reimbursing at all may affect the accessibility of the study. Moreover, guideline 13 of the CIOMS International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research (2017) states that "Research participants should be reasonably reimbursed for costs directly incurred during the research, such as travel costs, and compensated reasonably for their inconvenience and time spent" while warning that "Compensation must not be so large as to induce potential participants to consent to participate in the research against their better judgment". Whether a virtual gift can be considered appropriate compensation is up for discussion, but in some countries, researchers legally have no other choice.</p><p>For monetary reimbursement, researchers can decide for a bank transfer, a transfer via PayPal (or similar services), or a gift card. In terms of accessibility, a bank transfer is preferable over PayPal, because in general a larger number of people will have a bank account than a PayPal account, increasing the accessibility of the study. However, in terms of data acquisition, a bank transfer requires much more personal data from the participant, such as their full name and address. In addition, from a global perspective, bank transfers are much more complex than services like PayPal. If the sample consists of people from different countries, a bank transfer quickly becomes a complex transaction due to differences in required details, length and format of account numbers and verification requirements, whereas a service like PayPal requires relatively little information and maintains the same process for transactions across the world. A solution to this trade-off between accessibility, convenience, and personal data minimization might be reimbursement via gift cards. This is only indirectly monetary and can only be spent at particular outlets, but generally offers reasonable flexibility against little personal information acquisition (often an email address is enough). 1 If neither monetary reimbursements nor gift cards comply with the local laws, one could consider a material gift. However, many researchers have found that their institutional ethics boards can be convinced to allow reimbursement via gift cards.</p><p>Another aspect to carefully consider is data protection. Data acquired online is (initially) stored and transferred online. From an ethics and data protection perspective, there are three relevant considerations: (1) server security, (2) server location, and (3) server owner. Server security is the most straight-forward of the three. Before storing data on a server, the researcher must ensure that the server is secure and encrypted. University servers and commercial servers generally have processes in place that mitigate the risk of attacks and security breaches. Still, also for liability reasons it is worth explicitly confirming this with the responsible service provider on site. Server location is important in the context of data protection regulations. Many countries' data protection regulations contain data residency laws, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Please note that while Amazon gift cards are a common means of reimbursement especially in the US, they cannot be used in Amazon webshops in other locations (e.g., an amazon.com gift card cannot be used in Germany on amazon.de and vice versa). Taking into account the ambition to facilitate data acquisition from different geographies, the regional scope of many gift cards can quickly turn into a limiting factor in practice. that is, they impose restrictions on data storage outside of their own region. These restrictions can take various forms. For example, the local regulation may require the participant's consent for storing their personal or pseudonymized data elsewhere or limit data storage or transfer only to those countries/third parties that offer comparable levels of protection. Laws like the USA Patriot Act 2 (which allows US governmental bodies investigating terrorism to obtain data stored on US servers) or the CLOUD Act 3 (which allows access to US agencies investigating a crime, once they have obtained a warrant or subpoena from a US court) can pose a hindrance for researchers from outside the US to store data on US-owned servers. This is relevant when deciding for data storage in the commercial cloud (e.g., via Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and so on) versus using a university-managed server. Before embarking on online data collection, it is crucial to become familiar with the local data protection regulations to avoid legal consequences and to ensure that the data is stored accordingly. This may cause limitations on the platforms available, as their data storage policies may not be in accordance with the researcher's local regulations. Furthermore, some data protection regulations apply extraterritorially (e.g., the European Union's GDPR for certain types of services and data processing), meaning that even if platforms comply with the researcher's local regulations, they must also comply with the participant's data protection regulations.</p><p>Sharing data acquired online is in principle not different from sharing data acquired in the lab.</p><p>There is one aspect that potentially requires additional consideration, however. Compared to collecting data in the lab, data acquired online is more likely to be obtained from participants who do not live in the same country or region as the researcher. Because of this, it is important to explain to participants precisely what consequences data sharing has for them. To give an example, data protection regulations in the EU require participants' consent for storing their data outside of the EU. When a study potentially involves collecting data from EU participants, it is important to provide full information regarding the purpose of data collection, data retention time, list of potential parties with whom the data might be shared, explaining that sharing data means the data may be stored outside of the EU, explaining that data cannot be destroyed after data sharing, etc. Waiving GDPR rights is not possible, so instead explicit, actionable consent has to be obtained for each of these aspects in a verifiable manner (i.e., recording date/time, IP address, etc.). This example should not be taken to suggest that researchers need to acquaint themselves with all data protection regulations across the world, but rather that the consent form relating to data sharing needs to be detailed and carefully-worded about all aspects of data sharing, including those that one might normally take for granted. Furthermore, in many cases data can be shared if they are fully anonymized and unidentifiable. This means that direct identifiers (e.g., name, address, date of birth, voice, facial features) have been removed and that the person's identity cannot be reconstructed by connecting data points that are not considered identifiers in isolation (e.g., age, nationality, gender, handedness). The latter is especially relevant in datasets with small samples, special populations (e.g., clinical populations), very specific questions (e.g., whether one of the caregivers is transgender), and/or a large number of data points per person.</p><p>These data storage and sharing procedures have a big impact on open science and collaborative science. Optimizing the choice of reimbursement, server location, and data sharing for one research institution in one country is significantly easier than optimizing these factors for multiple institutions, especially across different countries. However, for transparency and reproducibility as well as for international collaboration it will be important to establish procedures that make global data storage and data sharing possible. One of the projects that is actively trying to find global solutions for online testing is the ManyBabies-AtHome project <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zaadnoordijk et al., 2021)</ref>. This international, multi-lab consortium aims to facilitate practical and technical aspects of online testing of developmental populations across the world and to address ethical concerns regarding data protection, data storage, and data sharing. One important goal of ManyBabies-AtHome is to be able to share the online video data according to open science practices while adhering to legal and ethical standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Recruiting participants online</head><p>Online testing offers the possibility to acquire data from many participants and from a broader demographic <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Rhodes et al., 2020;</ref>. Especially when using asynchronous testing methods, it is possible to recruit and test hundreds of participants in a single day. Realizing this potential, however, requires piloting and fine-tuning the recruitment strategies. Moreover, not unlike testing in the lab, recruiting some populations is easier than others. The quickest way to recruit is of course from one's own database, but if this is not available, there are other possibilities for recruitment.</p><p>One possibility is to recruit via online advertising. Broadly speaking, there are two different approaches. One is via posts on the lab's own social media accounts or posts targeting specific groups (e.g., in a Facebook group for caregivers, using specific hashtags on Twitter or Instagram, advertising via a blog, etc.), the other involves spending money on ads for platform services like Google or Facebook to have study shown in the ads section or as banner. The first option is free with a relatively small time investment, but it is currently unclear exactly how successful it is. 4 Paid advertising on platforms such as Facebook seems to generate more success for some labs (see Brouillard &amp; Byers-Heinlein, 2018 for tips), but recruiting non-WEIRD samples can be substantially more difficult and expensive <ref type="bibr">(Ozernov-Palchik et al., in press</ref>). Moreover, while paid advertising seems to work for some researchers, several others have informally expressed dissatisfaction with the success rate of paid online advertising. More research is needed into what factors influence this success rate to make paid advertisement a viable option in terms of monetary and time investments.</p><p>There are several recruitment platforms on which online studies can be advertised and/or conducted. General platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Paolacci &amp; Chandler, 2014,</ref> https://www.mturk.com/) and its European counterpart Prolific <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Palan &amp; Schitter, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> https://www.prolific.co/) consist of large databases through which recruitment can be conducted. The benefit of these lies in the sheer number of people in their database. However, the databases are not optimized for developmental research and finding infant or child participants can be a challenge. As a result, recruitment platforms have been set up specifically for recruitment of infant and child populations, like ChildrenHelpingScience (https://childrenhelpingscience.com/) for English-speaking caregivers and KinderSchaffenWissen (https://kinderschaffenwissen.eva.mpg.de/) for German-speaking caregivers, where researchers can advertise their studies. The Baby's Online Live Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kato et al., 2021</ref>) is currently being implemented and aims to take care of recruitment as well as participant management (e.g., reimbursement). Studies conducted on the online infant and child testing platform Lookit  can also be advertised via the Lookit participant database. These platforms are focused on developmental populations, which makes the recruitment process more comfortable.</p><p>Recruitment methods such as online advertising and using recruitment platforms can be a quick way to collect the desired amount of data and have been used very successfully. However, for researchers looking to recruit non-English (or German) speaking populations, populations with specific constraints (e.g., clinical populations), and populations outside of WEIRD countries, these methods often do not offer the solution to the challenge of diverse recruitment. While some progress towards globalization is being made by, for example, efforts to translate the Lookit platform in multiple languages (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zaadnoordijk et al., 2021)</ref> and by the creation of recruitment platforms out of various countries, recruitment of representative samples continues to be a challenge (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">DeMayo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ozernov-Palchik et al.,</ref> in press) and will need to be actively addressed by the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Choosing the right paradigm</head><p>The feasibility of online testing differs per paradigm. Some paradigms provide a relatively smooth transition from lab-testing to online testing, while others require more consideration or are currently not suitable for online data acquisition. In this section, we will discuss several paradigms frequently used for testing infants, toddlers, and young children. We focus on these paradigms as paradigms for older children tend to be more similar in type (although not in stimulus selection) to paradigms used for testing adults.</p><p>Although it would be impossible to cover every single paradigm, it is possible to extract a few general principles regarding the feasibility of taking commonly used paradigms online before going into the details of individual paradigms. When collecting data online, we rely entirely on equipment and software that caregivers have and are able to use. Moreover, data is subject to more noise from environmental distractors and from variable or less measurement precision due to differences in equipment and internet connections. This problem can sometimes be mitigated by testing larger samples, which is more feasible with online data collection. However, the reliance on available equipment and the increased noise in the data exclude several methods, research questions and paradigms. This will not be a problem for many developmental researchers as many other paradigms are feasible and require types of data that can be obtained remotely (e.g., video or audio data). Moreover, with recent advances in automated analysis of video data for gaze direction, motion, and emotional states, the dependence on laboratory equipment is decreasing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Looking behavior paradigms</head><p>Central-looking paradigms, in which the relevant variable is the looking time towards the screen, and visual preference paradigms, in which the relevant variable is the difference in looking time to the stimuli presented on the left and right side of the screen, are among the most feasible paradigms for online experiments and are often used in browser-based setups. The experimental setup requires participants to have a webcam, which records the participant while the stimuli are being presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tran et al., 2017)</ref>. Subsequent coding of looking behavior allows the researcher to treat the data similar to lab data (see also Section 7 on data analysis). Comparisons between the results of looking behavior studies in the lab and online have yielded mixed results. Some studies have found substantial differences between data collected in the lab and online that could not be attributed to environmental distractors alone (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bochynska &amp; Dillon, 2021)</ref>. Other studies showed that the observed patterns were very similar (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bánki et al., in press;</ref>, though the effects were weaker with data obtained online . Due to the increased number of distractors in the home environment compared to the lab environment,  suggest that a visual preference paradigm might be more suited for online testing than a central looking paradigm as it keeps the child's attention to the screen. Moreover, good caregiver instructions regarding position of the child and lighting are necessary to ensure the visibility of the participants' eyes (see Section 5).</p><p>Other types of looking behavior paradigms, such as habituation paradigms, visual world paradigms, or head-turn preference paradigms tend to be more difficult to implement. For example, paradigms with more than two stimuli on the screen at once tend to suffer from insufficient accuracy in gaze coding in young participants. When coding the looking behavior manually from the webcam recording, it is very difficult to see where the infant or toddler is looking when a level of detail beyond left vs right is required. This challenge could potentially be solved with automatic gaze coding algorithms, but the performance of even the state-of-the-art algorithms is currently not sufficient for a reliable analysis (see also Section 7 on data analysis). The development of good and quick automatic gaze coding algorithms could also unlock the possibility of conducting habituation paradigms for asynchronous online testing. Habituation paradigms, as well as any other infant contingent paradigms, are currently infeasible in an asynchronous set-up. This would require an automatic gaze coding algorithm to detect when the participant is showing signs of habituation. Conducting a habituation study in a synchronous set-up is more feasible and progress has been made to add this paradigm to the list of possible paradigms to study online <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kominsky, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kominsky et al., 2021)</ref>. These developments allow researchers to test habituation paradigms in a synchronous setup using PyHab, an open-source looking-time coding and stimulus presentation tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kominsky, 2019)</ref>. To our knowledge, there have been no attempts of implementing head-turn preference paradigms online. An implementation of this type of paradigm would probably require extracting the conceptual aspects of the measure and redesigning an experimental setup in a looking-while-listening/preferential looking type of manner that matches these conceptual aspects without the requirement of having the head-turn preference setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Audiovisual paradigms</head><p>Auditory and audiovisual paradigms are common in early development studies, especially when investigating language acquisition and language processing. Both auditory and audiovisual paradigms are suitable for online data acquisition, but certain checks and technical aspects need to be considered. The most obvious aspect is that the sound needs to be audible. While there are intricate ways to check whether the auditory signal to the headphones is according to the researcher's wishes <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Woods et al, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, Milne et al., 2020</ref>, infant and toddler studies are more likely to be conducted via speakers. The type of speakers, the position of the speakers and the environmental noise are all relevant in determining the audibility of the stimuli. Simple audibility checks can be carried out by caregivers, for example by playing them a recording of a few words and asking them to click the words they heard. If you are working with a population of children with hearing loss, trying to optimize the sound may be more complicated. Although sound meter apps exist, their reliability is variable across apps and phones <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Murphy &amp; King, 2016)</ref>, rendering them useless for this purpose. The simplest solution is to ask the caregivers to set the settings manually until the stimuli are at a volume they believe is comfortably audible to their child. Alternatively, one could design a small pre-study in which one plays sounds to the child and determines at what sound level the child reacts. This pre-study could be carried out synchronously or asynchronously (with the caregiver indicating when the child reacts). Studies that rely on a constant volume-level across participants are currently more difficult to realize.</p><p>Another aspect to take into account is the audiovisual synchronization of the stimuli. The extent to which this could cause a problem depends on the research question as well as the implementational decisions relating to, for example, the platform, browser, and programming language. Two extensive reviews showed that remote research software has relatively small delays on display and reaction times <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020b)</ref> but that this differs between operating systems, browsers, and even hardware <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bridges et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Bridges and colleagues (2020)</ref> conclude that these results indicate that online studies are feasible except in cases where the researcher requires the utmost precision or wants to compare absolute reaction times across participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Motor and action-related paradigms</head><p>Measuring motor and action in data collected via the browser or via video call is possible if the measure of interest can be extracted from a video recording of the participant or reported by the caregiver. Although it is possible to obtain interesting developmental insights in this manner, it limits the range of possibilities with these methods to very specific research questions. This is especially problematic with infant participants. Being able to instruct preschoolers and school-aged children may open up some additional options in this age-group, but very precise motor measurements remain difficult to manually code from videos. Advances in automatic video coding have been made in the domain of motion (see also Section 7), with algorithms like PoseNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kendall et al., 2015)</ref> and DeepLabCut <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mathis et al., 2018)</ref> being used in various research contexts. Recent analysis of previously recorded videos of infant exploration showed that DeepLabCut is able to extract infants' movement patterns automatically and has the potential to extract facets of the data that are difficult or time-consuming to code manually <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Solby et al., 2021)</ref>. To what extent this will also generalize to webcam recordings has yet to be investigated.</p><p>Turning to other remote methods, a recent study explored the possibilities of analyzing data from wearable sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Franchak et al., 2021)</ref>. In this study, the data of 15 infants was collected in the lab. An additional two infants were tested at home and served as a case study. These exploratory data demonstrated that the wearable sensors used at home were able to distinguish changes in the relative duration of positions throughout the day (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Franchak et al., 2021</ref> for more details). However, the authors note that sensitivity varied among participants and positions, which will have to be addressed in future research. Overall, this is a promising new direction for remote data collection in the motor and action domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Caregiver-child interaction measures</head><p>Many researchers of caregiver-child interaction studies opt for synchronous data collection (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pochinki et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Segal &amp; Moulson, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shin et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Woon et al., 2021)</ref>, although these types of studies have been carried out asynchronously too (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Addyman &amp; Scott, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rhodes et al., 2020)</ref>. Some measures can be coded from a webcam or audio recording. However, additional data loss is expected when using asynchronous data acquisition as there is no researcher present to instruct the caregiver to reposition themselves, the webcam or the microphone if necessary. The dyad may be too far away from the microphone to be audible, or the video may be capturing only half of the dyad or the wrong person in the dyad (e.g., directed at the child when the caregiver's actions are being studied and vice versa). This problem is easier to resolve when acquiring data via video call, which is a feasible way of collecting caregiver-child interaction data. However, synchronous data acquisition is more time consuming for the researcher, requires scheduling with the caregivers, and may influence the caregiver's interaction with the child as there is a real-time observer present. Turning off the researcher's camera and microphone can facilitate a more natural interaction.</p><p>Another consideration is how to standardize the interaction if additional items are required.</p><p>Several studies have used pictures or picture-books displayed on the screen to capture verbal interactions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rhodes et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Woon et al., 2021)</ref>. Since the item is displayed digitally, this is easy to standardize across participants. Moreover, reading books digitally or on paper has previously, in an exploratory labstudy, been shown to yield similar results <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fisch et al., 2002)</ref>. Another option is to ask caregivers to use an item they already have (e.g., a puzzle; <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pochinki et al., 2021)</ref> or can easily obtain. When very specific toys or other objects that are not part of a standard household are required, researchers may have to consider shipping them, which requires extra time and effort and comes with additional costs. If the item is a fun toy for the child, it may serve as the compensation for participation (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Segal &amp; Moulson, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, if it is an item that won't serve as participant compensation or if the researchers need the item to be sent back, this may decrease the feasibility of the online study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Neurobehavioral assessments and intervention studies</head><p>One potential application of online testing lies in the possibility to administer neurobehavioral assessments and interventions remotely. This would enable data collection of participants (in a research setting) or patients (in a clinical setting) who may otherwise not have had the possibility to visit the researcher or clinician in person. Moreover, telehealth methods are associated with substantial costreductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lindgren et al., 2016)</ref>. Recent work on remote neurobehavioral assessment in infants demonstrated the feasibility of remote collection of many different socioemotional and cognitive measures as well as biospecimens <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gustafsson et al., 2021)</ref>. Although the same level of standardization as compared to conducting the assessment in a lab or clinic could not always be achieved due to lacking support items or different toys during free play, <ref type="bibr">Gustafsson and colleagues (2021)</ref> found that in many cases a suitable replacement was available. However, the availability of resources may depend on factors such as socioeconomic status and size of the home, leading the researchers to make several task modifications to re-introduce some level of standardization. Telehealth assessments have also been tested for feasibility, for example, for detecting early markers of Autism Spectrum Disorders in infants <ref type="bibr">(TEDI;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Talbott et al., 2020)</ref>, including in those with Down Syndrome (PANDAbox; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kelleher et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Beside assessments, there is a theoretical possibility for online interventions. However, while there are several remote intervention studies targeting caregiver behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Comer et al., 2017)</ref>, few studies have been targeting infant or child behavior or development (see Ozernov-Palchik et al., in press).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Optimizing data quality</head><p>Reduced data quality and increased noise are a common concern in the context of online data collection, especially for asynchronous testing. Some studies have compared experiments conducted in the lab with those conducted online and found similar results (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> in Section 8), but others have shown weaker effects, possibly due to increased noise (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lapidow et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, Sheskin &amp; Keil, 2018</ref>. When deciding for online testing versus in-lab testing, part of the consideration has to be to what extent the research question, chosen paradigm, and expected effect size allow for some increase in within-participant noise. Depending on the research question and method, the possibility to test more participants in less time may mitigate the increased noise. Moreover, there are several steps researchers can take to improve data quality.</p><p>In asynchronous testing, where no researcher is present, the caregiver takes on the role as coexperimenter, albeit an untrained one. It is therefore essential to minimize the technical skill set required by using, for example, browser-based solutions that limit the need for downloading software and to put effort into creating very clear instructions for caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Shields et al., 2021)</ref>. In addition to the general information leaflet, it is important to have an additional instructions page with text and do and don't pictures or with a short video explaining the basics regarding the set-up, caregiver interference, and what to do in case of infant fussiness or technical errors. The goal is to make the instructions as surefire as possible by giving clear examples and/or a checklist, allowing the caregiver to check that they are on the right track. When the data collection hinges on a webcam recording, a live-play of the webcam can be shown to participants so they can see whether their child is in view and the lighting conditions are good.</p><p>When data collection hinges on audio, the audibility of the speakers can be tested by displaying four pictures on a screen and asking caregivers to click the picture that corresponds to the spoken word. If microphone recordings are necessary, one can ask caregivers to speak into the microphone and subsequently play back the sound to them, asking them to check that their voice is audible and clear.</p><p>Some researchers opt for providing instructions via Zoom before acquiring data in an asynchronous manner (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yamamoto et al., 2021)</ref>. This may increase the likelihood that caregivers follow the instructions, but diminishes the benefits of asynchronous online data acquisition in terms of scheduling between caregiver and researcher and in terms of parallelizing data acquisition. Whether that cost is worth the benefit depends on the particulars of an individual study. A fully asynchronous setup and acquiring more participants to account for higher attrition rates may be more convenient with easily recruited participants, while ensuring optimal data collection by instructing participants via video call may be the best solution with difficult-to-recruit participants.</p><p>In some cases, simple tricks can be used to help caregivers. For example, to make sure that the child is positioned in the center of the webcam view, the researcher can insert a box (or something more child-friendly like cat ears) on the video live-play so the caregiver can reposition the child or the webcam.</p><p>To determine the screen's pitch (i.e., its dots-per-inch) many researchers and testing platforms use a credit card trick in which the caregiver is shown a credit card on screen and asked to resize the on-screen credit card to match the size of a real one. One can then calculate the ratio between the on-screen card in pixels and the real card in millimeters and adjust stimulus presentation based on this information (see e.g., Li et al., 2020 for more details). Moreover, with javascript it is possible to record the resolution of the participant's screen and to determine whether the window was full screen or not.</p><p>Since the home environment contains more distractors, it is recommended to take this into account when writing the instructions. Ask participants to do the study in a quiet room and to switch off devices such as televisions and mobile phones. If caregivers are participating with more than one child (e.g., in case of twins), it is best if this is done by taking turns instead of simultaneously, ideally while someone else watches the other child. When data collection involves stimulus presentation on the screen, it can help to increase the salience, for instance by using both visual and auditory stimuli and/or attentiongrabbers throughout the study.</p><p>In addition to optimizing the instructions and stimuli, there might be a need to implement policies to recognize bots <ref type="bibr">(Chmielewski &amp; Kucker 2019</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Shields et al., 2021)</ref>. When using webcam recordings, bots are easy to filter out. Many kinds of fraud (e.g., no child being present) will be caught in synchronous experiments by the interaction with the researcher, and in asynchronous experiments by the acquisition of a video of the child. For studies with older children that require text entries, button presses, or multiple choice answers, bots can sometimes be recognized by the pattern of responses or the entries.</p><p>However, for these data points, it is much harder to know for sure whether the response came from a child or a bot. Simple surveys are particularly susceptible to this, as they are easy to cheat with random responses. Some solutions to this, such as restricting participation to computers from US IPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kennedy et al., 2020)</ref>, will impact the potential of online testing to address the WEIRD crisis. There are several other solutions available to minimize bot participation in the online study, such as using captchas and conducting some degree of participant screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jones et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kennedy et al., 2020)</ref>. Prescreening can be done by asking specific information related to the target population and/or by asking for the same information in different formats (e.g., date of birth and numeric age) and cross-checking the consistency of these answers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jones et al., 2015)</ref>. Other forms of cheating may occur too. For instance, caregivers may lie about the age of the child to fulfill the inclusion criteria. A solution can be to set a wider age range than required and post-hoc excluding participants at the end of the range. Another option is to check the age distribution of the participants for evidence of unexpected higher-frequency bumps at the ends of their requested age range, which would be indicative of caregivers shifting the age just into the requested range, or ask questions about the general abilities of the child (e.g., number of spoken words if trying to differentiate 8-month-old and 12-month-old infants). Generally speaking, reviewing the data before reimbursement is recommended and can be mentioned on the general information page of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Technology decisions</head><p>A key decision to be made is whether the researcher and participant will communicate synchronously, connected to each other in real-time with a video-conferencing platform such as Zoom (papers tagged synchronous in the living resource, see Section 8), or asynchronously with the participant performing the task at a time of their own choosing by connecting to a website that records the data, for the researcher to download later (papers tagged asynchronous in the living resource, see Section 8). These have pros and cons. Synchronous experiments offer interactions that more closely mimic in-lab testing.</p><p>Before the experiment, the researcher can explain the procedures and converse with the caregiver or participant to ensure they have understood. During the experiment, the researcher can code the child's responses allowing paradigms that require real-time rating like habituation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kominsky et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Standardized questionnaires that have an interview form (e.g., the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales) can be administered in a familiar way (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shin et al., 2021)</ref>. Asynchronous experiments, in contrast, have the benefits that the participant can perform the experiment whenever they want, without the need to schedule a specific time when the researcher is available. This is particularly valuable for international research, for caregivers who work full-time, and for children with unpredictable cycles, such as infants, where the planning needed for a timed appointment may add a burden for caregivers.</p><p>The degree of experimental control differs between synchronous and asynchronous experiments. Asynchronous experiments are "double blind" in the sense the web server controlling the experiment will not react to the participant's appearance, behavior, or to the experimental condition. Furthermore, the code that controls the protocol can be shared to allow its replication, precluding undocumented influences from the way a researcher interacts with the participants, or the environment the researcher is in, which may affect synchronous testing.</p><p>To implement the experiment, the researcher must decide on the degree to which they want to use existing solutions, which will require less effort but be less flexible, versus constructing their own parts. Tools like Zoom or Microsoft Teams are widely used and familiar to many participants and researchers, making them attractive for synchronous experiments. However, they bring limitations. For example, when Zoom is set to "speaker view" it only records video of whoever is speaking at the moment.</p><p>This feature is disadvantageous when you want a video of the child and not the researcher giving instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bambha &amp; Casasola, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>For asynchronous experiments, various browser-based platforms are available (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> in Section 8). Amazon Mechanical Turk <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Paolacci &amp; Chandler, 2014)</ref> is widely used across industry and academia. It supports some simple paradigms, such as questionnaires or picture labelling, from within the Mechanical Turk platform. Gorilla (Anwyl-Irvine et al, 2020a), Pavlovia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bridges et al, 2020)</ref>, and Labvanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Finger et al., 2017)</ref> are widely used in psychology, mostly for adult testing. These experiment builders are easy to use for researchers with limited programming experience and offer rich environments, with components to present text, images and video, to record responses from the keyboard or mouse, to control the experimental flow (e.g., counterbalancing) and to pay participants. They are designed to achieve precise timing, and to log the timing obtained. There are thousands of sample experiments.</p><p>However, they are not specifically designed for developmental research, and this leads to some limitations. For example, as infants cannot press keys or respond verbally, it is necessary to record from the webcam <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Tran et al., 2017</ref>). This is not currently possible with Gorilla 5 or Pavlovia, but is supported by Labvanced. Lookit is a platform developed at MIT  designed for developmental science (see also Section 4.1), specifically originally for infant testing, which uses Pipe (https://addpipe.com) to record the video stream. Discoveries Online <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Rhodes et al., 2020)</ref> asks caregivers to upload the webcam footage at the end of testing. Finally, e-Babylab is a tool with a graphical user interface for asynchronous experiment creation and user/data management <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lo et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Video streaming, whether used either for delivering stimuli or recording from the webcam, is adaptive in that the transmitting machine adjusts the quality of the pictures being transmitted depending on the bandwidth of the connection between the two computers. The advantage of this adaptive streaming is that it makes the protocol available to people served by a wide range of different bandwidths, and it is robust to temporary drops in bandwidth. The disadvantage is that sometimes the quality may degrade below an acceptable level, or even stop completely if the bandwidth drops too far, leading to glitches in timing. To ensure the bandwidth between the participant's computer and the study's web server are sufficient, they should not be too geographically distant (e.g., not transatlantic or transpacific).</p><p>Moreover, the effect of web server location(s) on participant diversity should be considered. If streaming is too unreliable, stimuli can be delivered in other ways to ensure their high fidelity. If they are pictures, they may be preloaded in advance of presentation without using streaming, for asynchronous protocols (e.g., with Lookit, Pavlovia) or synchronous ones (e.g., using PyHab and slides.com with <ref type="bibr">Zoom, Kominsky et al, 2021)</ref>. Platforms also allow short videos to be preloaded, although this can take some time for slow connections.</p><p>For greater flexibility, some groups have chosen to set up their own platforms. This involves coding a website, typically using HTML and JavaScript, with standard web frameworks such as JQuery and Bootstrap, or specific psychology tools such as jsPsych, and setting up a streaming server (e.g., using</p><p>Kurento Media Server, https://www.kurento.org/). As an example of the flexibility this allows, the streaming server can require a minimum acceptable bandwidth and the connection can be adjusted to be asymmetric, to be tolerant of delays (or jitters) on the upload of data so allowing a higher fidelity transmission, as it is not important exactly when the data arrives. To reach geographically distributed populations, it may be helpful to distribute servers across regions in the commercial cloud.</p><p>To achieve a representative global population, it will be necessary to provide translations of the website into different languages. This typically involves two levels of implementation: (1) the internationalization of the site, which involves changing the code so that it can deliver different content to different locales, and (2) the localization, or translation, of the text itself into a specific language. The collaborative ManyBabies-AtHome project has internationalized Lookit and is translating it into a number of languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zaadnoordijk, et al., 2021)</ref>. Delivery of different content to different locales can be important when acquiring demographic information (changing the options to reflect, for example, the local educational system for acquiring data on caregiver education) or when acquiring certain data is legally or culturally problematic for a subset of the target regions (e.g., health-related data).</p><p>Another important technical consideration is the degree to which the website should persistently store participant details. The website could be designed so that participants must make an account, and participation logs and experimental results are attached to this account. Alternatively, it might be stateless between visits, so that participants are directed to a link for an experiment, which will record the data attached to an anonymous session-unique identifier. Not recording participants' details reduces the sensitivity of the personal data stored by the site and can reduce data protection and data security concerns. However, if participants wish to do many experiments, they may need to retype common details (e.g., age of child) each time if the website cannot persistently store their details. Furthermore, it will make longitudinal studies difficult, as participants cannot be invited back for later sessions. It may also reduce data quality and encourage attempts at fraudulent participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Data analysis</head><p>Video recordings from webcams must first undergo quality control. In asynchronous studies, it is often necessary to reject a substantial proportion of video data <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Tran et al., 2017;</ref>, because of issues with the participants (e.g., child absent or not correct age), with the recording environment (e.g., child's face not completely visible, lighting poor), or because of video streaming issues (e.g., browser version issues, bandwidth too low). It is typically necessary to screen each video, to determine whether its quality is acceptable for inclusion or not. A related issue is participant payment. As mentioned in Section 5, it is worth reviewing the data before reimbursement. Researchers can then decide to pay participants who have made a good effort to participate, even if their data cannot be used, while not paying participants that appear to be willfully ignoring the instructions (e.g., no child present or child far too old) to discourage repeat participation.</p><p>We have found it important to carefully examine timing logs. In particular, if video is being presented and there are glitches in stimulus delivery, the experiment and therefore webcam recording may last longer than expected. For a relatively small number of glitches, the data might still be admissible, provided the drift between stimuli and recording is accounted for. But, if the glitches are too long, the effects on infant attention are likely to irrevocably corrupt the data.</p><p>Following quality control, the videos must be hand annotated using a program such as Elan (https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) or Datavyu (https://datavyu.org/). Some or all of the data should be annotated by multiple raters, to allow for the calculation of inter-rater reliability. Good data management is important, as many people may contribute to the tagging of a study. To ensure consistency and reproducibility it is helpful to develop a manual that specifies which annotations will be applied to each video (e.g., looking/not looking/video data quality problem) and how they will be defined.</p><p>Hand annotation is time consuming, taking much more time than the video acquisition. There is growing interest in the possibility of automatically annotating videos using eye and pose tracking software. Chouinard and colleagues (2019) used a web service, Amazon Rekognition, to extract facial landmarks from infant webcam video and then a machine learning-based classifier to predict manual annotations. Video data quality, in particular good light and having the infant fully in frame, were found to have a strong effect on automatic annotation performance. In one study, distinguishing between the infant looking and not-looking was achieved with good sensitivity (a d-prime of around 2, taking manual annotation as the ground truth), which is promising. For left-right discrimination, while well above chance, performance was insufficient for application. A number of groups are working to improve classification for infants in particular. <ref type="bibr">Erel and colleagues (2021)</ref> presented an open-source deep learning approach to eye tracking in young children, iCatcher, which they validated on a set of lab acquired video data, achieving impressive performance. <ref type="bibr">Cao and colleagues (2021)</ref> have developed this further into iCatcher+ with more robust performance, and evaluated it on webcam data from Lookit. A technology of great promise is eyetracking from within the participant's browser. Proof-of-principle implementations are already available (e.g., WebGazer, https://github.com/brownhci/WebGazer; TensorFlow javascript Face Landmarks Detection https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/face-landmarks-detection) and</p><p>implemented within Pavlovia and Labvanced, but we do not believe they have been demonstrated to be robust enough for developmental science in their current iterations. Ultimately, this technology could supplant the need to record participant's webcam data, reducing the data protection issues and the requirement for fast internet.</p><p>In addition to eye tracking, algorithms are also being developed for motion tracking of toddlers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Ossmy et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Solby et al., 2022)</ref>. Another possibility is pupillometry, the measurement of pupil dilation, which is a marker of norepinephrine release in the locus coeruleus, making it an index of arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sara, 2009)</ref>. Using raters on Amazon Mechanical Turk, <ref type="bibr">Bainbridge and colleagues (2021)</ref> showed that it is possible to measure pupil dilation from videos of infants' eyes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Resources for online testing in developmental science</head><p>Getting acquainted with a new method can be time consuming. For the readers' convenience, we have put together several resources regarding studies comparing lab-acquired and online-acquired data <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>) and regarding platforms <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2)</ref> below. Another source of knowledge and expertise can be found within the aforementioned ManyBabies-AtHome project <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zaadnoordijk et al., 2021)</ref>, who offer a Slack channel which is to be used for any matters related to online testing of infants and children (both within as well as outside of the ManyBabies-AtHome project itself). It is a space where the online testing community can exchange ideas, ask questions, and stay up-to-date on the latest developments. Anyone is welcome to join, free of commitment to ManyBabies-AtHome. Finally, as online testing is a relatively new method that develops rapidly, we have created a living resource in which we invite development researchers to add current and future publications that are relevant to online data acquisition. This living resource can be found at www.cusacklab.org/testing-children-online. By using (a combination of) tags, researchers can filter for articles that are relevant to their work. Membership is required to add or edit entries in the library and can be obtained by contacting the administrators (i.e., the authors of this book chapter), but no such requirement is present for viewing the collection.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Future directions for online testing in developmental science</head><p>We hope to have shown the reader that online testing of infants and children is feasible and can have great benefits. At the same time, this is a new method and, as with any new method, there are still many challenges to overcome. One potential benefit of online testing that currently is not yet reaching its full potential is improving participant diversity. Although several studies report improvements regarding geographic diversity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bambha &amp; Casasola, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rhodes et al., 2020)</ref>, diversity of, for instance, caregiver education and race/ethnicity remains problematic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bambha &amp; Casasola, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bánki et al, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nelson et al., 2021;</ref>. This is partially caused by differences in access to computers and internet connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lourenco &amp; Tasimi, 2020)</ref>, which is difficult for researchers to change. However, there are other necessary changes that can and must be made if we want to make serious progress in reducing the WEIRD bias in online testing. These changes relate to translating and internationalizing testing platforms (including offering inclusive reimbursement options), and standardizing forms of data protection and data sharing that are acceptable to legislators across the world.</p><p>This is a challenge that cannot be undertaken by any single researcher or research group. As previously mentioned, the ManyBabies-AtHome project <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zaadnoordijk et al., 2021)</ref> has been set up to address precisely these questions. It will require a massive community effort to internationalize platforms and standardize processes such that they can be used globally. Nevertheless, we are convinced that we can only avoid becoming WEIRDer than typical lab studies if we take globalization seriously.</p><p>Another domain for further development is automatization of data quality control and data analysis. Currently, when acquiring data asynchronously, the researcher has little control over whether participants are visible or audible on the recording. Automatic feedback mechanisms could resolve this problem and thus lower the attrition rate and reimbursement costs. An implementation of this in the visual domain could, for example, be a live face detection algorithm that checks the webcam recording for the child's face or eyes prior to the study. Moreover, automatic feedback mechanisms could potentially provide variables that may be relevant for data analysis such as estimation of lighting quality or the degree of noise. To our knowledge, none of the commonly used browser-based platforms employ these types of algorithms at the moment. Automatic feedback mechanisms could be a useful advance in the field, especially for studies with younger populations which often rely on webcam recordings. In terms of data analysis, automatized methods have great potential too. As mentioned in Section 7, automatic gaze coding algorithms and automatic motion tracking algorithms are already being developed for data analysis in adult and developmental psychology. In addition to reducing the time-cost of manual coding, these algorithms have the potential to detect more subtle signals in the data that a human-coder may overlook <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Solby et al., 2021)</ref>. Automatic data analysis methods could also provide novel ways of increasing data privacy. Compared to manual data tagging, automated analyses would require data sharing with fewer people, leading to decreased risks. Furthermore, algorithms have the possibility to extract data summaries (e.g., looking behavior or pose estimations), which can be shared anonymously for data analysis. In theory, even at the level of data collection such methods could be employed. This would mean that the researcher would not receive a video of the participant but anonymized data summaries, removing many concerns regarding data protection. However, these methods will still need significant improvements before they can be used reliably for any of the aforementioned purposes.</p><p>Although many principles discussed in this chapter apply to the entire developmental population, we focused on data collection from infants, toddlers and young children. Collecting data from older children is in the practical sense not unlike adult data collection, for which several guides already exist (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arechar et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gureckis, et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Woods et al., 2015</ref>; and many others). A type of developmental data acquisition that we did not touch upon here is the collection of caregiver data about their child. Online tools lend themselves to quick and easy data collection from caregivers. Many standardized caregiver questionnaires can be turned into online forms or mobile apps (see e.g., DeMayo et al., 2021 for a web-based version of the Communicative Development Inventories) and researchers have also resorted to online caregiver data collection by using app-based Developmental</p><p>Diaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Daum et al., 2020)</ref>, study-specific questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bergmann et al., 2021)</ref>, and Experience Sampling Method <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(van den Heuvel et al., 2021)</ref>. These methods offer a valuable addition in developmental research, either as stand-alone tools or in combination with data collection from the child itself.</p><p>In addition to their application for research, online testing has potential translational applications as well.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ellefson et al., 2019)</ref> and used it, among others, to investigate the effects of executive function skills on the relation between numerical cognition and social-economic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ellefson et al., 2020)</ref>. Another application domain is healthcare. In Section 4.5 we discussed the feasibility of conducting intervention studies online. A natural next step would be to explore the extent to which these methods can be applied in clinical settings more generally. Similar to online testing in the research context, online approaches have their limitations and would be viable for only a subset of interventions or ways of monitoring. However, the benefits relating to costs and convenience are also applicable here: caregivers and their children would not have to physically go to their pediatricians, therapists or special-needs teachers as often, and the care providers in turn could potentially carry out multiple check-ups or interventions in parallel allowing them to treat more patients and keep better track of each patient's progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Conclusions</head><p>Online testing offers an interesting new form of data collection with many potential benefits relating to sample size and diversity, replicability, transparency, research costs, and collaborative possibilities. However, the method is still in its infancy and poses hurdles that are yet to be overcome.</p><p>Venturing into the world of online data acquisition means learning about the differences in decision processes compared to in-lab data collection. Here, we have provided a guide through these processes, the state-of-the-art developments in the field. With so many advances being made rapidly, it can be challenging to stay up-to-date in this field. To address this issue, we have used this chapter to present a living resource (www.cusacklab.org/testing-children-online, see also Section 8), comprising a collection of articles relating to all aspects of online testing, which is publicly accessible to the field and can be continuously updated. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables   Table 1</ref>.

Taking into account the ambition to facilitate data acquisition from different geographies, the regional scope of many gift cards can quickly turn into a limiting factor in practice. 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Both asynchronous and synchronous platforms can present written instructions that describe the testing situation required, such as the lighting, position of the camera and child, and so on. Synchronous experiments potentially allow for better compliance, as the researcher can iteratively request modifications if something is incorrectly configured. With future technological development, asynchronous experiments could also provide automatic feedback on some of these factors, but these methods are currently not yet commonplace. Asynchronous experiments typically allow for greater control during the experiment, with the protocol delivered entirely under computer control.</figDesc></figure>
