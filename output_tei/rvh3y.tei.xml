<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Cognitive Reflection Test (hereafter, CRT) measures the ability to suppress a prepotent but incorrect intuitive answer and engage in cognitive reflection when solving a set of mathematical word problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Frederick, 2005)</ref>. The most famous CRT item is the "bat and ball" problem: "A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? ___ cents." Participants usually come up with an appealing intuitive yet incorrect answer -10 centsinstead of the correct answer which requires more analytical processing and some formal computation -5 cents. The test has become increasingly popular, yielding more than 2,000 citations 12 years after its publication on Google Scholar and has grown into the optimum measure of rational thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Toplak, West, &amp; Stanovich, 2011)</ref>. It gained popularity because it predicts an extensive array of variables, inter alia, biases in reasoning, judgment and decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Campitelli &amp; Labollita, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Frederick, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lesage, Navarrete, &amp; De Neys, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liberali, Reyna, Furlan, Stein, &amp; Pardo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sirota, Juanchich, &amp; Hagmayer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Toplak et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Toplak, West, &amp; Stanovich, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, 2017</ref>, real-life decision outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Juanchich, Dewberry, Sirota, &amp; Narendran, 2016)</ref>, moral reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baron, Scott, Fincher, &amp; Metz, 2015)</ref>, paranormal beliefs and belief in God <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pennycook, Cheyne, Seli, Koehler, &amp; Fugelsang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pennycook, Ross, Koehler, &amp; Fugelsang, 2016)</ref> and political beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deppe et al., 2015</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kahan, 2013)</ref>. (For a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pennycook, Fugelsang, &amp; Koehler, 2015a.)</ref> Critically, a lot of the research, whether correlational or experimental, has presented participants with its initial forman open-ended answer formatso that participants have had to construct their responses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">De Neys, Rossi, &amp; Houde, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Frederick, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Johnson, Tubau, &amp; De Neys, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liberali et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Royzman, Landy, &amp; Leeman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sirota et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Szaszi, Szollosi, Palfi, &amp; Aczel, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Toplak et al., 2011)</ref>. Sometimes, however, an ad hoc multiple-choice question version of the CRT has been usedmost commonly a two-or fouroption format (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gangemi, Bourgeois-Gironde, &amp; Mancini, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morsanyi, Busdraghi, &amp; Primi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Oldrati, Patricelli, Colombo, &amp; Antonietti, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Travers, Rolison, &amp; Feeney, 2016</ref>). In the latter approach, the equivalence between the open-ended and multiple-choice versions of the test has been implicitly assumed or explicitly claimed and similar processes have been inferred from these two types of tests. Indeed, if such equivalence has been achieved then using a validated multiple-choice version of the CRT would be more convenient since such a version would most likely be quicker to administer and code than the open-ended CRT.</p><p>Furthermore, an automatic coding scheme would eliminate any potential coding ambivalence e.g., whether "0.05 cents", a formally incorrect answer to a bat and ball problem, should count as an incorrect or correct answer on the assumption that participants mistook the unit in the answer for dollars instead of cents: i.e., "0.05 dollars".</p><p>There are several good empirical and theoretical reasons to expect differences according to the response formats of the Cognitive Reflection Test. First, evidence from educational measurement research points out the fact that despite a high correlation between open-ended (also called constructed) and multiple-choice versions, multiple choice tests usually lead to a better overall performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bridgeman, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rodriguez, 2003)</ref>. Open-ended questions are more difficult to solve than multiple-choice ones for stem-equivalent items (i.e., that differ only by listing multiple choices), because presenting options enables a different array of cognitive strategies leading to increased performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bonner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bridgeman, 1992)</ref>. For instance, if participants generate an incorrect answer then a limited set of answers might provide unintentional feedback and eliminate that particular solution as a possible answer. With multiplechoice questions, participants can use a backward strategy, where they pick up an answer listed in the options and try to reconstruct the solution. Participants can also guess if they are uncertain about the options.</p><p>Second, there might be theoretical reasons for non-equivalence of tests with different response formats, which could also be consequential. A cognitive conflict, which triggers deeper cognitive processingaccording to several dual-process theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(De Neys, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kahneman &amp; Frederick, 2005</ref>)might be more pronounced in the presence of an explicitly correct option and some other intuitively appealing but incorrect alternative option <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bhatia, 2017)</ref>. Thus, a multiple-choice version of the CRT might be easier because the explicit options trigger cognitive conflict with higher likelihood which, in turn, leads to easier engagement into cognitive reflection and becomes more strongly associated with the benchmark variables usually linked with the CRT requiring cognitive reflection (e.g., belief bias, paranormal beliefs, denominator neglect, actively open-minded thinking; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pennycook et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Toplak et al., 2014)</ref>. Limited process-oriented evidence has indicated that a pronounced cognitive conflict was present when using a multiple-choice version of the CRT. The mouse trajectories of participants who responded correctly revealed that they were attracted to the incorrect intuitive response <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Travers et al., 2016)</ref>, whereas evidence of conflict was missing in the thinking aloud study using the open-ended version of the CRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Szaszi et al., 2017)</ref>. Clearly, other factors such as different sensitivity to conflict of the employed process-oriented methodologies might account for the difference, but the format response of the CRT remains a possible reason for this difference as well.</p><p>In addition, even if people were equally likely to detect a conflict in the two different response formats and engage in reflective thinking afterwards, they might still fail to correct their initial intuition due to lack of mathematical knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pennycook, Fugelsang, &amp; Koehler, 2015b</ref>). This is supported by the thinking aloud evidence, in which the performance in the CRT with the open-ended response format was partly explained by the lack of specific knowledge needed to solve the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Szaszi et al., 2017)</ref>. Since the correct answer is already included in the multiple-choice version of the test, this particular format might therefore be easier. Another consequence could be that such a test would have a weaker association with numeracy compared with the open-ended CRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Liberali et al., 2012)</ref>. In other words, construct non-equivalence would implicate different cognitive processes taking place in the different formats of the CRT.</p><p>These should result in different levels of performance and different correlational patterns with the benchmark variables usually associated with the CRT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The present research</head><p>In the present experiment, our overarching aim was to test the construct equivalence of three different formats of the Cognitive Reflection Test (and its variations). To do so, we compared their means and correlational patterns with other typically predicted constructs. We did not opt for correlation between the different versions of the test because this does not necessarily represent equivalence of the underpinning cognitive processes that manifest themselves into the final scores. Specifically, we set up three main aims to fill in the gaps outlined above. First, we tested whether the CRT response format affects performance in the test, both in terms of reflectiveness score (i.e., correct responses) and intuitiveness score (i.e., appealing but incorrect responses). Second, we tested whether the CRT response format altered the well-established association between performance in the CRT and benchmark variables: belief bias, denominator neglect, paranormal beliefs, actively open-minded thinking and numeracy. Third, we tested the psychometric quality of the different formats of the tests by comparing their internal consistency. In addition, and from a more practical perspective, we also had some expectations concerning time of completion.</p><p>According to the construct equivalence hypothesis, which is assumed in the current research practices, (i) the effect of the answer format on the reflectiveness and intuitiveness scores will be negligible, (ii) the correlational patterns with outcome variables will not differ across the different test formats and (iii) the tests' scores will have similar internal consistencies.</p><p>In contrast, according to the construct non-equivalence hypothesis, which was derived from the mathematical problem-solving literature and based on other theoretical reasons, (i) multiplechoice versions will lead to higher reflectiveness scores and lower intuitiveness scores due to employing a different array of more successful cognitive strategies, better chances of detecting cognitive conflict and/or better chances of identifying the correct response, (ii) the correlational patterns with outcome variables will differ across the different test formatsthe multiple-choice test should better predict the predictive validity variables (belief bias, paranormal beliefs, denominator neglect), since they share similar processes and it will be less correlated with numeracy 1 and (iii) the multiple-choice version will have a higher internal consistency in its summation score. Finally, we predicted that the multiple-choice version of the CRT would be quicker to complete compared with the open-ended version.</p><p>1 In other words, the tasks in which the answers are constructed (i.e., numeracy) should be less related with the multiple-choice version of the CRT, whereas the tasks in which one of the answers are selected (i.e., belief bias, denominator neglect) should be more aligned with the multiple-choice version of the CRT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Design</head><p>We powered the experiment to detect a small-to-medium effect size (f = .17 ≅ η p 2 = 0.03). Given α = .05 and β = .90 for a between-subjects ANOVA with three groups, such a power analysis resulted in a minimum required sample size of 441 participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Such a sample size would be sensitive enough to detect a medium effect size difference between two correlations (i.e., Cohen's q ≈ 0.32). The participants were recruited from an online panel (Prolific Academic). Panel members were eligible to participate only when they fulfilled all four conditions: (i) their approval rate in previous studies was above 90%, (ii) they had not taken part in previous studies conducted by our lab in which we used the Cognitive Reflection Test, (iii) they were UK nationals and (iv) they resided in the UK. The first criterion aimed to minimise careless responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Peer, Vosgerau, &amp; Acquisti, 2014)</ref>, whereas the second criterion aimed to reduce familiarity with the items and the last two criteria aimed to guarantee a good level of English proficiency. The participants were reimbursed with £1.40 for their participation, which lasted, on average, 17 minutes. A total of 452 participants (with ages ranging from 18 to 72 years, M = 37.0, SD = 12.3 years; 60.2% of whom were female) completed the questionnaire.</p><p>The participants had various levels of education: less than high school (0.7%), high school (39.4%), undergraduate degree (44.2%), master's degree (12.2%) and higher degrees such as PhD (3.5%).</p><p>In a between-subjects design, the participants were randomly allocated to one of the three versions of the Cognitive Reflection Test and then answered items from the five benchmark tasks, which were presented in a random order.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Procedure</head><p>Cognitive Reflection Testresponse format manipulation. After giving informed consent, the participants solved the extended seven-item Cognitive Reflection Test, comprised of the original three items <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Frederick, 2005)</ref> and four additional items <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Toplak et al., 2014</ref> "In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads.

The presentation order of the CRT items, as well as the individual options in the MCQ versions of the test, was randomised for each participant. After solving the CRT, the participants then assessed the item familiarity of all of the CRT items presented in a random Belief Bias. The participants assessed the logical validity of the conclusion of eight syllogisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Evans, Barston, &amp; Pollard, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Markovits &amp; Nantel, 1989)</ref>. Each syllogism featured two premises and one conclusion. Four of the syllogisms had an unbelievable conclusion that followed logically from the two premises. For instance: "Premise 1: All things that are smoked are good for the health. Premise 2: Cigarettes are smoked. Conclusion:</p><p>Cigarettes are good for the health." The other four syllogisms featured a believable conclusion that did not follow logically from the premises. For instance: "Premise 1: All things that have a motor need oil. Premise 2: Automobiles need oil. Conclusion: Automobiles have motors." The belief bias score had good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .86). Correct responses were summed (+1 each) to create a belief bias score (0-8) with higher values indicating a stronger bias.</p><p>Paranormal Beliefs. We assessed paranormal beliefs across different domains (e.g., witchcraft, superstition, spiritualism) with the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tobacyk, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The participants expressed their agreement with 26 statements (e.g., "It is possible to communicate with the dead") on a 7-item Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Moderately Disagree, 3 = Slightly Disagree, 4 = Uncertain, 5 = Slightly Agree, 6 = Moderately Agree, 7 = Strongly Agree). The scale had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.95). We averaged the participants' responses (1-7), with higher values indicating stronger paranormal beliefs.</p><p>Denominator Neglect. We used five scenarios describing a game of chance in which the participants could draw a single ticket from one of two bowlsa small bowl and a big bowleach containing folded tickets <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kirkpatrick &amp; Epstein, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Toplak et al., 2014)</ref>. Small bowls feature a higher probability of winning and ratios with smaller denominators than big bowls. For instance, the small bowl contained 10 tickets with 1 winner ticket out of 10; therefore giving an 11% chance of winning, whereas the large bowl contained 100 tickets with 8 winning tickets out of 100, giving an 8% chance of winning. Denominator neglect occurs when participants prefer to choose from the bigger bowl, not realising that the smaller bowl (with the smaller denominator)</p><p>is actually more likely to have a winning ticket. The participants indicated which bowl they would prefer in a real-life situation in order to hypothetically win £8 on a 6-point Likert scale  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baron, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Stanovich &amp; West, 1997)</ref>. Numeracy. We used the Lipkus Numeracy Scale, perhaps the most commonly used measure of numeracy in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lipkus, Samsa, &amp; Rimer, 2001</ref>). The measure consists of 11 simple mathematical tasks, which tap into general numeracy, including understanding of basic probability concepts, ability to convert percentages to proportions and ability to compare different risk magnitudes, (e.g., "The chance of getting a viral infection is .0005. Out of 10,000 people, about how many of them are expected to get infected?") The scale had satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .65). The participants' correct answers were summed (0-11) so higher scores indicated higher numeracy.</p><p>Finally, the participants answered some socio-demographic questions (age, gender and education level) and were debriefed. We conducted the study in accordance with the ethical standards of the American Psychological Association. We have reported all the measures in the study, all the manipulations, any data exclusions and the sample size determination rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of test response format on performance</head><p>The percentage of correct and intuitive incorrect responses, as well as item difficulty, item discrimination and item-total correlations, looked very similar across the three formats of the seven-item CRT <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Tables 1 and 2)</ref>. Overall, the participants correctly answered a similar number of problems in all the test versions of the seven-item CRT <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 1</ref>, panel A). We found no statistically significant differences between these three formats in the number of correctly solved problems, F(2, 449) = 0.31, p = .733, η 2 p &lt; .01. A Bayesian analysis, using a BayesFactor R package and default priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Morey &amp; Rouder, 2015)</ref>, yielded strong evidence (evidence categorization as recommended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lee &amp; Wagenmakers, 2014)</ref> to support the model, assuming the null format effect relative to the model assuming the format effect, BF 01 = 30.3. The effect of format on reflectiveness score remained non-significant when we entered the familiarity with the items as the covariate, F(2, 448) = 0.27, p = .271, η 2 p &lt; .01 and the effect of familiarity was also non-significant, F(1, 448) = 1.73, p = .190, η 2 p &lt; .01. Bayesian analysis including the same covariate (as a nuisance term) yielded strong evidence to support the model assuming the null format effect relative to the model assuming the format effect, BF 01 = 31.2. The robustness of the findings was tested against a six-item version of the CRT, which did not include the seventh item which featured a three-choice option in the original open-ended version of the CRT. The conclusion remained the same: there was no detectable format effect between the open-ended, two-option and four-option formats of the six-item CRT (M 1 = 2.8, M 2 = 3.1, M 3 = 2.8, respectively; SD 1 = 2.1, SD 2 = 1.8, SD 3 = 1.9, respectively), F(2, 449) = 0.86, p = .426, η 2 p &lt; .01, and strong evidence for relative support of the null effect model relative to the alternative model,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">BF 01 = 18.2.</formula><p>The participants also correctly answered a similar number of problems in all the test versions of the original three-item CRT <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 1</ref>, panel C). The format effect was not statistically significant, F(2, 449) = 1.19, p = .306, η 2 p = .01, and we found strong evidence supporting the model assuming no effect relative to the effect, BF 01 = 13.4. The null effect on reflectiveness score remained when we controlled for familiarity of the items, F(2, 448) = 1.08, p = .342, η 2 p = .01 (there was a non-significant effect of familiarity, F(1, 448) = 1.21, p = .273, η 2 p &lt; .01). We found strong evidence to support the model assuming the null format effect (including the covariate as a nuisance term) relative to the model assuming the format effect, BF 01 = 15.2. Thus, the evidence found here clearly supports the hypothesis of construct equivalence.     Note. Each graph represents individual data points, density and the mean (middle bold line) and its 95% CI (box borders).</p><p>We observed more variability in the number of intuitive responses across the different test formats of the seven-item CRT, with the two-option test giving rise to higher numbers of intuitive answers <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 1, panel C)</ref>. We found a significant effect of the response format, F(2, 449) = 7.47, p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .03, and strong evidence to support the model assuming the format effect relative to the no effect model, BF 10 = 25.4. The two-option CRT yielded more intuitive</p><p>responses than the open-ended CRT, t = 3.59, p &lt; .001, and more than the four-option CRT, t = 3.01, p &lt; .001, but there was no difference between the open-ended CRT and the four-option CRT, t = -0.59, p = .825. (All the p-values used Tukey's adjustment.) The effect of format on intuitiveness score was stable even when we controlled for the familiarity of the items, F(2, 448) = 7.49, p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .03, while familiarity did not have a significant effect, F(1, 448) = 1.38, p = .241, η 2 p &lt; .01. The format effect was further corroborated by strong relative evidence, BF 10 = 27.3. The pattern of results was the same when item seven was removed from the averages of the open-ended CRT, the two-option CRT and the four-option CRT (M 1 = 2.3, M 2 = 2.9, M 3 = 2.4, respectively; SD 1 = 1.7, SD 2 = 1.8, SD 3 = 1.7, respectively). The effect of the format was still significant, F(2, 449) = 6.30, p = .002, η 2 p = .03, and we found moderate evidence to support the model assuming the format effect, BF 10 = 8.7.</p><p>However, we did not find a significant increase in the number of intuitive answers across the test formats in the original three-item CRT, F(2, 449) = 1.50, p = .224, η 2 p = .01 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref>, panel D). The data provided strong relative evidence to support the null format effect model, BF 01 = 10.0. The null effect of format on intuitiveness score remained non-significant when we controlled for familiarity of the items, F(2, 448) = 1.40, p = .247, η 2 p = .01. There was a nonsignificant effect of familiarity, F(1, 448) = 2.90, p = .089, η 2 p = .01 and it was supported by strong relative evidence, BF 10 = 11.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of test response format on validity</head><p>The construct equivalence hypothesis predicted that the correlational pattern of the correct and intuitive CRT responses with belief bias, paranormal beliefs and denominator neglect as predictive validity variables, and with actively open-minded thinking and numeracy as construct validity variables, would be similar across the three test formats. Overall, in terms of expected direction and strength, as indicated by the confidence intervals in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref>, we observed that all the correlations were significantly different from zero, with one exception being the nonsignificant correlation between the intuitive responses from the seven-item open-ended CRT and paranormal beliefs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref>). We observed only small correlational variations between the three test formats of the seven-item and the three-item CRT and the predicted variables <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 2</ref>, panels A and C). The four-option format followed by the two-option format sometimes yielded higher correlations than the open-ended format, e.g., most notably for the belief bias: -.52 and -0.51 vs. -.36 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 2, panel A)</ref>, but in other tasks, such as denominator neglect, the correlations were remarkably similar to each other. We tested the differences between correlations using a series of z-tests adjusted for multiple comparisons (given three tests in each test, we used a Bonferroni adjustment, which decreased alpha error from .05 to 0.017), using the cocor R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Diedenhofen &amp; Musch, 2015)</ref>. None of the differences between the correlations reached statistical significance (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>). In other words, the different formats of the CRT predicted the outcome variables to a similar extent. and its 95% CI.  .78], respectively. We did not find significant differences between these three alphas, χ 2 (2) = 3.29, p = .193 (using the "cocron" R package, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Diedenhofen &amp; Musch, 2016)</ref>. Similarly, no differences were detected for the intuitiveness scores, α = 0.68, 95% CI [0.59, 0.75], α = 0.73, 95% CI [0.66, 0.79], α = 0.64, 95% CI [0.54, 0.72], respectively, which was not significantly different, χ 2 (2) = 2.36, p = .307.</p><p>The internal consistencies of the three-item CRT were also similar across the response formats. The internal consistencies of the reflectiveness score were not statically significant to 563. Thus, any differences in the correlational pattern would be less likely to be due to differences in internal consistency of the scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of test response format on completion time</head><p>Finally, we looked at the time taken to complete the three-format version of the CRT. As</p><p>expected, the open-ended CRT (M = 5.9, SD = 4.0, Mdn = 4.8, IQR = 3.9 minutes) took substantially more time to complete than the two and four-option CRTs (M = 3.5, SD = 1.5, Mdn = 3.2, IQR = 2.0 minutes; M = 4.5, SD = 2.6, Mdn = 3.8, IQR = 2.8 minutes, respectively). A non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test (used due to data skewness), confirmed that the difference was statistically significant, χ 2 (2) = 44.71, p &lt; .001. The open-ended CRT took longer than the two-option test, Mann-Whitney U = 6352, p &lt; .001, and longer than the four-option CRT, Mann-Whitney U = 8490, p = .001. The four-option CRT took longer than the two-option CRT, Mann-Whitney U = 9067, p = .001. Thus, multiple-choice versions of the CRT are much quicker to complete without compromising the predictive validity of the tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In a well-powered experiment, we found that different test response formatsopenended, two-option and four-optiondid not significantly affect the number of correct responses in the original three-item Cognitive Reflection Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Frederick, 2005)</ref> or in its seven-item extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Toplak et al., 2014)</ref>. Overall, the response format did not alter the number of intuitive responses, except in the case of the two-option format of the seven-item CRT, which yielded a higher rate of intuitive responses than the open-ended and four-option formats. This could be due to the presence of more prominent intuitive options. Furthermore, we found no detectable differences in the pattern of correlations of the test with benchmark indicators of predictive and construct validitybelief bias, denominator neglect, paranormal beliefs, actively open-minded thinking and numeracy. Finally, all three formats had similar internal consistency of the items regardless of the type of scoring (reflectiveness vs. intuitiveness). Overall, these findings favour the construct equivalence hypothesis over the non-equivalence hypothesis.</p><p>Our findings are surprising in the context of the literature of mathematical word problems and educational testing because, in those fields, multiple-choice questions have been shown to be easier to solve than open-ended questions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bonner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bosch-Domenech, Branas-Garza, &amp; Espin, 2014)</ref>. This might be because of the specific nature of the CRT items. The strategies believed to be responsible for better performance in multiple-choice mathematical problemssuch as corrective feedback, guessing or backwards solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bonner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bridgeman, 1992)</ref> might not work so well when an intuitively appealing but incorrect answer is provided. For instance, it seems less likely that participants would resort to guessing when there is an appealing intuitive option available. Similarly, corrective feedback relies on generating an answer, which is not in the offered set of possible answers and therefore such an item offers unintentional feedback. However, there is little benefit from corrective feedback if the intuitive incorrect answer and the correct answer are the two most generated answers. Our findings therefore indicate that the three versions of the CRT capture similar processes.</p><p>Methodologically speaking, we created and validated four new measures of cognitive reflection: two-option and four-option three-item CRTs as well as the equivalent of the extended version, two-option and four-option seven-item CRTs. The four-option versions seemed particularly well suited for use in both experimental and correlational research. They offer the same level of difficulty, similar internal consistency and the same predictive power as the openended version of the CRT (in fact, the four-option CRT was nominally the best ranked predictor among the formats), whilst being substantially quicker for participants to answer. In addition, coding the answers can be completely automated, which saves time for the researchers and eliminates coding ambivalence, which may lead to coding errors. The overall additional financial cost is not trivial due to its cumulative nature. For example, Prolific Academic, which is one of the cheapest panel providers in the UK, currently charges an additional £0.20 for roughly 100 seconds of additional time for each participant, which is the additional time associated with using the open version of the CRT compared with the four-option version. This represents an additional £100 for a study with 500 participants (similar to a study presented here). In addition to this cost, if one were to employ a research assistant to code those 3,500 answers of the open CRT for three hours, this would cost an additional £60. Hence, running a single study with the open CRT compared with the four-option CRT would be £160 more expensive. If one were to run three studies in one manuscript, this would add up to £480 (i.e., one new study).</p><p>The argument regarding the coding ambiguity is not negligible either. For example, in the bat and ball problem, the correct answer is supposed to be indicated in pence (cents in the US)____ and hence it should be "5". But is "0.05" also a correct answer or not? Is "£0.05" a correct response? A strict coding scheme would not classify such answers to be correct responses even though, clearly, they are not reasoning errors and should bein our viewcoded as correct. There are no coding instructions in the original paper, nor a standardised coding practice regarding this test, and one can rarely see any details provided on coding of the CRT in other papers. So, there are obvious degrees of freedom in deciding on a coding scheme for the open answers in the CRT and it is not obvious what exactly constitutes the correct response. To illustrate the extent of the difference, in our research reported here, when we followed the strict coding for the bat and ball problem (n = 147), around 10% (6 out of 58) of the originally correct answers were recoded as "other incorrect" and around 11% (9 out of 83) of the originally intuitive answers were recoded as "other incorrect" responses; a significant change in absolute performance according to a marginal homogeneity test, p &lt; .001. The automatic coding of a multiple-choice version of the CRT eliminates this problem and would allow the CRT performance in future studies to be more comparable.</p><p>The two-option versions of the test are appropriate too. However, the seven-item CRT yielded a higher number of intuitive responses without compromising predictive patterns; this might have consequences for researchers for whom the average absolute level of intuitive responses is important. Future research should consider whether different cognitive processes are involved when response formats vary in stem-equivalent judgment and decision-making tasks.</p><p>For instance, one could wonder whether the process and performance is the same behind the base-rate fallacy: whereas constructed responses are used in the textbook version of Bayesian reasoning tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sirota, Kostovičová, &amp; Vallée-Tourangeau, 2015)</ref>, multiple-choice questions are used in the stereotypical base-rate problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">De Neys, Cromheeke, &amp; Osman, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Three limitations of our research require more discussion and should be addressed in future research. First, we have shown that the response formats did not alter predictive and construct validity, as indicated by the benchmark variables, and even though our selection of such variables captures different cognitive domains, it is not exhaustive. Future research should explore other outcome variables and see whether response format would yield any changes to the predictive and construct validity. Second, even though the format did not alter the performance or predictive patterns, clearly validity and reliability of multiple-choice versions of the CRT depend on the multiple-choice construction of the test. Here, we adopted a transparent and consistent procedure according to which two remaining options were the most common incorrect (non-intuitive) responses generated by the participants in other studies. Changes in the provided choices (the four-option version) might affect the construct equivalence, e.g., adding an additional appealing incorrect answer could increase cognitive conflict and subsequent cognitive engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bhatia, 2017)</ref>. Therefore, in terms of future research, we would recommend the use of multiple-choice tests that have been validated (see Supplementary Materials and https://osf.io/mzhyc/ for quick implementation) or, in the case of ad hoc development, we would advise at least testing the construct equivalence of new multiple-choice versions. In addition, as pointed out by our reviewer, it is also possible to imagine the construct non-equivalence hypothesis in the opposite direction. For example, one could argue that the open-ended version of the CRT is better at testing the spontaneous detection of an incorrect intuition, which might be the reason why the CRT predicts the predictive validity task. Even though we did not find supportive evidence for such a direction of the non-equivalence hypothesis, future research should consider this possibility when further testing the construct non-equivalence hypothesis.</p><p>Finally, even though we used a sample based on the general adult population, generally speaking this was a relatively well-educated sample; it is still possible that in low educated samples the test formats would play a significant role and future research should address this possibility empirically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We developed and validated a multiple-choice version (with two and four options) of the three-item <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Frederick, 2005)</ref> and seven-item Cognitive Reflection Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Toplak et al., 2014)</ref>. We have shown that the response format did not affect the perfomance, predictive patterns or psychometric properties of the test. Prior research used various response formats whilst assuming construct equivalence of these tests. Our findings are aligned with such an assumption. We recommend the use of the four-option multiple-choice version of the test in future correlational and experimental research because it saves time and eliminates coding errors without losing its predictive power.</p></div>
