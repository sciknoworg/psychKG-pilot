			<abstract>
				<p>In decision making, intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be linked to safety behavior, which could ironically maintain IU and, thus, foster indecisiveness. In a smartphone-based experience sampling study, 247 participants described their real-life decisions six times per day and rated (a) their situational indecisiveness, (b) decision characteristics, (c) situational IU, and (d) problematic safety behaviors. Participants higher in dispositional IU reported more indecisiveness and engaged in more problematic safety behavior across measurements. The same relationships were observed with situational IU at the level of individual measurements. Engaging in more problematic safety behaviors during the first days predicted indecisiveness on the last day, mediated by IU. The results demonstrate the real-life relevance of the relationship between IU, indecisiveness, and safety behavior.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Decision making is indispensable for functioning in a world of increasingly complex choices. Accordingly, indecisiveness, a "trait-like difficulty making decisions across time and situations" <ref type="bibr">(Lauderdale &amp; Oakes, 2021, p. 256)</ref>, is perceived as problematic in many cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Yates et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Indecisiveness is associated with impairment in everyday life, for example, putting off important tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ferrari, 1994)</ref> or lack of commitment to academic goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Germeijs &amp; De Boeck, 2002)</ref>, and with various mental disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Frost &amp; Shows, 1993)</ref> or anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Rassin &amp; Muris, 2005)</ref>. Potential explanations for the emergence of indecisiveness are multifaceted <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(van Randenborgh et al., 2010)</ref> and poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lauderdale &amp; Oakes, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>One possible explanation for indecisiveness could be uncertainty and how it is handled. Decisions making often requires committing to a choice despite uncertainty. Notably, individuals differ in how much they "react negatively on an emotional, cognitive, and behavioral level to uncertain situations and events" <ref type="bibr">(Dugas et al., 2004, p. 143)</ref>, a trait called intolerance of uncertainty <ref type="bibr">(IU;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Freeston et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Faced with a decision, a person high in IU may strive to reduce uncertainty as much as possible, even to a point where the costs outweigh the benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jacoby, 2020)</ref>, for example, by spending more time on searching for information than the decision outcome is worth. In fact, excessive uncertainty reduction may maintain IU in the long run because it reinforces a pattern where uncertainty is not tolerated buton the contrary-treated as something potentially dangerous and to be avoided <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carleton et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>This maintenance of IU, in turn, would then contribute to further indecisiveness in future decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007)</ref>. Previous studies related to this reasoning have relied on either correlational cross-sectional designs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Koerner et al., 2017)</ref> or controlled, but somewhat artificial laboratorybased paradigms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wake et al., 2022)</ref>. While the designs of these previous studies offer important evidence on the decision-making relevance of IU, they do not allow conclusions on whether the INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR <ref type="bibr">IN EVERYDAY LIFE 4</ref> proposed relationships between IU, problematic uncertainty reduction, and indecisiveness exist in people's real decisions in everyday life.</p><p>The present research therefore investigates the relationships between IU, indecisiveness, and problematic uncertainty-reducing behavior using the experience sampling method (ESM). ESM studies measure the same variables repeatedly from the same participant, often referring to their immediate and real-life experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Larson &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 1983)</ref>. As a specific advantage of the ESM approach, it allows testing whether predictions hold in a natural setting. Hence, the present study contributes to understanding problems in a ubiquitous area of human functioning, namely decision making; and, in doing so, it uses a methodology with particularly high external validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Intolerance of uncertainty, decision making, and related behavior</head><p>Uncertainty is usually an unpleasant emotional experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carleton, 2016)</ref>, and particularly so for people high in IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Freeston et al., 1994)</ref>. Due to the obvious uncertainty in many decisions, IU is assumed to be a predisposing factor for indecisiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rassin, 2007)</ref>. In line with a predisposing role of IU for indecisiveness, a robust correlation between IU and indecisiveness has been shown repeatedly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Koerner et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rassin et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>IU-related behavior may be an important component of the IU-indecisiveness association <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007)</ref>. IU-related behavior is defined as behavior primarily aimed at reducing uncertainty, either by resolving it (e.g., through overcompensating strategies such as information seeking), or by avoiding it (e.g., through under-engaging strategies such as procrastination; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bottesi et al., 2019)</ref>. These behaviors can occur in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007)</ref>. Previous findings are compatible with this reasoning. For example, IU is correlated with more checking of visual input when deciding whether two geometric shapes are identical <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wake et al., 2022)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jacoby et al. (2014)</ref> found that IU was associated with increased information sampling before deciding which of two colors was represented more often in a bag of beads. In line with IU-related avoidance behavior, higher IU is also INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR IN EVERYDAY LIFE 5 linked with a tendency to avoid a variable waiting time before choosing between two options in a gambling task. This is true even when avoiding the waiting time obviously reduces the value and probability of potential gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Luhmann et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>IU-related behaviors aimed at reducing uncertainty can be problematic because they are costly in terms of time, energy, or resources. For example, an individual high in IU may spend hours looking for information in order to eliminate uncertainty in a decision (e.g., which product to buy). The time and energy spent searching may easily outweigh the benefits of finding a better product (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Schwartz et al., 2002)</ref>. Another, more consequential problem arising from IU-related uncertainty-reducing behaviors is that they may maintain the underlying intolerance when carried out excessively (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007)</ref>. This maintaining process is comparable to safety behaviors in anxiety disorders. For example, a person with panic disorder may leave the house only when accompanied by their partner. In the short term, this reduces the fear associated with being outside alone. However, in the long term, the person's confidence is undermined and the thought of being outside alone will evoke even more anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Blakey &amp; Abramowitz, 2016)</ref>. Although IU in itself is not pathological, a similar mechanism may exist in IU-related behavior: Returning to the example of a high-IU individual seeking decisional information, this search may initially reduce uncertainty. However, persistent and excessive engagement in such behavior could diminish the person's ability to tolerate uncertainty in the future. In the long run, the person could depend more and more on uncertainty-reducing behaviors and become strongly averse to even small amounts of uncertainty in low-stake decisions. This vicious cycle would be fertile ground for indecisiveness. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates this proposed mechanism (cf., Jacoby, 2020).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Illustration of Predicted Relationships between IU, Safety Behavior, and Indecisiveness</head><p>Note. High levels of IU motivate a person to engage in uncertainty-reducing behaviors such as information seeking when faced with a decision. This behavior can take the form of problematic safety behavior, which, in the long-term, undermines the person's ability to tolerate uncertainty, or in other words, increases their IU. Increased IU, in turn, interferes with the uncertainty routinely involved in decision-making, thus promoting indecisiveness.</p><p>In the following, we use the term safety behavior when referring to excessive and problematic IUrelated behaviors aimed at reducing (decisional) uncertainty. In fact, psychotherapy programs targeting IU often focus on preventing safety behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hebert &amp; Dugas, 2019)</ref>, emphasizing their maintaining role. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dugas and Robichaud (2007)</ref> even refer explicitly to decision making and recommend the prevention of decisional safety behaviors in their IU-specific treatment program.</p><p>IU-related behavior, as well as its role as safety behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Tolin et al., 2003)</ref>, has lately received increasing attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Freeston et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wake et al., 2022)</ref>. However, empirical research of IU-related behavior is still sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bottesi et al., 2019)</ref>, especially in the area of decision making. The few studies examining IU-related behavior in decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jacoby et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wake et al., 2022)</ref> have not INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR IN EVERYDAY LIFE 7 been designed to test whether such behaviors meet all criteria of safety behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rosen &amp; Knäuper, 2009</ref>). In the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wake et al. (2022)</ref>, the increased checking of visual input before deciding is compatible with the notion of safety behavior. For example, it may resemble the exaggerated checking behavior of individuals with OCD. However, other criteria of safety behavior, such as disproportional effort and/or problematic long-term consequences cannot be inferred from the paradigm. Similarly, the choosing of more immediate but less valuable options in order to avoid waiting time, as observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Luhmann et al. (2011)</ref>, may resemble avoidant safety behavior of socially anxious individuals foregoing an enjoyable event out of fear of talking to others. Still, in order to more confidently classify this choice pattern observed in the experiment as safety behavior, other criteria of safety behavior should be fulfilled. More specifically, it remains unclear whether the choice pattern avoidant of waiting time is in fact motivated by uncertainty reduction, or rather by some other process, such as impatience. In the current study, we have therefore made sure to directly assess defining features of IU-related safety behavior, like having disproportional costs, maintaining IU in the long term, and being motivated by uncertainty. Moreover, the studies looking at decision behavior associated with IU have been crosssectional, which hinders the examination of potential long-term consequences of this decision behavior.</p><p>In contrast, the ESM approach we used, being longitudinal, allows looking at temporal sequences. This affords testing whether preceding safety behavior predicts subsequent IU and indecisiveness, consistent with a long-term negative effect of safety behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Purpose of the Present Study</head><p>In summary, IU is associated with indecisiveness and, presumably, with safety behaviors in the decision-making context. However, decisional safety behaviors may contribute to the maintenance of IU in the long term, creating a vicious cycle. Maintained IU, in turn, may negatively influence indecisiveness <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). The present research tests the associations derived from this idea. Complementing preliminary evidence from questionnaire-and laboratory-based research, our study relies on ESM INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR IN EVERYDAY LIFE 8 assessment of real personal decisions, demonstrating the everyday life relevance of the research question. Additionally, in cases where no personal decision was reported, we presented participants with predefined decision scenarios and posed the same questions as when a personal decision was described. This approach allowed us to test whether findings for personal decisions would replicate in standardized hypothetical decisions. To overcome limitations of preceding studies, we also assessed the extent to which uncertainty-reducing behaviors actually met criteria in line with the definition of safety behavior. Furthermore, the longitudinal nature of ESM affords testing relationships over time.</p><p>Hypotheses involving IU were tested both on the within-person level (Level 1; relationships between variables on the state level at any given time point) and on the between-person level (Level 2; relationships between trait measures assessed at baseline and/or state measures averaged across all time points).</p><p>Our central hypotheses were that state IU (Level 1) is positively related to state indecisiveness (H1a), and safety behavior (H1b); and, likewise, that trait IU (Level 2) is positively related to averaged state indecisiveness (H2a), and averaged safety behavior (H2b). Consistent with the idea of safety behavior undermining the ability to tolerate uncertainty and, in turn, to make decisions, we predicted (on Level 2, variables were averaged across time points) that preceding safety behavior is positively related to subsequent state IU (H3a) and subsequent state indecisiveness (H3b), and that subsequent state IU mediates the relationship between preceding safety behavior and subsequent state indecisiveness (H3c). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> visualizes the basic model underlying these hypotheses.</p><p>Less central to our main research questions, but adding valuable insight, we put forward secondary hypotheses (HS). First, we predicted that trait IU is positively related to state IU averaged across all time points (Level 2, HS1). Although this association may appear obvious, it would support the validity of our state IU measurement in general, and underline the applicability of state IU to the decision-making context in particular, corroborating the role of IU for decision making. Furthermore, INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR IN EVERYDAY LIFE 9 according to recent theorizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Freeston et al., 2020)</ref>, IU might shape the perception of situations by increasing the perceived uncertainty. Consistent with this reasoning, we expected that trait IU is positively related to averaged decision-related uncertainty (Level 2, HS2). Finally, building on results from an earlier study (xxx [masked for peer review], 2021), we predicted that decision importance moderates the relationship between IU and indecisiveness, in that the relationship will be stronger for more important decisions, both for state IU and state indecisiveness at a given time point (Level 1; HS3a) and for the cross-level interaction between trait IU (Level 2), decision importance (Level 1), and state indecisiveness (Level 1; HS3b).</p></div>

Four minor deviations from the preregistration were necessary (e.g., renumbering of hypotheses) and a detailed description is provided in the OSM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Power analysis and participants</head><p>According to a simulation-based power analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lafit et al., 2021</ref>; for details, see https://t1p.de/zgcl4), we strived for a final N ≥ 200, providing sufficient power (80%) to test more complex hypotheses including the cross-level interaction between trait IU (Level 2) and decision importance (Level 1) in predicting state indecisiveness (HS3b), as found in a previous study <ref type="bibr">(β = .11, N = 345;</ref> xxx [masked for peer review], 2021). To account for data loss due to data quality checks, we aimed to recruit at least 240 participants with complete baseline measurements. We advertised the study through social media <ref type="bibr">(Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)</ref>  (3 x 100 € and 10 x 30 €). To meet inclusion criteria, participants had to: be at least 18 years old; be fluent in German; have a smartphone with an iOS or Android operating system and a mobile data plan; pass the instruction comprehension questions; complete the baseline survey within one day after registration; provide at least one valid mobile survey. The final sample included N = 247 participants (mean age: 25.6; 81.0% female, 0.4% non-binary) with 98.0% having a university degree or qualification for university entrance. More descriptive information is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> (referring to Level 1) and <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> (referring to Level 2) as well as the OSM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Procedure</head><p>Data collection took place from January to March 2022. After providing informed consent, participants were screened for the exclusion criteria (age, language, technical requirements). If they passed the screening, they were directed to a tutorial. The tutorial provided an annotated sample trial of a fictitious participant to serve as a model and to illustrate which types of decisions and uncertaintyreducing behaviors were being asked for. Comprehension tests served to check understanding of the instructions, using five questions such as "What kind of decisions should you provide at the beginning of each survey?"(Decisions I have faced or am facing myself <ref type="bibr">[correct]</ref>, General decisions that people may face <ref type="bibr">[incorrect]</ref>). The test trial consisted of a regular trial in which participants could make themselves acquainted with the handling of the survey. It was not included in analysis. Those who passed the tests registered their smartphone with the signaling software (SurveySignal©), followed by the baseline assessment, where they indicated different trait-level variables (e.g., trait IU). At the end, they chose an individual starting time for the daily signals (any full hour between 6:00 AM and 10:00 AM CET).</p><p>Beginning on the second day after registration, participants were invited via SMS to complete six daily mobile surveys on seven consecutive days on their smartphones, with a reminder sent 15 minutes after the original signal if necessary.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11</head><p>A flowchart of the mobile survey is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In each mobile survey, participants described their most important decision since the last signal, allowing both pending and already completed decisions (hereafter called reported decision trials). If no decision was reported, they were provided with one of 40 everyday moral decision scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Singer et al., 2019</ref>, hereafter called scenario trials). Scenarios served to compare how participants reacted to their real-life decisions versus standardized hypothetical decisions and also discouraged intentional underreporting of decisions.</p><p>Referring to their own decision or the scenario, participants answered questions related to the decision.</p><p>If participants reported decisional uncertainty, they also indicated their state IU and any uncertaintyreducing behaviors, as well as to what extent this behavior qualified as safety behavior. Mobile surveys were distributed pseudo-randomly by SurveySignal© during a 14-hour time frame with at least 90 minutes between signals. Signals had to be responded to within 75 minutes or else were disabled. The day after the last signal at 10:00 AM, a feedback survey was sent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Measures</head><p>Descriptive statistics and internal consistencies for the principal measures are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Most mobile survey measures referred to the reported personal decision or the provided decision scenario, respectively. Their wording was therefore adapted to the type of trial. All wordings are provided in the preregistration codebook in the OSM. If no established German version of a measure was available, item translation was undertaken based on a thorough translation-back translation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brislin, 1970)</ref>. Trait measures were included for analysis if at least 80% of items had been answered, which was always the case (0% missing values). For state measures, the minimum number of INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR IN EVERYDAY LIFE 13 items required to calculate the score varied (see preregistration), but was met in the vast majority of measurements (99.4%; only 55 of all state measurements combined could not be included in the analyses). </p></div>

The German version has 18 items (e.g., "Unforeseen events upset me greatly"), answered on a scale from 1 (not at all characteristic of me) to 5 (entirely characteristic of me). The factor structure of the scale has been debated. In a shortened English version, a two-factor structure has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carleton et al., 2007)</ref>, distinguishing between inhibitory IU (being paralyzed by uncertainty) and prospective IU (being vigilant and cautious in the face of uncertainty). For the German version, a three-factor solution was deemed more appropriate, with a Constrained Action and Vigilance subscale corresponding largely to the Inhibitory and Prospective subscales, plus a third Stress subscale reflecting stress due to uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gerlach et al., 2008)</ref>. More recent research has favored one general IU factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(McEvoy et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, we used the total score for the main analyses and repeated analyses using all subscales exploratorily.</p></div>

The "Uncertainty makes/made me uneasy, anxious, or stressed in this decision"; "The smallest doubt can/could stop me from acting in this decision"; "It frustrates/frustrated me not having all the information I need/needed about this decision".

Examples of participants' entries included, but were not limited to, seeking advice (e.g., "I asked my mother for advice"), distraction (e.g., "I distracted myself with my phone"), or cognitive strategies (e.g., "I ruminated"). After providing this description, participants rated the described behavior on eight items representing criteria of problematic safety behavior on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Sample items included: "I behave like this because I feel uncertain";</p><p>"Acting differently would be difficult for me"; "This behavior restricts me". For example, if a participant indicated that they had asked for advice to reduce uncertainty, they rated the items referring to this because I feel uncertain"), while the third factor reflected Feeling Forced (two items, e.g., "Acting differently would be difficult for me"). Because a three-factor solution was neither theoretically anticipated, nor planned in the preregistration, it was only considered in exploratory analyses, while our main analyses used the total score of all safety behavior items.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Data analytic strategy</head><p>Analyses were carried out in R (R Core Team, 2020). For hypotheses involving Level 1 variables, we estimated multilevel models with measurement occasions nested in participants using the lmerTest package <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref> and Full Maximum Likelihood estimation. In these analyses, we first estimated random intercept models (i.e., only intercepts but not slopes were allowed to vary among Level 2 units). To test HS3a and b, predicting a moderation of the relationship between IU and indecisiveness by decision importance, we added interaction effects to the models in a second step. For all random intercept models, we then estimated the corresponding random slopes models (i.e., both intercepts and slopes were allowed to vary among Level 2 units). The more complex models were only reported if they converged properly and fit the data significantly better than the respective-less complex-random intercept model (as indicated by a significant chi-squared deviance test). This was the case in all but some exploratory analyses, therefore random slopes models are being reported unless otherwise stated. Degrees of freedom and p-values for fixed effects were calculated with Satterthwaite approximation. For hypotheses involving only Level 2 variables, simple OLS regression models were calculated. Mediation models were estimated using the lavaan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>, using bootstrapped (1,000 resamples) bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals. In analyses involving IU and indecisiveness averaged across the last measurement day, we controlled for the respective trait measures (i.e., trait IU/indecisiveness). By doing so, we aimed to control noise due to individual differences, thus increasing precision. The level of significance was set to alpha = .05.</p><p>To compute scale scores, item responses were averaged within scales (or subscales). Additionally, for some analyses, Level 1 variables were aggregated by computing the mean of the scores across all ESM time-points. Level 2 variables were grand-mean centered by subtracting the sample mean score from each participant's mean score. Level 1 predictors were person-mean centered by subtracting the respective participant's mean score from each individual measurement score.</p><p>We tested hypotheses separately for surveys referring to participants' own decisions (reported decision trials) and decision scenarios (scenario trials  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 3 and 5</ref>. As an exception, we did not consider scenario trials when testing whether preceding safety behavior would predict increased subsequent indecisiveness via increased IU (H3a -c). This exception was made because a potential influence of an earlier behavior on later perceptions was not plausible for hypothetical scenarios.</p><p>We also tested all predicted relationships using the subscales of our measures of IU and safety behavior exploratorily. Theoretical deliberations did not imply specific predictions for subscales, especially since for IU, the practical utility of subscales has been questioned <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(McEvoy et al., 2019)</ref>, while for safety behavior, the measure was new and the validation of the multifactorial structure is still pending. Also on an exploratory level, we repeated the mediation analysis (preceding safety behavior predicts more subsequent indecisiveness via IU; H3c) adding the frequency of uncertainty-reducing behaviors as a variable. In doing so, we tested whether frequency would explain more or additional variance compared to how much these behaviors met criteria of problematic decisional safety behavior.</p><p>Further exploratory analyses involved testing the positive relationship between IU and state indecisiveness (H1a &amp; H2a) as well as between IU and safety behavior (H1b &amp; H2b) with state and trait IU included simultaneously as predictors on the within-person level (Level 1). This approach allowed us to test whether both predictors still predict the respective dependent variable even when the other predictor is statistically controlled for. Furthermore, we assessed the within-person (Level 1) association between each measurement of safety behavior and the following measurement of indecisiveness via the following measurement of IU (multilevel mediation). Although we assumed on theoretical grounds that preceding safety behavior could influence subsequent indecisiveness via IU only after a certain time (i.e., the first six measurement days, H3c), we thus tested whether this predicted influence would also be observable from one measurement occasion to the next.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Secondary hypotheses</head><p>In HS1, we predicted that people with higher IU at the trait level also experienced more state IU in everyday decisions.

In line with the hypothesis, trait IU was associated with more averaged uncertainty during a decision, b = 0.32, t(242) = 4.19, p &lt; .001. Importantly, this relationship between trait IU and uncertainty was also found for scenario trials, b = 0.23, t(240) = 2.95, p = .004, featuring the same standardized decision scenarios for all participants.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the association between IU and state indecisiveness was stronger in more important decisions (moderation effect, HS3). Contrary to the hypothesis, this was not the case when looking at state IU on Level 1, b = 0.02, t(2312.073) = 1.01, p = .312 (comparison of random intercept model with and without moderator: χ 2 (1) = 1.020, p = .312; HS3a). However, when looking at trait IU, the expected moderation effect was found: The relationship between trait IU (Level 2) and state indecisiveness (Level 1) was stronger for decisions perceived as more important (Level 1), as indicated by a significant cross-level interaction in the random slopes model, b = 0.09, t(3551.45) = 4.25, p &lt; .001</p><p>(comparison of random intercept model with and without moderator: χ 2 (1) = 18.02, p &lt; .001; HS3b).

This lack of an interaction was opposed to the hypothesis (HS3a), but in line with the total score-based results.</p><p>Results for the interaction of trait IU with decision importance to predict indecisiveness (cross-level interaction, HS3b) were mixed: The trait IU subscales Stress and Inhibitory IU showed the expected interaction, but the Constrained Action subscale showed the interaction only in some constellations, while the Vigilance and Prospective IU subscales never showed it (maximum non-significant interaction term b = 0.04, t(3262.65) = 1.95, p = .051).</p><p>We also investigated the potential impact of the frequency of available data points for aggregated state IU and safety behavior variables. This allows to decide whether only the safety behavior characteristics of uncertainty-reducing behaviors were crucial or whether the frequency of these behaviors also had to be considered. Correlations between the frequencies of available data points for a variable and the corresponding aggregated variable scores were small (e.g., aggregated safety behavior score and frequency: r = .14; aggregated state IU score and frequency: r = -.04; both referring to reported decision trials). The frequency of available safety behavior scores was only a significant Finally, we also investigated the mediation model (preceding safety behavior predicts more subsequent indecisiveness via IU, H3c, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>) in a multilevel analysis. The within-person <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Level 1)</ref> association between each measurement of safety behavior and the following measurement of state IU was significant, b = 0.15, 95% CI [0.07; 0.24], whereas the association with state indecisiveness was not, b = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.02; 0.14]. Thus, safety behavior predicted more state IU, but not more state indecisiveness at the next measurement. Consequently, the mediation model that did apply to safety behavior averaged across the first six survey days and state IU and state indecisiveness averaged across the last survey day did not apply to the multilevel perspective.</p></div>

Understanding helpful vs. disadvantageous aspects is a prerequisite for improving decision problems. Our ESM-based observations reveal robust associations between IU, safety behavior, and decisional difficulties in real everyday decisions. While not allowing causal inferences, these findings add evidence to the oftenstated assumption that IU and safety behavior may be important factors to consider when looking for ways to alleviate indecisiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jacoby, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rassin, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Summary of results</head><p>Trait IU was positively associated with state indecisiveness. This observation complements existing research showing that trait IU is related to trait measures of indecisiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Koerner et al., 2017)</ref>, and extends it to real-life decisions. Furthermore, the higher the trait IU, the more features of problematic safety behavior were ascribed to uncertainty-reducing behaviors. The direct measurement of safety behavior, taking into account its defining features described in the literature, is an important addition to the state of research. Existing studies of IU-related behaviors in decision making that could be interpreted as safety behaviors have not explicitly tested some crucial safety behavior criteria, like the costs of a behavior or whether it is motivated by the desire to reduce uncertainty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Luhmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wake et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The trait-level associations of trait IU with variables averaged across all measurement days were mirrored by the same associations based on state variables, that is, at a given measurement. This consistency suggests that similar mechanisms are at play not only trans-situationally, but also in individual decisional situations, reflecting the ubiquity of the connection between IU, indecisiveness, and decisional safety behaviors.</p><p>As shown in exploratory analyses, trait IU and state IU each still explained unique variance in state indecisiveness and safety behavior when entered simultaneously as predictors in the same model. This result is in line with previous research showing, for example, that situation-specific IU explains variance in psychological symptoms above and beyond trait IU <ref type="bibr">(Mahoney &amp; McEvoy, 2012)</ref>. The finding suggests that although a higher general disposition towards IU (i.e., trait IU) already predicts more indecisiveness and decisional safety behavior in specific decisions, IU felt in this specific decision (i.e., state IU) additionally helps explain these reactions to the decision.</p><p>We also found that engaging in more problematic safety behavior throughout several days was associated with more indecisiveness at the end of the ESM phase. This association was mediated by IU at the end of the ESM phase. Although correlational, the time component in our analysis is in line with a cumulative effect of safety behavior undermining tolerance towards uncertainty and, in turn, contributing to indecisiveness (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007)</ref>. Interestingly, associations of subsequent state IU and indecisiveness with preceding safety behavior were stronger than with the respective trait measures of IU and indecisiveness. Exploratory analyses showed that the mere frequency of uncertaintyreducing behavior explained little to no variance in subsequent IU and indecisiveness. This shows that uncertainty-reducing behavior in itself need not be problematic and it is important to explicitly assess to what extent it represents problematic safety behavior. Although the detrimental effect of excessive uncertainty reduction has been theoretically assumed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Freeston et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jacoby, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tolin et al., 2003)</ref> and even underlies IU-focused interventions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hebert &amp; Dugas, 2019)</ref>, we know of no prior longitudinal studies actually corroborating this claim.</p><p>When exploring the same mediation from a multilevel perspective (i.e., each measurement of safety behavior predicting the next measurement of state indecisiveness via IU), safety behavior explained variance in IU, but not in indecisiveness. This may support the theoretical reasoning that safety behavior exerts a stronger influence on later feelings, perceptions, and self-evaluations only after a certain period of cumulative exertion (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deacon &amp; Maack, 2008)</ref>. However, experimental research manipulating IU-related safety behavior is needed to conclusively test its causal effects.</p><p>Interestingly, most results held not only for participants' real-life personal decisions, but also for decision scenarios participants were asked to imagine. This aspect provides a valuable addition to the actual experience sampling data because it generalizes the findings to more standardized decision situations, reducing the subjective component of decision perception.</p><p>Some interesting additional observations were made in line with our secondary hypotheses. First, the concept of situational IU <ref type="bibr">(Mahoney &amp; McEvoy, 2012)</ref> was used to measure state IU in specific decisions. The finding that trait IU predicted increased state IU in participants' real-life decisions underlines the applicability of IU to the decision-making context, as has been demonstrated for others contexts as well, for example, specific mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Thibodeau et al., 2015)</ref>, or Covid <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Scharmer et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Further, trait IU was positively related to perceived decisional uncertainty. Importantly, this result was not only observed in reported decision trials, but also in trials featuring standardized scenarios, which were the same for all participants. This outcome is in line with theoretical considerations that IU alters the perception of situations, involving an increased sensitivity towards uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Freeston et al., 2020)</ref>. This phenomenon may be analogous to lower thresholds of threat perception in pathological anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bredemeier &amp; Berenbaum, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, as found in a preceding study (xxx [masked for peer review], 2021), the more important a decision, the closer the link between trait IU and aggregated state indecisiveness, suggesting a certain context-dependence of this relationship. However, the interaction effect was small and was not found for state IU and scenario trials. The existing but limited moderation by decision importance supports the view that although trait indecisiveness extends to trivial decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frost &amp; Shows, 1993)</ref>, it is not entirely independent of perceived decision features such as importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rassin, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the exploratory analyses using IU subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carleton et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gerlach et al., 2008)</ref>, the most important observation is that results based on total scores applied to all subscales as well for the main hypotheses. Regarding the secondary hypotheses, we also observed mostly the same relationships when using the subscales as compared to the total scale. Some deviations occurred, mostly in scenario trials, but they did not consistently rely on a certain subscale. The lack of consistent subscalespecific effects may support factor-analytic findings suggesting that IU subscales have limited explanatory value compared to the total score <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(McEvoy et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Results for the subscales of safety behavior were also largely in line with those based on the total score. Only the Feeling Forced subscale did not produce the same relationships in isolated constellations. Explanations may be that the items were difficult to understand (they were both based on hypothetical thinking, e.g., "Acting differently would be difficult for me"), that reliability was too low (the items had the lowest within-person reliability of all subscales), or that they were not perceived by participants to belong to the same construct as the other items (which may be supported by the factor analysis showing low loadings in both the 1-and 2-factor solution, cf. https://t1p.de/l8qct). In summary, although the content-neutral safety behavior assessment is innovative and its validity has been shown (xxx [masked for peer review], 2023), future studies should strive to adjust and improve the exact item wording.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Descriptive observations of decision making in everyday life</head><p>To the authors' knowledge, no ESM study has assessed a comparable amount of decision-related information several times per day, making this research an important addition to the decision-making literature even beyond the specific hypotheses tested. In reported decision trials, participants described a wide range of decisions. Time planning was by far the most common type of decision category. Workand education-related decisions were somewhat more frequent than leisure and vacation-related decisions. Combining decisions concerning social contacts, family, and partners, more than a third of decisions were social in nature. To our surprise, Covid-related decisions were the least frequent category (5.0%) although data collection took place in a time when public worry about the pandemic was still high. Levels of indecisiveness, lack of information, uncertainty, and state IU were relatively low, overall. Interestingly, this pattern converges with a daily diary study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zander-Schellenberg et al. (2019)</ref>. They also assessed decision ease, in other words, a reverse-coded proxy of the state indecisiveness measure in the current study. Ease scores had a high mean (5.23 on a scale from 1-7) and</p><p>were right-skewed, mirroring the distribution of state indecisiveness in our study. Somewhat in contrast to the rather low overall level of uncertainty and state IU/indecisiveness, more than a third of decisions involved uncertainty-reducing behaviors. Importantly, this does not automatically imply problematic safety behavior. Using the midpoint of the safety behavior scale (3 on a scale from 1-5) as a reference point, 39.8% of uncertainty-reducing behaviors in (reported) decisions had high safety behavior scores, which constituted 14.1% of all reported decision trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Strengths and limitations</head><p>One aspect setting these findings apart from earlier research is the use of ESM. Thus, results are not based on general retrospective self-evaluations as in existing correlational studies on IU, indecisiveness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Koerner et al., 2017)</ref>, and related behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sauer et al., 2020)</ref>. The fact that we observed all predicted associations using this methodology makes a strong case for their pervasiveness even in unselected samples with relatively low levels of decision problems, and is a crucial addition to converging findings from earlier studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wake et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, existing ESM studies of decision making have looked at specific subtypes of decisions, like choices in self-control temptations <ref type="bibr">(Hofmann et al., 2012)</ref> or food choices <ref type="bibr">(Bauer et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Studies in which participants described their general decisions, however, have only included one measurement per day and provided limited descriptive data about the decisions <ref type="bibr">(Bjälkebring et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sirota et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zander-Schellenberg et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, the present study also affords general The measurement of safety behavior also constitutes an innovation. Whereas preceding studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bottesi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wake et al., 2022)</ref> only allowed indirect conclusions about the safety behavior status of IU-related behaviors, the present study explicitly included defining features of problematic safety behavior. Also, this approach ensures that all uncertainty-reducing behaviors provided by participants have a corresponding safety behavior score, generating a comprehensive collection.</p><p>Judging the data collection procedure, 82.9% of all signals were responded to with a valid survey, indicating good compliance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hofmann &amp; Patel, 2015)</ref>. Crucially, surveys were distributed equally across all days of the week, including weekends, thus likely reflecting the full range of decisions.</p><p>Although participation was completely online, careful measures were taken to assure instruction comprehension, including a tutorial and mandatory attention checks. Also, underreporting of decisions was disincentivized by providing decision vignettes if participants had no personal decision to report.</p><p>These data quality criteria were reflected in a low rate of invalid decision descriptions (1.2%) and uncertainty reduction descriptions (0.2%) in the post-hoc external ratings.</p><p>Some limitations should be mentioned. The current sample was, on average, quite young and predominantly female, with a high education level. Future studies should strive for more representative samples to assure better generalizability. Importantly, however, trait IU levels, ranging from 2.67 (Constrained Action) to 2.99 (Stress) were comparable and even higher than in other (German speaking) unselected samples. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sauer et al. (2020)</ref> found trait IU scores ranging from 2.36 (Constrained Action) to 2.77 (Vigilance and Stress) during the Covid pandemic. Crucially, the detected associations indicate that even in unselected samples, existing individual differences as well as withinperson variability meaningfully explain variance in indecisiveness and safety behaviors. This being said, future research may strive to replicate the present findings in clinical samples (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Khawaja &amp; Yu, 2010)</ref> or those pre-selected according to their IU scores (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Wroblewski et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Although ESM data afford more conclusions than cross-sectional data by offering insight on the sequence of events, the reported findings are correlational. Ultimately, only experimental manipulations of the predictors included in this study would allow for causal inferences. For example, studies on the effects of pathological safety behavior have had participants carry out these behaviors for several days and observed the effects of these behaviors on subsequent pathology symptoms compared to a control condition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deacon &amp; Maack, 2008)</ref>. Similar designs could be implemented with regard to IU, for example, using the pool of potential safety behaviors collected in this study, and observing their effect on subsequent IU. In a similar vein, IU could be experimentally manipulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Rosser, 2019)</ref> to assess its causal effect on (state) indecisiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rassin, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>For the sake of capturing actual everyday decision making, daily surveys were collected with relatively high frequency during a rather short total measurement period. Consequently, our hypotheses involving a temporal sequence (H3a -c) could only be tested based on one sequence of safety behavior on the first six days and subsequent IU/indecisiveness on the last day. Testing shorter sequences (e.g., safety behavior on one day predicting other variables on the next day) seemed inadequate because the predicted effects of safety behavior cannot be expected to manifest themselves so fast (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deacon &amp; Maack, 2008)</ref>. A survey schedule with a longer total measurement period (possibly with fewer daily measurements to avoid participant burden) would have provided more sequences per participant to test these predictions. However, fewer daily measurements would not have matched the high number of daily decisions we expected based on previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zander-Schellenberg et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Depending on which definition of decision is used, our study did certainly not capture all types of decisions. Although there is no evidence about the actual average number of daily decisions, research on food-related choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Wansink &amp; Sobal, 2007)</ref> suggests that people massively underestimate the number of decisions actually taking place (e.g., the micro-decisions of what, with whom, when, etc. to have dinner vs. the holistic decision of "What to do for dinner"). Having said this, our design choices served the primary goal of testing specific hypotheses. Future research primarily aiming at general insights about decision making might benefit from more frequent but shorter measurements.</p><p>Finally, although the connection to participants' real life is assured through the use of ESM, the data still rely on self-reports prone to typical biases like demand characteristics. It is therefore important to complement the current findings with behavioral data observed under controlled conditions.</p><p>However, building on earlier studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jacoby et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wake et al., 2022)</ref>, but explicitly testing the safety behavior status of IU-related behaviors would be an important addition. The safety behavior items , having proved their usefulness in the present study and preceding research (xxx [masked for peer review], 2023), can be a helpful manipulation check tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The results have some practical implications. They add to the evidence that IU is an important factor in decision making and problems associated with it. Our observations also suggest that safety behavior, at a certain point, is not only costly, but may also contribute to the underlying problem of not being able to handle uncertainty. Accordingly, interventions against indecisiveness might benefit from strengthening uncertainty tolerance and reducing problematic decisional safety behaviors. Even in decision-making areas requiring high levels of precision, for example medical practice, uncertainty is inevitable and its adequate management is crucial <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Simpkin &amp; Schwartzstein, 2016)</ref>. However, more research is needed to confirm causal mechanisms.</p><p>This research also makes several important contributions in advancing the understanding of IU and indecisiveness. First, our findings generally show that these traits are reflected in everyday decision behavior. In fact, this is the first ESM study involving indecisiveness and the first ESM study of general decision making with more than one measurement per day. More importantly, they demonstrate robust relationships between IU, indecisiveness, and safety behaviors in everyday life decision making. Finally, the results suggest that the vicious cycle found for safety behaviors in anxiety disorders may be INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR IN EVERYDAY LIFE 39 applicable to IU and decision making. Although this idea has been proposed theoretically (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007)</ref>, the present data represent the most direct evidence to date. It goes beyond preceding studies due to a convincing operationalization taking into account the defining characteristics of safety behavior, and because our analyses considered the temporal sequence of variables.</p><p>The fact that all predicted relationships were found in real decisions made by an unselected sample is a strong indication of the ubiquity of these relationships. It shows that IU and problematic safety behavior, although often thought of as a clinical constructs, have implications for everyday behavior in non-clinical populations. This appears to be true not only for pathological phenomena, but also for a behavior as common as deciding.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Vigilance and Constrained Action items corresponded to items from Carleton et al.'s (2007) Inhibitory and Prospective subscale, respectively.

Descriptive Statistics for all subscales aggregated across reported decision trials are provided inTable 1.

For example, in reported decision trials and when considering the whole sample, trait IU did not predict the Feeling Forced subscale of safety behavior, b = 0.11, t(223) = 1.47, p = .143. When excluding data from participants stating we should not use their data (sensitivity analysis), trait IU did not predict the Feeling Forced subscale in both reported decision and scenario trials, maximum b = 0.15, t(196) = 1.87, p = .063. Similarly, in the mediation analysis regarding H3c (i.e., preceding safety behavior predicting increased subsequent indecisiveness via increased IU, cf.Fig. 4), the safety behavior Feeling Forced subscale (aggregated across the first six days) was not related to the mediator (i.e., state IU aggregated across the last day) in the full sample, b = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.10; 0.39], or in the sensitivity analysis, b = 0.15, 95% CI[-0.14; 0.37]. For all IU subscales and the safety behavior Feeling Forced subscale, the direct effect of safety behavior on indecisiveness when controlling for state IU remained significant, indicating partial mediation instead of the full mediation found for the total scale scores</figDesc><table /><note>(minimum significant direct effect, b = 0.18, 95% CI [0.02; 0.35]).</note></figure>
