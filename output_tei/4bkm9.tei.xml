			<abstract>
				<p>Survival necessitates a delicate balance between expending effort to obtain resources, and energy conservation. Individual differences in motivation, the tendency to expend effort, play a fundamental role in society, affecting health, education, and economic outcomes. Previous theories explain variations in motivation via dopaminergic function. However, insulin resistance could also alter motivated behaviour by shifting the balance toward energy conservation. In a preregistered experiment, we investigated whether blunted motivational tendencyreduced tendency to exert effort, quantified using economic decision-making models, and previously linked to neuropsychiatric symptoms-is present in type-2 diabetes. We found subjects with type-2 diabetes showed this cognitive signature of blunted motivational tendency, compared to matched non-diabetic controls. Across a large sample with and without diabetes, we found that increasing risk for diabetes linearly predicted blunted motivational tendency. Diabetic patients treated with semaglutide did not show restored motivational tendency. Metabolic ill-health is associated with a shift towards energy conservation, potentially contributing to comorbidity between metabolic disease and mental illness.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Motivation underpins every facet of human behaviour. Higher motivation is associated with beeer outcomes across domains including academic performance, employment status, IQ score and life satisfaction 1 , while reduced motivation (variously termed anhedonia, apathy or avolition) is a key transdiagnostic symptom of neurological and psychiatric conditions including depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and stroke 2 . Patients often describe reduced motivation as being among the most negative impacts on their quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Empirical work suggests a neurocognitive mechanism underpins motivational differences: the integration of costs and benefits during decision-making (effort-based decision-making) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> .</p><p>Growing evidence suggests that motivation and metabolic health are closely linked. Metabolic disorders like type-2 diabetes (T2D) are highly comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders like depression or schizophrenia, and motivational symptoms are postulated to play a mediating role in the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> . An overall shift towards greater energy conservation, manifesting partly as reduced effort expenditure or 'blunted motivational tendency', may constitute a common risk factor across mental and metabolic health. This suggests the existence of an overarching energy regulation phenotype spanning cognitive and physical health disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6</ref> .</p><p>Motivation depends primarily on dopaminergic signalling in the brain, particularly projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral striatum via the mesolimbic pathway . In humans, dopamine D2/3 receptor availability has been shown to correlate with motivational tendency, and dopamine agonists may increase motivational tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7</ref> . Neurons along the mesolimbic pathway also express receptors for insulin. While the effects of insulin on the brain are complex, a main effect seems to be an increase in dopamine release <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8</ref> . As well as enhancing motivation, striatal dopamine has a number of effects relevant to energy homeostasis, including inhibiting appetite and suppressing endogenous glucose production <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9</ref> . By extension, insulin insensitivity could potentially disrupt motivation.</p><p>For instance, empirical work suggests the relationship between depression and blunted motivation is mediated by overweight status, possibly due to elevated rates of insulin resistance 10 .</p><p>A common, effective treatment for diabetes and obesity is the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide. Semaglutide works by augmenting insulin secretion and regulating appetite, but also affects the brain where, like insulin, it targets dopaminergic neurons in mesolimbic pathways 11 .</p><p>It is unclear whether poor metabolic health, like mental and neurological health, is associated with blunted motivational tendency, and whether effective treatments work to ameliorate this blunting. We set out to investigate how a cognitive signature of motivational tendency is affected by metabolic disease and treatment, focussing on T2D and semaglutide. We hypothesised that people with T2D would exhibit blunted motivational tendencies and that this would be restored in patients undergoing semaglutide treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We recruited four study groups, differing in metabolic health and medication status, but matched by age, gender, and physical activity: subjects with T2D taking semaglutide, subjects with T2D not taking semaglutide, non-diabetic control subjects matched on body mass index (BMI), and control subjects with low metabolic risk (including restricting BMI to between 18.5 and 25; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>). Participants completed a gamified effort-based decision-making task online <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12</ref> , as well as self-report questionnaires targeting general health and neuropsychiatric symptoms ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>).</p><p>Using computational modelling, we quantified subject-level parameters governing participants' effort-based decision-making.</p><p>The four study groups did not differ in age, gender, physical activity, and, for the first three groups, BMI <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>.

To obtain subject-level parameter estimates describing participants' effort-based decision-making, we used hierarchical Bayesian modelling to fit six economic decision theory models to the task data (with weakly informative Gaussian priors and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling, implemented in cmdstanr <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> ).

Four aeention check questions were included in the questionnaires to assess questionnaire adherence. This included two easy questions (e.g., "Please answer 'Not at all'") and two harder questions (e.g., "When I am thirsty, spoiled milk is my drink of choice", expected answer: Definitively false). Participants were excluded when failing at least one easy question, or both harder questions (n = 3).</p><p>Further, we excluded participants reporting conflicting data regarding their health or medication status between the screening and the main study session (n = 19), as well as subjects reporting anthropometric data resulting in a BMI more than two standard deviations above the median (n = 5). Taken together, a total of n = 13 participants on semaglutide and n = 12 participants off semaglutide were excluded from analyses.</p></div>

Specifically, participants with T2D exhibited a lower motivational tendency compared to non-diabetic controls. This main result was echoed by our finding that increased risk of diabetes is associated with decreased motivational tendency.Our findings align with a broader framework regarding the brain's involvement in energy regulation. In T2D, reduced sensitivity to insulin could be conceptualised as shifting the body's homeostatic set point, favouring energy conservation over expenditure<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> . Cognitively, this homeostatic shift corresponds to a shift away from effortful behaviour, potentially owing to alterations in dopamine signalling .The cross-sectional nature of this study means we cannot draw any conclusions about whether changes in motivation precede, or are a consequence of, T2D. However, an important implication of our results is the putative existence of a positive feedback loop: decreased motivational tendencies and a behavioural bias towards energy conservation could potentially inhibit behaviours such as physical Further work, ideally a randomised controlled trial on the cognitive effects of semaglutide, will be needed to understand its effects on motivation fully.Our study results should be seen in light of several limitations, the most important of which is that the cross-sectional nature of our study precludes any assessment of a causal relationship between metabolic health and motivation. Based on the results presented here, we would predict participants with poorer insulin sensitivity to show a corresponding shift in motivational tendency.</figDesc><table><row><cell>In summary, we have identified a cognitive signature of diabetes, reduced</cell></row><row><cell>motivational tendency, which may play a part in maintaining or worsening disease</cell></row><row><cell>progression.

As semaglutide's effects on weight loss are mediated by the brain, and through dopaminergic signalling in particular 11 which in turn influences behaviour 2 , we had hypothesized semaglutide would enhance motivation. We were surprised, therefore, to find semaglutide did not significantly affect motivation -in fact, the T2D group on semaglutide had numerically (though not significantly) the lowest motivational tendency across all four groups. We consider two explanations for this result. First, it is possible that despite our group matching approach, sampling differences between T2D subjects on and off semaglutide resulted in systematic differences between the groups. For instance, participants who had been prescribed semaglutide may have had worse glucose control or metabolic health before semaglutide prescription, making them less comparable with our other groups. Note however, that groups were matched carefully on a number of variables including BMI. Alternatively, semaglutide may genuinely have no effect on motivational tendency in T2D.condition increases the risk of subsequently developing the other 16,17 . In future, to beeer understand the possible role of altered cognition and motivational tendency in this bi-directional relationship, one could conduct a longitudinal study measuring motivational changes in effort-based decision-making over time and assess how this relates to metabolic health and risk for diabetes. Additionally, studying changes in effort-based decision-making as T2D patients undergo treatment could also offer valuable insights to the causal relationship between T2D and motivation. Our results indicate this is a promising area of study. Conducting our study online allowed us to access a much larger and more diverse participant population than we could have obtained in person. However, a corollary of this study setup is that we are unable to obtain physiological measures from our participants, limiting us in our ability to infer underlying biological mechanisms.
