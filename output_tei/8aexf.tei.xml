			<abstract>
				<p>Background. Interpersonal problems are common in mental disorders like depression and social anxiety disorder. However, there is a lack of formal models to explain idiosyncrasies in patients&apos; interpersonal functioning. Following modern computational accounts of perception and action, interpersonal experience and behavior results from implicit inference about hidden environmental properties. Methods. We simulate interpersonal decision-making in a &quot;trust game&quot; using a POMDP generative model and active inference. Simulated agents decide to either keep or invest an initial budget to a trustee. If the agents invests, the trustee can cooperate with or exploit the agent&apos;s trust. Agents perform active inference of the context (cooperative vs. hostile) and action selection. By introducing systematic biases to the generative model, we simulate several subtypes of depression and social anxiety. We then collected data of N=25 patients with diagnosed depressive disorders and fit the generative model to the data. Results. Agents with biased expectations or preferences showed idiosyncratic interpersonal inference. They more readily infer to be in a hostile context and avoid investing with the trustee. Biases also affected the total earned rewards, with socially anxious and depressed agents receiving higher average rewards in hostile contexts compared to &quot;healthy&quot; agents (i.e., agents with an accurate-to-optimistic generative model), but &quot;healthy&quot; top optimistic agents showing superior performance in volatile environments. Fitting the model to the data resulted in individual parameters for patients with low symptom scores compared to those with high symptom scores, with group differences particularly in transition dynamics , outcome preferences and prior beliefs. Discussion. Our simulations formalize complex interpersonal phenomena within Active Inference. Interpersonal biases in mental disorders can be formalized and investigated with respect to their functional role. The model has potential applications in psychopathological research, personalized diagnostics, and individualized treatment planning. Further empirical work is necessary to validate the empirical basis and clinical usefulness of formal models of interpersonal decision-making.</p>

Determining whether interpersonal impairments are the cause or consequence of a mental health problem is challenging. It is likely that longitudinal bidirectional relationships exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Beeson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kirchner et al., 2022)</ref>. Impairments in interpersonal experience and behavior predict important clinical outcomes and play a role in the development and maintenance of mental disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Backs-Dermott et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bell et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kirchner et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Quilty et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Tokuda et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Woods et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Upon closer examination, interpersonal symptoms tend to share significant similarities across diagnostic categories. For instance, social withdrawal is common in depressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fernández-Theoduloz et al., 2019)</ref>, and socially anxious individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hudson &amp; Rapee, 2000)</ref>; but also in individuals with chronic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Harris, 2014)</ref>, post-traumatic stress disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Maercker &amp; Horn, 2013)</ref>, or borderline personality disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Liebke et al., 2017)</ref>. It follows that a breadth of different underlying causes may result in commonalities at the level of observable behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gao et al., 2017)</ref>. These commonalities are of particular interest in light of generally high comorbidity rates among mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Conway et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cuthbert &amp; Insel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dalgleish et al., 2020)</ref>. However, meaningful differences in interpersonal experience and behavior can still be identified between-and within diagnostic categories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Joormann &amp; Gotlib (2006)</ref> demonstrated differences between depressed and socially anxious individuals in terms of sensitivity to social stimuli. Also within the spectrum of depressive disorders, different "interpersonal subtypes" can be identified (e.g., "vindictive" vs. "socially avoidant", <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Simon et al., 2015</ref>).</p><p>There is a lack of formal theories or models that can effectively integrate and accurately operationalize the differences and commonalities in patients' interpersonal experiences and behaviors across-and within disorders. We have previously described the theoretical structure and functional form of such a model <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kirchner et al., 2022)</ref>, where we conceptualized impairments in interpersonal experience and behavior as the result of biased implicit inferences about hidden properties ("states") of the environment.</p><p>Individual biases can stem from, for example, divergent probability estimates about the environment, differences in evaluating interpersonal observations or the advantageousness attributed to these observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Promises of Computational Approaches in Mental Health</head><p>The promise of applying formal, normative models to mental health conditions is to identify distinct behavioral or neural phenotypes, or computational assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Karvelis et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Montague et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Formal computational models of clinical phenotypes, coupled with empirical data, may open novel avenues for researching heterogeneity, developing personalized treatments and predicting treatment outcomes . Bayesian accounts of behavior have gained substantial momentum in psychiatry and clinical psychology, reframing mental disorders as caused by aberrant implicit inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Pio-Lopez et al., 2022)</ref>. Bayesian inference has been applied to a wide range of mental disorders, including schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fletcher &amp; Frith, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Haarsma et al., 2022)</ref> and autism <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Palmer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pellicano &amp; Burr, 2012)</ref>, panic disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Maisto et al., 2021)</ref>, social anxiety disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gerrans &amp; Murray, 2020)</ref>, post-traumatic stress disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Linson &amp; Friston, 2019)</ref>, anorexia nervosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barca &amp; Pezzulo, 2020)</ref>, and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barrett et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">M. Berg et al., 2022)</ref>. While conceptually attractive, many theoretical accounts suffer from two crucial limitations. First, they tend to be developed within the boundaries of a specific, categorical diagnosis. Research has shown repeatedly that traditional, categorical nosologies show limited predictive power, arbitrary boundaries between subclinical and clinical expressions of a trait or symptom, and high levels of comorbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kotov et al., 2018)</ref>. Developments such as the HiToP <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kotov et al., 2018)</ref> or RDoC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cuthbert &amp; Insel, 2013)</ref> are moving away from a description of mental disorders by a set of distinct diagnostic categories and towards dimensional perspectives on clinical symptoms and syndromes. Secondly, many studies lack rigorous mathematical operationalizations that allow for computer simulations and a thorough formal evaluation of theoretical assumptions considering data. The Active Inference framework may help address these shortcomings, providing flexible and tractable algorithms for inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Parr et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Active Inference -A Framework to Model Mental Disorders</head><p>Active Inference is a theoretical account of perception, action and learning in complex systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Friston et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Heins et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Parr et al., 2022)</ref>. It is commonly used to model decision-making under uncertainty in cognitive neuroscience, but its application now extend to a wide range of fields and disciplines, including clinical psychology and psychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Benrimoh et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Montague et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Smith et al., 2021)</ref>. Complex behavior under Active Inference results from the imperative to maximize a lower bound on Bayesian model evidence, or minimize variational free energy (VFE). In other words, Active Inference ensures that incoming sensory information is well-explained by an internal, formal model of the world. To effectively navigate and interact with the (interpersonal) environment, agents need to infer its current state and decide what actions to pursue to resolve uncertainty about the environment and obtain preferred observations and outcomes. To accomplish this, it is crucial for the brain to entertain a generative model of its surroundings. A generative model is a formal conceptualization of the processes that generate sensory observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Friston et al., 2016</ref>). The generative model is used to form predictions, such as expectations about an interpersonal environment, which are based on sensory information and prior beliefs. Deviations between sensory information and model predictions can be used to update the generative model. This iterative process ensures that predictions continue to minimize VFE over time. To achieve the optimal balance between trusting prior beliefs or the current sensory information, their respective precision needs to be estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Brown et al., 2013)</ref>. The process of minimizing VFE is thought to underlie perception. Beyond perception, Active Inference offers a solution for action selection that dynamically interacts with VFE-based perceptual inference. Desirable states or outcomes (preferences) are part of the agent's generative model and can be reframed as a type of prior prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Da Costa et al., 2020)</ref>. Actions are selected in a way that makes these predictions more probable. In Active Inference, actions hence ensure that preferred outcomes or states are reached or maintained. Action selection requires minimizing the expected free energy <ref type="bibr">(EFE)</ref> over future states, given a sequence of actions. Policies that lead to preferred outcomes are more likely to be pursued by the agent. Agents are hence equipped to choose proximal actions that lead to the achievement of a distal goal state, i.e., planning-as-inference. Through this, Active Inference offers a computational strategy to solve the explore-exploit dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Heins et al., 2022)</ref>. In Active Inference, the state of the environment is usually modelled as unobservable, or hidden, to the agent. The agent has to infer the hidden state from sensory observations, which are generated by the hidden state in a probabilistic manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Da Costa et al., 2020</ref>). An agent further needs a representation of how, probabilistically, their own actions alter environmental states. This ensures that only such actions are chosen that either resolve the agent's uncertainty (explore) or bring the agent closer to their preferred outcome (exploit). Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have proved to be a convenient choice for generative models in Active Inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Da Costa et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Heins et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>POMDPs model the environment in terms of hidden states, which change dynamically over time as a function of the current state and the agent's actions.</p><p>To summarize, agents perpetually infer the real-world causes of incoming sensory observations. Agents will choose policies, or action sequences, that resolve uncertainty and maximize the likelihood of achieving preferred states. To do this, agents need to estimate how observations relate to hidden states, how hidden states evolve over time, and how their actions impact the evolution of hidden states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuroeconomic Decision-making and Interpersonal Behavior in Mental Disorders.</head><p>Neuroeconomic games are complex and strategic, yet controlled experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Glimcher &amp; Rustichini, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Robson et al., 2020)</ref> that have been utilized to study interpersonal decision-making in both healthy participants and clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(King-Casas &amp; Chiu, 2012)</ref>. In the present work, we focus on trust games, where an agent needs to decide whether to keep or invest a small monetary wage with a trustee.</p><p>If the agent decides to invest, the trustee can decide to cooperate, usually resulting in an increased payout for the agent; or defect, resulting in a loss for the agent. Previous research suggests idiosyncrasies in gameplay behavior in mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(King-Casas &amp; Chiu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Robson et al., 2020)</ref>. In particular, gameplay behavior in individuals with depression and social anxiety disorder is well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Ong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">C. Sripada et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">C. S. Sripada et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Zhang et al., 2012)</ref>. Individuals with remitted major depressive disorder tend to defect less when in the role of the trustee compared to healthy controls, which has been related to a reduced ability to cope with the socio-emotional demands of the trust game <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Ong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Zhang et al., 2012)</ref>. In social anxiety, functional imaging data suggests decreased processing of the opponent's motivation (C. S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Sripada et al., 2009)</ref> and decreased neural responses to a cooperative trustee compared to controls (C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Sripada et al., 2013)</ref>. Additionally, decisionmaking in neuroeconomic gameplay has been associated with important clinical variables. In an exemplary study, individuals with a history of high-lethality suicide attempts were less sensitive to the costs of punishing their partner in a trust game compared to patients with a history of low-lethality suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Szanto et al., 2014)</ref>. Hence, interpersonal decision-making in gameplay allows us to model clinically relevant experiences and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hinterbuchinger et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">King-Casas &amp; Chiu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Robson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Tzieropoulos, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Wang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Active Inference in Interpersonal Decision-making</head><p>Interpersonal contexts are highly complex and recursive. An individual needs to constantly monitor the dynamic actions of another individual, and predict future actions based on prior experiences with this individual or situation to choose appropriate and timely reactions. <ref type="bibr">Moutoussis and colleagues (2014)</ref> equip simulated agents with variational Bayesian message passing and engage in a trust game. They demonstrate that the agents are able to iteratively update beliefs about an opponent and make decisions that maximize reward over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Moutoussis et al., 2014)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Schwartenbeck et al. (2015)</ref> model behavior and neural activity in a neuroeconomic "limited offer" game using Active Inference.</p><p>Participants had to decide whether they would accept a lower offer or wait for a higher one, at the risk of losing any offers if they waited for too long. Active Inference showed superior performance compared to classical utility maximization schemes in explaining participant behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Schwartenbeck et al., 2015)</ref>. Finally, Cullen and colleagues (2018) simulated agents equipped with Active Inference in an artificial game-play environment and demonstrate that agents are capable of forming representations of their environments that help guide research into neurobiological underpinnings of mental disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cullen et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task</head><p>We use a classical economic game to simulate interpersonal decision-making in depression (see <ref type="figure">Figure    1A</ref>). In the trust game (J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Berg et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">King-Casas &amp; Chiu, 2012)</ref>, the agent's task is to play a multi-round investment-return game. In our simplified version, the agent receives a small amount of money in each trial, which they can either keep to themselves or invest their budget with a trustee. The artificial trustee can either keep or return half the multiplied wage invested by the agent. If the trustee decides to return half of the investment (return), the investment is multiplied by three, and split evenly between agent and trustee, leading to a surplus reward created by the joint venture (i.e., the agent invests 0.5 and receives 0.75). If, in contrast, the trustee decides to keep the agent's investment to themselves (defect), the agent loses all their budget to the trustee. In other words, if the agent invests, he can encounter both a return of investment (win) or a loss of their investment (in case the trustee defects). In the simulation, there were two different interpersonal contexts ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. In the cooperative context, the trustee collaborates (i.e., shares the agent's investment) with a probability of = 0.8. In the exploitative, or hostile context, the trustee tends to keep the agent's investment to themselves and shares with a probability of = 0.2. We simulated two games: a cooperative-to-hostile game, where a cooperative phase (t=20) was followed by a hostile phase (t=20), and a hostile-to-cooperative game (t=20 cooperative trials, followed by t=20 hostile trials). To maximize rewards over time, the agent should frequently share with the trustee in cooperative contexts and keep their initial wage in the hostile context. For this, the agent requires an accurate representation of the current context, which they need to infer from observing the trustee's behavior over several rounds of the game. The agent hence needs to solve the dilemma of learning as much as possible about the trustee's intentions (explore) on the one hand and maximizing reward (exploit) on the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Trust Game and experimental design.</head><p>A. The agent receives a budget of 0.50 at the beginning of each trial. The agent must decide to keep or invest their budget. If the agent decides to invest their budget with the trustee, the budget is multiplied by factor 3. The trustee can decide to collaborate with the agent and return half of the tripled budget (0.75), resulting in a larger overall payoff for the agent and the trustee. If the trustee, decides to keep the agent's investment to themselves (defect), the agent does not receive anything.</p><p>B. There were three contexts: cooperative (trustee returns agent's investment in 80% of trials), hostile (trustee returns agent's investment in 20% of trials); and random (50% return of investment when sharing with the trustee).</p><p>In the simulations, we focused on the cooperative-and hostile context and switches between these two, with two types of games: a hostile-to-cooperative game (t=20 cooperative followed by t=20 hostile trials) and a cooperativeto-hostile game (t=20 hostile trials followed by t=20 cooperative trials).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>The simulations were implemented in <ref type="bibr">Python (v. 3.8.3)</ref> and the pymdp toolbox for Active Inference in discrete state spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Heins et al., 2022)</ref>. The game's context can be cooperative ( ( ℎ ) = 0.8),</p><p>hostile ( ( ℎ ) = 0.2) or random ( ( ℎ ) = 0.5). The agent's task is to infer the current context and choose their actions accordingly. If, for example, the agent infers to be in a cooperative context, they should invest their money with the trustee for an increased outcome. If, on the other hand, they infer to be in a hostile context, they should prefer to keep their money. We here simulate 40 trials t of the task, with one context switch after t=20.</p><p>The agent's generative model was determined by four parameters , , and . For a graphical overview of the agent's generative model, see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The matrix, or likelihood, describes the agent's beliefs about the mapping between observations (i.e., defection vs. cooperation) and the hidden state of the environment (i.e., cooperative vs. hostile). For example, an agent might expect to observe a cooperative reaction in a cooperative context with a probability of = 0.8. In this case, the agent's belief is accurate, since the probability of observing a "share" in the cooperative environment is set to = 0.8 in the environment. However, the agent can hold inaccurate beliefs, which we assume to be a central mechanism underlying mental disorders.</p><p>The , or transition matrix, comprises the agent's beliefs about the evolution of the hidden states over time, given the present state and their own actions. If, for example, the agent infers to be in a cooperative context, they may believe that this context is stable and expect to remain in a cooperative state in the next timestep with a probability of = 0.9. The matrix parameterizes all possible state transitions.</p><p>The vector formalizes the agent's prior preferences over outcomes. In the trust game, a "win" after engaging in a joint venture with the trustee may be the preferred outcome, whereas a "loss" of their investment after the trustee defects is the least preferred outcome. In the following, "win" here refers to the multiplied return on investment the agent receives when the trustee shares the amount previously invested by the agent.</p><p>Finally, the vector contains the agent's prior beliefs over hidden states, i.e., the agent's beliefs about states at the start of the game. An agent may for example believe that the cooperative, hostile or random state are equally likely, assigning a probability of ( = ) = 0.333 to each context. We now introduce the first agent, a healthy-to-optimistic agent, with a detailed explanation of the underlying generative model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Healthy agent.</head><p>We first developed a healthy-to-optimistic agent with a generative model close to the probability structure of the generative process (i.e., the environment). Their observation model consisted of three matrices: (1) the reward observation model 1 , containing the agent's expectations about reward outcomes associated with each context, (2) the behavior observation model 2 , i.e. the agent's internal mapping between the context and the expected behavior of the trustee, and (3) the choice observation model , which maps the agent's executed action to the expectation about the sensed action.</p><p>The healthy agent's reward observation is here reported separately for observing a certain outcome given they have decided to share with the trustee:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 = ( . 9 . 15 . 5 ) ⏟ , ( . 1 . 85 . 5 )} ⏟ . ℎ</formula><p>For example, when sharing in the cooperative context (first row), the agent expects to observe a return of their investment ( ) with a probability of . 9, and to observe a as a consequence of the trustee defecting with a probability of . 1.</p><p>In contrast, when the agent decides to keep their budget, they deterministically observe their initial budget as outcome. Note that this relationship remains the same for all subsequent agents.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1. 1. 1. )} ⏟ . ℎ</formula><p>The agent's behavior observation model is equivalent to the agent's reward observation model above, with the exception that it connects context and trustee behavior. There are three possible trustee behaviors to be observed: return, defect, and unknown.

All procedures were in line with the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review boards of the Philipps-Universität</p><p>Marburg and Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen (reference number #2022-10k). The data reported here were collected as part of a larger study (pre-registration: https://aspredicted.org/see_one.php) A total of N=23 patients participated in the trust game and were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. In the hostile-to-cooperative condition, participants played with a trustee who returns their investment with a relatively low probability (p=0.2) for t=30 trials, followed by a cooperative phase in which the trustee returns the patients' investment with a higher probability (p=0.8). In the cooperative-to-hostile condition, patients first interacted with cooperative trustee for t=30 trials, followed by t=30 trials of playing with more hostile trustees who return the patient's investment relatively rarely. In a third condition, the trustee's behavior was random, i.e. determined by coin-flip in each trial. Participants first received written instructions about the game. They were instructed that they will be playing with other participants who are currently online. The experimental paradigm was equivalent to the simulated task ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) with two exceptions. Firstly, participants were instructed that they are playing with a real trustee via an online platform, and jittered waiting times were introduced between trials and after a share action in line with the cover story. Secondly, participants played 60 trials of the trust game, each of which was with one of 10 possible trustees which were introduced with a code name. In the end, the participant received 50% of the monetary amount earned in the game as a financial compensation for their participation.</p><p>After completing the game, patients filled out several clinical and demographic surveys, including the <ref type="bibr">Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck et al., 1988)</ref> which will be used in the current analysis to group patients into high-and low depressed individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimization.</head><p>We fit the model to the behavioral data of participants playing the trust game using optimization, with the goal of obtaining a set of individual parameters , , , and for each participant. We introduced as a free parameter which determines the weighting between hedonic (reward-oriented) and epistemic (information-oriented) drives by scaling the update especially to parameter after observations. This was done to obtain more behaviorally flexible strategies during the model fitting and initialization during the fitting. The parameters obtained through the optimization best capture actual participant behavior, yielding computational-level approximations of the participant's generative model while performing the task.</p><p>For the optimization, we defined a cost function</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">= ∑ • ( ) + (1 − ) • ( 1 − 1 − ) =0</formula><p>where are the normalized behavioral responses in trial ( = 1 indicates a share action, or investment by the agent; and = 0 indicates that the agent keeps their budget):</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">= ∑ = 1 ∑</formula><p>are the probabilities of "share", or invest, choices obtained from running the active inference model with optimized parameters. Minimizing is equivalent to finding parameters that yield simulated actions as close as possible to the observed actions , which enter in normalized form . In other words, minimizing identifies parameters of the generative model that result in the best possible match between simulated-and empirically observed actions.</p><p>The objective function was used to find the optimum of 15 parameter distributions in total, with 3 parameter values for , six parameter values for , three parameter values for and two parameter values for , the exact number of parameters required for the simulation. We furthermore introduced parameter , which was used to weight hedonic (reward-oriented) vs. epistemic drives by scaling the The whole procedure was performed 10 times per participant to account for the stochastic variance in the minimization scheme, and the run with the lowest cost is chosen for each participant. The optimization was performed at the Marburg High Performance Computing Cluster 3 (MarC3). Results of the optimization were used to analyze group differences in generative model parameters between patients scoring low on the BDI (mild depressive symptoms) and patients scoring high on the BDI (moderate to severe depressive symptoms; median split and minimal/ maximum score split, defined by scores that lie one standard deviation above-or below sample median score). We furthermore investigated potential parameter differences between individuals who played a hostile-to-cooperative game vs. a cooperative-to-hostile game. Finally, we ran a series of simulations with the optimal parameters of the patients with the least-and most severe depressive symptomatology, respectively. For this, the parameters obtained from the optimization were inserted in the agent model and twenty runs each of a cooperative-to-hostile and a hostile-to-cooperative game were simulated.</p></div>

During a long series of observing returns on their investment, the agent forms a precise posterior belief about being in a cooperative context (max. (context = cooperative) = 0.95). After the context switches to hostile, this agent accurately infers to be in a hostile context (max. (context = hostile = 0.89). Any individual returns on their investment leads to a large posterior belief to be in a cooperative context again, which is reminiscent of an optimism bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bracha &amp; Brown, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Sharot, 2011)</ref>. After observing several defects, the agent adopts a more careful behavioral strategy and starts avoiding the investment.

Note that the posterior belief (context = hostile) becomes less certain with each "keep" action, resulting in a drive towards exploration. When the context switches to a cooperative one, the agent quickly returns to precise posterior beliefs about being in a cooperative context and interacting with the trustee.</p></div>

The healthy agent (i.e., an agent with an optimistic-to-accurate generative model of the task) playing the trust game, first in a cooperative context (blue background, epochs 0-20), followed by a hostile context (red background, epochs 20-39). After observing returns from the trustee (blue triangle), the agent is confident that they are in a cooperative context. When the switch to a more hostile context happens, the agent's posterior belief switches and they believe to be in a hostile context, but their behavioral strategy switches relatively late in the time series.</p><p>B. Similar as A, but the game starts with a hostile context, followed by a cooperative one. While the agent quickly believes to be in a hostile context and starts to adapt their behavior accordingly, they continue to explore, which allows them to detect the switch to a more cooperative context after 20 timesteps.</p><p>Depression in our models results from a combination of processes, comprising pessimistic prior beliefs about context ( ), pessimistic beliefs about the future ( ), and decreased reward sensitivity ( ). We simulated two sub-types of depression, simulating perturbations in the generative model that are in line with the literature on depression.</p><p>Depression: reward-insensitive and pessimistic. The first model of depression (reward-insensitive and pessimistic) holds a generative model which compared to healthy 1) assumes cooperative contexts to be more volatile compared to hostile contexts; 2) a relative insensitivity to rewards, and 3) a higher prior belief to be in a hostile context. When first observing the trustee return their investment, the agent does not accurately infer a cooperative context (max. (context = cooperative) = 0.68). In the example of  <ref type="figure">30</ref>). When faced with the cooperative context first, the fatalistic agent comes to the precise posterior belief to be in the cooperative context (max. (context = cooperative) = 0.9), and they continue to interact with the trustee. After observing defects in the hostile context, the agent increasingly avoids the interaction with the trustee. Their belief to be in a cooperative context drops close to (context = cooperative)≈0.05. When in the hostile context first, they accurately infer to be the context's nature.</p><p>However, the agent continues to explore the trustee's behavior and correctly infers a cooperative context to be more likely after observing returns on their investment.</p></div>

Individual defects by the trustee cause spikes in the posterior belief to be in a hostile context. The agent here furthermore avoids the interaction before the context switch, and this behavioral strategy remains rigid for the rest of the time series.</p><p>B When starting in a hostile context, the agent makes a few negative experience when investing with the trustee and as a consequence their posterior belief to be in a hostile context approaches p(context=hostile)=0.95. The agent shows a mixture of continued exploration of the trustee behavior and avoidance during the hostile context. After the context switches, rigid avoidance behavior is adopted after an individual defect by the trustee. B The fatalistic agent, when first exposed to a hostile context, correctly infers its nature and begins to avoid investing with the trustee. However, due to continued exploration, the agent registers the context switch. Individual defects in the cooperative context influence the agent's posterior beliefs drastically compared to the healthy-tooptimistic agent <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> Socially anxious interpersonal inference.

This agent's observational model is marked by a more ambiguous mapping between observations and the corresponding context ( ). The agent further believes that the context dynamics will develop towards random or unpredictable contexts ( ) and an increased focus on loss avoidance ( ). A random and a positive context are believed to be more likely a-priori than a hostile context ( ). When first immersed in a cooperative context, the agent infers the random context to be the most likely cause of observing returns of investment ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6A)</ref>.

In a hostile-to-cooperative game, reward is maximized by the healthy agent (mean reward = 29.42). The Type 1 -insensitive and pessimistic depressed agent received the lowest reward in this setting (mean reward = 18.47). We further investigate average rewards outcome of the healthy-to-optimistic agent compared to the depressed and socially anxious agents in a longer time series (T=120 with 12 context changes; see supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 33</ref> for details). In a longer series (T=120) with more volatile context dynamics, the healthy agent outearns the depressed-and socially anxious agents <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 35)</ref>.</p><p>The healthy-to-optimistic agent further observes the highest overall number of win outcomes in both the cooperative-to-hostile game (average total wins = 19.5; <ref type="figure">Figure 9A</ref>) and in the hostile-to-cooperative game (average total wins = 16.5; <ref type="figure">Figure 9B</ref>). The least absolute number of wins is observed by the Type 2 -trauma and defeat social phobia agent in both settings (cooperative-to-hostile: 5.9 average total wins; hostile-to-cooperative: 0.4). Average net wins (i.e., absolute number of wins -absolute number of losses) in a cooperative-to-hostile context are maximized by the Type -insensitive and pessimistic depressed agent (average net wins: 8.64) as a function of their lowered threshold to avoid investing with the trustee compared to the healthy agent (average net wins: 1.5). The Type 1 -depressed agent however also observes the worst win-to-loss ratio in a hostile-to-cooperative game (average net wins = -5.2). The healthy agent observes the most favorable win-to-loss ratio in the hostile-to-cooperative game (average net wins = -0.65).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we report a series of simulations in which an artificial agent engages in a classical trust game and fit this model to behavioral data from outpatients with depression playing the game. Using Active Inference, the agents infer the interpersonal context from the trustee's behavior. We developed agents in which several biases are combined to simulate depression and social anxiety and finally Pessimistic priors and fatalistic beliefs about the temporal dynamics of hidden states were at the core of the depressed agents' generative models. In line with this, individuals with depression show a variety of pessimistic interpretation biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Everaert et al., 2017)</ref>, pessimistic tendencies such as learned helplessness and low self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Seligman, 1972)</ref> and potentially a lack of interpersonal skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Segrin, 2000)</ref>. A lack of reward valuation and pessimistic prior beliefs may also relate to a reduced motivation to engage with their environment in patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fernández-Theoduloz et al., 2019)</ref>. In the trust game, the depressed agents earned significantly less compared to healthy agents during a hostile-to-cooperative series. However, the depressed agents outcompete the healthy agent in a cooperative-to-hostile series.</p><p>Here, the depressed agents switch to an avoidant behavioral strategy soon after the context switch. The healthy agent's optimistic beliefs about their environment and their strong motivation to win a joint reward keeps them from adopting an avoidant strategy, even after observing a series of defects. In the trust game, avoiding the trustee's decision is an intelligent strategy in a hostile context. However, this strategy comes at the expense of potentially missing a switch to a cooperative context, explaining why the depressed agents earn significantly less compared to the healthy agent in the hostile-to-cooperative series. Our simulation supports the idea that in some environments, depression may be an adaptive response that protects the individual from exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Prins et al., 2015)</ref>. However, the optimistic helplessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Seligman, 1972)</ref>, aberrant reward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Lewinsohn, 1974)</ref> or cognitive immunization <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rief &amp; Joormann, 2019)</ref>. Further, some research suggests that individuals with depression show a more realistic interpretation of action-outcome contingencies (depressive realism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dunning &amp; Story, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Moore &amp; Fresco, 2012)</ref>. In line with this, the depressed agents adapt their posterior beliefs over contexts more quickly and accurately and their behavioral strategy switched quicker in hostile contexts, compared to the more optimistic agent in our simulation.</p><p>Depressive symptoms often manifest episodically, with patients experiencing alternating phases of severe and relatively mild symptoms. In Active Inference, episodic courses may be a function of the transition model (or matrix). If individuals believe for example that both hostile and cooperative contexts are relatively stable, then a few negative interpersonal triggers may be sufficient for the agent to infer a stable, hostile state, which can be updated through repeated exposure to positive interpersonal exchanges.</p><p>The "socially anxious" agents focused on risk aversion and showed increased avoidance behaviors.</p><p>Avoidance is a defining feature of social anxiety disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bögels &amp; Mansell, 2004)</ref>, which could be mediated through the combination of loss aversion and pessimistic prior beliefs in Active Inference. The distinction between the two subtypes of social anxiety disorder lies in their prior beliefs about initial states, the temporal dynamics of these states, and the degree to which they are motivated to achieve a positive outcome (i.e., observing a successful collaboration vs. keeping the initial budget and not taking the risk). The avoidance behavior of the insecure-avoidant socially anxious agent is driven by the insecure belief that the environment is random and unpredictable. In contrast, the trauma-and-defeat agent avoids collaborating with the trustee because they hold strong beliefs to be in a hostile environment. The two agents are similar with respect to their behavioral strategies and earned rewards, but the differences in model perturbations may be of crucial importance during treatment. It can be conjectured that cognitive restructuring and social competences training may be the most beneficial to insecure-avoidant agents, while, for example, interpersonal trauma may need addressing in trauma-anddefeat-type patients first.</p><p>In the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiToP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kotov et al., 2018)</ref>, social anxiety disorder and depression are part of the internalizing spectrum, but while social anxiety disorder loads on the "fear" subfactor, depression loads on the "distress" subfactor. In terms of computational transdiagnostic processes, this difference may lie in the preference over outcomes, or the vector. In one of our models for depression (reward-insensitive and pessimistic), social anhedonia is modelled via a reduced preference for positive social rewards. Social anxiety disorder, in contrast, is a function of high levels of risk avoidance, where a disproportionately large weight is placed on risk and loss avoidance.</p><p>Fitting our model to the behavioral data of patients with diagnosed depressive disorder of varying symptom severity yielded optimal values for all parameters of the generative model , , , and weighting parameter . We considered the resulting generative model parameters separately for individuals with high-and low symptom severity and the game sequence they played. Both symptom severity and game sequence affected the parameters of the generative model in a subtle way. The observation model did not differ between individuals with low vs. high symptom severity, indicating that both groups did not differ in their ability to relate a specific outcome to the corresponding context.</p><p>The transition dynamics differed very subtly. More severe symptoms were associated with an increased belief in the stability of the cooperative context, and less stability of the hostile context.</p><p>Furthermore, higher symptom severity was associated with a slightly increased belief of transitioning into a hostile context when the current context was cooperative, and a decreased belief in a transition from a hostile into a cooperative context. Outcome preferences did not differ between median-split patient groups. When considering individuals with minimum-and maximum symptom severity, a slight tendency emerged, suggesting higher symptom severity is associated with lower utility assigned to the social reward (return on investment), slightly more risk aversion, and higher preference for keeping their budget compared to individuals with milder symptoms. Counter-intuitively, more severe depressive symptoms were associated with a heightened prior belief ( ) to be in a cooperative context, and a lower belief to be in a hostile context. Finally, weighting parameter was introduced to govern the weighting of epistemic vs. hedonic drives in the generative model. While differed inter-individually, this variance was not related to symptom severity.</p><p>When equipping the agent-model with the optimized parameters derived from patient data, we could simulate the patient's behavior over several games. We identified idiosyncrasies in the patient's respective decision-making, with mildly depressed patients forming more precise posterior beliefs over the cooperative context, whereas more severely depressed individuals formed higher posterior beliefs over the hostile context. Our approach demonstrates that data-inspired agent models can be useful in simulating patient behavior efficiently for a large number of games and different contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>The model presented here provides starting points for explaining heterogeneity in social experience and behavior among individuals with mental health problems. For the simulations, the parameter specifications were chosen so that they align with the literature, but are ultimately based on theoretical considerations. By fitting the model to behavioral data of patients with depression, we show that parameter distributions can slightly differ between individuals with low-vs. high symptom severity. Of note, these results need to be interpreted with caution. An important goal of the optimization procedure was to demonstrate its feasibility in the context of relatively sparse behavioral data and complex generative models such as POMDPs. We cannot yet determine if these changes in model parameters are unique to depression or similar to those in, e.g., social anxiety, and whether they can account for substantial variance when comparing clinical with non-clinical samples. More data from diverse diagnostic categories (ICD-10 social anxiety, depression) or symptom spectra (HiTOP internalizing spectrum, subfactors fear vs. distress) is required to draw conclusions about the specificity of parameter changes. A limitation is the relatively small sample size, and the lack of a non-clinical control group in the dataset used for model fitting. Future work should aim at collecting data from both diagnosed-and undiagnosed individuals to represent the entire spectrum from mental well-being-to disorder. On the other hand, heterogeneity in model parameters emerged despite the lack of a non-clinical control group, and the boundaries between non-clinical sadness in the general population and depressive disorders are fluent <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Tebeka et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Of note, finding clear and distinct computational phenotypes within a diagnostic category has proven to be extremely challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Karvelis et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Robson et al., 2020)</ref>. The test-retest reliability of the generative model parameters identified in this task is rather unclear. We nonetheless argue that there is value in understanding how changes to the parameters of a generative model influence behavior to inform etiological concepts, instead of basing computational phenotypes on nosological categories. In case transdiagnostic affiliations can be derived from computational models of behavior, there is still very limited research into the reliability and validity of computational markers. A recent meta-analysis suggests that cognitive tasks and computational markers derived from task behavior shows relatively poor psychometric properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Karvelis et al., 2023)</ref>. Longitudinal task batteries may be necessary to equip researchers with the data to disentangle measurement errors, practice effects and state-and traitlike changes in behavior. Further empirical validations of our model may need to consider multiple experiments of interpersonal behavior in tasks with varying degrees of similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We simulated complex interpersonal experiences and behaviors in mental disorders as Active Inference of interpersonal context within a neuroeconomic game. We fit our agent model on behavioral data of participants with diagnosed depressive disorders of varying severity. Our model allows for the simulation of complex interpersonal experiences and behaviors, and enables the operationalization of transdiagnostic and disorder-relevant processes, as well as heterogeneity in social functioning across individuals. Fitting the model to behavioral data can provide more mechanistic insights into biased expectations and assumptions in clinical populations, with implications for personalized diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>Our simulations yield three fundamental insights: (1) different generative models of the environment can result in similar interpersonal strategies, (2) avoidant interpersonal behaviors are adaptive and functionally sensible in exploitative environments and <ref type="formula">3</ref>exploration, which appears to be a crucial characteristic of healthy interpersonal behavior, can lead to losses in some environments; however, on average, it produces the most robust outcome rates in dynamically changing environments. Developing computational phenotypes based on observable behaviors is an important cornerstone of personalized diagnostics and tailored interventions. By fitting our model to the behavioral data of patients, we can obtain approximations to the computations underlying patient's behavioral strategies. Neuroeconomic games offer a relatively naturalistic, yet well-controlled experimental framework. Future research needs to further provide empirical validation of these ideas, ideally within longitudinal, multi-task studies.</p></div>

An inaccuracy in the agent's matrix corresponds to an inability to "connect the dots" between the trustee's behavior and the hidden state. While a healthy agent confidently expects a positive outcome, or win, in a cooperative context, perturbations in the observation model could lead to e.g., a positive interaction being connected to a hostile context. We hence perturbed so</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">that (simplified) ( . 5 . 5 . 5 ) ⏟ , ( . 5 . 5 . 5 )} ⏟ . ℎ</formula><p>Now, the agent's uncertainty when mapping observations to hidden states is very high. A cooperative response by their trustee is related to the cooperative context with = 0.5, but also to the hostile context with = 0.5. In clinical psychology, this may relate to perceptual disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Horga &amp; Abi-Dargham, 2019)</ref> or "cognitive immunization" <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Panitz et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Rief et al., 2022)</ref>, where alternative explanations are found for interpersonal experiences that violate the patient's beliefs about their social surroundings (e.g., "He was nice to me because he thinks that I am a pathetic loser."). It may further relate to a lack of social and emotional skills. In this simulation (observational uncertainty ( )), we further set the prior over hidden states to be maximally uninformative ( : ( = ) = 0.333 per context). Now, the agent believes the cooperative state to be less stable over time ( ( | −1 = 0.5). Instead, the hostile state has increased in stability (p(hostile|hostile) = 0.9). This could translate to an interpersonal pessimism bias, which is frequently observed in patients with depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Liu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Niu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Panitz et al., 2021)</ref>.

The vector determines the agent's preferred observations by placing a high prior probability over desired outcomes and a low prior probability over undesirable ones. An excessive negative weight is placed on losses, compared to a relatively low preference given to the "win" outcome. An agent with such outcome preferences shows inappropriate loss aversion, which may prematurely tip the exploration-exploitation balance towards missing out on valuable epistemic information to avoid a loss. These parameter settings may approximate rejection sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gao et al., 2017)</ref> and risk aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hartley &amp; Phelps, 2012)</ref>.

When introducing an uninformative distribution as the parameter of the generative model as a proxy for high inferential uncertainty, the agent is unable to form precise posterior beliefs about any specific context ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 20A; averaged: Figure 24)</ref>. Their posterior beliefs deviate only slightly from the uninformative prior as a consequence of the agent's inability to connect a specific observation to a context. Any slight deviations from the prior can be attributed to the remaining parameters of the generative model ( , , ) which are equivalent to the healthy-to-optimistic agent.</p><p>The switch to a more hostile context after t=20 leads to a slight decrease in P(context=cooperative), and an increase in p(context=random), but no change in the agent's observable behavior. When starting in a hostile context <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">(Figure 20B)</ref>, the agent's beliefs to be in a hostile context similarly do not deviate much  A. An agent with a biased parameter forms only imprecise posterior beliefs about being in any specific context, compared to an agent with a more accurate generative model (comp. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2)</ref>. Negative experiences have a relatively smaller weight to alter the posterior belief compared to a healthy agent.

However, the agent here avoids interacting with the trustee after 13 timesteps. A. In a cooperative context, the agent with fatalistic expectations (biased parameter) shows a relatively strong posterior belief to be in a hostile context after observing some interspersed defects.

In the negative context, precise posteriors are formed over the hostile context.

When starting in a cooperative context <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">(Figure 21A)</ref>, the agent's posterior belief to be in a cooperative context form slowly compared to the healthy-to-optimistic agent. Individual defects by the trustee impact the agent's beliefs much more strongly than longer series of cooperative observations (e.g. defect in t=4, t3 p(context=cooperative)=.78; t4 p(context=cooperative)=.04). The agent is more uncertain about the context compared to the healthy agent, even after observing a longer series of cooperative actions (max. ( = ) = 0.81). When the context switches, this is reflected in the agent's posterior beliefs (max. ( = ℎ ) = 0.83). However, this belief is not reflected in a more avoidant behavioral strategy. This lack of behavioral adaptation can be attributed to the intact parameter, which assigns a high utility to observing the "win" outcome. When first seeing a hostile context <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">(Figure 21B)</ref>, the agent accurately believes to be in a hostile context (max.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion: transdiagnostic processes</head><p>In the first agent, we targeted the observation model ( , observational uncertainty), by decreasing the certainty with which observations are connected to a specific context. As a consequence, the agent struggled making precise context inferences. Biases to the observation model could be related to "cognitive immunization" techniques, where a friendly interaction is connected to a hostile context <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kube, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Panitz et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rief &amp; Joormann, 2019)</ref>.

The inability to draw "correct" conclusions from a given observation may also be the consequence of a lack of socioemotional skills, a common impairment in clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Nestor et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Segrin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Wolkenstein et al., 2011)</ref>. Many patients further connect positive interpersonal experiences to randomness rather than true benevolence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ewen et al., 2022)</ref>. In conclusion, perturbations to the agent's matrix have the consequence that observations do not have a systematic or sensible effect on state inference.</p><p>Next, we perturbed the agent's transition parameter ( ), introducing fatalistic beliefs. The transition matrix comprises beliefs about the evolution of contexts over time and the agent's action-dependent state transitions. Believing that a hostile context will likely develop into a cooperative one is a computational approximation to the optimism bias in healthy adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bracha &amp; Brown, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Sharot, 2011)</ref>. In contrast, believing that hostile contexts are the norm while cooperative contexts are futile is in line with e.g., hopelessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Liu et al., 2015)</ref>, learned helplessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Seligman, 1972)</ref>, low self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Maier &amp; Seligman, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Niu et al., 2022)</ref>, or interpersonal distrust <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. Empirical data suggests that individuals with depression and social anxiety show deficits in social cognition, mentalization and theory of mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baker &amp; Edelmann, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Nestor et al., 2022)</ref>, which may be a consequence of inaccurate beliefs about the dynamics of interpersonal situations -for example, believing that interpersonal situations will inevitably end in hostility <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lüdtke &amp; Westermann, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Segrin, 2000)</ref>. Supporting the relevance of expectations, recent data suggest that negative expectations drive subclinical depression to a larger degree than actual negative experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lüdtke &amp; Westermann, 2023</ref>). Furthermore, biases in the transition model may be an appropriate operationalization for altered future thinking in depression. A recent meta-analysis suggests a link between depression and the difficulty to imagine specific positive events in the future, which may reduce motivation to engage in any activities, especially given that the ability to imagine negative future events is unaltered in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gamble et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Gaining a joint win is the preferred outcome in healthy individuals. To simulate psychopathological behavior, we manipulated the parameter such that the agent puts an increased weight on avoiding losses instead of maximizing wins. Consequently, the agent explores the trustee's behavior less, and starts avoiding any transactions with the trustee quicker compared to the healthy-to-optimistic agent, which may be a useful method to simulate social anhedonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barkus &amp; Badcock, 2019)</ref>. Several studies suggest aberrant reward valuation and -responsiveness in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alloy et al., 2016)</ref>. On the other hand, perturbations in the parameter could be a proxy for rejection sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gao et al., 2017)</ref> and risk aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hartley &amp; Phelps, 2012)</ref>, by placing an overly strong weight on avoiding the "loss"</p><p>outcome.</p><p>Finally, we manipulated the agent's prior beliefs over contexts <ref type="bibr">( , pessimistic priors)</ref>. Particularly, the agent's generative model comprised the belief that a hostile context is more likely compared to a cooperative context a-priori. Individuals with depression expect to experience higher rates of negative events, and lower rates of positive events <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Thimm et al., 2013)</ref>. Specifically, studies suggest that a lack of positive expectations may be more central to depression than the presence of negative expectations, which is in line with a reduced prior on positive experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Horwitz et al., 2017)</ref>. In psychological terms, perturbations to the parameter may be related to interpersonal distrust <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Poggi et al., 2019)</ref> or trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Mauritz et al., 2013)</ref>. In the simulation, a biased prior belief was overridden by the agent's observations because the other parameters of the generative model (i.e., observation model, transition matrix, preference over outcomes) were intact. Pessimistic prior beliefs may effectively model experience-dependent negative beliefs that normalize in more favorable environments. Deviations in the vector may nevertheless be of relevance for clinical phenotypes, especially in combination with perturbations to other parameters of the generative model.</p><p>A healthy-to-optimistic agent is most flexible in a longer time series.</p><p>An additional supplementary analysis was performed to determine which agent would earn more absolute rewards in a longer simulation with more volatile contexts. The healthy agent outearns all other agents (reward-insensitive and fatalistic depression, and both social phobia agents, see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> in main text). More detailed analyses of exemplary time series reveal that the healthy-to-optimistic agent remains capable of detecting context changes throughout the longer time series, unlike the agents with depression and social phobia. This allows the healthy/ optimistic agent to flexibly maximize rewards, also in a situation with very volatile context dynamics. Exemplary developments of three agent's posterior beliefs during the long time series are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 33</ref>. A healthy-to-optimistic agent updates beliefs to be in a hostile environment quickest.</p><p>Cooperative-to-hostile games reward loss avoidance; hostile-to-cooperative scenarios reward flexibility.</p><p>We computed total earnings in a game with T=40 trials, averaged over 20 games per agent type. Results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 34</ref>. In a cooperative-to-hostile game, the agent with increased loss avoidance, but</p><p>an otherwise intact generative model earns the highest absolute rewards. This may be attributed to their quicker adopting of an avoidant behavioral strategy (see also <ref type="figure">Figure 22</ref>) compared to other agents. In contrast, in a hostile-to-cooperative game, the healthy agent maximizes total earned rewards due to their unique ability to update a precise posterior belief to be in a hostile context compared to all other agent types.</p><p>In a longer time series with more volatile context dynamics, a healthy agent maximizes total earned rewards compared to both agents with depression (type 1 depression: insensitive and pessimistic, type 2 depression: fatalistic) and social phobia (type 1 social phobia: insecure and avoidant, type 2 social phobia: trauma-and-defeat). This can similarly be attributed to the agent's continued exploration despite having formed a precise posterior belief to be in a hostile context (see also <ref type="figure">Figure 33</ref>).</p></div>

The constraints on the parameters set by the nature of the game were maintained in the optimization (constraints on ; a zero probability to obtaining a return on investment when the agent chooses to keep their budget; (win|keep − budget) = 0 etc). The optimization algorithm hence looked as follows: 1. Read participant dataset 2. Randomly initialize the required 14 parameters in logit space within pre-defined bounds 3. Softmax logit parameters and initialize the agent model with parameters and participant data 4. Compute the cost function 5.
