Hierarchical Diffusion Modeling of the Creative Evaluation Process</head><p>Creative ideas are essential for tackling today's problems, from personal obstacles, such as combining work and childcare during a pandemic lockdown, to societal challenges such as climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hennessey &amp; Amabile, 2010)</ref>. It is no wonder that educators are increasingly including creativity in curricula and that managers consider creativity a key skill <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Casner-Lotto &amp; Barrington, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">IBM, 2010)</ref>. Divergent thinking tasks are often used to assess creative ability, the ability to produce original and useful ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barron, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Runco &amp; Jaeger, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Stein, 1953)</ref>. Perhaps the most common divergent thinking measure is the alternative uses task (AUT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Guilford, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Runco &amp; Acar, 2012)</ref>. On the AUT, people are typically asked to come up with as many unusual uses as possible for a given object (e.g., "bath toy" for the object "brick") within a certain time interval. When solving the AUT, two main processes occur: ideation and evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Basadur, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Guilford, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Runco &amp; Acar, 2012)</ref>. Ideation is the "brainstorm" phase where one comes up with ideas, and evaluation is the decision making phase where one judges which ideas are creative enough to pursue (or in the case of the AUT to list as a response). While most research has focused on ideation and how to improve it (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Benedek, Fink, &amp; Neubauer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Forthmann et al., 2019)</ref>, how people evaluate and select ideas is less understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Grohman, Wodniecka, &amp; Kłusak, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Ritter, van Baaren, &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Silvia, 2008</ref>). Yet, in the real world, it only takes one well-selected idea to solve a problem (e.g., the printing press reduced the cost and labor of printing books, thereby increasing literacy and making knowledge more accessible) or disregarding a good idea to lose the battle in innovative business (e.g., Blockbuster vs. Netflix; <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Randolph, 2019)</ref>. In this paper, we take a cognitive modeling approach to fill this gap and study how people decide which ideas are creative or not on the AUT.</p><p>While the standard definition of creativity states that originality and utility are both needed for creativity, individuals may differ in how much they value these two dimensions.</p><p>Previous research has mainly focused on population-level effects and found that people tend CREATIVE OR NOT? 5 to value originality more than utility when judging the creativity of an idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Caroff &amp; Besançon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Diedrich, Benedek, Jauk, &amp; Neubauer, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Runco &amp; Charles, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>However, creativity is a widely used word and regularly discussed by laypeople <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davies, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mueller, Melwani, Loewenstein, &amp; Deal, 2018)</ref>. Consequently, different people may have substantially different conceptions of how important originality and utility are for creativity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Loewenstein &amp; Mueller, 2016)</ref>. For example, some may value utility more than others when judging creativity, and some may even find ideas or products that are not useful more creative (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Haaf &amp; Rouder, 2017</ref> for a discussion of individual differences).</p><p>In order to examine the evaluation phase of the AUT, we focus on the decision-making process of whether an alternative use is creative or not. Previous work on creative idea evaluation has primarily focused on how mental or emotional states, or instructions lead to better judgements of how creative ideas are, whether of people's own ideas or those of others (de Buisonjé, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ritter, de Bruin, ter Horst, &amp; Meeldijk, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Grohman et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Herman &amp; Reiter-Palmon, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Mastria, Agnoli, &amp; Corazza, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Puente-Diaz, Cavazos-Arroyo, &amp; Puerta-Sierra, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Rietzschel, Nijstad, &amp; Stroebe, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Ritter et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Runco &amp; Smith, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Silvia, 2008)</ref>. In contrast, we use a process modeling approach to better understand the cognitive underpinnings of creativity evaluation and apply the commonly used two-choice response time (RT) paradigm from the decision making literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Krypotos, Beckers, Kindt, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Wagenmakers, Ratcliff, Gomez, &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>, here in the form of the Creative-or-Not task (CON-task). For example, given the object "book" one must decide, as fast as possible, whether using it as a "roof tile" is creative (or not). The CON-task stimuli vary on the two dimensions of originality and utility, allowing us to unobtrusively assess individuals' implicit values of originality and utility when judging creativity in the CON-task. Our task is somewhat similar to the creativity evaluation test <ref type="bibr">(Benedek et al., 2016)</ref>, a test to detect individual differences in creative evaluation ability amongst prospective secondary school teachers, as we also present others' ideas on the AUT to participants. However, where their focus was on assessing evaluation ability, we aim CREATIVE OR NOT? 6 to explore the decision-making process and individual differences in implicit conceptions of creativity. As such, responses are not correct or incorrect, but just the respondent's opinion.</p><p>To gain insight into the cognitive basis of the evaluation process, we model CON-task data using the drift diffusion model (DDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Wabersich &amp; Vandekerckhove, 2014)</ref>. The DDM is a cognitive model of the processes during two-choice decisions . The model essentially assumes that people make decisions through noisy evidence accumulation (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Over time, the individual supposedly accrues more and more information about a stimulus to answer a posed question and then ultimately crosses a decision boundary, for example to decide that "Yes, roof tile is a creative use for a book". For every new sample of information, the individual determines whether it is in line with the "Yes" or the "No" decision and thereby sequentially adds new to the old evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Wagenmakers, 2009)</ref>. This information accumulation process ends when a certain threshold of evidence is reached.</p><p>The DDM has commonly been applied to studies of language, perception, or memory retrieval (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ratcliff, 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Ratcliff, , 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Ratcliff, Gomez, &amp; McKoon, 2004)</ref> where participants make simple and fast decisions that are either correct or incorrect (e.g., Is CFREE a word or not? <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Meyer &amp; Schvaneveldt, 1971)</ref>. But it has also been used to model longer, value-based choices where there is no objectively correct response <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hutcherson, Bushong, &amp; Rangel, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Krajbich, Armel, &amp; Rangel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Milosavljevic, Malmaud, Huth, Koch, &amp; Rangel, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Milosavljevic et al. (2010)</ref> showed that the DDM can computationally describe decisions in a binary food choice task. For two-choice decisions where a simple random walk is too simplistic, the DDM might not be complex enough. However, numerous complex decision-making models can be reduced to the DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bogacz, Brown, Moehlis, Holmes, &amp; Cohen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">van der Maas, Molenaar, Maris, Kievit, &amp; Borsboom, 2011)</ref>. Since the cognitive processes underlying creativity evaluation are largely unknown, we believe that the DDM serves as a good starting model for the evaluation phase of the AUT -also due to its useful psychometric properties: the DDM can be linked to the two parameter logistic (2PL) CREATIVE OR NOT? 7 model, a classic item response theory model to measure individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Tuerlinckx &amp; Boeck, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">van der Maas et al., 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, it separates potentially confounding processes related to stimulus encoding or motor control.</p><p>Taking into account both responses and RTs, the DDM allows us to explore the role of speed in creativity evaluation as assessed by the CON-task. The originality and utility of the CON-task stimuli may not only influence decision outcomes, but also decision speed. RTs tend to increase with difficulty . Accordingly, the more clearly creative a CON-task stimulus may be perceived, the faster it would be judged. Since highly original and useful ideas tend to be considered creative, they might be more easily evaluated regarding creativity than medium original ones and they might be judged faster. Using this logic, highly unoriginal stimuli might also be evaluated faster than medium original ones.</p><p>Altogether, this would suggest an inverted u-or even v-shaped relationship between originality and RT. The same might be the case for utility. In this paper, we explore this idea by measuring both decision outcomes and decision speed in the CON-task. As a plausibility check for our cognitive modeling approach, we also examine how well CREATIVE OR NOT? 8 individuals' implicit values and their explicit opinions about the relevance of the two dimensions for creativity are aligned. Furthermore, we investigate whether those who value originality (or utility) also tend to produce more original (or useful) AUT responses, respectively. Regarding the latter, we build on <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Caroff and Besançon (2008)</ref>'s study who found a positive relationship for originality and called for research examining the same for "appropriateness" (i.e., a term often used as synonym for the utility dimension).</p><p>To this end, we conducted two studies. Study 1 is exploratory where we initially fit the DDM model. In Study 2 we validate our pre-registered model from Study 1 and test specific hypotheses based on Study 1's results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Method Bayesian Hierarchical Diffusion Modeling of the CON-task</head><p>The DDM conceptualizes the response process in the CON-task as an interaction of several unobservable cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Vandekerckhove, Tuerlinckx, &amp; Lee, 2011)</ref>. Each of these is represented by a parameter (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). We use the simplest complete version of the DDM comprising four parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Wabersich &amp; Vandekerckhove, 2014)</ref>. First, the model assumes that the decision whether a use is creative or not is initially determined by β, which reflects the a priori bias towards either choice, regardless of stimulus characteristics.</p><p>Applied to the CON-task, this is an initial preference for "Yes, creative" or "No, not creative". Second, according to the DDM, individuals gradually extract and accumulate noisy information from the stimulus regarding its creativity, which in turn determines the drift rate δ, the tendency to respond "creative" or "not creative". Positive values suggest a drift towards the upper boundary and negative ones a drift towards the lower boundary.</p><p>Drift rates around zero suggest that a stimulus is perceived as ambiguous. The higher the absolute drift rate, the easier and faster the creativity evaluation, and the stronger the CREATIVE OR NOT? 9 evidence for the decision. The evidence accumulation ends when either of the two decision boundaries is reached. Third, the boundary separation parameter α reflects the distance between the two response boundaries and can be interpreted as response caution, where more hesitant creativity judges have a greater boundary separation. Finally, the parameter τ refers to the non-decision time. This parameter captures the processes taking place before and after the actual decision process such as stimulus encoding and motor control processes.</p><p>In this paper, the most central DDM parameter is the drift rate. The assumption is that stimulus originality and utility both positively affect the drift rate in that the more original and useful a CON-task stimulus is, the greater the tendency to respond "creative".</p><p>Moreover, the drift rate is the only model parameter that is influenced by stimulus characteristics because the remaining parameters are already set before the creativity evaluation starts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Vandekerckhove et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We estimated the model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lee, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Rouder &amp; Lu, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Vandekerckhove et al., 2011)</ref>, allowing us to examine the data both at the population-level and at the individual-level.</p><p>Hierarchical modeling provides rather conservative estimates of individual differences because it shrinks the individual effects towards the population mean (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Efron &amp; Morris, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Haaf &amp; Rouder, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>We chose Bayesian estimation for three reasons. First, even without a hierarchical extension, applying the DDM to data is computationally expensive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Tuerlinckx, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Extending it hierarchically makes the model quickly intractable when using the frequentist approach of maximum likelihood estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Vandekerckhove et al., 2011)</ref>. Second, Bayesian inference has several advantages such as an intuitive treatment of uncertainty regarding the model parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Wagenmakers, 2009)</ref>. Third, Bayesian hierarchical modeling is the preferred method for small trial numbers as simulation studies suggest that this method can recover individual variation relatively successfully even with small numbers of observations per participant <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Ratcliff &amp; Childers, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Specification</head><p>A detailed and complete model specification of the DDM used in Study 1 and 2 can be found in Appendix A. Here, we describe how we decomposed the drift rate parameter and the hierarchical structure of the model. To explore the influence of originality and utility when judging creativity in the CON-task, we regressed the drift rate on the originality and utility ratings of the stimuli. In both studies, we included random intercepts and random slopes to explore individual differences. Furthermore, because the response times and proportions of "creative" responses vary considerably across the 64 CON-task stimuli, we also included random intercepts pertaining to the stimuli.</p><p>In both studies, we decomposed the drift rate as follows. Let δ (ij) denote the drift rate for the ith participant, i = 1, ..., I, in the jth trial or stimulus, j = 1, ..., 64, of the CON-task, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">δ (ij) = θ δ(i) + φ δ(j) + θ OR(i) z OR(j) + θ U T (i) z U T (j) . The parameters θ δ(i) , θ OR(i) , θ U T (i)</formula><p>, and φ δ(j) reflect the drift rate decomposition.</p><p>Specifically, θ δ(i) denotes the drift rate intercept, representing individual i's drift rate for stimuli with average originality and utility ratings. φ δ(j) is stimulus j's deviation from the drift rate intercept. Furthermore, z OR(j) and z U T (j) are z-scores of the originality and utility of stimulus j. Lastly, θ OR(i) denotes the originality effect, and θ U T (i) the utility effect of individual i on the drift rate.</p><p>For most of the remaining DDM parameters, we also incorporated random effects to examine individual differences. In particular, we allowed the boundary separation and the bias parameter to vary across individuals. However, because in Study 1 we encountered identifiability issues when estimating random effects for β, we fixed the bias at the population level. Another exception is that we constrained the non-decision parameter, τ , to CREATIVE OR NOT? 11 be constant across participants in both studies because interpreting random effects for this parameter has shown to be problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Singmann, 2018b)</ref>.</p><p>To examine the interplay of the DDM parameters across participants, we also allowed the random effects pertaining to individuals to be correlated. As such, we assume that the individual effects are drawn from the same multivariate normal distribution with population</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">means [µ δ , µ θ OR , µ θ U T , µ α , µ β ]</formula><p>T and a variance-covariance matrix Σ, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">                θ δ(i) θ OR(i) θ U T (i) α (i) β (i)                 ∼ Multivariate-Normal                                 µ δ µ θ OR µ θ U T µ α µ β                 , Σ                 .</formula><p>Σ allows for correlations across the random effects pertaining to the individuals. The random effects of the stimuli are orthogonal to the individual random effects. They are also assumed to be randomly sampled from a population distribution (of stimuli),</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ δ(j) ∼ Normal(0, σ δ φ ),</formula><p>where 0 is the mean and σ δ φ is the standard deviation.</p><p>Since we estimated the model in the Bayesian framework, we needed to specify a prior distribution for each parameter. For Study 1, we used weakly informative priors that restricted the parameter space to a plausible range (see Appendix A). For Study 2, we used the insights gained from Study 1 and specified informative priors to test hypotheses in the Bayesian setting. We discuss these prior choices in the Methods, with details in Appendix A.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Guilford, 1967)</ref> used to assess their divergent thinking performance. The name of an object was presented on the screen, and participants had two minutes to type as many creative uses for the object as possible (e.g., the use "bath toy" for the object "brick"). During the session, participants were asked to generate uses for two objects, either "brick" and "fork", "fork" and "paperclip". or "paperclip" and "towel". The pairs were counter-balanced over participants. Generated solutions were listed on the screen and new ones were continuously added. Two independent raters who were unaware of the research questions/hypotheses of this study separately scored participants' answers with respect to originality and utility on a five-point scale (1 = not original/useful, 5 = very original/useful). Invalid responses were coded as 0. To assess interrater reliability, we computed the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 2 . The ICC for the originality scores</p><p>1 The Alternative Uses Task was administered in at least one other study during the six testing sessions but no other study made use of the CON-task.</p><p>2 Since we considered both responses and raters as random effects and considered consistency in ratings more important than absolute agreement, we used a twoway model and computed single score ICCs of the type consistency using the irr package throughout this paper <ref type="bibr">(Gamer, Lemon, &amp; Singh, 2019</ref> .71] for "brick", "fork", "paperclip" and "towel"</p><p>respectively. As performance indicators, we used the mean originality and mean utility score across raters, objects, and responses.</p><p>Creative-or-not Task. Participants completed 64 trials of the CON-task. The instructions were in Dutch and read the following: "In a moment, you'll see other people's answers to the 'Creative Uses task'. We would like to know if you think the answers are creative or not creative. Decide as quickly as you can. We will do this task four times, each time with a different object (such as book). You will be shown 16 ideas for each object." On each trial, they were asked "Do you think this use for [object] is creative?", followed by a specific use. Importantly, participants were not instructed regarding the criteria they should apply when deciding whether they find a use creative or not. RTs as well as responses ("creative" or "not creative") were recorded. Trials automatically counted as missing when</p><p>participants did not answer within nine seconds. The stimuli used had been selected from a collection of AUT responses. Their originality and utility had been independently scored on a scale from 1 to 5 by two creativity researchers. The ICC was 0.88 95%CI [0.80, 0.92] for originality and 0.65 [.49, 0.77] for utility. As stimulus ratings, we took the average originality and utility rating, respectively, across raters. The mean originality rating of the stimuli was M = 2.98 (SD = 1.20), and the mean utility rating was M = 3.37 (SD = 1.07). Stimulus originality and utility were negatively correlated, r = -0.61, 95% credible interval (CrI)</p><p>[-0.91, -0.45], BF 10 = 1.43 × 10 63 . The correlation is representative of the trade-off between compute the ICCs for the AUT objects separately, we used all collected AUT responses during the testing sessions and not only the responses of participants who also completed the CON-task. the two dimensions "originality" and "utility" that is often found in AUT responses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Rietzschel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Runco &amp; Charles, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Importance Ratings of Originality and Utility. After the CON-task, participants indicated, separately, to what extent they thought utility, innovativeness, originality and appropriateness played a role when evaluating creativity (1 = not important at all to 5 = very important).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results Study 1</head><p>The data cleaning is described in Appendix B. The cleaned dataset comprised 293 participants and 17806 trials. The mean RT across participants and trials after excluding data was 1.86 seconds (M edian = 1.61, SD = 0.92). The overall RT distribution is shown in Appendix C. The overall percentage of "creative" responses was 53.83%.

We fitted the DDM using the R package brms  which works with Stan to draw samples from the posterior distribution of Bayesian models <ref type="bibr">(Carpenter et al., 2017)</ref>. We ran 4 chains with 5000 iterations each. 1500 iterations per chain were used as warmup to adapt the sampler. Consequently, our analyses were based on a total of 14000 iterations. 5</p><p>We decided to not allow the bias parameter β to vary across individuals because when we did, the random effects of the bias and drift rate intercept were highly correlated, suggesting identifiability issues. We therefore estimated the DDM with only a population-level bias parameter. The remaining DDM parameters were not affected by this change.</p><p>We performed several model diagnostics procedures and inspected the model fit. There were no signs of non-convergence, with 0 divergent transitions andR values <ref type="bibr">(Gelman &amp; 5</ref> For all analyses, we used R (Version 3.6.1; R Core Team, 2019) and the R-packages BayesFactor (Version Rubin, 1992) below 1.01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Vehtari, Gelman, Simpson, Carpenter, &amp; Bürkner, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, we assessed the model fit using posterior predictive checks (see the online supplementary material). Overall, apart from some misfit in the outer quantiles of the RT distribution, the DDM could reproduce the data quite accurately and appeared to provide an acceptable account of the data.</p><p>Modeling Results. A summary of the estimated fixed and random effects parameters can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 1</ref> and 2, respectively, and a summary table with the random effects correlation parameters in Appendix B.</p><p>Regarding the fixed effects, our main focus of interest was on µ θ OR and µ θ U T , the overall effects of stimulus originality and utility on the drift rate δ. For µ θ OR , the posterior mean was 0.41, and the 95% CrI was [0.31, 0.50]. For µ θ U T , the posterior mean was 0.10, and the 95% CrI was [0.00, 0.19]. Both posterior means were positive. However, while the 95% credible interval (CrI) of µ θ OR did not include zero, the CrI of µ θ U T was very close to zero.</p><p>In general, all estimated posterior means of the remaining fixed effects parameters seem plausible as the CrIs were rather narrow and the parameters lie within a reasonable range (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 1</ref>). On average, there was no a-priori bias towards the response options "creative" or "not creative" (see µ β in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 1</ref>). This suggests that participants were on average equally likely to choose either of the two response options before stimulus onset.</p><p>However, the boundary separation, or response caution, was higher than found in most applications of the diffusion model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Matzke &amp; Wagenmakers, 2009</ref>, see µ α in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>One explanation for this rather high value is that the RTs in the CON-task were considerably slower than RTs in tasks typically modeled by the diffusion model.</p><p>We found substantial individual differences in all variability parameters. Notably, the results showed substantial variability across participants in the originality and utility effects on the drift rate. The posterior means of σ OR and σ U T were 0.23 and 0.19, respectively. The posterior means and credible intervals of all variability parameters are listed in suggesting that, at the very least, for some individuals, the effect of stimulus originality on the drift rate was weaker and for some it was stronger.</p><p>Participants further differed in their utility slopes. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3B</ref>, for some, the utility effect on the drift was around zero, for some it was positive, and for a few the effect was even negative. Specifically, the majority of the individual CrIs (n = 207; 70.65%)</p><p>included zero, 80 (27.30%) of them excluded and were above zero, and 6 (2.05%) individual</p><p>CrIs excluded and were below zero.</p><p>Individual differences also manifested themselves in a negative correlation between the originality and utility slopes. Here the posterior mean of ρ σ θ OR σ θ U T was -0.44, 95%CrI <ref type="bibr">[-0.60, -0.27]</ref>, and the correlation between the individual originality and utility slopes, based on the posterior means, was r = -0.67, 95%CrI [-0.73, -0.61], BF 10 = 6.33 × 10 37 . It is expected that r is greater than ρ because ρ σ θ OR σ θ U T is a population parameter taking uncertainty into account and r reflects the data in our sample. The greater the individual effect of stimulus originality on the drift rate, the smaller the effect of stimulus utility and vice versa. This correlation could also be explained by the substantial negative correlation between the originality and utility ratings for the CON-task stimuli (r = -0.61). We ruled this out by re-estimating the DDM when excluding the stimuli that contributed the strongest to the negative correlation. Specifically, we excluded the data from 20 items leaving us with  random effects parameters can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table A1</ref> in Appendix D. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4B</ref> further depicts two clusters that are the results from an exploratory k-means cluster analysis: it seems that one cluster comprises individuals with a positive effect of utility and a rather small effect of stimulus originality, and the other one individuals with a stimulus utility effect around zero and a positive effect of originality.</p></div>

In Study 2, we therefore specified hypotheses based on Study 1's results as well as previous research and re-fitted the DDM on an independent dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>Based on what we had learned from Study 1 and based on previous research, we expected positive effects of stimulus originality (H1) and stimulus utility (H2) on the drift rate. We also expected the effect of stimulus originality to be larger than the effect of stimulus utility (H3). Furthermore, given the observed substantial negative correlation between the individual stimulus originality and utility effects in Study 1, we expected a CREATIVE OR NOT? 20 negative correlation among those effects in Study 2 (H4). Specifically, we hypothesized that the greater an individual's effect of stimulus originality on the drift rate, the smaller the effect of stimulus utility would be and vice versa. Since in Study 1, we observed substantial individual differences in the extent to which stimulus originality and utility influenced the drift rate, we also expected non-zero variability across individuals in those effects (H5a and H6a).</p><p>Previous research suggests that originality plays a superior role in creativity judgments compared to utility (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Caroff &amp; Besançon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Diedrich et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Runco &amp; Charles, 1993</ref>). Based on these findings, we tested the hypothesis that everyone would have a positive effect of stimulus originality on the drift rate (H5b). Note that in Study 1, a few participants seemed to have a negative effect of originality. However, because this finding concerned only few participants and because we were not aware of any theory or research supporting it, we did not consider it robust enough to inform Study 2. Instead we decided to quantify the evidence for the ordinal constraint that everyone has a positive effect in Study 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Haaf &amp; Rouder, 2017</ref>. Regarding the effects of stimulus utility on the drift rate, we expected that some individuals would have a positive effect, some a negative effect, and some no effect (H6b). Given Study 1's results, we also expected that individuals' stimulus originality and utility effects would be positively associated with their self-reported importance ratings of originality and utility for creativity. More specifically, we expected individual originality effects on the drift rate would increase as the self-reported importance ratings of originality increase (H7a), and individual utility effects on the drift rate would increase as the importance ratings of utility increase (H7b).</p><p>Finally, we specified hypotheses regarding the association between CON-task judgements and AUT performance. We expected that originality scores on the AUT would be positively correlated with stimulus originality effects and negatively correlated with stimulus utility effects on drift rates (H8a and H8b). Similarly, we expected that AUT utility scores would be positively correlated with stimulus utility effects on CON-task drift rates CREATIVE OR NOT? 21 and negatively correlated with stimulus originality effects (H9a and H9b). Note that Study 1 did not support H9a and H9b. However, in both cases, we did not consider the evidence for the null to be convincing. Based on common sense, we still expected that the more useful one's AUT responses are, the more one values utility when judging creativity and the more one disregards originality -also since studies suggest that the more creative someone is, the better they are at judging creativity (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Benedek et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Silvia, 2008)</ref>. Study 2 served as a robustness check for this belief.</p></div>

The overall proportion of "creative" responses was 0.57. The mean RT for "creative" responses was 1.62 s (SD = 0.78). For "not creative" responses, this was 1.63 s (SD = 0.79).

All posterior samples were greater than zero. Therefore, the evidence in favor of H1 can be regarded as greater than 14000. In contrast, there was mere anecdotal evidence for an effect of utility on the drift rate, the Bayes factor was 1.88.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we aimed to study the cognitive basis of how people decide whether an idea is creative or not during divergent thinking. Divergent thinking is a two-phase process where people come up with ideas (ideation phase) and decide whether or not to use them (evaluation phase; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Basadur, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Guilford, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Runco &amp; Basadur, 1993)</ref>. We focused on the evaluation phase and used Bayesian cognitive modeling to better understand it. Using a novel application of the drift diffusion model (DDM) we aimed to understand how people weigh the two components of creativity, originality and utility, when deciding whether an idea is creative or not. We used the Creative-or-Not (CON) task, a timed two-choice decision-making task, where people are presented with ideas of how to use an everyday object (e.g., use a book as a roof tile) and then decide whether these are creative or not. The CON-task stimuli varied on how original and how useful they were (e.g., using a book to read is useful, but not original, whereas using a book as roof tile can be both). This way we could estimate individual differences in how originality and utility implicitly contributed to people's creativity judgements by examining their effect on the DDM drift rate parameter.</p><p>The drift rate represents people's tendency to respond "creative" or "not creative". The higher its absolute value, the greater the accumulated evidence for creative-or-not decisions, and the faster the response. Our main findings were: (1) stimulus originality strongly influenced participants' tendency towards creative responses (i.e., the drift rate), whereas stimulus utility was only somewhat related to it;</p><p>(2) there were large individual differences in how much participants took the originality and utility of presented ideas into account (i.e., varying individual effects of stimulus originality and utility on the drift rate); (3) participants' implicit tendencies or values of originality and utility on the CON-task were aligned with their self-reported importance ratings of originality and utility for creativity; (4) alternative uses task (AUT) scores for originality and utility coincided with how much the originality and utility of the presented CON-task idea weighed in on their decisions. We now CREATIVE OR NOT? 33 discuss each of these results in more detail.</p><p>Our finding that people value originality when evaluating creativity, evidenced by a substantial overall effect of originality on DDM drift rates, are in line with previous studies showing that people associate originality more so than utility with creativity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Caroff &amp; Besançon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Diedrich et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Runco &amp; Charles, 1993)</ref>. In both studies, the utility of ideas was only somewhat related to participants' tendency towards creative responses. In earlier work we also see that utility, or one of its creative synonyms (e.g., appropriateness, value) is less valued when it comes to judging creativity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Diedrich et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>However, despite the considerably smaller effect, a Bayesian model comparison supports our proposed model and suggests that utility matters when evaluating the creativity of ideas 10 .</p><p>Future work with the CON-task could include additional information about presented ideas, such as "surprise" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Boden, 2004)</ref> and "impact" <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1996)</ref>, to examine how these components implicitly influence people's creativity judgments.</p><p>Interestingly, just as researchers sometimes disagree on the definition of creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Simonton, 2018)</ref>, the homogenous group of psychology students in our study also varied greatly in their conceptions of creativity. We found both quantitative and qualitative individual differences in how they valued originality and utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Haaf &amp; Rouder, 2017</ref>.</p><p>Originality was usually important, but a few people seemed to regard original stimuli "not creative". Regarding utility, there were large individual differences too. Some participants seemed to value utility, a few rated any useful idea as "not creative", and some appeared to disregard it entirely. Moreover, the implicit values were negatively correlated (although in Study 2 we partly attributed this association to the stimulus correlation): the more participants valued originality, the less they valued utility when judging creativity. Future <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We conducted a Bayesian model comparison using Bridge sampling (not pre-registered; <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Meng &amp; Wong, 1996)</ref> where we compare our original model to a model that has neither an overall nor a random utility effect on the drift rate. We found extreme evidence for our original model over the model without any utility effects. We report this analysis in the supplementary materials. We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CREATIVE OR NOT?</head><p>34 research should look to generalize these results to other populations or types of creativity judgments. For example, adolescents appear to place more value on originality and less on utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Stevenson, 2022)</ref>, so there may be a developmental trend. Also, judging the creativity of AUT ideas is interesting as the task is used so often in psychological assessment and educational assessment (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Benedek et al., 2016)</ref>. But, would the utility of an idea be considered more valuable in real-world situations, for example when judging the creativity of ideas to combat climate change?</p><p>After the CON-task, we asked participants to rate how important they thought originality and utility were for creativity. These self-reported relevance ratings more or less corresponded to their implicit values of originality and utility on the CON-task. For example, those who strongly and explicitly indicated that originality/innovativeness is important for creativity also tended to implicitly value originality in the CON-task. In addition, it appears that the CON-task provides an indirect way to tap into what people consider creative.</p><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Caroff and Besançon (2008)</ref>, our results also showed that the more participants took originality and utility into account on the CON-task, the more original and useful their responses to the AUT were. We cannot talk about causality, but it seems plausible that people's implicit values of originality and utility influence what ideas they produce and how they evaluate and select ideas during divergent thinking, like on the AUT.</p><p>This coincides with findings that the more creative someone is, the better their creativity judgements are, whether its of their own or other's ideas (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Benedek et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Silvia, 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodological Implications</head><p>To our knowledge, this is the first time a mathematical model such as the DDM has been applied to the evaluation phase of divergent thinking. The DDM is generally applied to timed two-choice decision tasks where there is clearly a correct answer, such as lexical decision tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Wagenmakers et al., 2008)</ref>. Therefore, applying the DDM to the CREATIVE OR NOT? 35 CON-task, where there is no correct answer and we are basically assessing what factors influence people's tendency to decide if an idea is creative, is novel. Applying the DDM generally worked well on both studies, suggesting that the DDM might provide a reasonable account of the evaluation process in the AUT. A substantive interpretation of the evaluation process could be that when people judge creativity in the CON-task, they stochastically extract, accumulate, and integrate internal noisy signals about a stimulus' creativity, for example regarding the stimuli's originality and utility (for an interpretation regarding value-based decisions, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Milosavljevic et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Although overall we deemed the model fit to be acceptable, the model predicted slightly more right-skewed RT distributions at the individual level than there were in the data. This kind of misfit suggests that participants responded slower than the model predicted (but also note the predicted longer RTs in the upper quantiles of the RT distribution; see online supplementary materials). Since we explicitly instructed participants to respond as fast as possible, these longer RTs appear necessary for participants to evaluate creativity in the CON-task. The greater need for time is also reflected in a larger than usual boundary separation parameter which can be equated with the discrimination parameter in a 2PL model. It is directly influenced by the time participants have or take to respond <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(van der Maas et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Wickelgren, 1977)</ref>. Longer RTs therefore imply greater discriminatory power of the CON-task stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(van der Maas et al., 2011)</ref>, which is desirable given our aim to study individual differences in creativity conceptions. However, the relatively long RTs might also suggest that creativity evaluation comprises relatively long, possibly sequential decision-making stages where one simple random walk as assumed in the DDM might be too simplistic. On the other hand, the DDM might still be a good enough approximation of the evaluation process as several more complex decision-making models for binary choices boil down to the DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">van der Maas et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the role of RTs in our two studies, decision speed did not vary much across stimulus originality and utility ratings. Accordingly, there was no inverted u-or v-shaped CREATIVE OR NOT? 36 relationship between RTs and stimulus characteristics as one might have expected. At best, there was a tendency for stimuli with higher originality and utility ratings to be answered more slowly. A possible explanation is that the effects of originality and utility on the drift rate (i.e., people's tendency towards deciding "creative") were negatively correlated in both studies. This means that the more participants valued originality, the less they valued utility and vice versa. There appears to be a trade-off where people balance one dimension against the other when judging creativity, which could explain why stimuli with both higher originality and utility were processed more slowly.</p><p>The lacking influence of RTs begs the question of whether the DDM is not overly complex for the CON-task data from our two studies. For example, a hierarchical probit analysis 11 of our data resulted in similar conclusions. It would be interesting to examine whether RT effects are more apparent if participants are given less time (e.g., 3s versus the 9s in this study); especially since in the real-world people sometimes need to make split-second choices about which idea to pursue. Perhaps this would also lead to a better DDM model fit regarding the RT distribution. Also, instructions that emphasize speed more could affect the evaluation process, just as those of quantity or quality affect the ideation phase of divergent thinking (Said-Metwaly, Fernández-Castilla, Kyndt, &amp; Van den Noortgate, 2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This paper demonstrates a new approach to studying the evaluation process during divergent thinking. Our novel application of the drift diffusion model provides a mathematical method to study how people decide what's creative. The results imply that it is important to take both originality and utility into account when examining how people judge creativity. Also, given how conceptions of creativity vary, our findings suggest that when assessing creativity using divergent thinking tasks like the AUT, managers or researchers should clarify what the rating criteria are to provide a fair playing field for all.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendices Appendix A</head><p>This Appendix contains the DDM specification. Model differences between the studies are mentioned where necessary.</p><p>Let Y (ij) denote a response vector of the decision and response time (X (ij) , T (ij) ) for the ith participant, i = 1, ..., I in the jth trial (or stimulus), j = 1, ..., J of the CON task.</p><p>The bivariate data Y (ij) is assumed to be distributed according to a Wiener distribution,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Y (ij) ∼ Wiener(α (ij) , β (ij) , τ (ij) , δ (ij) ),</formula><p>with the four model parameters boundary separation α, bias β, non-decision-time τ , and drift rate δ. The Wiener distribution is a joint density function of deciding whether a use is creative or not, X (ij) , at time T (ij) <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Vandekerckhove et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The double index notation suggests that, in principle, the four parameters may differ across participants, as well as across trials. To reduce model complexity, we constrain the model in several ways. First, we treat all parameters as constant across trials. Second, at the participant level, we allow participants to differ in three out of four parameters, α, β, and δ.</p><p>The non-decision time parameter τ is constrained to be constant across trials as well as across participants (i.e., τ (ij) = τ ), because interpreting random effects for the non-decision time parameter has shown to be problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Singmann, 2018b)</ref>. We treat differences across individuals as random effects, assuming that participants are a sample from a population distribution.</p><p>Our main focus of interest is on the drift rate parameter δ. It is the only model parameter assumed to be influenced by stimulus characteristics because the remaining CREATIVE OR NOT? 38 parameters are already set before the decision-making of whether something is creative or not takes place (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Vandekerckhove et al., 2011)</ref>. To examine the influence of originality and utility when evaluating creativity, we regress δ on the originality and utility ratings of the stimuli. We include random intercepts as well as random slopes to take interindividual variation into account. Furthermore, because the response times and proportions of "creative" responses have shown to vary considerably across the 64 task stimuli, we also include random intercepts pertaining to the stimuli. Mathematically, we express the above described as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">δ (ij) = θ δ(i) + φ δ(j) + θ OR(i) z OR(j) + θ U T (i) z U T (j) . The parameters θ δ(i) , θ OR(i) , θ U T (i)</formula><p>, and φ δ(j) reflect the drift rate decomposition.</p><p>Specifically, θ δ(i) denotes the drift rate intercept, θ OR(i) the originality effect, and θ U T (i) the utility effect of individual i. Furthermore, φ δ(j) is stimulus j's individual deviation from the drift rate intercept. Lastly, z OR(j) and z U T (j) refer to z-scores of the originality and utility ratings of stimulus j.</p><p>In Study 1, the boundary separation parameter has random and fixed effects and the bias parameter is fixed. In Study 2, both the boundary separation and the bias parameter are allowed to vary across individuals. All random effects pertaining to the individuals are correlated in both studies. As such, we assume that the random effects are drawn from the same multivariate normal distribution with variance-covariance matrix Σ, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">            θ δ(i) θ OR(i) θ U T (i) α (i)             ∼ Multivariate-Normal                         µ δ µ θ OR µ θ U T µ α             , Σ             , CREATIVE OR NOT? 39</formula><p>in Study 1, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">                θ δ(i) θ OR(i) θ U T (i) α (i) β (i)                 ∼ Multivariate-Normal                                 µ δ µ θ OR µ θ U T µ α µ β                 , Σ                 , in Study 2.</formula><p>Σ is further defined below.

We use a standard normal prior for the originality and utility effects on the drift rate, θ OR , θ U T ∼ Normal(0, 1), .</p><p>For the remaining fixed effects we use the following weakly informative priors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">θ δ ∼ Normal(0, 1) µ β ∼ Beta(1.3, 1.3) µ α ∼ Normal + (0, 2)</formula><p>τ ∼ Uniform(0, 0.3).</p><p>These prior distributions restrict the parameters to a plausible range. The range of the a-priori bias parameter is from 0 to 1 and the boundary separation is restricted to be positive. The non-decision time generally needs to be smaller than the RTs. We therefore use 0.3 seconds, the minimally required response time (see exclusion criterion II.), for the prior on τ . Note that due to model convergence issues, we increase the upper bound by one millisecond to 0.301 which is the minimum RT in the data.</p><p>For all variability parameters we use the following prior, σ δν , σ δ φ , σ OR , σ U T , σ α ∼ Normal + (0, 0.3).</p><p>Lastly, we place a prior on the random effects correlations concerning the individuals.</p><p>The variance-covariance matrix Σ needs to be decomposed such that we can specify a prior for the correlations only. We refer to the matrix containing the random effects correlations as P. Specifically, Σ can be rewritten as ΦPΦ, whereby Φ is a 4x4 matrix with only the variability parameters on the diagonal, Φ = diag(σ δν , σ OR , σ U T , σ α ), and P is a 4x4 correlation matrix. For example, the correlation between the random originality and utility effects is expressed as ρ σ OR σ U T . We place a Lewandowski-Kurowicka-Joe (LKJ) prior with the shape 3 on P <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Lewandowski, Kurowicka, &amp; Joe, 2009)</ref>, P ∼ LKJ(3).</p></div>

Although we pre-registered to include only data from Dutch native speakers, we retrospectively decided not to exclude data from non-Dutch native speakers as long as they were able to read and respond fluently in Dutch to be as inclusive as possible. Thus, we included all participants who chose to do the Dutch (rather than English) version of the experiment. Participants were required to read an instruction in Dutch in order to do the experiment in Dutch. If they chose the Dutch version, we considered them sufficiently fluent to read and respond in Dutch for our study's purposes where only a few simple phrases had to be read or written in Dutch.</p></div>
