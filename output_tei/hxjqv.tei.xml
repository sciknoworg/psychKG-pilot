			<abstract>
				<p>The repulsion effect occurs when the presence of an inferior option (the decoy) decreases the attractiveness of the option that dominates it (the target), in puzzling contrast to the attraction effect. In this paper, we formally develop and experimentally test a normative account of the repulsion effect. Our theory is based on the idea that the true values of options are uncertain and must be inferred from available information, which includes the properties of other options. A low-value decoy can signal that the target also has low value when both are believed to be generated by a similar process. We formalize this logic using a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model that makes predictions about how the strength of the repulsion effect should vary with statistical properties of the decision problem. This theory can help account for several documented phenomena linked to the repulsion effect, as well as results from new lab experiments. Our results illuminate key drivers of context dependence across both economic and perceptual judgment and sharpen our understanding of when decoys can be detrimental.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The strategic design of choice sets and product lines is a critical component of marketing.</p><p>While the design process frequently assumes that preferences between options are not influenced by the set of alternatives, much work has demonstrated that this context does affect preference. For example, adding a clearly inferior item (the "decoy") to the choice set can make the option which dominates it (the "target") more appealing, a phenomenon known as the attraction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Huber et al. 1982)</ref>. Such context effects have fundamentally shaped research, teaching, and practice in consumer behavior for decades. They have also helped to identify the empirical boundaries of rational choice theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Huber et al. 2014)</ref> and motivated a multidisciplinary search for deeper principles of context-sensitive judgment across marketing, psychology, economics, neuroscience, and biology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Simonson 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">, Tversky and Simonson 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">, Roe et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Hedgcock and Rao 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Bordalo et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">, Trueblood et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Lea and Ryan 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Bhui et al. 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">, Spektor et al. 2021</ref>). Nevertheless, the robustness of the attraction effect has been seriously questioned by recent work, suggesting it may be less common than popularly thought. 1</p><p>Most strikingly, the opposite pattern has been observed, in which the inferior decoy makes the dominating target seem worse-a repulsion effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Frederick et al. 2014)</ref>. The repulsion effect has been documented in preferential choices between consumer goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Frederick et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, Liao et al. 2020</ref>, reinforcement learning paradigms with abstract options <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ert and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lejarraga 2018, Spektor et al. 2019)</ref>, perceptual decisions like picking the largest rectangle <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Spektor et al. 2018)</ref>, and even hybrid tasks with preferential decisions presented using perceptual stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Spektor et al. 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Brendl et al. 2023</ref>. The existence of this phenomenon means that a brand which introduces an inferior decoy option could damage sales of a target product, in contrast to previous marketing research and popular writing which traditionally emphasizes the attraction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ariely 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Orhun 2009</ref>. However, the conditions under which this adverse outcome might occur remain to be identified, making it difficult for managers to know when decoys may backfire, and leading to controversy over the effect. The anomalous yet wide-ranging observation of the repulsion effect indicates the need to investigate an alternate source of context dependence. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Modeling attempts have been confined to mechanical approaches that trace out the process of deliberation, with limited success <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Spektor et al. 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Spektor et al. , 2022</ref>.</p><p>Why does the repulsion effect occur? Some informally propose that inferior decoys may "contaminate" other options with similar attributes. This idea is referred to as the tainting hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Frederick et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">, Simonson 2014</ref>). Yet, despite its intuitive appeal, it is not clear why exactly such a mechanism should exist or what factors should modulate its strength.</p><p>In this paper, we formally develop and experimentally test a normative account of the repulsion effect which can be viewed as a Bayesian formulation of the tainting hypothesis.</p><p>1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Frederick et al. (2014)</ref> found a broad lack of evidence for the effect in 38 studies, including replications of several influential paradigms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Yang and Lynn (2014)</ref> similarly found little reliable evidence of the effect across 91 attempts to produce it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Trendl et al. (2021)</ref> found a precisely estimated null effect in an experiment designed to meet the ideal test conditions laid out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Huber et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>2 As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Spektor et al. (2019)</ref>, the repulsion effect should not be conflated with the similarity effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Tversky 1972)</ref> even though both describe a relative decrease in preference for the target option similar to the decoy. The key difference between the two is that the decoy is plainly inferior to the target in the repulsion effect but of comparable value in the similarity effect. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Spektor et al. (2019)</ref>, in our experiments we see no support for a similarity-effect interpretation as participants prefer the decoy substantially less than the target, and are thus evidently able to distinguish the two.</p><p>Our theory is based on the idea that the true values of options are uncertain and must be inferred from available information, which includes the properties of other options. A low-value decoy can signal that the target also has low value when both are believed to be generated by a similar process. For example, a bad product can signal bad brand quality, indicating that other products from the same brand are probably not as good as they appear. People may likewise draw shared inferences about two restaurants from the same franchise, two job candidates from the same training program, two movies from the same studio, or two fruits from the same basket. We capture this logic in a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Tenenbaum et al. 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Because uncertainty can arise from sources as diverse as limited information, sensory noise, and constraints on cognitive processing, this mechanism applies to both economic and perceptual judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Woodford 2020)</ref>. Even when groups are not explicitly known, people may form inferences about which items were likely generated by the same underlying statistical process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson 1991)</ref>. In this perspective, the repulsion effect may reflect an adaptive function which improves decision quality, because the context provides information that helps to interpret the available options <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(McKenzie et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">, Sher et al. 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Bhui and Dubey 2024</ref>.</p><p>Our theory is consistent with an array of research from marketing as well as cognitive science. Several empirical studies in quantitative marketing use related models to analyze how consumers learn about different products from the same brand or category <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Erdem 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Erdem and Chang 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">, Sridhar et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Ching et al. 2013</ref>. This formally reflects psychological research demonstrating that consumers draw category-based inferences about products <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kardes et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Loken et al. 2008</ref>. More broadly, an expanding body of work in cognitive science fruitfully applies hierarchical Bayesian models to explain judgment in a wide range of domains such as reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr">(Acuña and Schrater 2010, Gershman</ref> and Niv 2015), sensory learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Mathys et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Mathys et al. , 2014</ref>, advice taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Diaconescu et al. 2014)</ref>, motion perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bill et al. 2020)</ref>, moral judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Kleiman-Weiner et al. 2017</ref>), linguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Xu and Tenenbaum 2007)</ref>, and beyond (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Griffiths and Tenenbaum 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">, Tenenbaum et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">, Sharp et al. 2022</ref>).</p><p>3 Our hierarchical cognitive modeling approach should not be confused with either hierarchical Bayesian statistical modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Gelman et al. 2013)</ref> or hierarchical decision making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Tversky et al. 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Evangelidis et al. 2018</ref>. Purely statistical hierarchical models are only meant to capture individual heterogeneity for purposes of improved parameter estimation. They make no direct claims about cognitive principles or processes, even though the mathematical structures we use are the same. The process models trace out a sequence of broad decision strategies taken by an agent to arrive at a choice. They are not specifically about inferential principles, though these could be invoked by the strategies they contain.</p><p>The main contribution of our paper is to rigorously develop a normative account of the repulsion effect. By doing so, we provide a unified explanation for its existence across economic and perceptual domains, and transparently expose the conditions under which it should emerge. Our formulation also enables a sharper specification of what similarity entails, and allows this Bayesian tainting hypothesis to be precisely laid out in a variety of environments. We maximize transparency by deriving closed-form analytical expressions that encapsulate the repulsion effect.</p><p>In what follows, we present our theory and show how it can help account for a number of previous findings, such as the emergence of the repulsion effect in decisions from experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ert and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lejarraga 2018, Spektor et al. 2019)</ref>, the double decoy effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Daviet and Webb 2020)</ref>, the phantom decoy effect <ref type="bibr">Farquhar 1992, Pettibone and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wedell 2007)</ref>, and the non-monotonic impact of decoy distance on the repulsion effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Liao et al. 2020)</ref>. We also conduct four new experiments using hypothetical consumer choice tasks and incentivized value estimation paradigms which demonstrate that the repulsion effect is stronger when the target and decoy are believed to come from the same group and have more correlated values, as predicted by the theory.</p><p>Our work yields several benefits. First, our theory helps to account for empirical variation in the effect observed across past studies and new experiments in a unified way. Second, it enables us to specify a version of the tainting hypothesis in any setting where an appropriate causal model can be written down. Third, it offers a normative rationale for the repulsion effect, linking it with branches of research that explore the adaptive nature of preference construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bettman et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">, McKenzie et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">, Sher et al. 2022</ref>) and apparent cognitive biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Wernerfelt 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Lewis et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Gershman et al. 2015a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">, Lieder and Griffiths 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Bhui et al. 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">, Villas-Boas 2023</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Context Dependence and Inference in Product Evaluation</head><p>The design of product lines and the construction of choice sets have long been analyzed in marketing. When context dependence is incorporated, both academic research and popular discussion on these topics have focused on the impact of the attraction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Kivetz et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Ariely 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Kamenica 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Orhun 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">, Rooderkerk et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, Chen and Turut 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, Narasimhan and Turut 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Herweg et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">, Zheng et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Helfrich and Herweg 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Apffelstaedt and Mechtenberg 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">, Yuan and Xiao 2022</ref>. However, the repulsion effect means that an inferior decoy could negatively affect the target option. Our work clarifies the conditions under which this kind of backfire could happen. 4 Specifically, there must be uncertainty about the true value of the product (e.g., because the product or the consumer is new), uncertainty about the brand or category value (e.g., because the brand or category is new), and the brand or category must be coherent (i.e., products must be thought to have similar properties). Furthermore, because our model applies to perceptual judgment as well, the design attributes considered could include perceptual features like package size in addition to economic ones.</p><p>In this light, the present work is evidently connected to research on umbrella branding.</p><p>Strong empirical correlations have been found between consumer perceptions of products from the same brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Sullivan 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Erdem 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Erdem and Swait 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Bottomley and Holden 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Erdem and Sun 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Erdem et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Erdem and Chang 2012</ref>. Theoretical models have shown how correlation between product values can be credibly signaled by umbrella branding <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Wernerfelt 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">, Miklós-Thal 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">, Moorthy 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">, Wernerfelt 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Keller 2012</ref>, helping to endogenize the type of underlying relationship we suppose is present. Our formulation of how group structure can be inferred from option attributes may advance the quantitative modeling of how consumers learn from similar products or experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Kim 2022)</ref>. This research also contributes to the broad literatures on consumer inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kardes et al. 2008</ref>) and category-based inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Loken et al. 2008)</ref>. For example, our theory formally recapitulates the experimental findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Levin and Levin (2000)</ref> that inferences about the qualities of an incompletely described target product are guided by the qualities of a second, linked product that is more well-defined.</p><p>The decoy's detrimental impact in the repulsion effect raises the question of whether it could occur in a competitive scenario. This could be possible under the conditions outlined above, and might have happened in the cola wars during the early 1990s. Crystal Pepsi was a clear version of Pepsi introduced in 1992 to capitalize on the "clear craze," a marketing fad in which transparent versions of products were created to connote purity. Coca-Cola fought back by coming out with Tab Clear, a clear version of their diet cola Tab, which was considered inferior to the flagship cola products and reportedly meant to fail and sabotage Crystal Pepsi in the process. Tab Clear was marketed as a diet drink, a category that was less popular at the time. Because both drinks were clear colas, the negative perception of Tab Clear supposedly made consumers believe that Crystal Pepsi had similar undesirable qualities. As the former chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola asserted <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Denny 2013)</ref>: "This is like a cola, but it doesn't have any color. It has all this great taste. And we said, 'No, Crystal Pepsi is actually a diet drink.' Even though it wasn't. Because Tab had the attributes of diet, which was its demise. That was its problem. It was perceived to be a medicinal drink. Within three or five months, Tab Clear was dead. And so was Crystal Pepsi." While the only record of this tactic came after the fact from the former executive (who stands to benefit from this narrative) and has not been otherwise corroborated to our knowledge, it usefully illustrates the conditions we proposed for the effect to emerge:</p><p>Crystal Pepsi was a new product and so consumers were not sure how to feel about it, clear colas formed an unfamiliar category so consumers were unsure about their qualities, and consumers plausibly felt that different clear colas had similar latent properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Bayesian Models of Context Effects</head><p>Bayesian principles have been used before to explain contextual preference reversals like the attraction effect. For instance, when decision makers are uncertain about how valuable each attribute is, the presence of a decoy can indicate that the target offers better than fair market value <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Shenoy and</ref><ref type="bibr">Yu 2013, Wernerfelt 1995</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kamenica 2008 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Yu 2018)</ref>. Alternatively, because the decoy is more similar to the target than to the competitor, it may be easier to compare <ref type="bibr">Russo 1969, Markman and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Medin 1995)</ref>, thus providing ordinal information which raises the probability that the target is the best option <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Howes et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">, Natenzon 2019</ref>. Bayesian inference may also be combined with the non-Bayesian assumption that preferences reflect deviations from one's expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Rigoli et al. 2017)</ref>. However, while all of these models appeal to inferential mechanisms not unlike our own, they are designed to generate attraction effects and do not naturally produce repulsion effects. 5</p><p>Our approach is closest to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bordley's (1992)</ref> analysis of context sensitivity in the domain of risky choice (see also <ref type="bibr">Luce and Raiffa 1957, p. 288)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Viscusi (1989)</ref>, he supposes that people do not take stated lottery outcomes at face value, and instead form assessments by adjusting their prior beliefs about lotteries toward the stated outcomes in a Bayesian fashion. He considers how various anomalies including one like the repulsion effect can occur when some lotteries have correlated outcomes (though this connection has gone unnoticed in the literature on repulsion effects to date). For example, suppose a customer at a restaurant must choose between beef, fish, and chicken, and that the quality of only the latter two depend heavily on the competence of the chef. Beef might be preferred to fish when they are the only two options; but if chicken were also available, the presence of both fish and chicken would indicate that the chef is competent since the restaurant would not likely advertise two bad dishes. In that case, the customer's assessment of the fish would improve, leading them to select fish over beef from a menu of all three meals even when they would select beef over fish in the absence of chicken. As in our account of the repulsion effect, the presence of a third item serves as a signal of another item's value, leading to a preference reversal that violates independence of irrelevant alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Luce 1959</ref>). Our formulation would encode correlated outcomes via the hierarchical structure, where the group mean denotes the chef's competence defined as the average quality of the meals they serve. In addition to the many new applications we present here, we move beyond <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bordley (1992)</ref> from a technical standpoint in multiple ways. We allow options to consist of multiple attributes and we derive similarity itself within the model. These advances are important for capturing observed properties of repulsion effects as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A Bayesian Model of the Repulsion Effect</head><p>We lay out our model in a two-attribute setting where the attributes are continuous variables such as numeric ratings of quality or price and the objective function takes on an additive form. Due to the flexibility of the Bayesian framework, our theory can be applied to a much wider set of attribute types and objective functions through appropriate modification of the generative process. We will briefly explore such modifications later in the subsection on Model Extensions.</p><p>Consider an agent evaluating a target option and a competitor in the presence of a decoy; call these T , C, and D respectively. Each option i ∈ {T, C, D} is described by two observable attributes, which we denote by x i,1 and x i,2 (and collectively by x i ). In traditional models of multi-attribute choice with additive utility, the value of an option would be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v i = ω 1 x i,1 + ω 2 x i,2</formula><p>for some coefficients ω 1 and ω 2 that reflect the subjective importance placed on each attribute. In the standard view, agents place intrinsic value on various attributes. Hence, customers might be thought to place a particular intrinsic value on a restaurant with a high quality rating. We propose instead that the observable attributes are merely superficial manifestations of an option's latent properties, and the agent does not have perfect access to the true values of options. In this view, a high quality rating is merely a signal of how good the customer's experience would be. It is noisy, since a high rating does not guarantee a great experience, but it is informative, and helps the customer construct an estimate of value. We take the agent's evaluation to be the expected value of each option conditional on the set of options (defined in terms of their observable</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">attributes), E[v i | x j ∀j].</formula><p>We assume the agent forms evaluations by inverting a hierarchical Bayesian generative model, depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. In this model, options are described by two latent properties as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>-value, v i ∈ R, and what we call "style," s i ∈ R. We define style as a value-orthogonal characteristic that determines the relative balance between attributes 1 and 2, holding value fixed. For example, two restaurants may be equally desirable overall even though one has better service if it is exactly offset by worse food; in our terminology, they have the same value but different styles. Technically speaking, value indicates which indifference curve an option resides on, while style indicates an option's position along that indifference curve. This kind of decomposition has been used before under other names <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Wedell 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">, Rooderkerk et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Berkowitsch et al. 2015</ref>. Although style does not bear directly on value, it will do so indirectly by affecting how similar the target and decoy are judged to be in the absence of explicit labels (see the subsection on Latent Group Inference).</p><p>An option's observable attributes are generated from its latent properties according to a common objective function and corrupted by noise. Specifically, we model this observation noise in two steps, roughly following Shenoy and Yu (2013): we first add Gaussian noise to the option's latent properties of style and value, and then map these noisy variables to attribute space by inverting the objective function. Accordingly, letv</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">i ≡ v i + ε i,v andŝ i ≡ s i + ε i,s where ε i,v ∼ N (0, σ 2 v ) and ε i,s ∼ N (0, σ 2 s )</formula><p>are independent noise terms. With an additive objective function, we thus construct attribute magnitudes such that  x i,2 =v i −ŝ i 2ω 2 . Thus, the attribute magnitudes are increasing in underlying value and differentiated from each other based on style. The denominator stems from our assumption that noise occurs in the latent space, and so the same amount of noise translates into a small difference for attributes that are more important and a large difference for attributes that are less important. We make the assumption that noise occurs in the value-style space for mathematical simplicity, but could suppose that noise directly impacts the attribute level without greatly altering the results. 6 Our construction implies that (</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v i = ω 1 x i,1 + ω 2 x i,2 andŝ i = ω 1 x i,1 − ω 2 x i,2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model Extensions</head><p>Although we made a number of assumptions for clarity, many of them can be relaxed to encompass a wider variety of environments. Many extensions are relatively standard in the Bayesian framework, such as allowing options to have different signal precisions or numbers of signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berger 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Gelman et al. 2013</ref>. Here are several further ways to extend the model and broaden its applicability.</p><p>1. Different objective functions can be used. In particular, value could come from the product of the attributes as with expected utility or Cobb-Douglas preferences</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">, v i = x ω 1 i,1 x ω 2 i,2 or equivalently log(v i ) = ω 1 log(x i,1 ) + ω 2 log(x i,2</formula><p>). This functional form with ω 1 = ω 2 = 1 could also capture perceptual judgments of rectangle size based on the product of width and height. Roughly following <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Shenoy and Yu (2013)</ref>, the objective function in the Cobb-Douglas case can be inverted to find attribute magnitudes such that log </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(v i ) = ω 1 log(x i,1 ) + ω 2 log(x i,2 ) andŝ i log(v i ) = ω 1 log(x i,1 ) − ω 2 log(x i,2 ), which yields x i,1 =v 1+ŝ i 2ω 1 i and x i,2 = v 1−ŝ i 2ω 2 i . Note thatṽ i , v</formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">=g i ] = 1 |{j:g j =g i }| j:g j =g iv j .</formula><p>The computation of group membership must sum over all combinations of options, so</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">P (g | x j ∀j) = P (x j ∀j|g)P (g) g ′ P (x j ∀j|g ′ )P (g ′ )</formula><p>where g ′ iterates over all possible groupings. We may also suppose that the prior probability of a group assignment is given by the Chinese restaurant process <ref type="bibr">(Aldous 1985, Gershman and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Blei 2012)</ref>, a nonparametric Bayesian model which has the capacity to accommodate any number of groups. The prior probability of grouping g is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">P (g | α, N ) = α K Γ(α) K k=1 Γ(|{j:g j =k}|) Γ(N +α)</formula><p>where Γ(•) is the gamma function and α is the concentration parameter that represents how strongly items tend to cluster into large groups. When α = 0, all items will be part of the same group, while in the limit as α → ∞, each item will constitute its own unique group. In the two-item case above, P (g = 2) = α 1+α and P (g = 1) = 1 1+α , so P (g=2) P (g=1) = α. 3. Any number of latent properties or observable attributes may be considered. Let x i be an M -dimensional vector of observable attributes with mth element x i,m , let y i be an L-dimensional vector of latent properties (one of which represents value) with ℓth element y i,ℓ , and letŷ i = y i + ε i be a noise-corrupted signal of the latent properties where ε i ∼ N (0, σ 2 I) denotes noise with an L-dimensional vector of variances σ 2 that has ℓth element σ 2 ℓ . Similarly, suppose y i ∼ N (ỹ i ,σ 2 I) with L-dimensional mean and variance vectors. Assume that x i = Zŷ i for some M × L matrix Z that transforms latent properties into observable attributes, and henceŷ i = Z −1 x i . For example, in the case laid out earlier with</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">M = L = 2, y i = [ v i s i ],ŷ i = v î s i , Z = 1 2ω 1 1 2ω 2 1 2ω 1 − 1 2ω 2</formula><p>, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Z −1 = [ ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 −ω 2 ]. Then E[y i,ℓ |x j ∀j] = y i,ℓ − σ 2 ℓ σ 2 ℓ +σ 2 ℓ (ŷ i,ℓ −ȳ ℓ )</formula><p>whereȳ ℓ is the sample average value ofŷ j,ℓ across members in the same group as i.</p><p>4. An informative hyperprior over values can be incorporated. People may come into a task with an initial bias. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Viscusi (1989)</ref> proposed that an individual's predisposition for optimism or pessimism could color their perceptions of risky gambles. This bias at a higher level might be a fruitful way to model individual differences. Suppose that the decision maker holds a hyperprior over values such thatṽ ∼ N (ṽ,σ 2 v ). Then the Bayesian estimates of the group mean become</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">E[ṽ T | x T ] = σ 2 v σ 2 v +σ 2 v +σ 2 v v T + σ 2 v +σ 2 v σ 2 v +σ 2 v +σ 2 v ṽ (3) E[ṽ T | x T , x D ] = 2σ 2 v σ 2 v +σ 2 v + 2σ 2 v v T +v D 2 + σ 2 v +σ 2 v σ 2 v +σ 2 v + 2σ 2 v ṽ .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>These estimates are biased toward the hyperprior mean, as are the resulting estimates of option value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">E[v T | x T ] =v T − σ 2 v σ 2 v +σ 2 v +σ 2 v v T −ṽ (5) E[ṽ T | x T , x D ] =v T − σ 2 v σ 2 v +σ 2 v v T −v D 2 − σ 2 v σ 2 v +σ 2 v + 2σ 2 v v T +v D 2 −ṽ .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Note that the original solution with an uninformative hyperprior is recovered asσ 2 v → ∞. Moreover, when there is no uncertainty in the group mean,σ 2 v = 0, the decoy has no effect on the estimate of the target value.</p><p>5. Variation may be treated as uncertain. Although we supposed the degree of variation along each dimension at each level was known by the decision maker, people might instead learn about variances based on how items cluster together <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">, Navarro and Kemp 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, André et al. 2022</ref>. This learning would affect the strength of assimilation and inference about latent groups. Such local calibration could help explain how context effects may manifest differently in disparate environments and occur at all scales.</p><p>6. Different attribute types can be analyzed. This flexibility lets us define similarity and apply the tainting hypothesis in a wide range of environments. For instance, options may consist of features which are either categorically present or absent, so options can be represented as binary vectors. In this setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kemp et al. (2005)</ref> have shown how <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Tversky's (1977)</ref> contrast model can be recovered if the feature vectors are generated by a beta-Bernoulli model, demonstrating a link between latent group inference and classic theories of similarity.</p><p>7. Different beliefs about latent group structure may be explored. Such versatility can be useful when describing how judgments may differ across economic markets or perceptual modalities. For example, people might think that in markets, companies strive to create diversified product lines. This belief could imply that products which have overly similar attributes are actually likely to have come from different brands. In theory, this might even produce an attraction-like effect, as the decoy could be grouped together with the competitor to the benefit of the target. Beliefs about market structure could also emerge from strategic equilibria that might affect the information content of the choice set (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kamenica 2008</ref>).</p><p>8. The attraction effect can be incorporated by the inclusion of uncertainty over the relative attribute weighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Shenoy and</ref><ref type="bibr">Yu 2013, Wernerfelt 1995)</ref>. The decoy can provide information about this component of preference in addition to being a signal of overall target value. In the Appendix, we provide proof-of-concept simulations of a unified Bayesian model that yields an attraction-repulsion continuum based on the degree of uncertainty in various parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Decisions from Experience</head><p>A body of work studies the difference between decisions when the attributes of options are explicitly described versus when they must be learned from experience (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hertwig et al. 2004, Hertwig and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Erev 2009)</ref>. For example, an agent may be told that a gamble offers a $10 payoff with a 50% probability, or they may acquire a sample of realized outcomes from which they must estimate these quantities. The resulting estimates may be noisy and distorted in various ways. Ert and Lejarraga (2018) conducted repeated-choice tasks in which participants were either provided with explicit descriptions of risky gambles or had to learn their properties from experience, and observed a repulsion effect only in the latter case. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Spektor et al. (2019)</ref> also observed a repulsion effect in a learning-from-experience task. To accommodate this phenomenon, they extended a basic reinforcement learning model such that representations of options could interact with each other in the updating process. Their augmentation consisted of a mechanism in which similar options (like the target and decoy) tend to inhibit each other, benefiting other options (like the competitor).</p><p>Decisions from experience rely on noisier estimates of value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fox and Hadar 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Through the lens of our theory, this noise should be counteracted by Bayesian regularization toward other options from the same group.

For example, when consumers learn about different products from the same brand or category, there can be Illustration of the repulsion effect in decisions from experience (right) versus decisions from description (left).</p><p>spillover because experience with one product is informative about the quality of the others. Evidence for such correlated learning of option values has been found in abstract reward learning tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acuña and Schrater 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">, Wu et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">, Schulz et al. 2020</ref> and the exploration patterns of fishermen <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Marcoul and Weninger 2008)</ref>, as well as the purchase behavior of consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Erdem 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Erdem and Chang 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">, Sridhar et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Ching et al. 2013</ref>). An inferior decoy would thus reduce the appraised value of the associated target. Note that many previous models encode higher-order relationships in terms of fixed correlation parameters connecting different options. Our model allows these correlations to be derived based on the agent's probabilistic assessment of whether the items were generated by the same latent process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The Double Decoy Effect</head><p>Typical studies on the decoy effect include only a single decoy. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Daviet and Webb (2020)</ref> conducted experiments with preferential choices in which a second decoy superior to the first one was added to the choice set. They observed that the addition of the second decoy made the target less appealing, cancelling out the attraction effect. As the second decoy does not extend the range of attributes beyond the first, this finding is difficult to account for with traditional models of range normalization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Volkmann 1951</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">, Soltani et al. 2012</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Daviet and Webb (2020)</ref>  We provide an alternative (though not mutually exclusive) explanation. In light of our theory, the second decoy provides further information about the group value, and furnishes an additional signal that the target may be worse than it appears. This extra signal should thus further bias the target's estimate downward. It might also increase the tendency to group the target and decoys together because its presence in between the target and the first decoy may contribute evidence that they are part of the same cluster. See <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> for illustration.</p><p>Similar mechanisms have been found to describe a variety of judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Austerweil et al. 2015</ref>). For example, Bayesian models of latent structure can capture the flexibility and speed with which arbitrary social groups and subgroups can be constructed in ways that simple dyadic similarity models cannot, as well as the resulting patterns of interpersonal judgment (Gershman and Cikara 2020). The introduction of an extra person with attributes in between two others has been found to increase the tendency to group those two together and the corresponding degree of social influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gershman et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, Lau et al. 2018</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The Phantom Decoy Effect</head><p>Phantom decoys, different from standard decoys, are typically superior to the target option but unavailable at the time of choice. Despite being dominant rather than dominated, they have been found to increase preference for the target in economic tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Pratkanis and Farquhar 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Highhouse 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">, Pettibone and Wedell 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">, Scarpi 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">, Scarpi and Pizzi 2013</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Farquhar and Pratkanis (1993)</ref> recognized that phantom alternatives may contain information that helps to contextualize the value of other options and can thereby facilitate choice <ref type="bibr">(Fischhoff et al. 1980, p. 124)</ref>. Our theory provides a formalization of this idea. Notice that, aside from the unavailability of the decoy, this phantom decoy effect mirrors the repulsion effect. In the former case, a superior decoy favors the option it dominates;</p><p>in the latter case, an inferior decoy undermines the option that dominates it. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> illustrates the relationship. In our Experiment 1b, described later, we demonstrate that the repulsion effect occurs even when the inferior decoy is a phantom.</p><p>One prominent account of the phantom decoy effect is the similarity-substitution hypothesis, according to which people default to the target option as an effort-saving strategy when the preferred decoy is not available because it is the most similar alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Tversky 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">, Pettibone and Wedell 2000</ref>. Our Bayesian account offers further nuance to this hypothesis. First, it provides an alternative adaptive rationale for similarity-based judgment. Rather than effort minimization, the effect could stem from principles of inference under uncertainty. Second, it provides a refinement of what form similarity takes. Rather than a simple exponential function, similarity can manifest in different ways depending on the generative process assumed by the decision maker. Third, it integrates this similarity judgment into the overall effect of the decoy. This yields new implications for how the strength of the effect depends non-monotonically on the attribute distance between the decoy and the target, in contrast to previous hypotheses which predict monotonic relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Scarpi and Pizzi 2013)</ref>. We elaborate on this non-monotonicity in the next subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Non-Monotonic Effect of Decoy Distance</head><p>Decoys can be close to or far from the target in attribute space, and the strength of the repulsion effect appears to be modulated by this attribute distance. In consumer choice, Illustration of the non-monotonic effect of decoy distance on the repulsion effect. Grayness represents the probability that the decoy is judged to be from the same group as the target. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Liao et al.

That is, preference for the target first declines and then grows again as the decoy becomes more distant. 7</p><p>This non-monotonic effect can occur in our model due to the conjunction of two factors determining the repulsion effect. First, when the decoy is moved farther away from the target, it constitutes a more negative signal. This effect grows linearly in the distance between the target and decoy. Second, the farther away the decoy is, the less likely it was generated by the same process as the target. This effect is decreasing at an approximately logistic-Gaussian rate. The product of these forces yields an initial enhancement of the repulsion effect (when the first force is stronger) followed by a decline (when the second force is stronger). The result is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.</p><p>Such a mechanism has been found to capture analogous patterns in multisensory perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Körding et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">, Sato et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">, Shams and Beierholm 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Cao et al. 2019</ref>.</p><p>People draw causal inferences about whether two sensory cues originate from the same source (i.e., from the same location) or different sources, based on how concordant the cues are and the level of uncertainty in each one. This is why successful ventriloquists, for example, maximize the synchrony between the puppet's facial movements and the sound of their speech. When cues are close together, they are likely caused by the same source, and the best estimate of the source's location falls in between the cues (closer to the more precise signal). When the cues are far apart, they are likely caused by different sources, and the best estimates of the source locations are close to each cue separately. The estimated location of a cue's source is thus nonlinear in the distance between the cues. A similar observation has been made regarding anchoring and hindsight bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Wilson et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Knowledge of an outcome serves as an anchor that pulls recollections toward it.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiments</head><p>Our theory makes novel predictions about the ingredients needed for the repulsion effect to occur. We conducted new experiments to test some of these predictions. First, the decision maker must believe the target and the decoy come from the same group.

Third, observable attributes must be noisy signals of underlying value, and the values of the target and decoy must be meaningfully correlated.</p><p>Accordingly, we ran consumer choice experiments in which we varied group membership, both when the decoy was available (Experiment 1a) and when it was an unavailable phantom (Experiment 1b), and we ran value estimation tasks in which we varied statistical properties of the environment (Experiment 2a) and made the group structure implicit (Experiment 2b). To foreshadow our results, we found that repulsion effects indeed emerged more strongly when the target and decoy were grouped together (even when the decoy was unavailable), when attribute noise was high and value dispersion was low, and when group membership could be more clearly inferred from stimulus attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Experiment 1a</head><p>In Experiment 1a, we explicitly manipulated the group structure underlying the options in a consumer choice setting, either saying that the target and decoy came from the same group, or that the three options came from different groups. This allowed us to test our primary hypothesis that the repulsion effect would occur when people believed that the target and decoy were generated by a similar process. If the repulsion effect did not depend on this belief, there should be no differences in participants' preferences across the two conditions.</p><p>Participants 449 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk using</p><p>CloudResearch. They received a $0.50 participation fee for completing the experiment. To ensure data quality, participants answered an attention check question at the end of the experiment, which can be seen in the Supplemental Materials. A total of 372 participants passed the attention check, and are included in the analyses below. The sample size was determined based on a power calculation which indicated that it would provide 90% power to detect a 3-point shift (corresponding to a Cohen's d of about 0.1 according to pretests) at the 5% significance level assuming 20% exclusion from participants failing the attention check and 2% loss of data from technical glitches, when pooling across all stimuli. The experiment was approved by the local IRB. All participants gave informed consent prior to their participation.</p><p>Procedure Each participant made three hypothetical consumer choices based on stimuli borrowed from existing paradigms: Italian restaurants (adapted from Sen 1998), cans of orange juice (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Ratneshwar et al. 1987)</ref>, and lottery tickets (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Huber et al. 1982)</ref>. Each of these three choices consisted of three different options, with attributes that corresponded to a target, a competitor, and a decoy. The stimulus attributes are listed in the Supplemental Materials. Participants indicated the strength of their preference for the options by splitting 100 points between them. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> shows a screenshot of the task.</p><p>We used a between-subjects design in which participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. Participants in the "same group" condition were explicitly told in all three choices that the target and decoy came from the same brand or were managed by the same group of people; participants in the "different groups" condition were told that all three options came from different brands or were managed by different groups of people.</p><p>This text was emphasized to ensure participants were aware of it. They had unlimited time to answer the questions.</p><p>To counterbalance the target and competitor identity, for each question we designed a separate decoy for each side (randomly assigned to participants), inferior in one dimension.</p><p>This allows us to eliminate the effect of target identity by pooling together data across both decoy sides. Each option had two attributes (e.g., Quality and Price). There were two versions of each stimulus that were roughly matched, a qualitative version with verbally described attributes and a quantitative version with numerically described attributes.</p><p>These versions were randomized within each participant, meaning every participant would face one choice for each of the three stimulus types but could have a mix of quantitative and qualitative versions of each.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Experiment 2a</head><p>The goal of Experiment 2a was to test whether the repulsion effect varies depending on uncertainty in the environment. Specifically, the effect should be stronger when attributes are noisier signals of value and there is little dispersion in the values of members from the same group, meaning there is a high noise-to-dispersion ratio. To precisely control the statistical properties of the environment and measure how this influences the formation of beliefs, we turned to a different paradigm based on value estimation. This task was also incentivized and repeatable, so the same participant could be posed many trials.</p><p>Participants 80 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk using</p><p>CloudResearch. They received a base pay of $1.00 for participation and a performance bonus up to $3.50. To ensure that participants understood the rules, they completed a comprehension check before they were allowed to move on to the main task. Those who failed the check were given the option to try again or review the instructions again, until they correctly answered all the comprehension check questions. The experiment was approved by the local IRB. All participants gave informed consent prior to their participation.</p><p>Procedure Participants were instructed to imagine themselves as gold miners in the Wild West, borrowing task stimuli and aesthetics from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dorfman et al. (2019)</ref>. On each trial, they were shown three mines, and had to provide their best guess of how much gold would be found in each one. Noisy signals of these true values were presented as test samples to inform the estimates, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 12</ref>. Participants were paid based on the absolute error between their guesses and the true values. Two of the mines were shown to be from the same mountain, leading to correlated values, while the third was from a different mountain. We refer to a given one of the first two mines as the "target mine," the other mine from the same mountain as the "decoy mine" (though it is not necessarily inferior to the target), and the mine from a different mountain as the "competitor mine."</p><p>The equivalent of the repulsion effect in this task occurs when the estimated value of the target mine is biased by the signal of the decoy mine.</p><p>All of the values were drawn from a hierarchical distribution similar to the generative model in our theory, with independent draws across trials. The expected values of each mountain were drawn from a discrete uniform distribution ranging between 50 and 150 in increments of 1. The value of each mine was drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to the value of the mountain it belonged to and variance (i.e., dispersion) that depended on the experimental condition. Thus, these values were positively correlated for the two mines from the same mountain. The noisy signals were drawn from Gaussian distributions with mean equal to the mine value and variance (i.e., noise) that again depended on the experimental condition. Values were redrawn in the rare case they fell below 0.</p><p>Participants completed two blocks of 20 trials each. In one block, the standard deviation of the mine values was 15 while the standard deviation of the noisy signal was 5, yielding a low noise-to-dispersion ratio. In the other block, the two standard deviations were reversed, yielding a high noise-to-dispersion ratio. The order of blocks was counterbalanced. Participants received feedback on the true mine values after each trial. To help them become acquainted with the value distributions, we also showed them 10 training examples before each block. Results from Experiment 2a. Regression coefficients from subject-level random effects model are shown with 95% between-subjects confidence intervals. Noise/Dispersion = noise-to-dispersion ratio.</p><p>If the repulsion effect is modulated by the noise-to-dispersion ratio as the theory predicts, the experimental manipulation should affect how participants' guesses rely on the test sample from each mine. When the ratio is higher, participants' estimates of the target mine should rely relatively less on the target mine's own test sample and more on the test sample of the decoy mine. Assuming they know the generative process well enough, they should not rely on the test sample of the competitor mine in any case.</p><p>Exclusions We excluded 11 outlier trials where participants' guesses were 500 away from the test sample, comprising 0.34% of the total trials.</p><p>Results To quantify how participants integrated the various pieces of information, we analyzed the data using a random-effects regression which predicted participants' estimates of the mine values based on the experimental condition, the test values of all three mines, and the interactions between condition and each of these signals, with subject-level random effects for all the regressors. This regression included only the pooled responses for the two mines from the same mountain, as estimates for the other mine would not be expected to have the same pattern.</p><p>The regression results are visualized in <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref> and summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>. When the noise-to-dispersion ratio was high, participants relied relatively less on the target mine's Note: Condition is a dummy variable which equals 1 in the high noise-to-dispersion ratio condition and 0 otherwise. own signal and were influenced more by the decoy mine's signal, as predicted. This result was indicated by a statistically significant negative interaction between experimental condition (a dummy variable equal to 1 when the noise-to-dispersion ratio was high) and</p><p>the target mine test value [t(970.0) = −9.24, p &lt; .001] as well as a significant positive interaction between condition and the decoy mine test value [t(2454) = 4.34, p &lt; .001]. No significant effect was observed for the interaction between condition and competitor mine test value [t(818.5) = 0.50, p = .617], and the competitor test value coefficients were not significantly different from 0 in either condition [t(82.2) = 1.13, p = .261 in the low noise-todispersion ratio condition, and t(81.2) = 1.27, p = .207 in the high noise-to-dispersion ratio condition], indicating no reliance on this unrelated signal. The intercept reflects reliance on the hyperprior, the distribution of mountain values, which had a mean of 100. The increase of the intercept in the high noise-to-dispersion ratio condition [t(1667) = 4.90, p &lt; .001] implies that participants relied more on this hyperprior as well, also consistent with Bayesian principles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Experiment 2b</head><p>In previous experiments, we explicitly told participants the group structure. In Experiment 2b, we withheld information about group membership in order to examine how latent group inference modulates the repulsion effect. To alter this inference, we showed participants the style of each item and varied the level of noise along this value-neutral dimension.</p><p>This allowed us to keep the value distributions intact. We hypothesized that participants would infer group membership based on how similar the styles were in statistical terms, and would use that assessment to guide their guesses of mine values. When style noise is low, mines can be easily assigned to the correct mountains, and their estimated values should be more biased by the other mine from the same mountain.</p><p>Participants 86 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk using</p><p>CloudResearch. They received a base payment of $2.00 for participation and a performance bonus up to $7.00. To ensure that participants understood the rules, they completed a comprehension check before they were allowed to move on to the main task. Those who failed the comprehension check were given the option to try again or review the instructions again, until they correctly answered all the comprehension check questions. To make sure that they paid attention, participants also completed an attention check at the end of each block, which can be seen in the Supplemental Materials. Five participants failed at least one attention check. The experiment was approved by the local IRB. All participants gave informed consent prior to their participation.</p><p>Procedure Similar to the procedure of Experiment 2a, participants were in the role of miners in the Wild West, estimating the values of three mines. However, there were two key differences, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 14</ref>. First, participants were not told which mines belonged to which mountains. They only knew that two out of the three mines were from the same mountain and the remaining mine was from a different mountain. They had to infer which mine was from a different mountain and report their guess; this single response summarizes the entire group structure. Second, instead of mining for gold, participants mined for a mix of red ore and blue ore, which translated into total dollar values. In addition to test samples for each mine (i.e., noisy signals of the true values), they were shown the ratio of red to blue ore found in the sample. Although both kinds of ore had equal value, and participants were informed of this fact, this multi-attribute description could help assign mines to mountains. Participants again received bonus payments based on the absolute error between their value estimates and the true values. Additionally, they received 2.5 cents for every time they correctly identified the mine which belonged to a different mountain.</p><p>The value of each mountain was drawn from a discrete uniform distribution ranging between 100 and 200 in increments of 1. The value of each mine was drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to the value of the mountain it belonged to and a standard deviation of 5. The noisy signals were drawn from Gaussian distributions with mean equal to the mine value and a standard deviation of 15. The styles of each mine were drawn from Gaussian distributions with a mean of −20 (mountain containing one mine) or +20 (mountain containing two mines) and variance depending on the experimental condi-tion, translating into red-blue ratios averaging 0.8 and 1.3. All attribute magnitudes were redrawn in the rare case they fell below 0.</p><p>Participants completed two blocks of 20 trials each. In one block, the standard deviation of the mine styles was 2. In the other block, the standard deviation of the mine styles was 50. The order of the blocks was counterbalanced. Higher style noise would lead to more overlap between the ore ratio distributions of the two mountains. Participants received feedback on the true mine values and the membership of each mine after every trial. To help them become acquainted with the value distributions and the relationship between style and group membership, they were shown 15 training examples before each block. In these examples, they were first asked to make a guess of which mine was from a different mountain based on the test samples with noisy signals and styles, and then the true mine values and mountain assignments were revealed.</p><p>If participants relied on the styles of the mines to help infer latent group structure, then they should make more accurate inferences when style noise is low. Moreover, if the repulsion effect depends on the ability to correctly infer latent group structure, participants'</p><p>estimates of target mine value should rely relatively less on the target's own test sample and more on the decoy mine's test sample when style noise is low.</p><p>Exclusions One participant did not understand the task correctly and entered only 1, 2, or 3 in the guesses of total ore value, so we excluded this participant from our analysis.</p><p>We also excluded the five participants who failed at least one attention check. Data was analyzed from the remaining 80 participants. We attempted to exclude trials where participants' guesses were 500 away from the test sample, as with Experiment 2a, but there were no such trials. We also removed 8 trials where the amount of blue ore was 0 leading to an undefined red-blue ratio.</p><p>Results Participants more accurately identified the mines belonging to each mountain in the low style noise condition (92.5% correct) as compared to the high style noise condition As in Experiment 2a, we analyzed the data using a random-effects regression which predicted participants' guesses of the mine values based on the experimental condition (a dummy variable equaling 1 in the high style noise condition), the test values of all three Competitor mine <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> Results from Experiment 2b.

This regression similarly included only the pooled responses for the two mines from the same mountain.</p><p>The regression results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. When the style noise was high, participants' estimates of the target mine value relied more on the target mine's own signal and were influenced less by the decoy mine's signal, as predicted. These results were indicated by a statistically significant positive interaction between condition and target mine test value [t(151.4) = 5.68, p &lt; .001] and a significant negative interaction between condition and decoy mine test value [t(218.9) = −3.19, p = .002]. Though not predicted by the model in this setting, there was no significant interaction between condition and the test value of the competitor mine [t(139.7) = −1.62, p = .109] or the intercept <ref type="bibr">[t(137.</ref>3) = −1.24, p = .216].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Discussion</head><p>Participants' estimates of target mine value were biased toward the decoy mine signal, especially when noise was high and dispersion was low (meaning their attributes were worse predictors of true value and their true values were more correlated).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>Empirical demonstrations of context-dependent preferences have long been posed as challenges to traditional theories assuming economic rationality. And yet, the instability which so intrigues us is also what makes these phenomena hard to reliably grasp. Context effects still inspire behavioral decision theorists to search for their underlying principles, the stable mechanisms which can consistently explain when they will emerge and when they won't.</p><p>In this paper, we put forth an account of the repulsion effect, a recently documented context effect in which the presence of an inferior decoy option makes the target option which dominates it seem less appealing. It has been observed in both economic and perceptual judgment, and contrasts with the four-decade-old attraction effect. Our theory is based on the idea that the true values of options are only imperfectly signaled by their observable attributes, and thus people must draw upon all available cues to form evaluations. If the target and decoy are believed to have been generated by the same underlying process, the decoy can provide a negative signal about the value of the target. We constructed a hierarchical Bayesian model to formalize this pattern of reasoning. Our model embodies a point made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Simonson (2014)</ref>: "a finding that a moldy orange taints an adjacent (yet nonmoldy) orange and generates repulsion suggests that certain inferior options infect similar options that are susceptible to the same affliction; in contrast, an overpriced, unattractive sweater has no bearing on the quality of a more attractive sweater and merely highlights its superior value. It thus seems that the nature of the relationship between the two adjacent options is one moderator of the resulting effect."</p><p>Past efforts to formally model the repulsion effect have been restricted to sequential sampling models that lay out the dynamic process of decision making, and have struggled to naturally capture the effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Spektor et al. 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Spektor et al. , 2022</ref>. Our normative approach offers a complementary perspective that casts light from a different angle. In the foundational taxonomy of David <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Marr (1982)</ref> from cognitive science, sequential sampling models reside on the "algorithmic" level which emphasizes the process by which a computation is achieved, while ours resides on the "computational" level which foregrounds the adaptive logic of the computation and abstracts away from the algorithm. No formal computational-level theory has been proposed before to explain the repulsion effect. Our goal was to fill this gap by developing such a theory and demonstrating its explanatory power. This perspective lets us view the problem in a way that brings clarity to many aspects. It obscures other aspects by necessity, especially factors in the decision process such as presentation format and timing <ref type="bibr">Cohen 2019, 2021a,b)</ref>, because computational-level accounts are inherently less suited for these than algorithmic ones.</p><p>The Bayesian framework nonetheless lets us flexibly encode many kinds of beliefs by altering priors and likelihoods at various levels of the hierarchy. This affords us a great deal of theoretical power, and allows exploration into the common and distinct properties of decision making across different markets, or across economic and perceptual domains.</p><p>We made several simplifying assumptions to keep our exposition clean, and mentioned a few ways they could be profitably relaxed. Even more extensions may be possible.</p><p>We focused on the repulsion effect for theoretical clarity and to avoid retreading 40 years of historical debate over the attraction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Huber et al. 2014)</ref>. The mechanism we propose is compatible with other sources of context effects. Nonetheless, we hope that our theory can contribute to this dialogue by helping to identify conditions under which the attraction effect may be opposed. Several have argued that ordinal information plays a key role in attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Howes et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">, Natenzon 2019</ref> and that imprecise attribute representations can diminish it by obscuring the dominance relationship (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Huber et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">, Simonson 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">, Spektor et al. 2021</ref>. This can explain why attraction tends to be observed when attributes are concrete and bear little ambiguity, such as price <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Simonson 2014</ref>). However, it has not been recognized that imprecision could also play a central role in the repulsion effect.</p><p>Furthermore, rather than drawing lines between qualitative and quantitative stimuli <ref type="bibr">(Frederick et al. 2014, Yang and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Lynn 2014)</ref> or between perceptual and preferential stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Spektor et al. 2018)</ref>, our theory views them all through the common lens of inference and distinguishes attributes based on inferential uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Spektor et al. 2021)</ref>. Although certain classes of attributes might be generally considered more precise (e.g., numeric versus verbal descriptions), variation can still exist within these classes. For instance, some attributes may be quantitative and yet imprecise, such as abstract quality ratings that are hard to interpret; others may be qualitative and yet precise, such as clear and detailed verbal or visual depictions. Much remains to be understood about how attribute perception depends on the format of presentation.</p><p>The existence of other Bayesian models of context effects suggests that core aspects of these effects may be reconciled through common mechanisms. By virtue of the Bayesian framework, our model could in principle be combined with others into a mega-model that includes multiple kinds of uncertainty and makes predictions about what will happen when all forces are considered in sum. We provide simulations in the Appendix of such a model that generates both the attraction and repulsion effects under different parameter settings.</p><p>This integration highlights the care needed when specifying the role of imprecise preferences in context effects. Inference due to uncertainty in the relative value of attributes fosters the attraction effect <ref type="bibr">(Wernerfelt 1995, Shenoy and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Yu 2013)</ref>, whereas inference due to uncertainty in overall integrated value fosters repulsion. It is thus insufficient to merely allude to preference uncertainty in a generic sense; we must be precise about imprecision.</p><p>Although a full account of context dependence will surely need to incorporate multiple cognitive mechanisms, we believe the elements we have laid out here sharpen our conception of the repulsion effect and constitute a valuable piece of the puzzle.</p><p>The resulting expression resembles equation (A.4), with only the emergence of a multiplier on the repulsion term scaling it by the probability that the target and decoy are thought to be from the same group. This probability can be computed from Bayes' rule, considering the relative probabilities that the two items came from the same generative process or two different ones.

We extend this to also incorporate the possibility that the decoy may belong to a separate indifference curve structure than the competitor and target (ω T,C ̸ = ω D ), for example because it may come from a different market. This yields four possible grouping structures:</p><p>1.ṽ T =ṽ D and ω T,C = ω D 2.ṽ T =ṽ D and ω T,C ̸ = ω D 3.ṽ T ̸ =ṽ D and ω T,C = ω D 4.ṽ T ̸ =ṽ D and ω T,C ̸ = ω D</p><p>As the decoy distance increases, the posterior probabilities of these groups shift, which can reduce the influence of the decoy.</p><p>The combination of inferences is able to produce both U-shaped ( <ref type="figure">Figure B</ref>.3) and inverted U-shaped ( <ref type="figure">Figure B</ref>.4) patterns of preference for the target. Importantly, these arise from the same Bayesian model, just with different parameters. High noise relative to dispersion is required for repulsion (and hence the U-shape), while uncertainty over ω is needed for attraction (and hence the inverse U-shape). The parameters for each simulation are listed below.</p><p>U-shaped effect: ω = 0.5, σ </p><formula xml:id="formula_32">2 v = 1,σ 2 v = 0.5, σ 2 s =σ 2 s = 3, σ x = 3, β = 1, [P (ṽ T =ṽ D , ω T,C = ω D ), P (ṽ T = v D , ω T,C ̸ = ω D ), P (ṽ T ̸ =ṽ D , ω T,C = ω D ), P (ṽ T ̸ =ṽ D , ω</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>relevant dimensions, with restaurant options characterized by the attributes of food quality and service quality.

This difference corresponded to a significant drop in points assigned to the target across conditions [t(1040.3) = −2.92, p = .004], as predicted by the theory.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">Since we only consider the attraction effect in the Appendix, our primary results might be considered necessary though not sufficient conditions for the repulsion effect to emerge on net.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">Though we isolate the repulsion effect in our paper for clarity, in the Appendix we present simulations from a unified model that can produce both effects, by integrating our focal mechanism with that of<ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Shenoy and Yu (2013)</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">We note that there have been mixed results in the literature. For example,<ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Liao et al. (2020)</ref> found an inverted Ushaped effect of decoy distance in perceptual judgment. We conjecture that this pattern could arise from an analogous similarity-based mechanism applied to the attraction effect. Indeed, some have argued that the attraction effect may be modulated by perceived similarity between the target and decoy<ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Mishra et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Izakson et al. 2020</ref>. In the Appendix, we provide simulations that nest both the attraction and repulsion effect in the same Bayesian model, by incorporating inference about the relative values of the attributes and extending latent group inference accordingly. We demonstrate that this model can produce both U-shaped and inverted U-shaped patterns, depending on which aspect of inference is more influential.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8">The posterior belief when the decoy is present is also more precise. Greater precision could increase utility for risk averse agents, as<ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Roberts and Urban (1988)</ref> and<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Erdem (1998)</ref> point out in the context of product branding. While this may be a meaningful factor especially in economic decisions, it would oppose the reduction in mean value we focus on above (leading to attraction), and thus cannot produce a repulsion effect.</note>
