			<abstract>
				<p>People lose tens of billions of dollars a year to financial exploitation in the United States alone. Few studies have examined how preferences for trust and fairness in economic activities may contribute to risk for financial exploitation. Furthermore, few studies have examined the interaction between risk factors. In three studies, we attempt to address these gaps by surveying 1918 demographically and socioeconomically diverse participants to examine putative risk factors for self-reported financial exploitation. We focused on: 1) how trust in others and fairness preferences during economic games are associated with self-reported financial exploitation; and 2) how sociodemographic and health-related factors interact with psychosocial factors to confer risk for financial exploitation. We found participants with lower socioeconomic status and poor emotion regulation skills were at the greatest risk for financial exploitation. We also found associations between greater risk for financial exploitation and poorer physical health, more severe cognitive decline, increased persuadability, and increased insensitivity to trustworthiness cues. Our findings suggest that risk for financial exploitation is dependent upon a combination of psychosocial, sociodemographic and health factors, which may lead to interventions that protect vulnerable individuals.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Financial exploitation, defined as the illegal or improper use of an adult's funds or property for another person's profit or advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Conrad et al., 2010)</ref> , results in annual losses of billions of dollars <ref type="bibr">(Roberto &amp; Teaster, 2011)</ref> . Exploitation of older adults in particular has been recognized as a serious and growing public health problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Deane, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">J. Hall et al., 2016)</ref> . Multiple putative individual risk factors for financial exploitation have been identified within and across sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial domains. These include low income, poor mental health, cognitive decline, poor deception detection, and low social support (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gunderson &amp; ten Brinke, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">James et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kircanski et al., 2018</ref> ; for recent reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hanoch &amp; Wood, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lichtenberg et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Spreng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Walzak &amp; Thornton, 2022)</ref> . However, little is known about the link between financial exploitation and adults' ability to integrate social information during economic decision making, and how this relationship may interact with other identified risk factors. This is a key question to consider, because processing of social/affective information (i.e., others' trustworthiness, intentions, and non-verbal cues) during financial interactions may be an promising intervention target for inoculating vulnerable adults against exploitation attempts, such as individualized psychosocial training (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Epstein et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scholz et al., 2023 )</ref>. Moreover, inconsistent findings across prior studies warrant the need for a comprehensive understanding of risk for financial exploitation that can be validated across cohorts and ultimately translated into actionable interventions to reduce risk. Here, we attempt to fill these gaps by systematically examining the relationships among established and novel risk factors for financial exploitation across three separate community samples of adults.</p><p>The first major gap in our understanding of financial exploitation is the lack of research on social information integration during economic activities as a risk factor. This gap is particularly important given findings that the vast majority of financial exploitation cases are perpetrated by strangers (51%) followed by friends and family (34%) <ref type="bibr">(Roberto &amp; Teaster, 2011)</ref> , suggesting that people's social information integration regarding trust in others and fairness preference may play an important role in shaping victims' economic decisions. Economic games used in studies of behavioral economics (e.g. Ultimatum Game, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Güth et al., 1982 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">the Trust Game, Berg et al., 1995 )</ref> offer an opportunity to directly observe social information integration during financial decision making in the laboratory, and have helped advance understanding of human behavior in economic settings, such as fairness preference and trust in others (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Levitt &amp; List, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thielmann et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2020 )</ref>. However, economic games with different social settings have rarely been studied alongside risk factors for financial exploitation. Additionally, there have been inconsistencies reported in the literature regarding several identified risk factors for financial exploitation. Overall, worse physical health (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wood et al., 2016 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. Acierno et al., 2010)</ref> and worse cognitive functioning (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boyle et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Han, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Roberto &amp; Teaster, 2011)</ref> have been consistently associated with higher risk for financial exploitation. However, socioeconomic status (SES) (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hall et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sur et al., 2021)</ref> , trust in others <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shao et al., 2019 (a)</ref>) , emotion regulation <ref type="bibr">( Shao et al., 2019(b)</ref> ) , and social support <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2021)</ref> have been contradictory. Results from research on age (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">James et al., 2014 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ross et al., 2014)</ref> also did not show that older people are particularly more vulnerable to financial exploitation, contrary to both popular and psychological opinions. One possible explanation for these inconsistent observations of a single risk factor's relationship with financial exploitation might be its potential interaction(s) with other risk factors. While there exists an abundance of research on single factors, in contrast, only a handful of studies have touched upon interactions between two or more of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beach et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weissberger &amp; Bergman, 2022)</ref> .</p><p>Neglecting to examine trust in others and fairness preference during economic games as a risk factor along with interactions between different risk factors limits our ability to comprehensively understand risk for financial exploitation, with downstream limitations on developing effective prevention and intervention programs. The present research addresses these literature gaps in a series of three studies, by examining: 1) how trust in others and fairness preference during economic games may be associated with self-reported financial exploitation (Studies 1, 2 and 3), 2) how the association between socioeconomic status and self-reported financial exploitation may be moderated by health-related and psychosocial factors (Studies 1 and 2), and 3) how sociodemographic and health-related factors moderate the associations between psychosocial factors and self-reported financial exploitation (Study 3). Using three studies, we investigated risk factors across trust in others and fairness preference during economic games, sociodemographic, health-related, and psychosocial domains in three different cohorts. We hope our research contributes to a more comprehensive and reliable understanding of financial exploitation risk to guide healthcare, governmental and financial industries in combating financial exploitation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection and Procedure for All Studies</head><p>All data were collected using Qualtrics panels. The surveys were to participants based on their eligibility and the targeted sociodemographic brackets of each study. Data from participants who failed Qualtrics' internal quality check (e.g., anyone completing in less than half of the median completion time of the "soft launch" during which 10% of the target sample size was collected for Qualtrics' reviewing purposes) and attention checks (e.g., asking participants to "select the 'strongly disagree'") were excluded from a study directly by Qualtrics before sending the final data to us. In each specific analysis we also excluded participants whose data needed for the analysis was not collected due to Qualtrics technical error (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref> to S8 for sample size and measure summary of each analysis). All participants were paid by Qualtrics for completing a survey. All studies were approved by Temple University's Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1 -Risk Factors in an Older Adult Sample from Philadelphia Metropolitan Area</head><p>Given the focus on older adults in previous financial exploitation research (e.g. citation), we first focused on risk factors of financial exploitation within older adults from our local community in Philadelphia, PA, USA. Our primary goals were to identify 1) how trust in others and fairness preference across social context in economic activities may be associated with self-reported financial exploitation, and 2) how the association between socioeconomic status and self-reported financial exploitation may be moderated by health-related and psychosocial factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A sample of local older adults was recruited using Qualtrics panels. Participants were eligible to enroll in the study if they were 50 years of age or older and currently lived in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area. The participants were recruited to be evenly split across brackets of household income ($0-50,000; $51,000K-100,000; $101,000 and above), gender (male, female), and education (no degree; college degree; master's <ref type="table">1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1</ref> degree or above). The final sample included 680 participants. The majority of participants identified as female (57.35%), White (81.18%) and not-Hispanic (96.62%), and ranged in age from 50 to 91 years (M = 62.48) <ref type="table">( Table 1 )</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Questionnaires and scales of sociodemographics, financial exploitation, health, economic decisions across social contexts, persuadability, insensitivity to trustworthiness cues, need to belong, and perceived social support, and emotion regulation were presented to participants were presented to participants. See <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> for summaries of health-related, psychosocial measures and sociodemographic measures. The survey also included several questions and scales that are not for the current study and are not reported here. Participants' average total time to complete the survey is 33.32 minutes.</p><p>Financial exploitation To measure financial exploitation, we used the 30-item Older Adult Financial Exploitation Measure <ref type="bibr">(OAFEM, Conrad et al., 2010 )</ref>. Each item asks the participant to indicate whether a potential financial exploitation experience occurred at any point during the past twelve months, including the present. Responses were coded using a three-point scale (0 = "No", 1 = "Suspected", 2 = "Yes"). The final OAFEM score is a severity-weighted sum across all 30 items (Entitlement Expectation = 1; Lesser Theft &amp; Scams = 2; Major Theft &amp; Scams = 3 ).</p><p>Trust in others and fairness preference To assess participant's trust in others and fairness preference in economic activities, we used hypothetical questions from the Trust Game <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berg et al., 1995)</ref> and the Ultimatum Game <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Güth et al., 1982)</ref> , respectively. We included six items from the Ultimatum Game. Each item asks if the participant would accept or reject an offer from a stranger who shares a proportion of a certain amount of money with the participant. The offer in each item varies across the task in terms of fairness (e.g., an offer of 48%-50% split of the money to the participant was coded as fair, whereas offers of less than 25% to the participant were coded as unfair). There were four unfair items and two fair items. We also included four items from the Trust game. Each item asks how much money a participant would invest for a prospective higher return with a person who could choose to either split the multiplied amount evenly (reciprocate) or retain it for themselves (defect). The person was either a hypothetical friend in two of the items or a hypothetical stranger in the other two items (adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fareri et al., 2022 )</ref>. Participants were asked to indicate how much in dollars they would share with the other person (e.g., how much out of $28. The maximum amount varied between $22, $23, $27, and $28 across four items). We used the amount of money shared with others as an indicator of participants' trust in the other person.</p><p>Health indicators To assess health, we adopted the physical health and mental health subscales from PROMIS global items <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ader, 2007)</ref> as measures of physical health and mental health.</p><p>Psychosocial factors For psychosocial factors, we used the Everyday Cognition Scale <ref type="bibr">(Farias et al., 2008)</ref> to measure perceived decline of everyday cognitive abilities (i.e., memory, language, visuospatial skills, executive function), the Need to Belong Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Leary et al., 2013)</ref> to measure participants' desire of acceptance and belonging, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support <ref type="bibr">(Zimet et al., 1988)</ref> to measure participants' subjectively assessed social support, the persuadability subscale and insensitivity to untrustworthiness cues subscales from the two-factor Gullibility Scale (citation) to measure participants' propensity to be persuaded and insensitivity to the presence of untrustworthiness cues. We also used the Emotional Regulation of Others and Self (citation) to measure emotion regulation of improving or worsening the feelings of self of others and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (citation) to measure emotion reappraisal and suppression.</p><p>Sociodemographics For sociodemographics, we collected participants' education level, current monthly expenses, highest annual salary ever earned, annual household income, gender, age, race, and ethnicity <ref type="table">( Table 1 )</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p>One focus of Study 1 was to investigate how trust in others and fairness preference during economic games may be associated with self-reported financial exploitation. We measured participants' evaluation of fairness from the Ultimatum Game trials using the difference in the proportion of rejection of unfair and fair monetary offers. We measured trust in friends and in strangers using the average proportion of money shared with each partner type during the Trust Game. We also used the sum of the two proportions as a measure of overall trust in other people and the difference between the two proportions as a measure of a participant's differentiation of trust in strangers versus friends. We hypothesized that: 1) trust in others and financial exploitation would be positively correlated; and 2) evaluation of fair and unfair monetary offers would be associated with financial exploitation. <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> contains all the pre-registered ( https://osf.io/fcrus , February 17th, 2020) analyses we conducted to test for effects of trust in others and fairness preference during economic games.</p><p>The second focus of Study 1 was to examine how the association between socioeconomic status and self-reported financial exploitation may be moderated by health-related and psychosocial factors, such as emotion regulation of self and others.</p><p>To measure socioeconomic status, we first categorized and ordinally coded one's highest lifetime annual salary, current monthly expenses, education level, and current annual household income (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for categories and coding of each socioeconomic status item). We then used the sum of all items as a composite index for socioeconomic status. We hypothesized that people with lower socioeconomic status will be more vulnerable to risk factors of poor health, larger cognitive decline, lower perceived social support, higher need to belong, and poorer emotion regulation. For example, we predicted that cognitive decline would be positively associated with self-reported exploitation, and that this association would be stronger among individuals from lower versus higher SES. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table S5</ref> presents all the hypothesized interactions between socioeconomic status and health-related and psychosocial factors (pre-registration ). The scores for each health-related and psychosocial factor are calculated according to their original published description (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> for citation details).</p><p>We used iteratively reweighted least-squares robust regression models with Huber weights to compute the coefficient of single factors of trust in others and fairness preference during economic games and the coefficient of interaction between socioeconomic status and other health-related and psychosocial variables. This method allows us to downweight the impact of outliers and gain a better fit to the majority of data. Since we are interested in the effects over-and-beyond age, and previous research has yielded inconsistent effects of age (Ross et al., 2014) , we also included age as a covariate in each of the regression models. Given the potential non-independence among measures in regression tests, multiple comparisons are corrected following the approach in Derringer (2018) that accommodates non-independent tests. All analyses were performed in R Statistical Software (v 4.3.0, R Core Team, 2023). Robust regressions were performed using 'rlm' and its default settings of the MASS R package <ref type="bibr">(v 7.3.60;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venables &amp; Ripley, 2022)</ref>. We adopted a robust F-test (i.e. a Wald test for multiple coefficients, ) to compute the p value of a correlation coefficient in robust regression using 'f.robftest' and its default settings of the sfsmisc R package (version 1.1-16; Maechler, 2023).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To test the association between trust in others and fairness preference during economic games and risk for financial exploitation, we constructed models regressing OAFEM onto a social-economic measure with age included as a covariate. <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> contains a summary of estimates of regression coefficients as well as descriptive statistics for regressors. We did not find significant associations between OAFEM and trust in other people or evaluations of fairness in others (all p -values &gt; 0.15).</p><p>To test the interaction between socioeconomic status and other health-related and psychosocial measures, for each potential interaction pair (e.g. socioeconomic status * physical health), we built a model that regressed OAFEM onto socioeconomic status, a health-related or psychosocial measure of interest, and the interaction between the two variables, with age included as a covariate. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table S5</ref> presents a summary of estimates of regression coefficients of interaction terms as well as descriptive statistics for regressors. Results revealed a significant interaction between socioeconomic status and the intrinsic affect-worsening component of our emotion regulation measures ( b = -0.25, f 2 = 0.0076, p &lt; 0.001). In other words, greater risk for financial exploitation is positively associated with a tendency to deliberately worsen one's own feelings, and this association is stronger for individuals of lower socioeconomic status than higher socioeconomic status <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">( Fig. 1 )</ref>. No other interactions reached statistical significance.  To facilitate visualization and interpretation of continuous variables used in analyses, X-axis variables are binned using 33% and 66% percentile. Socioeconomic status is binned using a median split.</p><p>Following the non-significant interactions between socioeconomic status and the remaining health-related and psychosocial variables, we explored their association with OAFEM (see <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> for a summary of estimates). Results from these follow-up simple main effect analyses revealed that, for health-related factors, higher OAFEM was associated with worse physical health ( b = -0.47, f 2 = 0.018, p &lt; 0.001), worse mental health ( b = , f 2 = , p &lt; 0.001), and greater everyday cognitive decline ( b = 4.57, f 2 = 0.026, p &lt; 0.001). Among psychosocial factors, higher OAFEM was associated with lower perceived social support ( b = -0.91, f 2 = 0.011, p &lt; 0.001) and stronger extrinsic affect-improving ( b = 0.71, f 2 = 0.005, p &lt; )0.001, extrinsic affect-worsening ( b = 1.38, f = 0.005, p &lt; 0.001), and and intrinsic affect-improving ( b = 0.61, f 2 = 0.004, p &lt; 0.001). Higher OAFEM was also associated with higher persuadability ( b = 0.30, f = 0.029, p &lt; 0.001) and higher insensitivity to trustworthiness cues ( b = 0.18, f 2 = 0.009, p &lt; 0.001). No significant association between OAFEM and socioeconomic status was found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2 -Risk Factors in an Older Adult Sample from Pennsylvania Region</head><p>In Study 2, we sought to replicate our findings from Study 1 in a more diversified population within the Pennsylvania region, USA. Our primary goals were the same as in Study 1: To evaluate 1) how trust in others and fairness preference during economic games may be associated with self-reported financial exploitation, and 2) how the association between socioeconomic status and self-reported financial exploitation may be moderated by health-related and psychosocial factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Similar to Study 1, a sample of older adults from the Pennsylvania region was recruited using Qualtrics panels. Participants were eligible to enroll in the study if they were 50 years of age or older and currently lived in the Pennsylvania region. The participants were drawn from various urban and rural areas across the state that encompass varying levels of household incomes and were evenly split based on gender (male and female). Qualtrics distributed the survey to participants based on their eligibility and the targeted income, geographic area, and gender brackets. The final sample included 305 participants. The majority of participants identified themselves as female (60.66%), white (84.92%) and not-Hispanic (95.74%), and ranged in age from 50 to 94 (M = 61.78) ( <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>We retained most measures from Study 1 <ref type="table">( Table 2 )</ref>. However, we do note a few key differences to the trust in others and fairness preference measures and our collection of socioeconomic status-related metrics that were made in order to minimize survey length and remove superfluous items to increase participant retention. In contrast to Study 1 where we used six items for the Ultimatum Game, for Study 2 we only assessed participants' evaluation of one unfair offer from a hypothetical stranger. Similarly, instead of four items for the Trust Games as in Study 1, in Study 2 we kept only one item of sharing money with a hypothetical stranger. Moreover, in Study 2 we used ZIP code based household income as our measure of socioeconomic status, which is different from the composite socioeconomic status index we used in Study 1. Sociodemographics <ref type="table">( Table 1 )</ref>, health-related and psychosocial measures <ref type="table">( Table 2 )</ref> were retained in their original form from Study 1. The survey also included several questions and scales that are for other studies and are not reported here. Participants' average total time to complete the survey is 32.98 minutes. <ref type="table">Table S6 and Table S7</ref> contain summaries of the pre-registered analyses ( https://osf.io/v357h , May the 11th, 2020) we conducted for Study 2. For single-factor effects of our trust in others and fairness preference measures, we hypothesized that: 1) trust in others (as measured by proportion of money shared with the hypothetical stranger) and financial exploitation are positively correlated; and 2) fairness preference (as measured by accepting or rejecting the unfair monetary offer) is associated with financial exploitation. For interactions with socioeconomic status, we hypothesized that socioeconomic status would have statistically significant interactions with health, cognitive decline, perceived social support, and emotion regulation.</p></div>

We also found several other moderating effects of socioeconomic status on the association between extrinsic affect-worsening, everyday cognitive decline, and persuadability ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3 -Risk Factors in a National Sample of Both Younger and Older Adults</head><p>Building off findings of interactions between socioeconomic status and several psychosocial factors from Study 1 and Study 2 that included only older people from <ref type="table">3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3</ref> Philadelphia metropolitan area and Pennsylvania region and the majority of participants were White, one open question relates to how demographic factors such as age, gender and race, and health-related factors would interact with psychosocial factors in a more diverse sample? Therefore in Study we expanded our sample's age range, racial diversity, and geographical range, and examined how sociodemographic and health-related factors may moderate the association between psychosocial factors and financial exploitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A national sample of adults was recruited using Qualtrics panels. Participants were eligible to enroll in the study if they were 20 years of age or older and currently lived in the United States. The participants were drawn to be evenly split across brackets of household income ($0-50,000; $51,000K-100,000; $101,000 and above), gender (male and female), race, and education (no degree; college degree; master's degree or above). The final sample included 933 participants. The majority of participants identified themselves as male (50.05%), White (53.91%) and not-Hispanic (91.10%), and ranged in age from 20 to 94 (M = 46.83) ( <ref type="table">Table 1 )</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>In Study 3 we again retained most scales from the previous two studies <ref type="table">( Table 2 )</ref>. One key change was made to the trust in others and fairness preference measures during economic games due to survey length changes. Similar to Study 2, we used one item of unfair offer from a hypothetical stranger for the Ultimatum Game. Different from Study 2 where we used one item of sharing money with a hypothetical stranger from the Trust Game, in Study 3 we used two items of monetary sharing, one with a hypothetical friend and one with a hypothetical stranger.</p><p>We also added two new measures. First, in order to capture a second assessment of risk for financial exploitation, we also administered The Short Form of Financial Exploitation Vulnerability Scale (FEVS-SF, Campbell &amp; Lichtenberg, 2021), a nine-item scale to detect contextual risk of financial exploitation. Each FEVS-SF item asks for different context-related information regarding the environment in which the participant is making a financial decision. Responses were coded using a three-point scale (0 = "Not at all worried", 1 = "Somewhat worried", 2 = "Very worried"). The final FEVS-SF score is a sum across all nine items. Second, we added an additional measure of cognitive function, the Cognitive Reflection Test <ref type="bibr">(Frederick, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thomson &amp; Oppenheimer, 2016)</ref> which measures the ability or disposition to resist reporting an intuitive response that occurs to one first yet may be wrong. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p>In Study 3 our focus was twofold. First, we studied which psychosocial variables were associated with financial exploitation. Second, we investigated how the associations between psychosocial variables and financial exploitation might be moderated by sociodemographic and health-related variables. <ref type="table">Table and Table contain</ref> all the psychosocial, sociodemographic, and health-related variables we planned to use for Study 3 analyses (pre-registration: https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=TPQ_UDJ , April 29th, 2021). For socioeconomic status, similar to Study 1 we used the coded sum of one's highest lifetime annual salary, education level, and annual household income as our composite index of socioeconomic status <ref type="table">( Table )</ref>.</p><p>We predicted 1) psychosocial variables tied to trust, fairness, social support, cognitive reflection, and need to belong will be associated with risk for financial exploitation, and 2) these relationships will be moderated by sociodemographic factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity and also health-related variables of cognitive decline, physical health, and mental health. To test the hypotheses, we used the same robust regression approach with age as a covariate and multiple comparison correction as in Study 1 and Study 2.</p><p>We note that we tested our hypotheses using both OAFEM and FEVS-SF respectively as two distinct measures of financial exploitation with non-overlapping items. We originally expected a strong correlation between OAFEM and FEVS-SF and planned to include only participants who scored similarly on both measures. We respectively binned OAFEM and FEVS-SF into three levels: no risk of fraud (score = 0), low risk of fraud (score &lt; median for non-zero scores), high risk of fraud (score &gt;= median for non-0 scores). Among 933 participants, only 420 participants ( M = 45.73, SD = 19.46) scored similarly (i.e. fell into the same bin) on both measures, and a follow-up correlation analysis using the full sample of 933 participants revealed only a moderate correlation between OAFEM and FEVS-SF ( r = 0.33, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>To balance between retaining enough power and having financial exploitation measured more reliably, we decided to exclude participants whose z-transformed OAFEM and FEVS-SF scores show an absolute difference of two or above. After exclusions, our final sample size was 844 ( M = 48.06, SD = 19.57). We expected similar results using either OAFEM or FEVS-SF as independent variables respectively for this sample of 844 participants after filtering. However, the results were not consistent, especially the interaction results. Therefore we report results from the 844 participants using OAFEM and FEVS-SF as our measures of financial exploitation separately below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Using OAFEM as a measure for financial exploitation, we first examined associations between OAFEM and the psychosocial factors of interest <ref type="table">( Table S8 )</ref>. We found higher OAFEM scores were associated with lower perceived social support ( b = -1.24, f 2 = 0.009, p &lt; 0.001), an increased need to belong ( b = 0.25, f 2 = 0.010, p &lt; 0.001), increased persuadability ( b = 0.54, f 2 = 0.0.052, p &lt; 0.001), and greater insensitivity to trustworthiness cues ( b = 0.44, f 2 = 0.028, p &lt; 0.001). Similar to Study 1 and Study 2, we did not find significant associations between OAFEM and rejecting an unfair monetary offer or between OAFEM with the proportion of money shared with a hypothetical stranger or friend.</p><p>Following the significant associations between OAFEM and perceived social support, need to belong, persuadability, and insensitivity to trustworthiness cues, we then tested for potential moderation of sociodemographic and health-related factors on these associations after controlling for age. <ref type="table">Table S6</ref> presents all the moderation analyses and results. Compared to younger individuals, older individuals showed weaker positive association between OAFEM and insensitivity to trustworthiness cues ( b = -0.01, f 2 = 0.013, p &lt; 0.001) and persuadability ( b = -0.01, f 2 = 0.021, p &lt; 0.001). We also found the positive association between OAFEM and persuadability is stronger for people with higher SES than people with lower SES ( b = 0.04, f 2 = 0.016, p = 0.002 ). We did not find any other significant moderation of sociodemographic and health-related factors.</p><p>We then explored the effects of sociodemographic and health-related factors that showed no interactions with psychosocial factors above. We found that when controlling for age, similar to what we found in Study 1 higher OAFEM was associated with worse mental health ( b = -0.59, f 2 = 0.010, p &lt; 0.001). We also found, similarly Study 1 and Study 2, more everyday cognitive decline ( b = 11.89, f 2 = 0.086, p &lt; 0.001) <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">( Table S5 )</ref>.  We also tested our hypotheses using FEVS-SF as a measure for financial exploitation. Again we first examined associations between FEVS-SF and the psychosocial factors of interest <ref type="table">( Table S7</ref> ). Similar to OAFEM, after controlling for age, higher FEVS was associated with lower perceived social support ( b = -0.59, f 2 = 0.052, p &lt; 0.001), higher need to belong ( b = 0.09, f 2 = 0.023, p &lt; 0.001), higher persuadability ( b = 0.15, f 2 = 0.094, p &lt; 0.001), and higher insensitivity to trustworthiness cues ( b = 0.16, f 2 = 0.061, p &lt; 0.001). Also similar to OAFEM, we did not find significant associations between FEVS-SF and rejecting an unfair monetary offer or between FEVS-SF with the proportion of money shared with a hypothetical stranger or friend.  Following the significant associations between FEVS-SF and perceived social support, need to belong, persuadability, and insensitivity to trustworthiness cues, we then tested for potential moderation of sociodemographic and health-related factors on these significant associations. <ref type="table">Table S</ref> 8 presents all the moderation analyses and results. Different from OAFEM, after controlling for age we found that the positive association between FEVS and insensitivity to trustworthiness cues was weaker for people reporting higher everyday cognitive decline ( b = -0.20, f 2 = 0.018, p &lt; 0.001). We did not find any other significant moderation of sociodemographic and health-related factors.</p><p>We then explored the effects of sociodemographic and health-related factors that showed no interactions with psychosocial factors above <ref type="table">( Table S7 )</ref>. We found higher FEVS-SF was associated with younger age ( b = -0.08, r 2 = 0.188, p &lt; 0.001). After controlling for age, we found higher FEVS-SF was associated with lower socioeconomic status ( b = -0.20, f 2 = 0.052, p &lt; 0.001), lower mental health ( b = -0.48 , f 2 = 0.163, p &lt; 0.001), and lower physical health ( b = -0.49, f 2 = 0.264, p &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In three studies that sampled diversely from older adults of the Philadelphia metropolitan area (Study 1), older adults across Pennsylvania (Study 2), and both younger and older adults across the United States (Study 3), we examined associations between self-reported measures of financial exploitation and the relatively understudied construct of trust in others and fairness preference during economic games, as well as interactions with and between previously-establish putative risk factors. Our goals were to address gaps in the literature of financial exploitation susceptibility in diverse and vulnerable populations, test hypotheses across three separate cohorts, and contribute towards a comprehensive understanding to inform future risk reduction efforts. In Study and Study 2, we found participants with lower socioeconomic status and a higher tendency to deliberately worsen their feelings were at the greatest risk for financial exploitation. Additionally in Study 2, we found participants with lower socioeconomic status and higher self-reported cognitive decline, persuadability, or extrinsic affect-worsening were at the greatest risk for financial exploitation. In Study 3, consistent across two financial exploitation vulnerability measures, we found that higher financial exploitation risk was associated with decreased social support, increased need to belong, increased persuadability, increased insensitivity to trustworthiness cues, and decreased mental health. Taken together, our findings suggest that risk for financial exploitation is dependent upon a combination of psychosocial, demographic and health factors, which in turn may foster development of interventions to protect vulnerable individuals.</p><p>One of our primary goals was to investigate how trust in others during economic games may be associated with self-reported financial exploitation. Using the Trust Game <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">( Berg et al., 1995 )</ref> to measure people's tendency to trust others in financial contexts , we did not find any significant associations between trust and financial exploitation, including interactions with other factors. However, when considering insensitivity to trustworthiness cues and persuadability from the Two-Factor Gullibility Scale (Teunisse, Case, Fitness &amp; Sweller, 2020), we found consistent statistically significant relationships across all three studies; specifically, greater insensitivity to trustworthiness cues and persuadability were associated with greater financial exploitation risk. Our exploratory analyses following the different results from the Trust Game and the Two-Factor Gullibility Scale showed only weak correlations between the measures (all absolute r s &lt; 0.16, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S1</ref> ). The constructs of insensitivity to trustworthiness cues and persuadability are closely tied to emotion recognition and social problem-solving abilities, as they require effectively identifying and integrating affective information such as another person's inherent or demonstrated trustworthiness and intentions. Our primary results and exploratory follow ups suggest the hypothetical and incentive non-compatible economic tasks used in the studies may have not been ecologically valid enough to capture aspects of affective processing and social-economic decision making as accurately as the persuadability and insensitivity to trustworthiness cues scales did. Previous studies examining the direct effects of SES have been inconsistent (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hall et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sur et al. )</ref>. In our research, the main effect of socioeconomic status was also inconsistent across studies. However, when we examined potential interactions between socioeconomic status and other psychosocial factors, one consistent effect we found is the interaction between SES and intrinsic affect-worsening: individuals with lower SES were particularly at risk for financial exploitation when they demonstrated a greater tendency to worsen their own or others' feelings. Future research and interventions aimed at minimizing financial exploitation risk among low SES groups may benefit from further investigating and addressing these interacting factors. Intrinsic affect-worsening (i.e., deliberate worsening of one's feelings) is one such factor worth considering, given multiple observed main and interactive effects. In other words, individuals who were more likely to focus on their own shortcomings, negative experiences or problems were at greater risk for financial exploitation -in general and particularly for lower SES individuals. Intrinsic affect-worsening is associated with emotional exhaustion and health-related impairments (Niven et al., 2011). One often sees parallels with intrinsic affect-worsening in clinical depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gotlib &amp; Joormann, 2010)</ref> . The higher financial exploitation risk we found associated with lower SES and higher intrinsic affect-worsening suggest depressed individuals from lower SES background are particularly vulnerable to financial exploitation. Future study and intervention should further examine and pay more attention to this particular population. Social-cognitive abilities including emotional reasoning and trust evaluations are often compromised following traumatic brain injury (TBI), leading to serious consequences in everyday life, reduced financial capacity and increased risk for financial exploitation <ref type="bibr">(Martin et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sunderaraman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2017)</ref> . Fortunately, the TBI cognitive remediation literature offers interventions that can help improve emotion recognition and problem solving abilities through cognitive rehabilitation post-TBI <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Babbage, 2014)</ref> , which may be translated to help other vulnerable populationsincluding subgroups identified in this study -recognize malicious intent and minimize financial exploitation susceptibility. These interventions include introducing and training concrete problem solving strategies, internal and external memory strategies that may be used to keep track of prior attempts or negative incidents with certain individuals, and identifying and attending to different types of affective information (e.g., verbal and non-verbal cues) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cicerone et al., 2019)</ref> .</p><p>We note that our study has a few notable limitations which may contribute to the inconsistency within our own results. First, measuring risk for financial exploitation is challenging and often limited to self-report data. Although several different instruments have been developed, it remains unclear how they are associated with risk for specific types of financial exploitation, such as consumer fraud versus imposter schemes (Nguyen et al., 2021) . Given the difficulties in collecting and validating people's experiences with financial exploitation for reasons such as scam-related stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bailey et al., 2021)</ref> , self reports might not be an accurate reflection of actual financial exploitations. In addition, many self-report measures of financial exploitation do not assess frequency of financial exploitation. Without such frequency information, a person who was victimized once by, for example, online survey scam, would look the same as someone who had been victimized by multiple online survey scams, resulting in inaccurate overall amount of financial exploitation experienced. Furthermore, financial exploitation scales that have been in major use are almost developed and validated using older people of 60 years of age or above <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jackson, 2018)</ref> , including the OAFEM and FEVS-SF we used in our own studies. Younger adults' daily activities and experiences can be quite different from older adults and may face different financial exploitation risks. Financial exploitation scales for older people may not be able to accurately capture financial exploitation risks for younger people. Without a validated financial exploitation scale for both younger and older adults, it will be difficult to have a comprehensive and reliable understanding of financial exploitation, especially its association with age and related factors. All these difficulties in measuring risk for financial exploitation may contribute to the inconsistency in some of the main effects and in interactions between factors that we observed across studies.</p><p>Beyond the measurement of financial exploitation -an issue that impacts all studies in this area -we note that our study is also uniquely impacted by potential sample biases. In each of the three studies we employed a Qualtrics Panel to recruit participants via emails and collect data from online surveys, and Study 2 and Study 3 were conducted at different times during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that the samples might represent populations that have access to the internet and check their emails at least from time to time, and toward people who were resistant and/or resilient to both short and long term pandemic impacts, including but not limited to internet access <ref type="bibr">(Lourenco &amp; Tasimi, 2020)</ref> . The potentially particular characteristics of our samples due to study platform and time might limit generalizability of our results and may also have contributed to inconsistencies we observed across studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our work helps provide a fuller characterization of risk factors that contribute to financial exploitation. Our findings across trust in others, fairness preference, health-related factors, sociodemographics, and psychosocial factors not only contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of financial exploitation risk, but also provide guidance to those fighting against financial exploitation.       <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S1</ref>. correlation matrix of the Trust Game measures and Two-Factor Gullibility Scale measures</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Study 1 SES interactions</figDesc></figure>
