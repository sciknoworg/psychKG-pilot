				<p>Developing the ability to plan is an important part of children&apos;s transition into independent adults. Characterizing the development of planning ability in complex environments has been a longstanding interest in developmental science. Complex planning is known to involve multiple cognitive processes that enable the representation of the problem domain and the simulation of potential futures. To date, however, we lack a mechanistic account of how complex planning ability develops, in large part because prior developmental research has relied on tasks with small state spaces and analysis approaches that cannot effectively disentangle how multiple, distinct cognitive processes contribute to planning. Here, we address these shortcomings by leveraging a game-like planning task and a corresponding computational modeling framework, previously used in adults, to delineate the developmental trajectories of three component processes of complex planning. These processes include heuristic evaluation of prospective states based on relevant features, forward simulation of potential future actions and their outcomes (i.e., planning depth), and sustained attention to relevant features. Participants (ages 8-25 years) played the Four-in-a-row task, presented as a 4x9 board game, against computer opponents. This task assesses complex planning as it has too many potential future scenarios to exhaustively consider, a feature of many real-life planning scenarios. We found asynchronous age-related change in the component processes of complex planning, with the heuristic evaluation of relevant features rapidly improving from childhood into adolescence, and planning depth showing more protracted developmental improvements. Fewer attentional oversights predicted better planning but did not demonstrate age-related variability. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence for the continued development of model-based decision strategies into adulthood, and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underpinning planning ability within complex environments at different developmental stages.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Planning is a form of sequential decision making that involves the mental simulation of potential futures. Everyday life requires planning for achieving short-and long-term goals, from selecting an efficient commute home to making educational choices that facilitate a successful career. De-veloping the ability to plan is an important part of children's transition into independent adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Nurmi, 1991)</ref>. The necessity of developing strong planning skills is further highlighted by studies showing that children and adolescents who perform worse on planning tasks in laboratory settings are also more impulsive in real life <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Luciana et al., 2009)</ref> and deficits in planning are characteristic symptoms of several disorders that typically emerge in childhood, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boyer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Olde Dubbelink and Geurts, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Van Den Heuvel et al., 2005)</ref>. Characterizing the development of planning is therefore a longstanding interest in psychology. Importantly, while convergent developmental findings suggest that planning improves from childhood into early adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albert and Steinberg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Korkman et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">McCormack and Atance, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Friedman et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Injoque-Ricle et al., 2014)</ref>, we lack a mechanistic account of the cognitive component processes that underlie developmental improvements in planning ability. Forward simulation, the use of heuristics to evaluate states, and sustained attention may all play a role in complex planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>, and contribute to developmental improvements in planning ability.</p><p>Mental simulation of possible futures involves imagining potential future states that one may encounter within a sequential decision making problem domain. Simulating further into the future constitutes deeper planning. Studies observing age-related increases in both accuracy and solving speed in traditional assays of planning such as the Tower of London task <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Shallice, 1982)</ref> suggest that planning depth may increase with age (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Shallice (1982)</ref> have found that from childhood to adulthood, individuals exhibit greater use of evaluative strategies that incorporate forward planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Decker et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Potter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vaghi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nussenbaum et al., 2020)</ref>. However, these developmental studies of model-based decision making used tasks in which participants only need to simulate two steps forward <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref>, limiting both the ecological validity of the planning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(van Opheusden and Ma, 2019)</ref>, as well as the ability to robustly index individual differences in planning depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Feher da Silva and Hare, 2020)</ref>. In more complex planning problems that require searching larger state spaces, participants exhibit age-related improvements in performance that continue into young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albert and Steinberg, 2011)</ref>, suggesting that age differences in forward simulation may promote age-related improvement in planning depth in complex problems with large decision trees.</p><p>The use of heuristics provides a resource-rational approach for simplifying decision making problems that have large decision trees (for an overview see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011)</ref>).</p><p>For example, when trying to plan a complex transit route home, one may use the heuristic of getting to a subway station where many different lines converge. Such heuristics involve attending to reward-predictive features in order to evaluate the desirability of a state <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Simon and Chase, 1988)</ref>). This heuristic evaluation process can be used during forward simulation to identify which sequence of potential future actions and outcomes has the greatest long-term merit. This concept is formally captured by a class of computer science algorithms called heuristic search <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Sutton and Barto, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Newell and Simon, 1972)</ref>. Although heuristic search has rarely been studied in human cognition, recent studies in adults suggest that humans implement resource-rational heuristic search strategies when they face complex planning problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Huys et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Callaway et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>. The quality of the heuristic evaluation process differs between adult individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>, and past studies have found that the use of heuristics in various types of judgement and decision making tasks increases into early adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jacobs and Klaczynski, 2002)</ref>. Together, this literature suggests that the quality of individuals' heuristics may also change with age. However, whether the quality of heuristics in complex planning tasks improves with age has not yet been directly examined, in large part due to limitations in the ability to quantify this cognitive process within existing planning tasks.</p><p>Fluctuations in attention can also influence performance in complex planning tasks. Momen-tary lapses of attention can slow problem solving speed and decrease accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Luciana et al., 2009)</ref>. Importantly, given that the ability to sustain attention during cognitively demanding tasks may improve from childhood to young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lin et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McAvinue et al., 2012)</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Betts et al. (2006);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huizinga et al. (2006)</ref> for evidence of less protracted development), it is difficult to identify whether age-related improvements in performance on traditional planning tasks can be attributed to improvements in planning depth and heuristic quality, or simply to reduced inattention. Thus, the ability to directly quantify changes in each of these component processes of complex planning is needed in order to provide a mechanistic account of the development of planning ability.</p><p>Here we aimed to characterize the developmental trajectories of these cognitive component processes of complex planning -planning depth, heuristic quality, and attention -as well as their contributions to planning ability across from middle childhood into early adulthood. We used a recent, child-friendly task called Four-in-a-row and a corresponding computational model, which have previously been used to formally characterize planning ability and its underlying components in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>. Critically, this approach enables a more ecologically valid assessment of complex planning ability, as the task contains 1.2 16 non-terminal states, which far exceeds the size of the decision trees in other planning tasks commonly used in cognitive science <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(van Opheusden and Ma (2019);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">van Opheusden et al. (2021)</ref>). Moreover, our computational modeling framework enables us to formally dissociate and quantify planning depth, heuristic quality, and attention. Leveraging this framework, we observed age-related improvement in planning ability, indexed by increasing Four-in-a-row playing strength, and demonstrated that such improvement was supported by asynchronous development of heuristic quality and planning depth, but not by age-related changes in attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive statistics</head><p>Participants (N = 156, ages 8-25 years) completed the Four-in-a-row task <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>, which is an extension of Tic-Tac-Toe. The human participant and computer opponent alternate placing tokens on a 4-by-9 board <ref type="figure">(Fig.1A)</ref>, and the first to complete four tokens in a row <ref type="bibr">(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)</ref> wins. If no player wins before the board fills, the game is a draw. This board size has approximately 1.2 × 10 16 non-terminal states (van Opheusden and Ma, 2019). The task was programmed in JavaScript and participants completed the game online in a web browser. The computer opponents were calibrated to human play to create a wide range of difficulty levels, which were then used in a staircasing algorithm to approximate a 2-win to 1-loss ratio (see Methods).</p><p>Participants answered comprehension questions before the Four-in-a-row task started, to check whether they understood winning moves and draws. Most participants answered all comprehension questions correctly on the first attempt (n = 138; n = 16 made one mistake and n = 2 made more than one mistake). Age did not significantly correlate with the number of correct answers on the comprehension questions ( = 0.136, p = 0.089), confirming that younger participants also understood the task well. The staircasing results showed that older participants played more games against more difficult opponents, suggesting that planning ability improved with age ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1E</ref>). Due to the large state-space, participants often encountered novel states; i.e., board configurations that they had not encountered before (mean unique states = 88.7%, sd = 2.0%), and thus could not be approached by relying upon repetition of previously successful moves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age differences in playing strength</head><p>We assessed each individual's playing strength (Elo rating) by using the Bayeselo algorithm (https: //www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/). The Bayeselo algorithm quantifies an individual's probability of winning a game with definite wins, losses, and draws against other opponents from the same</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V = 2.3 V = 2.3 V = 1.8 V = 0.3 V = 4.8 V = 5.2 A B C D E F</formula><p>Elo rating <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Four-in-a-row planning task, computational model, and descriptive statistics. A. Example board position in the Four-in-a-row game. Two players, black and white, alternate placing pieces on the board, and the first player to achieve four tokens in a row wins the game. In this position, black is about to win by moving onto the third square from the left in the bottom row (open circle, mouse cursor). B. Features used in the heuristic function (purple: connected two-in-a-row, blue: unconnected two-in-a-row, orange: three-in-a-row).</p><p>Features with identical colors are constrained to have identical weights. The model also includes a central tendency feature and a four-in-a-row feature. C. Illustration of the heuristic search algorithm. Black is to move (left image). After considering two candidate moves for black and evaluating the resulting positions using V(s), the highest-value move (V = 2.3) is selected on the second iteration and expands this node with three candidate moves for white. The algorithm backpropagates the lowest value (V = 0.3), as this is the worst possible move for black. That value is compared against its alternatives in each intermediate node of the tree, to decide in which direction to expand the tree in the algorithm's next iteration. D. Actual decision tree for one simulation in one position for one participant, after parameter fitting (red: the sequence of most promising moves for both players). In this example, the depth of planning is 5. Following the recipe first proposed by Claude Shannon <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Shannon, 1951)</ref>, the model uses a heuristic evaluation function with a best-first search algorithm. The basic tenets of this class of algorithms are that: 1) the agent uses simple features to estimate the value of a position, and 2) the agent searches more promising branches of the decision tree first. We adopt this algorithm to serve as a model of human play, incorporating imperfections such as noise, pruning, and attentional oversights. The first tenet translates into a value function V(s) which assigns values to board states s.</p><p>The model uses a weighted linear sum of five features: central tendency, connected two-in-a-row, unconnected two-in-a-row, three-in-a-row, and four-in-a-row (for example, see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B</ref>). The central tendency feature assigns a value to each square corresponding to inverse Euclidean distance from the board center, and sums up the values of all squares occupied by the player's pieces. The other four features count how often the corresponding pattern occurs on the board. Weights are associated with these features, and the value of a state is evaluated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) = 4 ∑ =0 ( , ) − 4 ∑ =0 ( , )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where = C and = 1 when it is the player's move, and = 1 and = C when it is the opponent's move. C captures value differences between active and passive features; for example, a three-in-a-row feature signals an immediate win on the player's own move, but not the opponent's.</p><p>The weight of feature i is given by , which is multiplied by the number of occurrences of feature i in state s.</p><p>The second tenet translates to the construction of a decision tree <ref type="figure">(Fig.1C and D)</ref>. Guided by the evaluation function, the decision tree is built using a best-first search algorithm that focuses computational resources by exploring promising branches of the decision tree first. More precisely, the algorithm first builds the root node to represent the current state of the board, and builds a partial decision tree using an iterative process. Each iteration, the algorithm decides which node to consider next by exploring the sequence that results if both players choose their highest-value moves in the current tree, using Equation 1. The selected leaf node is expanded, generating successor nodes that represent possible moves given the board state at the leaf node. These leaves are evaluated and the values are backpropagated to predecessor nodes up to the root of the tree using minimax rule. The minimax rule reflects the adversarial nature of the game; it backpropagates the player's highest value move in state s (i.e., the best move for the player) and the lowest value move during the opponent's turn (i.e., the opponent's subsequent worst move for the player).</p><p>Finally, the model returns the move with the highest value.</p><p>The model contains additional components which improve its ability to match human data.</p><p>First, it includes a pruning rule: when expanding a node, all candidate moves whose value differs from the best by more than a threshold are pruned. This reflects that people do not perform an exhaustive search, given that the number of states is too large. The pruning rule also accounts for the prior finding that humans may not find best sequence of moves if the initial move's value is too low <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Huys et al., 2012)</ref>. Second, the model accounts for variability in people's choices by introducing three potential sources of noise. Before constructing the decision tree, features at specific locations and orientations are randomly dropped with a probability ; these features are omitted during the calculation of ( ). This source of noise accounts for random attentional oversights, a cognitive component process of planning we sought to examine. Additionally, the algorithm terminates with a random stopping probability on each iteration; thus, the total number of iterations follows a geometric distribution with parameter . This source of noise accounts for the possibility that people do not always plan to the same extent. Finally, the model also includes a generic lapse rate , which reflects the probability that the participant makes a random move. For more details on the computational model and model fitting, see <ref type="bibr">Methods and (van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developmental trajectories of the cognitive component processes of planning</head><p>By fitting the computational model to each participants' decisions in Four-in-a-row, we can obtain individual estimates of three cognitive component processes of planning: planning depth, heuristic quality, and feature drop rate, a measure of attentional oversight. For each of these metrics, we obtain one estimate per individual. To characterize the development of complex planning, we ran robust regressions that considered the influence of age on each of the three cognitive component processes derived from the computational model ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>).</p><p>Planning depth reflects how deep a given participant builds the decision tree; i.e., how far a participant tends to think into the future. However, given that the model allows for noisy and variable decisions to be made at each step, the decisions the participant simulates may grow increasingly 'loose' as they think more steps ahead, further into the future. To derive planning depth, each participant's fitted model is used to simulate their moves, which it does by building a decision tree with a given participant's estimated parameters. One move is simulated for a fixed set of 5482 unique states each, which were selected for their occurrence in human-vs-human Four-in-a-row play <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>. This simulation is repeated 10 times, as there is variability in moves due to noise. This results in 10 x 5482 simulations per participant. Planning depth is operationalized as the length of the forwardly simulated sequence in which both the participant and computer opponent make the best moves in every simulated step according to the values in the decision tree;</p><p>i.e., the depth of the decision tree. Finally, this depth is averaged over the 54820 simulations to obtain a participant's planning depth. Planning depth monotonically improved with age (B = 0.83, p = 1.45⋅10 −6 , 95% CI[0.50; 1.16]), such that older participants tended to think more steps ahead into the future.</p><p>Heuristic quality reflects how close a participant's subjective weights for each of the five model features are to the optimal weights. The five model features are central tendency, connected twoin-a-row, unconnected two-in-a-row, three-in-a-row, and four-in-a-row. Heuristic quality is computed in three steps. First, the subjective state values of the 5482 unique states are calculated given the participant's estimated feature weights. Second, the objectively optimal state values of each of these 5482 states are computed by running the model without sources of noise and no pruning until it converges on a given state's value (after approximately 200000 search iterations).</p><p>These optimal state values can take the values of -1 (loss), 0 (draw), or 1 (win). Third, for each individual, these optimal values are correlated to the subjective state values given a participant's feature weights. Heuristic quality is therefore the correlation between the subjective state values given the participant's feature weights and objectively optimal state values. Heuristic quality does not depend on the pruning threshold, feature drop rate, stopping probability, or lapse rate. Given that the subjective value is a linear combination of feature weights, while the optimal values are discrete, the correlation reaches a maximum of 0.7 with optimal feature weights. Heuristic quality showed both a linear and a quadratic age effect, suggesting that age-related improvements in heuristic quality emerged most strongly between childhood and early adolescence (linear B = 0.03, p= 5.37⋅10 −7 , 95% CI[0.02; 0.04]; quadratic: B = -0.02, p = 2.32⋅10 −3 , 95% CI[-0.03; -0.01]).</p><p>Feature drop rate reflects attentional oversights and is calculated as an estimated parameter in the model. More specifically, it is the parameter which captures the probability that a participant overlooks a random feature instance on the board by temporarily setting its weight to 0. Feature drop rate, did not significantly change with age (B = 0.00, p = 0.884, 95% CI[-0.02; 0.02]).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The contribution of the cognitive component processes of planning to playing strength changes across development</head><p>To identify how different aspects of complex planning vary across development to support overall ability, we implemented robust regressions in which age and each of the three cognitive component processes derived from the computational model interacted to predict playing strength <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig.   2B</ref>). We found that planning depth and heuristic quality showed age-dependent effects on Elo rating. Specifically, heuristic quality was most predictive of Elo rating at younger ages (interaction between age heuristic quality and age B = -38.82, p = 1.48⋅10 −5 , 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-55.94, -21.70]</ref> Fluid reasoning, future orientation, and impulsivity in relation to the cognitive component processes of planning</p><p>Additional general measures of cognitive ability (e.g., fluid reasoning), as well as trait-like characteristics (e.g., future orientation, impulsivity), have been associated with individual differences in planning ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Luciana et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albert and Steinberg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Steinberg et al., 2009)</ref>.

Together, these results support the interpretation that heuristic quality and planning depth are partially supported by age-related improvements in fluid reasoning.</p><p>Self-reports also showed that daily life future orientation increased with age ( = 0.374, p = 1.661⋅10 −06 ) and impulsive behavior decreased with age ( = -0.177, p = 0.027), consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Steinberg et al., 2009)</ref>. However, we did not find a relation between either measure and any cognitive component process derived from the computational model (all ps ≥ 0.156) after controlling for age, suggesting that the Four-in-a-row computational model captures different aspects of complex planning than those indexed by these self-report measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we aimed to characterize the development of the cognitive component processes that underlie planning. To quantify how age-related variation in heuristic quality, planning depth, and attention contribute to planning, we leveraged a formal framework of resource rational planning in large state spaces, where there are too many possible futures to exhaustively consider. We identified distinct developmental trajectories of these cognitive component processes and their involvement in complex planning. Heuristic quality showed rapid age-related improvement until mid-adolescence, and higher heuristic quality contributed to better playing strength until adulthood. Planning depth showed a gradual, monotonic increase with age and supported better playing strength from mid-adolescence into adulthood. Fewer attentional oversights were associated with better playing strength, but neither attentional oversight nor its relation with playing strength varied with age. Together, these findings contribute to the growing literature on model-based decision making by delineating the development of cognitive component processes that underlie model-based planning in a large state space.</p><p>Our approach is consistent with a literature suggesting that individuals use heuristics as a resource-rational approach to simplify complex decision making problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011)</ref>, including studies in adults of planning in large state spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Callaway et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">van Opheusden et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Huys et al., 2012)</ref>. Here we found that heuristic quality increased with age, specifically from early to mid-adolescence. The precise developmental trajectory of heuristic quality, may however, depend on the complexity of determining the correct weighting of different features, and how readily relevant features can be distinguished. For example, in an information search study in which a simple proportion of easily distinguishable features were predictive of reward (i.e, two obvious variants in shape, color, and pattern), children and adults showed no difference in information aqcuisition effectiveness <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Meder et al., 2019)</ref>. In settings that require a larger set of more complex heuristics such as chess, Go, and many planning scenarios in real life, the correct feature weights may instead need to be acquired through extensive experience or instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Charness et al., 2005)</ref>. In such settings, heuristic quality may show more protracted developmental improvements. Nevertheless, that strong age-related improvements in heuristic quality in our task occurred at earlier ages relative to increases in planning depth may reflect a generalizable principle across problem domains. Namely, planning deeply will be most effective when one has a reasonably correct weighting of the relevant features to incorporate into their value function.</p><p>For example, deep planning in Four-in-a-row is pointless if the player does not value the winning feature of attaining four tokens in a row. Therefore, prioritizing heuristic quality improvement before planning deeper may be a developmental principle that generalizes to other complex decision making problems.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that performance on difficult planning tasks improves from childhood to early adulthood, consistent with theories and lay notions that children do not think ahead as much as adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albert and Steinberg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Korkman et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">McCormack and Atance, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Friedman et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Injoque-Ricle et al., 2014)</ref>. Here we used a model that formalizes this forward search process and identified an age-related increase in planning depth. This finding is consistent with studies showing developmental improvements in forward simulation of future events Ghetti and Coughlin (2018); Suddendorf and Redshaw (2013). Recent neuroscientific work has proposed that forward simulation may depend in part on the replay of trajectories within a cognitive map that represents the structure of a task or environment (for review see Miller and Venditto (2021)). For example, neuroimaging studies in adults have revealed that the representation of a state can contain information about likely subsequent future states (i.e., the successor representation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Russek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gershman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Stachenfeld et al., 2017)</ref>. These studies often use navigation paradigms which require that the organism builds a cognitive map of the spatial environment, which may be achieved by replaying previously experienced routes. Such a map allows for flexible (re)planning when the organisms goal changes (for recent overviews see Momennejad . In addition, it has been shown that the successor representation can be used to discover sub-goals to solve planning problems Botvinick and Weinstein (2014). It is therefore possible that the replay of prior experienced states can also be used to identify the reward predictive features (such as two in a row) that inform heuristic quality.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are currently no studies of the development of replay-like neural activity in humans. However, studies in rodents show evidence that the ability to replay extended spatial trajectories develops gradually from a very young age into adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Muessig et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Farooq and Dragoi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Donato et al., 2021)</ref>. Together with our findings, these studies suggest a promising future research agenda to characterize how these simulation processes develop and how experience with rewarding outcomes or frequency of encountering a given complex planning environment may shape these trajectories Mattar and Daw (2018).</p><p>Attentional oversights may be a major confounding factor in previous studies of planning development, as these transient oversights are indistinguishable from weak planning ability. Our formal model was able to dissociate temporary attentional oversights of relevant features from heuristic quality and planning depth. We found that in the context of planning, individuals with fewer oversights showed better planning, and the tendency to exhibit attentional oversights did not show age-related changes. Importantly, this age invariance in attentional oversight corroborates the notion that improvements in the quality of individuals' value functions reflects better fine-tuning of feature weights with age rather than a greater tendency to attend inconsistently to relevant features at younger ages. While it may be somewhat counter-intuitive that attentional oversights did not vary with age, one possibility is that the lack of time pressure in our task served to ameliorate developmental differences in the allocation of attention.</p><p>Past studies suggest that fluid intelligence is associated with individual differences in planning ability, both in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Unterrainer et al., 2004)</ref> and across development <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Potter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Köstering et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Steinberg et al., 2009)</ref>. In addition, self-reports of both future orientation and impulsivity have been respectively related to having better or worse planning ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Luciana et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albert and Steinberg, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Steinberg et al., 2009)</ref>. However, while fluid reasoning, future orientation, and impulsivity all change with age and have been associated with planning ability in previous studies, these constructs were not explicitly formalized in our model. Thus, in order to examine how these constructs relate to developmental changes in the component processes of planning, we used a separate task assessing fluid reasoning, as well as self-report measures of future orientation and impulsivity, and examined their relation to heuristic quality and planning depth. As expected, we found that fluid reasoning and future orientation increased with age while impulsivity decreased, consistent with past studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cattell, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ferrer and McArdle, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albert and Steinberg, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, fluid reasoning partially mediated the developmental changes in both planning depth and heuristic quality. This result complements prior studies in which fluid reasoning was found to be an important component process of model-based decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Potter et al., 2017)</ref>. Neither impulsivity nor future orientation were associated with heuristic quality or planning depth. Self-reports may be less reliable as they could be more prone to biases such as response desirability and also require self-reflection. Additionally, this finding may also suggest that impulsivity and future orientation reflect different component processes of planning than the ones that were studied here.</p><p>A limitation of the current study is that we did not take into account all cognitive component processes that are known to relate to planning ability. For example, it is possible that planning depth relies on working memory to remember the consequences of possible moves <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gilhooly, 2005)</ref>. Motivation may additionally modulate planning depth through the engagement of cognitive control and related dopaminergic functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Westbrook and Frank, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, here we used Fourin-a-row as an individual difference measure, but research on the psychometric properties of this task is needed before it can be used in an applied setting. Such validation might include examining the relation between the Four-in-a-row metrics and both pre-existing planning tasks and inter-rater reports of real-life planning ability, as well as assessing the test-retest reliability and internal consistency of these task metrics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Our final sample consisted of 156 participants (N = 54 children (8-12 years, mean age = 10.44 years, sd = 1.36, 25 females); N = 51 adolescents (13-17 years, mean age = 15.50 years, sd = 1.42, 24 females); N = 51 adults (18-25 years, mean age = 22.19 years, sd = 2.05, 29 females)) from across the United States to partake in this online study. Participants were contacted from an existing database of families and adults, as well as through other means of community recruitment. Participants were fluent in English and reported no color blindness, learning disability, or neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders. The target sample size, N = 150 participants, was determined according to previous online research on model-based planning in the same age range <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Nussenbaum et al., 2020)</ref>. Participants were instructed that they would receive $15 plus a performance-based bonus for participation. All participants were compensated with a $17 Amazon gift card.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants were instructed to complete the study on a laptop or desktop computer using Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox. If participants tried to launch the task on, e.g., a tablet or smartphone, or with an incompatible browser, they would be unable to proceed past the first instructions page.</p><p>The Four-in-a-row task began with brief written instructions followed by a comprehension check to ensure that participants understood all three winning Four-in-a row orientations (i.e., diagonal, horizontal, and vertical). This quiz took the form of three multiple choice questions, in which participants were shown final game states and asked to indicate the winner of the game. If the response was incorrect, the instructions were repeated. After the quiz, the main task started, consisting of 35 games. Participants first completed the Four-in-a-row task, followed by age-appropriate assessments of individual differences in fluid reasoning, daily life impulsive choices and future orientation using the Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chierchia et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nussenbaum et al., 2020)</ref>), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale -Brief (BIS-Brief <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Steinberg et al., 2013)</ref>), and the Future Orientation Scale (FOS <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Steinberg et al., 2009)</ref>), respectively. These measures are used in tandem to assess the construct validity of the Four-in-a-row task and its associated computational model in a developmental sample by testing whether its parameters capture known cognitive mechanisms of individual planning ability. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at New York University (IRB-FY2016-1194). Parental permission and child assent were obtained prior to participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Four-in-a-row computer opponents and staircasing algorithm</head><p>The computer opponents' algorithm was similar to our main model (described below). We created 200 computer opponents that all used the same algorithm but with different parameter values.</p><p>We started by fitting the model on all participants in laboratory experiments from (van Opheusden et al., 2021), resulting in 1650 agents. We then ran an all-versus-all tournament between these 1650 agents and ranked their performance using the Bayeselo algorithm (https://www.remicoulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/). Finally, we selected 200 agents such that their Elo rating uniformly covered an interval ranging from slightly weaker than the worst human players to slightly stronger than the best. We fine-tuned this interval in pilot experiments with participants from the same age range as the target sample. We divided the set of 200 agents into 20 ability categories, with 10 agents per ability category. We matched participants with computer opponents using two-winto-one-loss staircasing, starting with the second ability category. That is, when a participant won two consecutive games, the ability category of their opponent in the next game increased by one.</p><p>When a participant lost, the ability category of their opponent decreased by one, and after a draw, the ability category of their opponent stayed the same. An opponent was randomly selected from the 10 agents within that ability category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Playing strength and model derived cognitive component processes of planning</head><p>There are three model derived metrics that each corresponds to a different cognitive component process underlying planning: planning depth, heuristic quality, and feature drop rate. In addition, we estimated each participant's playing strength by using the Elo system (https://www.remi-coulom.</p><p>fr/Bayesian-Elo/). This algorithm treats estimating playing strength as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem, with a model that specifies the probability of a win/loss as a logistic function of the rating difference between the participant and the computer opponent. The algorithm takes as input a database of game results and computer opponent's Elo rating, which are determined through computer vs. computer simulations. The algorithm uses these to estimate all participant ratings. Individual players' Elo rating are sufficiently precise that they can be used as a metric for playing strength.</p><p>Planning depth was estimated as follows: After fitting the parameters of our main model for a given participant, we ran the model forward in generative mode: for each board position, we generated 100 simulations using the fitted parameters. In each simulation, we recorded the depth of the principal variation (sequence of moves considered best), then averaged across simulations and board positions. The result is the planning depth estimate for that participant.</p><p>Heuristic quality is defined as the correlation between the value given the state and feature weights ( ( , )) and the objective value (1 for wins, -1 for losses, 0 for draws), across a pre-generated set of observed game states s. This pre-generated set was selected for their occurrence in human vs human tournaments <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>. The heuristic quality only depends on the feature weights in the model, and not on the parameters of the tree search algorithm.</p><p>Finally, the feature drop rate is simply the parameter in the model (see model description in the main text). This parameter simply captures the probability that the player overlooks a random feature, temporarily dropping it from the value function. Feature drop rate is therefore a measure of attentional oversights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fitting, model comparisons, and model stability</head><p>The main model in the original study has 10 parameters <ref type="bibr">(van Opheusden et al., 2020)</ref>. The model fitting, comparisons and reliability assessments reported here correspond to the procedures reported previously. More specifically, we fit these parameters for participant separately using maximumlikelihood estimation. However, deriving the log-likelihood analytically requires marginalization of all latent variables, which is intractable. Therefore, we estimated the log probability of a participant's move in a board position with inverse binomial sampling (IBS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DeGroot, 1959)</ref>, which is an unbiased estimation method <ref type="bibr">(van Opheusden et al., 2020)</ref>. As it was not possible to calculate gradients of the log-likelihood, we optimized the log-likelihood function with Bayesian adaptive direct search <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acerbi and Ji, 2017)</ref>, which is a powerful gradient-free algorithm. We account for potential overfitting by reporting 5-fold cross-validated log-likelihoods. Model comparisons were done to examine the necessity of each parameter. The full best-first search model was compared with to lesioned models, excluding one parameter at the time, again using 5-fold cross validation.</p><p>To assess parameter estimate stability, we calculated the correlation between parameter estimates of independent fits <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1</ref>). While the parameter estimates between the two independent fits should be highly correlated, they cannot be identical because the model fitting algorithm provides stochastic estimates of the log-likelihood and therefore returned stochastic parameter estimates <ref type="bibr">(van Opheusden et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fluid reasoning</head><p>After the Four-in-a-row task, participants completed the MaRs-IB in order to obtain an index of fluid reasoning ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chierchia et al., 2019)</ref>. The task involved a series of matrix reasoning puzzles that required participants to select a pattern-completing shape from four possible options (the target and three distractors). There were 80 puzzles in total. The task ended after 8 minutes had passed, or after all 80 puzzles were completed. All MaRs-IB methods followed directly from <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Nussenbaum et al., 2020)</ref>. A subset of participants (N = 51) had previously completed the MaRs-IB as part of an earlier experiment. At least days had elapsed since the prior study date. In our analysis of the MaRs-IB data, we excluded trials in which participants made responses in less than 250 ms, as well as trials in which participants failed to respond before the 30-second time limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chierchia et al., 2019)</ref>. We excluded 5 adult participants from MaRs-IB analyses due to missing data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-reports</head><p>After the MaRs-IB, participants completed the BIS-Brief, an abbreviated 8-item version of the BIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Steinberg et al., 2013)</ref>, to assess their self-reported impulsive personality traits. This shorter scale has been validated for use among youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mathias et al., 2018)</ref>. Additionally, participants completed the 15-item FOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Steinberg et al., 2009)</ref>, which examines future orientation along three, 5-item dimensions: time perspective, anticipation of future consequences, and planning ahead.</p><p>Child participants were told that a parent could help them read the questionnaires, if needed. Seventeen participants reported that a parent provided reading assistance on the BIS-Brief and FOS.</p><p>In our analysis of the BIS-Brief and FOS data, we excluded 4 participants (2 children and 2 adults) and 2 participants (1 child and 1 adult), respectively, who selected the same answer column for each question. To ensure that participants did not rush through the questionnaires, we confirmed that all participants had minimum questionnaire completion times longer than two standard deviations below the mean (BIS-Brief mean = 52.55 seconds, SD = 25.90 seconds; FOS mean = 203.35 seconds, SD = 93.13 seconds). The mean and standard deviation completion times were computed without outliers (1 participant who had the BIS-Brief open for multiple days on their browser, and 7 participants for the BIS-Brief and 9 participants for the FOS whose completion times fell more than 1.5 times the interquartile range above the third quartile).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Some figures show age bins (children: 8-12 years, adolescents: 13-17 years, and adults: 18-25 years) for data visualization purposes. However, we treated age as a continuous variable in all analyses with the exception of post-hoc exploratory analyses. The age groups were approximately the same size and have similar proportions of males and females (see Participants).</p><p>To test the relation between age and the model derived metrics, we used robust regression models with bisquare weighting for outliers, which down weighs mild outliers and deletes extreme outliers (those which are &gt; 6 times the median absolute deviation of the residuals are set to zero weight). We tested both linear and quadratic (polynomial of the second degree) age effects and report the results for the best fitting age model. We also used robust regression models to predict Elo rating using planning depth, heuristic quality, feature drop rate, and their interaction with age. We computed our robust mediation analyses using the "test mediation" function from the "robmed" R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alfons, 2021)</ref>, and significance of the mediation effects was calculated using 5,000 bootstrapped replicates.</p><p>As a result of the five-fold cross validation method, each subject had five estimates of planning depth, heuristic quality, and feature drop rate. The average of each metric per subject was therefore used as a dependent variable in the regression models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive statistics</head><p>With age, participants took longer on average to make a move in Four-in-a-row (Spearman rho correlation between decision time and age: = 0.234, = 0.003) and made more moves per game ( = 0.200, = 0.012). On average, participants completed the Four-in-a-row task in 16.17 minutes (sd = 5.54). Task completion time correlated with age such that older participants took longer ( = 0.277, p = 4.55⋅10 −4 ).</p><p>As planning is time-consuming, qualitatively better moves should be associated with longer decision times.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model stability</head><p>The model fitting pipeline is computationally expensive. Each model takes approximately one hour per participant on New York University's High Performance Computing cluster (Intel Xeon E5-2690v2 CPUs 3.0GHz) with parallel computing for IBS (for details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>. Conventional methods of assessing parameter recovery are therefore nearly intractable.</p><p>Consequently, we follow the methods described in van <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref> by calculating the correlation between parameter estimates of independent fits to assess the stability of the parameter estimates. We report the results across our sample as well as for each age group separately, thereby accounting for the fact that the range of parameter estimates differed between age groups and reliability may therefore differ between groups too. We found that all parameter estimates were positively correlated across age <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1</ref>). For 18-25 year olds, all refits were significantly correlated, except lapse rate, which replicated the findings in the original study on adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(van Opheusden et al., 2021)</ref>. For 8-12 year olds and for 13-17 year olds, the correlations were all significant and importantly, the correlations were not smaller for these younger age groups than for adults, suggesting that the parameter estimates were stable across fits and age (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2</ref> for an overview of all correlation coefficients and p-values). This shows that the parameter estimates were stable across fits and that this stability was not weaker for younger participants. In addition, the correlations between different model derived metrics were weakly in the expected directions, suggesting that there was no strong trade-off between the metrics <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations between Four-in-a-row metrics</head><p>The correlations between model derived metrics were weakly in the expected directions. Elo rating was positively correlated with planning depth (p &lt; 0.001) and heuristic quality (p &lt; 0.001). Deeper planning was associated with lower feature drop rate (p = 0.006), and the correlation between heuristic quality and planning depth was not significant (p = 0.069). More importantly, none of the correlation strengths was high, suggesting no strong trade-off between the different metrics (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>).</p></div>

Therefore, free parameters that showed age-related changes were included in the final model even if those parameters only affected the model fit in one of the age groups. This showed that the full model best captured age-related differences and we did not exclude any parameters <ref type="figure">(Fig. S4)</ref>.  <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>.

Here we used a recently developed task and computational modeling framework to show that the development of planning is characterized by an asynchronous improvement of its underlying component processes. The development of planning first relies on refinement of the value function by fine-tuning the representation of reward-predictive features, and continues to improve gradually into adulthood through deeper forward reasoning. Taken together, this study shows strong evidence for continued development of model-based decision strategies into adulthood. The findings contribute to understanding the development of model-based decision making in large state spaces and propose a promising research agenda to characterize the development of different forms and component processes of planning from childhood to adulthood.</figDesc></figure>

Planning depth became more predictive of Elo rating with age (interaction between planning depth and age B = 35.17, p = 1.19⋅10 −4 , 95%CI[17.59, 52.75]). These findings suggest developmental changes in the contribution of these component processes to solving planning problems. Age-related improvement in planning ability was predicted by heuristic quality at younger ages, and at older ages by the age-related gradual expansion of the decision tree size. In addition, lower feature drop rate was associated with better playing strength (main effect B = -38.19, p = 9.60⋅10 −6 , 95% CI[-54.65,   -21.73]). However, this relationship did not differ significantly with age (interaction effect B = -4.07, p = 0.615, 95% CI[-20.04, 11.90]), confirming that, across participants, fewer attentional oversights predicted better playing strength.To better understand the interaction effects between age and heuristic quality and age and planning depth on Elo rating, we performed post-hoc robust regressions with age binned into groups (children: 8-12 years, adolescents: 13-17 years, adults: 18-25 years). This set of post-hoc robust regressions allowed us to examine how each of these metrics contributed to Elo rating within an age group. We applied Bonferroni-Holm corrections for multiple comparisons. We found that heuristic quality was significantly predictive of Elo rating for the 8-12 year olds (B = 87.46, p = 6.98⋅10 −5 , 95%CI[46.96, 127.95]), but planning depth and feature drop rate were not (planning depth B = 10.23, p = 0.608, 95% CI[-29.61, 50.07]; feature drop rate B = -33.50, p = 0.110, 95% CI[-  75.01, 8.03]). For the 13-17 year olds, heuristic quality remained a significant predictor of Elo rating (B = 55.03, p = 5.95⋅10 −4 , 95%CI[24.97, 85.10]). Feature drop rate additionally became a significant predictor in this age-range (B = -43.44, p = 0.634⋅10 −3 , 95% CI[-74.03, -12.86]), but planning depth did not (B = -7.22, p = 0.622, 95% CI[-36.50, 22.05]). For 18-25 year olds, heuristic quality was no longer significantly predictive of Elo rating (B = -11.97, p = 0.250, 95% CI[-32.64, 8.70]). Instead, for this age group, planning depth was most predictive of Elo rating (B = 72.49, p= 1.61⋅10 −8 , 95% CI[-  51.06, 93.92]) followed by feature drop rate (B = -31.55, p = 0.005, 95% CI[-52.98, -10.12]). Together,</figDesc><table /><note>these results clarify age-related changes in the use of the cognitive component processes that underlie planning decisions: heuristic quality refinement supports planning improvements during childhood, while planning ability is increasingly supported by forward reasoning towards young adulthood.</note></figure>
