				<p>We examine the ability of observers to extract summary statistics (such as the mean and the relative-variance) from rapid numerical sequences (two digit numbers presented at a rate of 4/sec). In four experiments, we find that the participants show a remarkable ability to extract such summary statistics and that their precision in the estimation of the sequence-mean improves with the sequence-length (subject to individual differences). Using model selection for individual participants we find that, when they only estimate the sequence average, most participants rely on a holistic process of frequency based estimation and there is a minority who rely on a rule-based and capacity limited mid-range strategy. When both the sequence-average and the relative variance is estimated about half of the participants rely on these two strategies. Importantly, the holistic strategy appears more efficient in terms of its precision. We discuss implications for the domains of two pathways numerical processes and decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Imagine a stock-market operator viewing a rapid sequence of stock returns on which she needs to make a fast buy/sell decision, or alternatively, a person who faces a crowd of people, each exhibiting a distinct emotional expression towards the person, who then needs to decide if to approach or not. In situations such as this, the rapid extraction of summary statistics of the elements (numerical returns or emotional expressions), in particular their average, has obvious advantages. Recent research over the last two decades has convincingly demonstrated that humans have a remarkable ability to extract summary statistics from large sets of visual elements, briefly presented together or in fast sequence, with regards to visual properties such as size, orientation and even emotional expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allik, Toom, Raidvee, Averin, &amp; Kreegipuu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ariely, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chong &amp; Treisman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dakin, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Haberman &amp; Whitney, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Khayat &amp; Hochstein, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Robitaille &amp; Harris, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Parkes et al., 2001)</ref>. Similarly, it has been reported that humans can extract the arithmetic average (the simplest summary statistic) from rapid numerical sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Malmi &amp; Samson, 1983</ref>) For example, <ref type="bibr">Brezis et al., (2017)</ref> reported that human observers are able to provide quite accurate estimates of numerical average for sequences of 2-digit numbers (sequence length 6-12) that are presented at a rate of 4/sec. Moreover, they demonstrated the precision of these estimates increases with sequence length, and decreases with the sequence mean and variance.</p><p>Finally, they proposed a model based on a population of broadly number-magnitude detectors, which accounted for all these data patterns (see next section).</p><p>While this extensive research has focused on the extraction of an ensemble-average, there is less research on the extraction of higher order summary statistics, such as the variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bronfman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kareev, Arnon, &amp; Horwitz-Zeliger, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Morgan, Chubb, &amp; Solomon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Solomon, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ward, Bear, &amp; Scholl, 2016)</ref>, in particular for numerical sequences. This shortage stands out, given the well-known impact of the variance of a payoff-set on risk-preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Erev et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Glickman, Tsetsos, &amp; Usher, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ludvig et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Summerfield &amp; Tsetsos, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vanunu, Hotaling &amp; Newell, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vanunu, Pachur, &amp; Usher, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Weber, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Zeigenfuse, Pleskac &amp; Liu, 2014)</ref>. Motivated by this shortcoming, the aim of this paper was to probe further into the capacity of human observers to extract summary statistics of rapid numerical sequences. In particular, we extend previous investigations with regards to the following questions. i) Can human observers extract higher order summary statistics (such as the relative sequence-variance 1 ) at the same time as they extract the average? ii) What types of mechanisms do people deploy when making such estimations? We contrast here between holistic frequency-based estimations and more sequential rule-based and working-memory limited strategies such as the mid-range; see next section for details. iii) Are there individual differences in the mechanism or the strategy that human observers deploy in these tasks?</p><p>and iv) which of those strategies/mechanisms result in more efficient estimations?</p><p>We start with a brief computational section that provides a motivation for our experiments.</p><p>Following, we present four experiments in which human observers were asked to evaluate summary statistics of rapid numerical sequences. In Experiment 1 (A and B) only the average is evaluated, while in Experiments 2 and 3, the participants are required to make two estimations for each sequence: average and (relative) variance in Experiment 2, and average and confidence in Experiment 3, respectively. Finally, we present a computational analysis of the data, which is focused on individual differences with regards to the estimation mechanism and we examine their relative efficiencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling of numerical averaging: dependency on sequence-length</head><p>We are focusing on the intuitive averaging of the type that people can make for rapid sequences (four per second) of two digit numbers under time pressure (see methods of Experiment 1). This belongs to the domain of approximate numerical estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dehaene, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dehaene, Dehaene-Lambertz &amp; Cohen 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Feigenson, Dehaene &amp; Spelke, 2004)</ref> and excludes an explicit computation of the average based on summing the numbers and division by the sequence length. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Malmi and Samson (1983)</ref> considered two alternative ways of computing a sequence average: i) a running average with decreasing weights, ii) the estimation of the "center of mass" from a frequency distribution, and they concluded in favor of the latter. More recently, <ref type="bibr">Brezis et al., (2016</ref><ref type="bibr">Brezis et al., ( , 2017</ref> population averaging model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), provides a computationally explicit mechanism that first generates a noisy frequency representation of a numerical sequence and estimates its center of mass.  <ref type="bibr">Brezis et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, when presented with a sequence of numbers, the sequence's average is estimated from the population-averaging of the number-magnitude tuned activation profile, by weighting the contribution of each detector's activity according to its preferred number magnitude <ref type="bibr">(Georgopoulos, Schwartz, &amp; Kettner, 1986)</ref>. At display's offset, the center of mass is estimated by summing each neuron's detector's activation multiplied by its preferred magnitude and dividing by the sum of the overall network's activity (see <ref type="bibr">Brezis et al., 2017</ref>, for a biological plausible neural implementation):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= (∑ • ) ∑ ⁄<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where for each detector i, F=firing rate; T=the detector's preferred magnitude. The sum is taken over all numerosity detectors.</p><p>The population averaging model makes a particular prediction on how the precision of the estimate depends on the length of the sequence. As the sequence-length (n), increases, the frequency representation becomes less noisy (due to Poisson variability of neural detectors, which decreases with the activation magnitude) and therefore the precision of the estimate increases ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). This is thus equivalent to a computation of the average, based on noisy representations of its magnitudes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= ∑ + =1 , ~(0, 2 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where, Xi is the i th item of the sequence and 2 is the variance of the encoding noise.</p><p>For simplification, we will here approximate the population averaging with this simplified model, which we label the normative-holistic averaging model (Normativity here corresponds to the property that all the items are used and weighted equally in the estimation of the average; see contrast with heuristic models below). The normative-holistic model predicts that the precision of estimation would improve with 1 √ ⁄ <ref type="table">(Figure 2 blue line),</ref> which results from the averaging of the encoding noise, and is similar to that of the population-averaging model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref> black line).</p><p>We contrast the normative-holistic model estimation with a heuristic computation based on symbolic representations of the numbers that are subject to working memory capacity limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ashcraft, 1992)</ref>. The simplest such model, assumes that out of the n-numbers, the observers are able to remember few samples (2 or 3) and use them to evaluate the average of the sequence by computing their mean 2 . For the case in which the samples stored in working memory are random, we label this the analytical-random model, as it relies on explicit (rule based) computation of the average based on what is available in working memory 3 . This analytic-random model is a variant of the procedural arithmetic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson, Reder, &amp; Lebiere, 1996)</ref>, in which procedural operations are serially performed on symbols available in WM. Since with increasing n, the few WM-samples provide a less  It is possible, however, to consider a more sophisticated "analytic" version of this strategy, which still computes the average based on few (e.g., two samples), but selects those samples in a non-random way <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Myczek &amp; Simons, 2008</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chong et al., 2008)</ref>. For example, an efficient way to select two samples is to select the maximum and minimum of the sequence, resulting in the so called, mid-range heuristic. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> (Magenta line), the mid-range heuristic predicts a milder improvement with sequence-length (for n&gt;7), since the mid-range provides a better estimate of the average, the longer the sequence is.</p><p>Note that despite using one less samples (2 instead of 3) the mid-range precision is higher than that of the random-analytic with n&gt;3. However, this advantage comes with a cost. For the case that the numbers are selected from a non-symmetric, skewed distribution, the midrange strategy predicts systematic deviations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of computational contrasts between estimations strategies</head><p>We have contrasted several mechanisms that observers can deploy to estimate the average of a numerical sequence. The normative-holistic mechanism assumes each item contributes to the estimate but is subject to a potentially large encoding noise, which averages out with n. The analytical-random model assumes an exact (symbolic) computation of the average based on few (2-3) random samples, and it predicts precision to decrease with n. Finally, the mid-range model, predicts a milder improvement in the precision estimate with n (for n&gt;7), but it also predicts that only the extreme values contribute to the average estimate.</p><p>Thus to contrast between estimations strategies, we will focus on how the precision of the estimate (computed either as RMSD or as a Pearson correlation between actual and estimated sequence-average 4 ) depends on sequence-length. In addition, we focus on the decision weights of the ranked items (De Gardelle &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Summerfield, 2011)</ref>, in order to probe the deployment of mid-range strategies.</p><p>To anticipate our results, we found that observers can estimate relative-variance of rapid numerical sequences remarkably well, while they also estimate the sequence average.</p><p>Moreover, while we find individual differences in the estimation strategy, most observers deploy a holistic mechanism when the task requires average estimation only, and about half of them deploy such a holistic mechanism even when they estimate both the average and the relative variance. Finally, we find that the participants who deploy the holistic mechanism tend to be more precise in their estimations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments</head><p>Four experiments were carried out to probe individual differences in the mechanism by which human observers evaluate rapid numerical sequences. In all the experiments the sequences presented two digit numbers at a rate of 4/sec and sequence-length was randomly selected to be either 6 or 12 items (based on Brezis et al., 2015, we avoided shorter sequence lengths to discourage explicit computation strategies, which were found for sequences of 4 items). Previous research has indicated that the number magnitude is automatically encoded when subjects are presented with two digit numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dehaene et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fitousi &amp; Algom, 2019)</ref>. In Experiments 1a and 1b, we require participants to evaluate only the sequence average (see <ref type="figure">figure 3)</ref>. These experiments differ in the distribution from which the numbers are sampled: uniform in 1a, and skewed in 1b. Under an adaptive observer assumption, skewed distributions are likely to make the deployment of a mid-range estimations less likely. In Experiments 2 and 3 we used (like Experiment 1a) numbers that are sampled from a uniform distribution, but we required the participants to provide two estimates for each sequence. In addition to the average, Experiment 2 required an estimation of sequence-variance, while Experiment 3 required an estimation of the confidence in the estimation of the average. Since confidence is expected to reflect the uncertainty on the value of the estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lebreton, Abitbol, Daunizeau, &amp; Pessiglione, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref> and this is likely to increase with the variance of the sequence, we consider the confidence estimation, an indirect/implicit estimation of the variance. Since mid-range strategies provide a simple and natural way to estimate the sequence-variance, we can expect that the deployment of this strategy will increase in Experiments 2 and 3 (see experimental methods for participants and procedure details for all experiments).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1a</head><p>We used two measures to quantify each subject's precision in averaging. The first is the Pearson correlation of the real and estimated averages of the sequences of each participant (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6A</ref>, for an example of an individual observer). The average Pearson correlation was high (r=0.75, SD=0.12) and was significantly higher than zero (all participants' p's&lt;0.001). Second, we computed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the real averages and the participants' responses (note that higher value of RMSD imply lower accuracy). The RMSD was significantly lower than the simulated RMSD generated by randomly shuffling participant's responses across trials (Actual RMSD=7.7; Shuffled RMSD=14.8; t(23)=17.7, p&lt;.001).</p><p>To test the sequence-length effect, we carried out a paired sample t-test between the RMSD of the six items condition compared to the twelve items condition, which showed a significant difference. The precision improved (RMSD decreased) with sequence-length: six items sequences (Mean=7.77, SD=3.4) and 12 items sequences (M=6.90, SD=3.2); t(23)=3.66; p&lt;.01 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5A</ref>; Experiment 1a). These results are consistent with the predictions of the normative-holistic model which predicts better performance for the 12 items sequences relative to the six items sequences due to the fact that uncorrelated single item noise averages out, but is also consistent with predictions of the mid-range model. In addition we found that precision decreases with sequence variance (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4B</ref>):</p><p>repeated measure ANOVA with the within subject factor of the 3 groups of variance; F(1.2,28)=44.8; p&lt;.001, indicating a linear trend. In order to probe whether participants based their average estimations mostly on extreme values, as predicted by a midrange strategy (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> red plot), or on all items with equal weights as predicted by a normative-holistic strategy (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> blue plot), we ran separate regressions for each of the sequences' length conditions, using the sequence ranked numbers as predictors (see Method section; in the twelve-items sequences we paired the items in order to have six predictors in both conditions) and we averaged both conditions weights. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5A</ref>, the regression weights show a mild U-shaped pattern (black line), indicating a tendency to overweight extreme values as predicted by a midrange strategy, but note that the decision weights are closer to normative-holistic model (blue line), according to which participants based their estimations on all items. A paired sample t-test between the weight given to inlying ranks [2-5] and outlying ranks [1 and 6] <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Vandormael, Herce, Balaguer, Li, &amp; Summerfield, 2017)</ref> was statistically significant; t(23)= 4.45, p&lt;.001. The mean difference between outlying and inlying ranks across participants was 0.12. 5 We next examined individual differences. We found remarkable individual differences in the sequence-length effect (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6B</ref>), in the curvature of the ranked decision weights (U-shape pattern), indicating the presence of different estimation strategies (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6C</ref>), and in the precision of the estimations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6D</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1b</head><p>Experiment 1b was identical to Experiment 1a, with the only exception that in the majority of trials the distributions used to generate the sequences were skewed rather than uniform (same means). In addition, the variance was not manipulated factorially, as in Experiment 1a, however, the trials had a high variability in their sequence mean and variance (see</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Methods).</formula><p>Participants showed a high accuracy rate in evaluating sequences' average in both lengths.</p><p>Pearson mean correlation between the sequences' actual average and participants' estimation of the average was high (r=0.71, SD =0.12) and significantly higher than zero (all p's&lt;.001). In addition, RMSD between the real averages and participants' responses was also measured and was significantly lower than simulated RMSD generated by (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1a with the exception that in addition to evaluating the sequences' average, participants were also instructed to estimate the sequences' relative "spread" 6 (high, medium, low). The experiment had two aims: First we wanted to see if people have the ability to extract this higher order statistic, together with the average, when viewing rapid sequences of numbers. Second we wanted to see if introducing this demand, would change the strategy the participants deploy to estimate the average.</p><p>The participants had a high accuracy rate in evaluating sequences' average in both lengths.</p><p>Pearson mean correlation across participants between the sequences' actual average and participants' estimation of the average was high (r=.73, SD=.09) and significantly higher than zero (all p's&lt;.001). In addition, the RMSD between the real averages and participants' responses was significantly lower than simulated RMSD generated by randomly shuffling participants' responses across trials (RMSD=7.68, RMSD random Shuffle=14.23; t(23)=-21.88, p&lt;.001). In contrast to previous experiments, however, while precision was still numerically higher for longer sequences (lower RMSD), this effect did not reach statistical significance (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> Experiment 2); t(23)=1.84, p=.07), and it was subject to marked individual differences <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 7A</ref>). Critically, the participants showed a high accuracy rate in the estimation of the sequences' relative-variance in both lengths (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">figure 7B</ref>). Spearman correlation between the sequences' actual variance and participants' (3-scale) estimation of the relative-variance was high and significant (r=.74, SD=0.1, p&lt;.001; for all participants; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7C</ref>).</p><p>As in Experiment 1 we averaged both regressions weights of each of the sequences' length conditions, using the sequence ranking's numbers as predictors. The results show a Ushaped pattern with a significant difference between the decision weights of the inliers [ranks 2-5] and outliers ranked numbers [ranks 1 and 6]; t(23)=6.78, p&lt;.001. The mean difference between outlying and inlying ranks across participants was 0.16. The higher difference in this experiment compared with Experiment 1a (0.12) indicates that instructing the participants to estimate the variance in addition to the average, made them assign even higher weights to the extreme values (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5C</ref>). This was also subject to individual differences (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>Experiment 3 was similar to Experiment 2, but here we replaced the explicit estimation of the sequence relative-variance with a more implicit onea report of confidence in the average estimation (we expected that confidence will decrease with sequence variance; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lebreton et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, we aimed here to measure the decision time for the average-estimation and to determine if it depends on sequence variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2020)</ref>. As Experiment 1, there was a significant effect for sequence length in the RMSD indicating better performance in 12 items sequences t(23)=2.9; p&lt;.01, which was subject to marked individual differences; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9A</ref>). Critically, the confidence reported by the participants decreased with the sequence variance; F(1.39,3.1)=51.5; p&lt;.001. ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9B</ref>).</p><p>The Spearman correlation (for each participant across all responses) between the sequences' variance and the participants' (4-scale) confidence report was significant <ref type="bibr">SD=0.18,</ref><ref type="bibr">p&lt;.001)</ref>, but subject to marked individual difference ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9C</ref>). Finally, we find that the RT of the average estimation increased with the sequence variance; F(3,69)=6.8; p&lt;.001.</p><p>For the novel (bimodal) condition we found that the confidence and the RT were similar to those in the (unimodal) large variance condition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9D</ref>). Finally, we ran a ranking regression to test whether participants assign higher weights to extreme values. As in the previous experiments a paired t test indicated an over-weighting of the extreme values, t(23)=4.12, p&lt;.001. Mean difference between the outlying and inlying ranks was 0.24 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 5D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Experimental Results</head><p>The results of these experiments demonstrate that human observers have a high capacity to extract two major summary statistics -the average and the relative variance, and to evaluate them with a relatively high accuracy when viewing rapid numerical sequences presented at a rate of 4/sec. The novel aspect of the results is the accurate estimation of sequence relative variance, and the fact that confidence and RT in the average-estimation can be used as indirect measures of sequence variance.</p><p>The results also indicate significant variability in the strategy that the observers deploy to make these estimations. This variability is indicated in the variation of the averageestimation precision, in the variation of the sequence length effect and the curvature of the U-shape in the decision weights for ranked sequence elements (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>). As all of these factors distinguish between the strategies we labeled as holistic-normative vs mid-range, it is likely that they reflect a variability in the strategy the participants deploy. In particular, it may be suggested, that type of distribution from which the numbers are sampled (see differences between Experiments 1a and 1b in the ranked regression) and the need to monitor variance (see differences between Experiments 1 and 2), affect the likelihood of a participant to deploy a mid-range or holistic normative estimation.</p><p>In order to quantify and validate these qualitative summaries of the data, we have carried out a computational analysis, aimed to contrast between the averaging estimation strategies we considered earlier (holistic-normative vs. mid-range). In the following section we use computational modeling methods to classify participants based on which of these strategies they deployed in each task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual differences in the average-estimation strategy: strategy classification</head><p>To classify the averaging classification strategies, we used two complementary approaches.</p><p>The first approach is empirical-based while the second required the development of formal models and on model selection based on the account of the subjects' data. The empirical based classification is straightforward. For each subject (and in each experiment), we computed the correlation (across all trials) between the average/mid-range of the sequence and the subject's estimation. We classified a subject as using a holistic-normative or midrange strategy on the basis of the highest correlation. While this method is simple, it only relies on the average of the estimation and does not take the distribution of estimations into account.</p><p>In the second approach, we developed formal models that quantify the predictions of the holistic and of the mid-range strategies, under a number of assumptions. As these models include stochastic processing, they predict not only mean-estimation but full distribution of estimations, and thus we can compute for each trial the likelihood of the response given the model and its parameters. (Note that once we determine the noise sources, the models also make predictions for the RMSD as a function of sequence-length, and thus this analysis goes beyond what could be achieved via a regression approach).</p><p>For each type of model (holistic or mid-range) we examined two versions, a simple one in which the noise (variability) parameters are fixed, and a more complex one in which one variability parameter depends on the sequence-variance. The simpler models assume the presence of a common motor/output noise (that is invariant to sequence-length or sequencevariance) and an encoding noise in the holistic model, which operates in the conversion of each item from a numerical symbol to a population response over magnitude representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dehaene, 2007</ref>; see also <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1)</ref> 7 ; both of these noise distributions are assumed to be Gaussian. In the simple midrange model we assumed that the symbolic calculation of the average of two numbers is accurate and does not depend on their range.</p><p>In the complex models, variance dependent noise was introduced for both model types. This is motivated by this feature of the data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4B</ref>) and can be motivated in different ways for the two types of models. For the holistic model, the variance dependent variability is motivated by the holistic population-averaging model <ref type="bibr">(Brezis et al., 2017)</ref>, in which the estimation of the center of mass of the population response depends on the variance of the sequence (peaked distributions are more precise than flat ones; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1C)</ref>. For the mid-range model, the variance dependent noise corresponds to a type of "calculation-error", which increases with the range. Finally, in all models we allowed an intercept and a slope to mediate the transformation from an internal to an external space 8 (see Computational</p><p>Methods for details of the models). For each participant, we have carried out a model selection analysis of the data in the experiments presented. The models which we contrasted were the normative-holistic model and the mid-range model. The contrast was based on their relative likelihood to account to all the estimations a participant gave (maximum likelihood, subject to a standard penalty for degrees of freedom; AIC and BIC measures; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akaike, 1973)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table-</ref>1 we present the group BIC-values (mean BIC across participants) for each of the four models for the data of our four experiments. We see that at the group level, the holistic model wins by far in Experiments 1a and 1b, in which subjects where only asked to estimate the sequence-average. In Experiments 2 and 3 (in which variance or confidence where queried in addition) we find more balanced results; the models are at a tie in Experiment 2 and there is a small advantage favoring the mid-range model in Experiment 3. We also see, that except for Experiment 1b (which used skewed number distributions), the presence of variance-noise improved the model fits.   <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Same for the complex holistic midrange models.</p><p>First, we see a very high consistency between the simple-model classification and that based on trial by trial correlations between the models and the subject's estimates. Second, based on both models, we see that almost all subjects are classified as deploying a holistic estimation mechanism in Experiments 1a and 1b (only 2-3 out of 46 Ss were classified as midrange in these experiments). Consistent with the group data, we find that about half of the participants still use the holistic estimation in Experiments 2 and 3, when they are required to estimate not only the sequence-average but also its relative-variance (or to report their confidence).</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 10,</ref> the models' classifications account for the qualitative behavioral patterns in our experiments: the dependency of the precision-estimate (RMSD) on the sequence-length and on sequence-variance. As in the data, the sequence length effect was bigger in Experiments 1a and 1b (in which most participants were classified as holistic), compared to Experiments 2-3 (only about half of the participants holistic). This can be explained by the stronger sequence-length dependency in this model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. Models' best fit prediction. In order to test whether the models account for the sequence length and variance effect (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A &amp;</ref>  The classification results are also consistent with the ranked regression results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5)</ref>,</p><p>where we see a gradation in the fraction of participants that deploy, a holistic/normative vs.</p><p>a mid-range strategy, respectively. While in Experiment 1b, which presented numbers selected from skewed distributions, all the participants were classified as holistic/normative and they showed flat ranked regression weights, in all other experiments, there were some participants classified as mid-range. Moreover, we see that the fraction of participants using a mid-range strategy increases (and the fraction of those using a holistic estimation decreases) when the participants are required to monitor the sequence variance or the confidence in the average estimation. This is consistent with the increased weights given to the extreme values at the group level, in these two conditions and with the marked variability in the sequence-length effect (and its reduced effect magnitude in Experiments 2 and 3).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether estimation precision (RMSD) differs between participants who were classified to the holistic vs. mid-range (this was done only for Experiments 2-3, where there roughly an equal number of participants were classified for both models). An un paired t-test indicates that holistic subjects were significantly more precise than mid-range subjects, t(46)=2.19, p&lt;.05, in their sequence-average estimations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. Performance-strategy difference. RMSD as a function of model classification. The significant difference indicates that participants who used the holistic strategy performed better at the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In four experiments we have shown that human observers can make quite accurate estimations of the average of rapid sequences of two digit numbers presented at a rate of 4/sec (as quantified by Pearson correlations in the range of .7-.8, between actual and estimated averages). Moreover, we show that the observers are able to estimate, in addition, the relative variance of the sequence (high, medium or low): the average Spearman correlation between estimated and actual (relative) variance was 0.74. Furthermore, the observers speed and confidence in the estimation of the average decreased with the variance of the sequence. These results demonstrate that the remarkable ability to extract summary statistics of perceptual sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ariely, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bronfman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chong &amp; Treisman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dakin, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Haberman &amp; Whitney, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Parkes et al., 2001</ref>), extends to rapid numerical sequences.</p><p>A central question that these results pose is the nature of the mechanism or strategy that the observers deploy to generate these estimates. Due to the rapid sequence presentation and the strict response-deadline we impose on response generation (3 sec, including the response on a continuous scale), we can exclude a fully analytical/symbolic strategy of adding the numbers and dividing by the sequence length, in favor of more intuitive estimation strategies. Two such "intuitive" strategies were considered in detail here. The first is the estimation of the center of mass from a noisy holistic (or frequency based)</p><p>representation of each sequence, and the second is an estimation based on few (efficiently selected) samples. For the former we have shown it to predict an improvement in precision with sequence-length and for the latter we distinguished between random sampling, which predicts a decreasing precision with sequence length, and a mid-range strategy which predicts a milder improvement <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>). Since most of the subjects in all experiments (and three out of our four experiments at the group level) show an improvement in precision with sequence-length (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A</ref>), this rules out the random sampling as an account for task performance in our experiments, leaving the holistic (or frequency) model and the midrange strategy, as more plausible candidates.</p><p>The most distinctive signature of the mid-range strategy (compared with the holistic/normative model) is the U-shape pattern in the decision weights of the ranked samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Spitzer, Waschke &amp; Summerfield, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vanunu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vanunu et al., 2020)</ref>. In all our experiments, except the one which utilized skewed distribution of numbers (experiment 1b), we found a small U-shaped modulation at the group level ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>), which was subject to marked individual differences <ref type="bibr">(Figures,</ref>. Model classification of individual subjects confirmed the presence of individual differences. While all the subjects were classified as utilizing the holistic mechanism in Experiment 1b (skewed distributions), we found that 12% were classified to utilize mid-range in Experiment 1a (uniform distribution), where this strategy is a viable one for the task.</p><p>Furthermore, the fraction of subjects that appear to utilize the mid-range strategy appears to increase in Experiments 2-3 (54%), in which the participants were asked to estimate the sequence relative spread or their confidence in the average estimation. Nevertheless, even in these experiments, almost half of the participants appear to rely on a holistic estimation.</p><p>These results parallel those obtained in tasks of probabilistic inference or in multiatribute decisions, in which the majority of participants rely on a holistic compensatory strategy of evaluation, while a minority rely on Take the Best <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Betsch &amp; Glöckner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brusovansky, Glickman, &amp; Usher, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Glöckner &amp; Betsch, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Newell &amp; Shanks, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Although we found that most observers deployed the holistic estimation mechanism, both estimation models can be subject to variations. For example, one can modify the holistic model so as to give differential attentional weights to numbers based on their values, while still summing over all items 9 . Similarly, one can modify the mid-range strategy by making it probabilistic, by including a probability parameter to fail in detecting the maximum/minimum in the sequence and then recursively select the value next in rank.</p><p>Future studies will be necessary to contrast such estimation mechanisms for the extraction of summary statistics of rapid numerical sequences and to characterize their individual differences. Below we discuss the relative efficiency of these two types of strategies, their relation with the two-pathway theory of numerical processing and the implications for the general field of decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation efficiency of numerical averaging and its computation</head><p>Work in numerical cognition, has highlighted the presence of two processes or pathways in number processing: i) exact vs. ii) approximate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dehaene, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dehaene &amp; Cohen, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>While the former is based on symbolic representation and on rule based operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ashcraft, 1992)</ref>, the latter is based on analog/magnitude representations and on perceptual type operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dehaene, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dehaene, Dehaene-Lambertz, &amp; Cohen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Piazza, Pinel, Bihan, &amp; Dehaene, 2007)</ref>. For example, both numerical symbols and numerosity (dot) displays activate the same distance-dependent approximate number representation in the parietal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Piazza et al., 2007)</ref>. Moreover, an analog representation of symbolic numbers is also supported by distance-effects in the comparison of symbolic numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dehaene, Dupoux, &amp; Mehler, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moyer &amp; Landauer, 1967)</ref> and by data from patients with dyscalculia <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dehaene &amp; Cohen, 1991)</ref>. Finally, it was suggested that this analog representation of magnitudes is part of a core system for numerical processing, which is shared with other animal species (and non-verbal humans) and grounds the processing of symbolic representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Feigenson, Dehaene, &amp; Spelke, 2004</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Verguts &amp; Fias, 2004</ref> for a computational modeling illustration).</p><p>While most previous work has focused on mathematical operations, such as addition or subtraction <ref type="bibr">(Barth et al., 2006)</ref>, here we have focused on averaging. Obviously, one way (a symbolic one) to compute an average is via summation and division by n. The numerical cognition literature discussed above, suggests an alternative type of estimation: a population averaging of the analog magnitude representation, as was shown to be possible for perceptual properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ariely, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chong &amp; Treisman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dakin, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Haberman &amp; Whitney, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Parkes et al., 2001</ref>). Thus the approximate and the exact pathways may map into the types of models we have contrasted here, with the exact pathway mapping on to the (rule-based) mid-range strategy, and the approximate pathway onto the holistic estimation of all (but noisy) samples. A central question that can be raised is which of these pathways or processes is more efficient for tasks that require the extraction of summary statistics from rapid sequences. Note that this is not straightforward, as the two processes face a tradeoff. While the holistic model takes all items into account, it is subject to significant encoding noise on each one. By contrast, the mid-range strategy, relies on only two items, but due to its symbolic nature is subject to minimal encoding noise. Motivated by this tradeoff, we have examined the data for association (across participants) between task precision and strategy use. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>, we found that participants who were classified to the holistic model, had a higher precision in the task. 10</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for decision-making</head><p>The obvious importance of having a mechanism that automatically extracts summary statistics of rapid sequences of numerical payoffs, is that one can rely on it for preference formation, in situations that do not require explicit estimations. Indeed, statistical summaries are central to normative preference, as formalized by the prominent risk-return model, according to which the attractiveness of a risky alternative is an additive function of the alternative's average reward and its riskthat is, between the mean and the variance of the payoff distribution <ref type="bibr">Weber, 2011)</ref>. While most frequently, preferences are probed via choices between sets of alternatives, in which the canonical models involve some type of accumulation over sampled valued <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bhatia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Krajbich, Lu, Camerer, &amp; Rangel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Roe, Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Stewart &amp; Simpson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Townsend &amp; Busemeyer, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2004)</ref>, it is also possible to probe relative preferences for individual alternatives using an analog (like) rating scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Krajbich et al., 2012</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Becker, Degroot &amp; Marschak, 1964</ref> for BDM procedure).</p><p>Moreover, recently risk-preferences have been probed using analog rating-scale for rapid sequences of payoffs. The results were well accounted by a risk-return model, in which the preference depends on the mean and the variance of the payoffs (the latter accounting for risk-biases). We propose that such summary statistics can be holistically computed in an automatic way when we are exposed to alternatives consisting of numerical sequences (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Betsch &amp; Glöckner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Betsch, Plessner, Schwieren &amp; Gutig, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brusovansky, Glickman, &amp; Usher, 2018)</ref>, contributing a general preference towards these alternatives.</p><p>Finally, the automatic extraction of summary statistics of sets of values (payoffs or affective attributes) can provide a mechanism for intuitive decisions or forecasts, in which participants appear to rely on "gut-feeling" resulting in decision outcome that sometimes exceed those of conscious deliberations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bechara &amp; Damasio, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dijksterhuis &amp; Nordgren, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lee, Amir &amp; Ariely, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pham, Lee &amp; Stephen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rusou, Zakay &amp; Usher, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Usher et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">but see Gonzalez-Vallejo, Lassiter, Bellezza &amp; Lindberg, 2008</ref>). numerical values which were presented with a presentation rate of 4 HZ and were uniformly distributed.

The mouse cursor was always at the middle of the circle at the beginning of the scale display, thus it had an equal distance from each point of the scale (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>). The reason we changed the scale from a ruler to a semicircle was so we could measure more precisely the reaction time of the average estimation without introducing anchoring bias. iii) Instead of evaluating the spread of the sequence, after evaluating the average, the participants were instructed to rate their confidence rate on a 1-4 scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Method</head><p>To apply the models to data, we had to make some assumptions on the response variability in these 4 models. For the simple normative-holistic model we have 2 noise parameters, an encoding noise 12 (which is applied for each item, and thus averages out as 1√2 with sequence length, from 6 to 12) and a global (or motor noise 13 ), which does not change with sequence length:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= + ( ∑ + =1</formula><p>) + , ~(0, 2 ) and ~(0, 2 ) (3)</p><p>where, xi is the i th item of the sequence, is the encoding noise and is the motor noise and a and b are intercept and slope parameters, respectively, that are used to map between the participant internal estimation to the external response scale.</p><p>For the more complex normative-holistic model we have three noise parameters. Additional to the motor noise (as before), the encoding now varies with the sequence-variance (two parameters instead of one):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= + ( ∑ + + • 2 =1</formula><p>) + , ~(0, 2 ), ~(0, 2 ) (4) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">~(0, 2 )</formula><p>where, xi is the i th item of the sequence, and are encoding noise parameters, is the motor noise and 2 is the sequence's variance.</p><p>In the simple mid-range model we only assumed the presence of global/motor noise, which does not depend on sequence length:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">= + ( + 2 ) + ,~(0, 2 )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where a is the intercept , b is the slope , and are the smallest and highest items of the sequence and is the motor noise.</p><p>In the complex mid-range model we assumed a 'calculation' noise which depends on the range of the sequence in addition to the global/motor noise, which does not depend on sequence length:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">= + ( + 2 + − 2 ) + ,~(0, 2 ) ~(0, 2 )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where a is the intercept , b is the slope , and are the smallest and highest items of the sequence, is the motor noise and is the calculation noise.</p><p>Thus, the simple holistic-normative model has four free parameters (slope, intercept, encoding/motor noises), while the simple mid-range model has three free parameters (slope, intercept, motor noise). For the complex models we added one more parameter for each model to allow variance dependent noise. These noise components are motivated by the holistic population-averaging model <ref type="bibr">(Brezis et al., 2017)</ref> in which the estimation of the center of mass of the population response depends on the variance of the sequence (peaked distributions are more precise than flat ones; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1C)</ref>. For the mid-range model, the variance dependent noise corresponds to a type of "calculation-error", which increases with the range. For each trial in the experiment, we analytically computed the probability distribution for an estimation (x) as a function of the sequence of numbers the participants received on that trial and the model parameters, and we collected the Log of the Probability for the response on that trial given model parameters. This Log-Probability was aggregated across all the trials, and we searched the model parameter space (using a combination of grid and Simplex; see Optimization procedure in Supplement) for the set of parameters with highest log-likelihood. The model selection was then based on maximum likelihood model fits, and for each participant the model with the lowest AIC/BIC was selected.</p><p>exhaustively, and for each set of parameters, , the likelihood was calculated based on a Gaussian probability distribution function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">( ) = ∏ 1 √2 =1 −1 2 ( − ) 2</formula><p>where is the number of trials, is the subject's estimated average in each trial, is the predicted average by the model excluding noise, and is the standard deviation such that 2 = 2 + 2 for the normative-holistic model (see equation 3) and 2 = 2 for the Mid-range model. The five parameters sets that had the highest likelihood were fed as starting points to a Simplex minimization routine, in which the cost function was defined as the negative log-likelihood.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">As we only aim to examine sensitivity to relative-variance (i.e, to ordinal comparison of variance magnitudes) this is the same as relative-SD, relative-spread (or dispersion). We will use this terms interchangeably in the text (but see Methods for how this was presented to participants).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">We assume that subjects are able to compute the average of 2-3 numbers with reasonable precision. 3 The term "analytic" refers to the fact that subject to WM-capacity limitation, one relies on a symbolic, rule-based and error less computation. However, since this strategy does not use all of the information available, one may also think of it as an intuitive one<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kruglanski &amp; Gigerenzer, 2011)</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">The Pearson correlation between actual and estimated values, and the RMSD (root mean square deviations) provide complementary but well correlated aspects of precision. The RMSD (but not the correlation) is affected by systematic biases, while correlation (but less the RMSD) is affected by the range of the values. Here we report both, but we focus on RMSD when examining differences in precision with sequence-length (as this variable affects the range).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">We also estimate the U-shape pattern by extracting a curvature parameter for the parabolic fit of the ranked regression, for each participant. We found a very high correlation (r=.93, p&lt;.001) between the curvature parameter and the difference between the mean of outlying and inlying ranks. SeeFigure S1in the Supplement.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">We intentionally used the term "spread" (rather than variance or SD), appealing to the subjects' preexperimental knowledge in order to prevent participants from engaging in an explicit computation.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">Note that despite the invariance of the encoding noise to sequence-length the estimation-precision improves with sequence-length due to noise-averaging (seeFig. 2). 8 The intercept can correspond to subjective biases in the mapping of the internal estimation to the external scale, while the slope to a 'regression to the mean' that is normative when the distribution of sequences is centered around a mid-range value (50 in our case).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="9">For example, we have explored a model in which the numbers are weighed with Beta functions over the interval 0-100.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="10">In principle a subject classified as Mid-range, can have better accuracy than one classified as Holistic, if the latter, resorts to a higher encoding noise. The results reported here indicate that this is not the case.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">As shown inFigure 4A, the mean of the actual sequences varies continuously in the range (30-70).</note>

The free parameters of the normative-holistic and the midrange models were fitted to the data of each participant separately, using maximum likelihood estimation. We first constructed an n-dimensional grid (n is the number of free parameters for each model), with ranging from -20 to 20 in increments of 10, ranging from 0 to 3 in increments of .75, (only for the normative-holistic model) and ranging from 0 to 10 with increments of 2.5, (complex normative-holistic model) and (complex mid-range model) ranging from 0 to 1 with increments of 0.1.

Correlations between curvature parameter for the parabolic fit of the ranked regression and the difference between the mean of outlying and inlying ranks.
