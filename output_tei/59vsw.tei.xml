				<p>This paper provides guidance and tools for conducting open and reproducible systematic reviews in psychology. It emphasizes the importance of systematic reviews for evidence-based decision-making and the growing adoption of open science practices. Open science enhances transparency, reproducibility, and minimizes bias in systematic reviews by sharing data, materials, and code. It also fosters collaborations and enables involvement of non-academic stakeholders. The paper is designed for beginners, offering accessible guidance to navigate the many standards and resources that may not obviously align with specific areas of psychology. It covers systematic review conduct standards, pre-registration, registered reports, reporting standards, and open data, materials and code. The paper is concluded with a glimpse of recent innovations like Community Augmented Meta-Analysis and independent reproducibility checks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As more and more studies are conducted on psychology topics, the body of relevant research literature grows. This is excellent news for practicing psychologists from various fields, such as clinical, educational, school, industrial and organizational, health, sports, that want their practice to be evidence-based. However, this increase in research output creates new, higher demands to gather, analyze, and synthesize the vast amount of available information. As such, conducting reliable, well-organized systematic reviews to synthesize findings is essential. is now facing the daunting task of meeting various, sometimes conflicting, standards.</p><p>Paradoxically, resources and guidance for open science practices are more available than ever, yet navigating them can be overwhelming, particularly as most resources were not developed with psychology research specifically in mind. Furthermore, the available resources are not always accessible to psychology researchers today due to jargon and specific terms from other disciplines, and they do not always tackle methodological issues common in psychology research. Indeed, psychology is methodologically diverse and heterogeneous both across, and within subdisciplines.</p><p>The purpose of the present paper is to provide guidance and tools to researchers</p><p>interested in conducting open and reproducible systematic reviews in psychology. This focus is deliberately narrow in order to make it accessible for beginners (e.g., a PhD student conducting their first systematic review), and our intent is to help navigate the available resources and standards rather than simply adding one more tricky tutorial to the pile. In a sense, this paper is thus an introductory meta-guide, helping the reader find the right resources for their research area. Those resources will then become a thorough introduction to systematic reviews and meta-analysis.</p><p>The paper has the following outline: first, we pose the important question of whether systematic review is the appropriate review method for your research question. In doing so, we highlight the strengths and limitations of systematic reviews. Next, we guide you through the process of making a systematic review open and reproducible, step by step, following current best practices (e.g., pre-registration of protocols, reporting standards).  Step-by-step visualization of the process and decisions involved in conducting an open and reproducible systematic review in school psychology, from research question to publication. Abbreviations: SR = Systematic review; RQ = Research question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step 1: Evaluate Whether a Systematic Review Fits Your Research Question</head><p>Before starting a systematic review you should ask yourself if this type of review is a good fit with your research question (see Step 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>). Literature reviews have always been an important part of scholarly research; historically, narrative reviews were written by subject experts. While already immensely useful in collating research findings, such reviews were limited by the inherent subjectivity in the selection of included literature and in the synthesis into conclusions. To combat this, Glass (1976) introduced a way to perform quantitative synthesis of research literature: the meta-analysis. The next great milestone was when the Cochrane Collaboration developed conduct standards for systematic reviews of clinical trials in the 1990s. Their goal was to remove subjectivity in the review process and to reduce biases in the synthesis, due to, for example, "cherry picking" studies to fit one's conclusions. If we fast-forward to 2024, systematic reviews are today the norm for clinical literature reviews, and are steadily becoming embraced as the most reliable and accurate way to synthesize findings by other disciplines, such as psychology.</p><p>Systematic reviews are characterized by following detailed, standardized methods on how to formulate specific and clear research questions, search the literature, assess the literature for quality and risk of bias, extracting and coding of data, and synthesizing the extracted data.</p><p>How the extracted data is synthesized depends on the data type. For quantitative data, meta-analysis can often be used. Sometimes the data cannot be meta-analyzed but instead displayed graphically, or in a table. On the other hand, qualitative data can be synthesized using qualitative/narrative (yet still systematic!) methods. Systematic reviews thus have a very specific purpose, and are not intended to replace other types of reviews, such as scoping reviews that aim to give a broad overview of a larger topic (see e.g., JBI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Peters et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Systematic reviews enable researchers to ask highly specific questions about the literature. For example, in the case of intervention studies, the review question is formulated using the PICO framework, where the Population, Intervention type, Comparison, and Outcomes are precisely defined. This requires a razor sharp research question and strong foundational knowledge about the research literature. However, even if you do not plan on conducting an intervention review, considering the PICO framework can be very helpful (see e.g., Nishikawa-Pacher, 2022); it can clarify the review question and save both time and effort in preparing the search and screening strategies. If your research question is too vague to be turned into a precise review question, a systematic review is probably not your best option.</p><p>A systematic review also takes considerable time to complete (at least a year; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Higgins et al., 2023b)</ref>, so if you do not have that much time available (and are prepared to sacrifice some rigor) a rapid review <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Garritty et al., 2021)</ref>) might be more suitable. Furthermore, a systematic review is not a one-person show; it requires a team of at least one content expert, one systematic review method expert and one literature retrieval expert (i.e., a university librarian). It is also recommended that at least screening, data extraction, and coding is performed by a minimum of two researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Higgins et al., 2023b)</ref>.</p><p>Provided that you have made sure that you do, indeed, want to conduct a systematic review, our guide will help you ensure that it is also open, transparent and reproducible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step 2: Choose conduct standards based on your research question</head><p>The next thing you should ask yourself is what type of conduct standards for systematic reviews you will want to follow (see Step 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>). We recommend one of the following three conduct standards: the Cochrane Collaboration's MECIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Higgins et al., 2023a)</ref>, the Campbell Collaboration's MECCIR (The Methods Group of the Campbell Collaboration [Campbell Collaboration], 2016), or NIRO-SR <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Topor &amp; Pickering et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Most readers likely know of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of</head><p>Interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Higgins et al., 2023b)</ref>, regardless of working with healthcare interventions or not.</p><p>The Cochrane Handbook is the official (and very detailed) guide to the process of conducting and maintaining clinical systematic reviews. In order to fulfill the standard, each Cochrane Intervention Review has to meet the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Review (MECIR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Higgins et al., 2023a)</ref>. If your research question concerns a health intervention, MECIR is often a great choice, even though it is not necessarily tailored specifically to research in psychology. However, most of clinical and health psychology is methodologically similar enough for research to find the resources useful and easy to apply to their research questions. Step 3: Pre-registration It is becoming more and more endorsed to pre-register one's planned study when conducting primary empirical research. Not surprising, as there are plenty of benefits, both for the author(s) and for the research field as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Nosek et al., 2018)</ref>. Pre-registering prevents several types of questionable research practices that can increase false positives (see <ref type="bibr">John et al.,</ref> 2012 for an overview), including optional stopping, p-hacking, and hypothesizing after the results are known (HARKing).</p><p>One might think that pre-registrations are redundant for systematic reviews; after all, the data already exists so there is not really a hypothesis that needs to be pre-registered before the data collection. The authors are not entirely blind to what the data will show as they have already read many of the most influential studies before deciding to conduct a systematic review.</p><p>Furthermore, the point of a systematic review is to find all relevant studies and synthesize them, so how could there be any risk of bias? We would like to argue that systematic reviews are among the most important studies to pre-register. The reason is that there are an infinite amount of small choices when conducting a systematic review, all of which will shape the final synthesis. Small changes to the inclusion criteria in population (e.g., age cut-off), type of intervention (e.g., short or medium length), comparison (e.g., types of control groups), outcomes (e.g., single or aggregate measures) and study types (e.g., randomized control trials or quasi-experimental studies) all combine to a staggering amount of researcher's degrees of freedom to reach any conclusion they want, unless the literature is crystal clear, which is rarely the case. It is this realization that has led to pre-registration (in this context often called prospective registration) to become best practice for systematic reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Stewart et al., 2012)</ref>, and also increasingly more common, with over 30 000 registrations already in 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Page et al., 2018)</ref>. Similarly, the Generalized Systematic Review Registration Form (van den Akker et al., 2023), has been used to pre-register 2860 protocols in the year it has been available as a template on the Open Science Framework. Pre-registration is not only useful to prevent the risk of bias when conducting a systematic review, but it is also tremendously helpful for you as the author. Systematic reviews are, unlike primary studies, meant to be updated as new studies almost inevitably are published.</p><p>By the time you have conducted your first batch of screening, data extraction, and analysis, reaching the moment to submit your publication, it is likely that enough time has passed that you need to update the searches and screen the new studies found. By committing to writing and registering a clear, detailed pre-registration from the very beginning, you ensure that you have an easy-to-follow recipe to follow whenever you want to update your review. The pre-registration process is outlined in Step 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Select a Pre-Registration Route</head><p>When conducting a systematic review, there are three different routes to pre-registration (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>): registered reports, published protocol, or independent pre-registration.</p><p>The strongest route is a registered report. This involves you submitting your entire introduction and method section as planned and then getting editor and reviewer feedback before conducting any searches or screening of the literature. After adjustments based on their feedback, you will get an in-principle-acceptance before you conduct the review, meaning that you are ensured to publish once the systematic review is done. When you submit the finished report, the reviewers will check for any deviations from your stage 1 submission. The upside of registered reports is that it not only prevents the above-mentioned researcher's degrees of freedom, but also a lot of publication bias, as the publisher cannot reject your systematic review due to lack of findings. The downside is that the process from registered report to published review takes a long time, and it might not be feasible to pause your review when awaiting reviewer feedback.</p><p>Furthermore, you have to follow the standards the publisher has set out for registered reports.</p><p>These might be more adapted to empirical studies, so you should make sure to submit to a journal that is also specialized in publishing systematic reviews.</p><p>An interesting new way of publishing a registered report is submitting to the Peer Community In Registered Reports. The entire process is then handled by a peer community, and once the systematic review is finished, you get to pick from a list of journals which to publish in.</p><p>The second route is to write a full systematic review protocol and formally publish it before conducting the review. Some journals allow this (e.g., Campbell Systematic Reviews, Meta-Psychology). This route is quite similar to doing a registered report, but you do not always have the same guarantee that the journal will also accept your final systematic review once it is done. Additionally, similar to registered reports, this process can be quite slow, and you will have to wait until you have published your protocol to begin conducting the review. A clear upside is that you will get to publish your systematic review protocol in a scientific journal. This can be a good experience and strong motivator, especially for early career researchers. Another benefit is the rigorous standards and formats, which can provide support to researchers feeling unsure about the methodology.</p><p>The third route is to independently pre-register a systematic review protocol in an online registry (such as the Open Science Framework, OSF). On the one hand, this route allows the flexibility to conduct the review at your own pace, and it gives you the freedom to select which standards and templates are best suited for your specific systematic review. The downside is that this route does not guarantee you a publication. If your results are not deemed interesting by reviewers, your systematic review might be hard to publish. Furthermore, whereas pre-registering an empirical study sometimes only involves a few paragraphs of hypothesis, design and statistical analyses, pre-registrations for systematic reviews requires a full protocol.</p><p>This typically requires a short introduction as well as a full method section. It thus resembles what you would submit as a registered report if you were to conduct an empirical study. Indeed, once you have written your protocol, you might find yourself in a position where it makes more sense to submit this to a journal than to independently pre-register it.</p><p>While the first two routes (registered reports and published protocols) are the ideal approaches in terms of transparency and minimizing bias, we acknowledge that the third route of independent pre-registrations is for many authors and many review topics the most realistic as a starting point. It is also the route with the most options open for the authors, and thus has the biggest need for support. As such, it is the route that the remainder of this article is focused on. If you decide on one of the first two routes, all later steps in the process will be outlined in detail by the publisher or journal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Write the protocol</head><p>When writing your protocol that you aim to pre-register, you should select a template that matches the conduct standard for your systematic review (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>). If you follow the Cochrane Collaboration's MECIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Higgins et al., 2023a)</ref>, we recommend using the PROSPERO <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Booth et al., 2011)</ref> protocol template, as they are designed to work together. It consists of a number of items that aids you in planning your review for each stage (searches, screening, data extraction, etc.), and together with the conduct standards, you can be sure that you have written a useful protocol that is both easy for you to follow, and easy for others to understand.</p><p>If you are following MECCIR (Campbell Collaboration, 2016), we instead recommend using the Generalized Systematic Review Registration Form (van den Akker et al., 2023), which is available as a pre-registration template on OSF. The Generalized Systematic Review Registration Form is quite similar to the PROSPERO protocol template, but more flexible, detailed and exhaustive. This is especially useful when you're investigating an area that is more complex or heterogeneous than clinical trials. It has purposefully been designed to work for any type of systematic review, in any academic subject, quantitative or qualitative, and is thus a good default when specialized templates aren't available for your research topic. Despite being released only a year ago, the template has already been used to pre-register 2860 systematic reviews, and is thus already a popular alternative.</p><p>If you instead follow the NIRO-SR conduct standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Topor &amp; Pickering et al., 2023)</ref>, there is a specific protocol template created for it that you should follow, and that can also be registered on OSF. It provides a comprehensive list of elements that should be specified within a systematic review protocol. The NIRO-SR template also includes a short list of answers to commonly asked questions for those authors who are new to protocol pre-registration.</p><p>Regardless of which protocol template you choose, your pre-registration will include detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., what population to search for) as well as clear instructions on how to conduct the review (e.g., screening instructions, data instructions). It is important to also create the materials you will use when conducting the review. In particular, you should set up the data extraction sheets (or similar tool), and pre-register them as well. The same goes for the risk of bias tools that will be used. Finally, before pre-registering, it is important to always pilot your protocol and the materials.</p><p>It is essential to pre-register your protocol in a trusted public repository specifically designed for this purpose. This ensures it is time-stamped and that it cannot be altered without the changes being tracked. The PROSPERO protocol should be registered in the PROSPERO registry <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Booth et al., 2011)</ref>. Note that the PROSPERO registry does not allow any systematic review protocols that do not have some type of health as their outcome. For example, if you are conducting an intervention study for students with ADHD and your primary outcome is school achievement, it cannot be pre-registered in PROSPERO. In that case, and any other case, you should instead pre-register it on OSF. This is also the registry we recommend for Generalized Systematic Review Report Form (van den Akker et al., 2023) and NIRO-SR <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Topor &amp; Pickering et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Step 4: Conduct the systematic review After pre-registering your protocol, it is now time to conduct your systematic review (see</p><p>Step 4 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>). Similar to conducting original research, systematic reviews begin with data collection, which entails a systematic search in selected databases and other repositories. To ensure reproducibility, it is necessary to provide detailed search strategies for each database.</p><p>PRISMA-S extension <ref type="bibr">(Rethlefsen et al., 2021</ref>) provides a checklist of information you need to report for a reproducible literature search. Keep in mind that databases have various levels of precision when it comes to reference search and not all search strategies will always retrieve identical numbers of references. To mitigate this, it is best that you save raw files of downloaded references and upload them to the repositories along with the search strategies. That way, anyone can reproduce the rest of your review on the same dataset. Keeping a detailed track of your search strategies also simplifies the process of updating your search and enables other researchers to re-use your material. The next step involves screening titles and abstracts. Screening can be done however one prefers, but today there are many screening tools which streamline this process and allow transparency in reporting. Sadly, many of them are paid proprietary software. As of now, we recommend Rayyan <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ouzzani, 2016)</ref> as the free alternative, as it allows selecting exclusion criteria, annotating, and labeling studies and exporting this data in various spreadsheet and reference formats that facilitates transparency of the screening stage. If you are multiple screeners (which we highly recommend that you are), your individual decisions will be recorded and not just the final verdict. We recommend exporting separate files for excluded and included studies and uploading both as supplemental materials.</p><p>The next phase involves reading the full articles. At the time of writing, we are not aware of any free tools that we can recommend. However, for most research questions, the number of full texts to read is going to be less than a hundred, and thus this stage can be successfully documented using any sheet software (such as Google Sheets, Excel, etc.) and the free-to-use reference tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zotero (2023)</ref>, which has a built-in PDF reader. We have relied on that option in a project with around two thousand fulltext and it has still worked smoothly.</p><p>Next, you will extract data from the full text articles and enter into data extraction sheets.</p><p>In order to make data extraction reproducible and transparent, you should apply the same logic of doing things in small steps, as the systematic review itself rests on. For example, during data extraction, it might be tempting to simply copy an effect size that is reported in the right format (e.g., Cohen's d). However, this puts the calculation of the effect size into a black box. Instead, you should copy the means and standard deviations, noting the page number in the article from which you retrieved them, and calculate it yourself.</p><p>We strongly recommend using reproducible R-scripts for any data wrangling or calculations of effect sizes. They also allow you to do reproducible meta-analyses. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lakens et al. (2016)</ref> for further guidance on the reproducibility of meta-analyses.</p><p>Through the process of conducting your systematic review you are almost guaranteed to arrive at situations where your protocol does not give clear guidance, or where it is simply impossible to follow. You might even realize that you have made a mistake in the protocol. There is no reason to panic. Deviations from pre-registrations are sometimes needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lakens, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Simply make a note of every deviation (what it is and why) immediately when they arise. If they are major, we recommend pausing your review and updating your pre-registration with a new version that explains and justifies the deviation. However, small deviations can simply be mentioned in the final paper.</p><p>Step 5: Report the systematic review, openly share data and materials, and publish it open access and/or as a pre-print After successfully having completed the systematic review, it's time to decide what to report in the manuscript. As the systematic review method is characterized by rigor, so too is the reporting. The reporting standards ensure that the systematic review itself is open and transparent enough to be helpful for readers (e.g., what authors have done exactly), and that it can be adequately scrutinized by a third party. In addition, it guides review teams in what to report of the conducted review, making sure that no stone is left unturned.</p><p>The most notable standard is PRISMA, The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses <ref type="bibr">(Page et al., 2021)</ref>; likely the most used standard today. It was originally created to counteract poor reporting of systematic reviews. It also has an extension, PRISMA-S <ref type="bibr">(Rethlefsen et al., 2021)</ref>, which covers even more details to increase reproducibility.</p><p>We recommend review teams to follow PRISMA, and to use the item checklist for preparing the manuscript. Because PRISMA is so widely disseminated, it is also compatible with many pre-registration templates. This is important as this ensures that all necessary items in the pre-registration are cared for when time has come for the reporting of the systematic review.</p><p>The Generalized System Review Registration Form (van den Akker et al., 2023) is compatible with PRISMA and even shows the equivalent PRISMA item for each item in the registration form. Likewise, the pre-registration protocol following NIRO-SR is also PRISMA compliant and will make sure that you do not miss something in the pre-registration stage that later should be reported.</p><p>Researchers more accustomed to APA may instead choose the reporting standard APA style JARS Quantitative Meta-Analysis Article Reporting Standards Information Recommended for Inclusion in Manuscripts Reporting Quantitative Meta-Analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Appelbaum et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Some journals might also require this. Fortunately, it is very similar to PRISMA and you should not have any problems following APA JARS reporting if you have pre-registered your systematic review with either The Generalized Systematic Review Registration Form or NIRO-SR.</p><p>A downside to pre-registering and conducting systematic reviews independently is the risk of publication bias. Simply put, your review might not be published because it did not find what reviewers and editors find interesting. An inconclusive meta-analysis, for example, might be viewed as something that should be revisited after more studies have been conducted, rather than be published in its current form. Publication bias of this kind is detrimental to science, and the best way to avoid it is to make sure to publish your article as a pre-print prior to submission.</p><p>Any systematic review in psychology can be published for free in PsyArxiv. Furthermore, there now exist several journals committed to policies to ignore the findings and novelty of articles, where you can also publish your article (e.g., Collabra Psychology, Meta-Psychology)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Share the materials and data</head><p>Together with your article, it is important to share the materials and data openly. This ensures that other researchers can reproduce your findings, which also increases its trustworthiness. It also ensures that other researchers can update your review when new studies are published. Uploading your data and materials to public repositories like OSF allows it to be cited and shared by the scientific community, which in the end benefits everyone.</p><p>Unlike primary research, systematic reviews rely on secondary data. This means that obstacles to sharing data otherwise common in psychology research (such as patient anonymity) are eliminated. Most often reviews aim to synthesize aggregated data and extract descriptions available in research reports, which means that the data does not have to be anonymized and there are no ethical constraints to data sharing. While data is generally considered "shared" in systematic reviews and meta-analyses by providing summary tables or forest plots of effect sizes, this is often not enough to reproduce the analyses. Instead, you should aim to share as much as possible of your search strings, search results, screening results, the raw data extraction sheets, the risk of bias tool, the code to wrangle data and/or calculate effect sizes. You should also publish the code to reproduce the meta-analyses if you have done any. Simply put, share everything that allows you to reproduce your entire research process.</p><p>Make sure to publish your materials and data in a trusted repository (we recommend OSF) that provides DOIs (digital object identifiers), include meta-data that describes your dataset, and allows for a data dictionary <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Buchanan et al., 2021)</ref> that explains the contents of the data. This will ensure that your data is FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable <ref type="bibr">(Wilkinson et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this article we have provided you with guidance on how to follow open science practices when conducting a systematic review in psychology. In doing so, you will reduce the risk of bias in your systematic review and make it much easier for you, or someone else, to update your systematic review. Open science practices improves the trustworthiness of research by allowing anyone, including researchers, practitioners, science writers or patients, to not have to take your word for it and be able to verify your research methods. By opening up the research process to anyone, the threshold for non-researchers to participate is lowered, and this lays the grounds for citizen science, where non-researchers take part in the process. This is particularly important for systematic reviews that tend to strongly influence policy and decision-making.</p><p>Thanks to open science practices, you can invite stakeholders to join your team and give input throughout the entire process.</p><p>What we have described in this article are the beginner steps to improve open science practices in systematic reviews. We are confident that these small steps will make a huge difference, and that the first steps are the most important to take.</p><p>As open science practices become more common, we will likely see more mature and advanced practices develop. Independent reproducibility checks by an external party (e.g., by a data editor at a journal) are made possible with open science practices and will make sure that the review is not only transparent, but also reproduces without errors. Some journals already require it (e.g., Meta-Psychology), and some universities have started doing this as support to their researchers.</p><p>With the advent of new software solutions, the entire systematic review can be made into a fully reproducible report where the reader can repeat any stage. In Community Augmented Meta-Analyses (CAMAs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tsuji et al., 2014)</ref>, for example, the review is uploaded to an online repository and made reproducible, and interactive through a web application. This means that in addition to verifying the process behind your conclusions, they can also interact and "play around" with the analyses. For example, if a systematic review was about bullying's effect on anxiety ages 7 -18, and an interested practitioner wants to get the results specifically for children 7 -12, it can be done with just a few clicks in the web app, without requiring any extensive knowledge of statistics. Furthermore, it is possible to update the review (i.e., to augment it) when new data comes in. With the rise of better AI tools, we might, in the not so far future, even see this become partially automated.</p><p>In conclusion, our hope is that this simple guide provides psychology researchers with the first building blocks for an inspiring future. A future where systematic reviews are not only transparent and reproducible, but also invites researchers and practitioners from across the world to help improve them to the highest standard. A standard which, most importantly, is essential for trustworthy and safe evidence-based decisions when practicing psychology.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The equivalent guide and methodological expectations for social science interventions is provided by the Campbell Collaboration. The Methodological Expectations of Campbell Collaboration Reviews (MECCIR; (The Methods Group of the Campbell Collaboration, 2016)) is heavily based on the Cochrane Handbook but is developed to suit intervention reviews that are not health or medicine related. If your research question pertains to any type of educational, or social intervention, MECCIR is an excellent choice. While the two options above cover systematic reviews of interventions, many topics studied in psychology do not easily lend themselves to intervention studies. If you want to conduct a systematic review of non-interventional psychology studies, you will need different guidelines and conduct standards. Luckily, the framework of Non-Intervention, Reproducible, and Open Systematic Reviews (NIRO-SR; Topor et al., 2023) was recently proposed for this exact purpose. It is developed to be accessible to authors who have little experience with systematic reviews. Importantly, NIRO-SR places great focus on open and reproducible methodology and it is compatible with other common evidence synthesis standards. If your research question calls for a non-intervention systematic review, we strongly recommend following NIRO-SR.</figDesc></figure>
