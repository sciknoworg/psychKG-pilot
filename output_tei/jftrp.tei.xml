			<abstract>
				<p>Impairments in reward-related behavior in everyday life are characteristic of major depressive disorder and closely linked with anhedonia. While previous research has suggested a negative relationship between reward-related behavior and symptoms of depression or anhedonia, findings across clinical and non-clinical studies are mixed. We conducted three online studies, recruiting a combined 629 nonpatient online participants. The studies consisted of an exploratory study, a preregistered replication, and data from a separate study utilizing a distinct learning task. Participants completed reinforcement learning tasks where they learned to select either the more rewarding response or more rewarding stimulus, as well as a large set of self-report measures of symptoms and traits. Contrary to expectations, we observed a positive association between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia symptoms across all three studies. General depression symptoms showed one positive association and two null associations with performance. Our results contrast with the assumption of a negative association between reinforcement learning behavior and symptoms of depression or anhedonia. Instead, our results suggest that in large non-selective samples, anhedonia symptoms can be positively associated with reward-guided learning and decisionmaking.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Deficits in reward-guided behavior are a core characteristic of major depressive disorder (MDD) and are closely associated with anhedonia, defined as a lack of interest and pleasure in normally rewarding experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Association, 2013)</ref>. These impairments are often attributed to disruptions in reinforcement learning, which guides adaptive decisionmaking based on feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Husain and Roiser, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Huys et al., 2013)</ref>. Despite this connection, experimental studies utilizing common reward learning paradigms have yielded inconsistent findings, reporting a mix of negative and null associations between symptoms and performance in both clinical and non-clinical populations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brolsma et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Moutoussis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pike and Robinson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vrizzi et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>In research on major depressive disorder, anhedonia has emerged as an important focus due to its association with poor treatment outcomes and long-term prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(McMakin et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rizvi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Vrieze et al., 2014)</ref>. Anhedonia is also of particular interest because it is observed in other mental health conditions beyond MDD, including schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and substance use disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Shankman et al., 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, brain imaging studies have reported anatomical changes associated with transdiagnostic anhedonia severity, such as decreased striatal volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Husain and Roiser, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Schaub et al., 2021</ref>) and potential differences in task-evoked brain activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Husain and Roiser, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Understanding how anhedonia interacts with processes like reinforcement learning is thus important for improving our understanding of these disorders and informing treatment development.</p><p>To investigate the relationship between reinforcement learning, depression, and anhedonia, we conducted three online studies with over 600 participants. We employed two different learning tasks, with features designed to minimize the influence of working memory and thus increase the relative contribution of reinforcement learning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collins and Frank, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wimmer and Poldrack, 2022)</ref>. Contrary to expectations, we consistently found a positive association between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia symptoms. This relationship was observed in an initial study, confirmed in a preregistered replication, and extended to an independent dataset employing a distinct learning paradigm. This unexpected finding challenges common assumptions about behavioral measures of reinforcement learning and anhedonia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>Participants were recruited from the online platform Prolific. Eligibility criteria included residing in the United Kingdom, being between 18-38 years old, and fluency in English.</p><p>No mental health-related screening was used. Informed consent was obtained in a manner approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (Approval ID No.: 3451/001). Participants accessed the experiment via a web browser on a computer (excluding phones and tablets). Participants were compensated at a rate of £8.21 per hour, plus bonus earnings based on the learning and test phases in the tasks. Study 2 was preregistered prior to the collection of data (https://osf.io/du4vk).</p><p>Data for Study 3 came from a separate study focusing on goal-directed behavior (preregistration: https://osf.io/x3z5f) where the reward learning task was included as part of an additional set of tasks.</p><p>Participants were excluded based on poor task performance or failure to pass criteria for (in)frequency catch questions embedded within the questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Zorowitz et al., 2023)</ref>; see Supplemental Methods for details. In study 1, out of a total of 143 participants with complete data, 133 participants remained for symptom-related analyses (52.6% female; mean age 30.4 ± 5.0 years). In study 2, out of a total of 146 participants with complete data, 130 participants remained for symptom-related analyses (62.3% female; mean age 30.2 ± 5.0 years). In study 3, out of a total of 456 participants with complete data, 366 participants remained for symptom-related analyses (51.4% female; mean age 30.3 ± 5.2 years). In studies 1 and 2, participants were recruited for a two-session study; the first session was composed of the learning and test phases, while the brief second session which followed seven days later included only test phases. In study 3, participants were invited 1-3 days after completing a preceding two-day study. Questionnaire data for study 3 were collected during the second day of the preceding study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Tasks</head><p>All experiments were programmed in JavaScript using the JsPsych library <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(de Leeuw, 2015</ref>). In studies 1 and 2, we used a reward learning task paradigm adapted from previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wimmer et al., 2018)</ref>. The paradigm involved learning reward or loss associations for single stimuli, enabling rapid acquisition of stimulus-value associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wimmer et al., 2018)</ref>. Preregistered hypotheses focus on the choice test phase. Study 3 used an alternative and common two-armed bandit reinforcement learning task. In all studies, reward or loss associations were fixed across learning. In all studies, participants rated their current mood (happiness) before and after the task, while in studies 1 and 2, participants occasionally rated mood during learning after feedback.</p><p>In study 1 and 2, participants' goal was to learn the best response for each of eight unique stimuli to maximize their reward. After learning, participants completed a choice test phase and a stimulus-reward ratings phase. See Supplementary Methods for complete information. Stimuli were pseudorandomly intermixed across 16 repetitions (128 total trials). For each learning trial, participants chose between the options "Yes" and "No" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1a)</ref>. For reward-associated stimuli, the optimal response ('Yes') would lead to a mean reward of £0.50 on 75% of trials and zero otherwise, with reversed outcomes for the alternative response ('No'). For loss-associated stimuli, the optimal response ('No') would lead to zero on 75% of trials and a mean loss of -£0.50 otherwise. For two 'neutral' stimuli, both responses led to zero outcomes. Note that neutral stimuli had not been included in previous versions of this task but were added here to examine a separate question specifically addressed in the post-learning ratings phase (https://osf.io/du4vk). In the early part of the learning phase, participants were presented with occasional mood ratings (happiness) following feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Rutledge et al., 2014)</ref>. Depending on performance, between 1-4 ratings were collected following both 1) reward feedback for a correct response for reward stimuli, and 2) loss feedback for an incorrect response for loss stimuli.</p><p>After learning, participants completed the first half of a mental health questionnaire battery and then completed a choice test phase, our primary behavioral measure. Participants were presented with two options from the learning phase and were instructed to select the option that would lead to a better outcome <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1b)</ref>.</p><p>Feedback was not presented, but participants were informed that their choices would contribute to their earnings. Choice confidence ratings were also collected after choice.</p><p>Participants then completed a reward-and loss association ratings phase. For each stimulus, participants entered a response on a graded scale ranging from "100% loss" to "100% win". Finally, participants completed the second half of the questionnaire battery.</p><p>Approximately one week after the completion of study 1 and 2, participants were invited to return for a follow-up session. This session included a choice test phase, partially composed of novel choices, and a repetition of the reward ratings phase. An error in list creation led to the loss of choice data for approximately 30 participants in study 2.</p><p>In study 3, participants completed a two-armed bandit learning task, a widely used reinforcement learning paradigm ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c)</ref>; see Supplementary Methods for complete information. Six stimulus pairs were pseudorandomly intermixed across 18 repetitions (108 total trials). Participants learned to select the more frequently rewarded stimulus in each pair (78% versus 22% reward probability). Feedback was only provided for the chosen option. Unlike studies 1 and 2, no post-learning choice test or ratings phases were collected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-report Measures</head><p>In all studies, participants completed a battery of mental health questionnaires: the Zung </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral analysis</head><p>Behavioral analyses were conducted in MATLAB 2024b. Results are from the following analyses: paired t-tests, Pearson correlations, Spearman rank correlations, and linear regressions. In studies 1 and 2, learning performance was calculated for positive and negative stimuli separately, for each repetition, averaging the proportion of learning phase trials which correctly selected the optimal option. To examine whether test phase choices were related to symptoms, we calculated choice test performance as accuracy for choices between reward-and loss-associated stimuli. Given the highly skewed distribution, we used Spearman rank correlation to examine correlations with mental health questionnaires. Partial correlation was used to examine the addition of covariates.</p><p>In study 3, average learning performance was calculated across all pairs and trials. Pearson correlation was used to examine correlations with mental health questionnaires. Linear regression was used to test for the addition of covariates. No post-learning phases were collected in this experiment. A reinforcement learning model was also fit to the data; see Supplemental Methods for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Our analyses focus on the relationship between reinforcement learning performance and depression symptoms. After collecting data for study 1 (n = 133), we preregistered hypotheses for a replication experiment, study 2 (n = 130; https://osf.io/du4vk). To further confirm these findings and assess generalizability to a different type of learning task, we analyzed data from an independent experiment, study 3.</p><p>Studies 1 and 2. In studies 1 and 2, participants learned to select the optimal response over time for each of eight abstract stimuli, followed by choice test and ratings phases.</p><p>This learning paradigm has previously been used to investigate reward association learning and generalization assessed in post-learning measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wimmer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wimmer and Poldrack, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012)</ref>. For reward-associated ('reward') stimuli, the optimal response ("Yes") would lead to a mean reward of £0.50 on 75% of trials and zero otherwise, with reversed outcomes for the alternative response ("No"). For loss-associated ('loss') stimuli, the optimal response ("No") would lead to zero on 75% of trials and a mean loss of -£0.50 otherwise. Learning for rewardassociated stimuli proceeded rapidly, consistent with previous findings. An overall bias to initially respond "Yes" resulted in performance for reward stimuli starting near asymptote (study 1 first trial mean ± SEM 79.3 ± 2.1%; study 2 mean 79.8 ± 2.1%), while performance for loss stimuli approached asymptote after four repetitions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure   S1</ref>). This rapid initial learning was expected, and thus our individual differences analyses were planned to focus on test phase choices. By the end of learning, in study 1 performance for reward stimuli reached 81.5 ± 2.1% (last four repetitions) and performance for loss stimuli reached 80.3 ± 2.2%. In study 2, performance for reward stimuli reached 83.5 ± 1.9% and performance for loss stimuli at the end of learning reached 77.8 ± 2.2%. goal was to learn which response ("Yes" or "No") usually led to a better outcome for a given stimulus. For some stimuli, the best outcome was a reward (example shown above), while for other stimuli, the best outcome was avoidance of a loss. b) Test phase choice trial design for studies 1 and 2. Participants were instructed to choose the stimulus that would lead to a better outcome. Feedback was not presented. c) The twoarmed bandit paradigm used in study 3. Participants' goal was to learn to select the stimulus in each of six pairs that more likely led to reward.</p><p>Following the learning phase, participants completed a choice test phase without feedback <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1b)</ref>, which is the focus of the preregistration of study 2. We examined performance for choices composed of individual reward-and loss-associated stimuli.</p><p>Test accuracy was 87.8 ± 1.7% in study 1 and 86.3 ± 1.8% in study 2. In study 1, test performance correlated positively with several measures of depression symptoms: the MASQ anhedonic depression subscale (hereafter "anhedonia"; replication, study 2, we also found that test performance was positively correlated with anhedonia symptoms (MASQ r = 0.187, p = 0.033, rank correlation; <ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figure   S2</ref>). The next-strongest correlation was with positive valence symptoms (PVSS; r = -0.151, p = 0.087; <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref>). Test performance was not correlated with general depression symptoms (SDS; r = -0.0024, p = 0.979).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. a) Correlation between anhedonia (MASQ anhedonic depression subscale)</head><p>and choice test performance in study 1. b) Correlation between anhedonia and choice test performance in the preregistered replication study 2. The black line represents the line of best fit, while each dot represents an individual participant, with darker shading indicating overlap; dots were jittered slightly along the x-axis for visualization purposes.</p><p>Mood ratings ("happiness") were collected prior to the task in all experiments, and in studies 1 and 2, we also collected occasional mood ratings immediately after feedback during learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Rutledge et al., 2014)</ref>. A pre-learning baseline mood rating allows us to examine the influence of overall mood on performance. Across all scales, baseline mood ratings showed the strongest negative correlations with the anhedonia scale and, in study 1, the STAI scale ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S3)</ref>. Importantly, we found that the positive correlation between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia remained significant with the inclusion of baseline mood ratings in the regression model (study 1, p = 0.003; study 2, p = 0.0373), while performance was not correlated with baseline mood (p-values &gt; 0.622). Separately, we found initial evidence that mood fluctuations after feedback were negatively related to anhedonia symptoms, but this was not replicated in study 2 (Supplementary Results).</p><p>After the learning, participants also completed a stimulus rating phase, indicating on a graded scale how strongly each stimulus was associated with reward versus loss.</p><p>While preregistered analyses focused on choice test performance, these ratings may help understand the relationship between anhedonia and reinforcement learning. We found no consistent relationship between anhedonia and ratings or the difference in ratings (study 1 reward minus loss ratings, r = 0.166, p = 0.057; study 2, r = 0.0273, p = 0.758). These results suggest that either the ratings do not capture as clear a measure of valuation as test phase choices, possibly due to their lack of incentivization and widely varying individual differences in usage of the scale, or that anhedonia may specifically affect decision processes engaged during choices.</p><p>Approximately one week after the initial learning session, participants were invited to a follow-up session. Here, participants completed another round of choices between reward-and loss-associated stimuli and again provided reward ratings for stimuli. In study 1, 124 of 133 participants returned. In study 2, 113 of 130 participants returned; however, a list-generation error resulted in the loss of choice test data for many participants, leaving usable data for 83 participants. In study 1, the positive correlation between test performance and anhedonia symptoms remained significant after a one-week delay (r = 0.197, p = 0.0281, rank correlation). In the reduced set of 83 participants with usable data in study 2, we found no significant relationship (r = 0.0685, p = 0.546). Thus, while results are mixed across the two studies, the maintenance of the relationship between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia symptoms in study 1 is notable given the relatively long delay between sessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3. To test for an additional replication of the relationship between reinforcement</head><p>learning performance and anhedonia symptoms, we analyzed data from a separate large-sample online reward learning study (study 3, n = 366). The task was a variant of a common two-armed bandit paradigm. In the task, participants learned to select the more frequently rewarded stimulus in each of six stimulus pairs (78% versus 22% reward probability; fixed probabilities), pseudorandomly intermixed over the course of learning. No post-learning choice test or ratings phases were administered. Learning performance, quantified as the proportion of selections of the higher reward probability stimulus, showed clear improvement across repetitions (first four repetitions 62.2 ± 0.8%; last four repetitions 84.7 ± 0.7%; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3a)</ref>. Importantly, we found that learning performance was significantly correlated with anhedonia scores (mean correct across learning: r = 0.162, p = 0.0019; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3b</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref>). The next highest correlation was with positive valence systems (PVSS; r = -0.108, p = 0.0381, uncorrected). Learning performance was not correlated with general depression symptoms (SDS; r = 0.0305, p = 0.561, uncorrected). Baseline mood ratings again exhibited the strongest negative correlation with anhedonia symptoms ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure   S3</ref>). However, the anhedonia-performance relationship remained significant when including mood as a covariate (p = 0.0038), while the anhedonia-mood correlation was not significant (p &gt; 0.88). The correlation with performance was also supported by a reinforcement learning model, where model-fit learning rate correlated with anhedonia scores (r = 0.159, p = 0.0023, uncorrected, rank correlation). Thus, the results from study 3 replicate and extend the findings of studies 1 and 2, overall demonstrating a consistent positive relationship between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia symptoms across studies and two distinct reward learning paradigms.</p><p>Confidence during reinforcement learning may also be linked to depression symptoms. In perceptual decision-making, confidence ratings-but not task performance-have been negatively associated with an anxiety-depression symptom factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Katyal et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rouault et al., 2018)</ref>. To investigate whether a similar pattern extends to reinforcement learning, we collected confidence ratings periodically after every set of repetitions (every 6 or 8 trials, depending on the study), assessing participants' confidence in their recent performance. In Studies 1 and 2, we found a negative relationship between confidence during learning and anhedonia ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Results; Figure S6</ref>). In study 3, the gradual increase in performance across learning allowed us to examine the full set of relationships between learning, confidence, and symptoms. Consistent with prior work on metacognition, learning performance and confidence ratings were positively correlated (mean across learning phase: r = 0.425, p &lt; 0.001). In turn, confidence ratings were negatively related to anhedonia (r = -0.118, p = 0.0238, uncorrected; <ref type="figure">Figure S6)</ref>. Crucially, the relationship between learning performance and anhedonia remained significant after controlling for confidence (p &lt; 0.001). These findings reveal a novel dissociation: while anhedonia symptoms were linked to lower confidence during reinforcement learning, they were simultaneously associated with better task performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Across three studies with a combined sample of more than 600 nonpatient participants, we consistently observed a positive relationship between anhedonia symptoms and reinforcement learning performance. This unexpected finding was identified in an exploratory study, confirmed in a preregistered replication, and further extended in a study using a distinct learning paradigm. The reinforcement learning tasks involved either learning from reward or loss feedback (studies 1 and 2) or learning from reward versus omitted reward feedback (study 3), providing convergent evidence for this association. Our results contrast with the expectation that anhedonia-related deficits in reward-guided behavior in everyday life would manifest as deficits in experimental settings. While previous research has reported a mix of negative or null associations between depression or anhedonia symptoms and reinforcement learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brolsma et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Moutoussis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pike and Robinson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vrizzi et al., 2023)</ref>, we are not aware of any published studies reporting a positive association.</p><p>Several supporting findings accompany the novel positive relationships between reinforcement learning and anhedonia. First, despite recruiting a non-clinical sample, a substantial proportion (20-25%) exhibited clinically relevant depressive symptoms <ref type="figure">(Figures S6-S8)</ref>, indicating a broad range of symptom severity and enhancing the generalizability of our findings. Second, the strong negative correlation between anhedonia symptoms and baseline mood ratings reinforces the validity of our anhedonia measure ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S3)</ref>, aligning with research associating anhedonia with diminished affective states. Finally, consistent with prior studies linking an anxiety-depression symptom factor and decreased confidence in perceptual decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Katyal et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rouault et al., 2018)</ref>, we observed a negative association between anhedonia and confidence. However, whereas previous work reported no relationship between symptoms and task performance, our findings reveal a novel dissociation: higher anhedonia was associated with lower confidence yet better learning performance. This divergence suggests that anhedonia may alter the balance between subjective confidence and objective reinforcement learning.</p><p>Our findings suggest that the relationship between anhedonia and reward-guided decision-making may be more nuanced than previously understood. Here, we discuss two potential interpretations of the observed positive association between anhedonia and reinforcement learning. First, the effect may arise from a contrast-based or contextual mechanism. Individuals with higher anhedonia might experience diminished reward expectations and experiences in their daily lives. When in a controlled experimental task with rewards, they may perceive the rewards as relatively large, leading to enhanced reinforcement learning performance. Conversely, individuals with lower anhedonia, who may encounter more rewarding experiences in their daily lives, might perceive the experimental rewards as relatively small, potentially reducing their task performance. This interpretation aligns with evidence of within-experiment reward magnitude context effects in reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Palminteri and Lebreton, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Related to this interpretation, differences in attentional allocation or 'offline' processes may contribute to this effect. Individuals with lower anhedonia might automatically allocate attention and/or low-level processing resources more toward their relatively richer mental representations of real-life rewards and goals, thereby impairing task</p><p>performance.</p><p>An alternative interpretation centers on the core features of anhedonia:</p><p>diminished reward anticipation and reduced enjoyment of rewards. In our studies, anhedonia symptoms exhibited the strongest negative correlation with baseline mood ratings. We did not measure emotional engagement during choices, but at feedback, we found evidence in one of two studies with such measures that higher anhedonia was associated with blunted mood responses to feedback. Thus, it is possible that individuals with higher anhedonia experience blunted emotional responses to task events, leading to a greater reliance on analytical, less emotional cognitive processes.</p><p>This interpretation is somewhat paradoxical, as depression is often associated with cognitive impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahern and Semkovska, 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, it contrasts with the hypothesis that emotional engagement is beneficial for feedback-based learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lerner et al., 2015)</ref>. Nevertheless, and without relying on a simplistic dichotomy between 'hot'</p><p>and 'cold' cognition, it is possible that if performance is supported by a gradient of emotional and less-emotional processes, in some contexts, a shift toward lessemotional cognitive processes could be beneficial.</p><p>Mechanistically, the observed positive association between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia may arise from several factors. Common reinforcement learning models of "model-free" learning suggest two potential sources:</p><p>differences in the learned value of associations or differences in how those values are translated into choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Robinson and Chase, 2017)</ref>. Behaviorally, greater divergence in learned values can resemble reduced decision-making noise (variability). Typically, these parameters cannot be dissociated in reinforcement learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Huys et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Robinson and Chase, 2017)</ref>. As a potential independent measure of learned stimulus values, we collected post-learning subjective ratings of stimulus-reward and stimulus-loss associations in studies 1 and 2. These ratings, calculated as the difference between reward and loss ratings, showed no consistent relationship with anhedonia symptoms. This null finding suggests that differences in learned values may not be the primary source of the association with performance. However, this interpretation is tentative, as it is based on a null finding. Moreover, the null finding may be related to the fact that ratings tend to be noisy, in part because the ratings were not incentivized.</p><p>Regarding the two learning paradigms employed in our studies, one point of divergence from most prior research is that we aimed to decrease the contribution of working memory and increase the relative contribution of reinforcement learning to performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collins and Frank, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wimmer and Poldrack, 2022)</ref>. Specifically, the learning phases in our experiments intermixed at least six different sets of stimuli. This level of load has been demonstrated to significantly decrease the contribution of shortterm maintenance of stimulus and response associations to behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collins and Frank, 2012)</ref>. In contrast, most prior research on reinforcement learning and mental health-related symptoms utilized designs with immediate or near-immediate repetition of stimuli (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vrizzi et al., 2023)</ref>, which could potentially influence associations with symptoms. For instance, studies in patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated that apparent deficits in reinforcement learning are better explained by working memory impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Collins et al., 2014)</ref>. Notably, in study 3, we included a separate working memory measure, and the positive correlation between anhedonia symptoms and performance remained when accounting for working memory as a covariate.</p><p>Although our findings diverge from previous literature on depression symptoms and reinforcement learning, prior studies may not have specifically assessed or reported associations with anhedonia symptoms. When focusing on general depression symptoms, we found no consistent relationship with reinforcement learning. Two of three correlations were near-zero, while in study 1 the positive correlation was significant at an uncorrected level. Second, it is possible that the relatively large sample sizes in our studies allowed us to detect the moderate effect size association with anhedonia that smaller studies might have missed. Studies with smaller sample sizes would have less statistical power to reliably detect such effects, which could lead to null results that may not be reported or published due to historical biases against nonsignificant findings.</p><p>An important question concerns the relationship between our findings and participants' real-world behavior, as well as their potential clinical implications and translational value. Anhedonia has emerged as an important focus in research on depression due to its association with poor treatment outcomes and long-term prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(McMakin et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rizvi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Vrieze et al., 2014)</ref>. The observation of intact, and even relatively enhanced, reinforcement learning in individuals with higher anhedonia symptoms suggests that anhedonia is not universally associated with a decreased potential to learn and make reward-guided decisions. Depending on the underlying mechanism, this finding also suggests that some core neural mechanisms underlying reinforcement learning have the potential to function normally in individuals with higher anhedonia symptoms. However, it is important to recognize that these experimental results may not directly relate to behavior outside of isolated tasks. For example, the reinforcement learning tasks do not aim to represent some key features of real-world situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Steiner and Frey, 2021)</ref>, such as the sustained engagement and effort required to achieve many goals. Nevertheless, the relative success of participants with higher anhedonia symptoms in these tasks could provide leverage for using such paradigms as exercises or as measures of the efficacy of treatment components <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Norbury et al., 2024)</ref>. Alternatively, if individuals with higher anhedonia exhibit improved reinforcement learning both in tasks and in the real world, a moderate benefit might be overshadowed outside controlled task environments by other depression-and anhedonia-related factors not represented here, such as the need for behavioral activation or physical effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Treadway et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings have some limitations. Regarding the sample of participants, we did not collect diagnostic information or conduct clinical interviews. Instead, participants in our studies were recruited with no exclusion or inclusion criteria regarding symptoms, leading to a wide range of scores on self-reported symptoms. As noted above, approximately one quarter of participants met the threshold for clinical depression on the SDS scale. While the current sample of online study participants is unlikely to be representative of the general population, we would expect that our sample included individuals with diagnosable disorders, such as major depressive disorder, at rates comparable to the population average. A benefit of our non-selective recruitment strategy is the resulting heterogeneity in symptom profiles, which contrasts with the highly selective samples frequently used in clinical research, where exclusion criteria for comorbidities may limit the generalizability of findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brolsma et al., 2022)</ref>. Anhedonia symptoms are primarily associated with depression but are also observed in a range of other disorders, including bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Shankman et al., 2014)</ref>. By studying a sample that allows for mixed symptoms, our results provide insights into the broader population-level relationship between anhedonia and reinforcement learning.</p><p>In conclusion, across three non-clinical studies including over 600 participants, we consistently observed a positive association between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia symptoms. While anhedonia is known to profoundly impact well-being and functioning in everyday life, our findings suggest that individuals with elevated anhedonia symptoms retain the capacity for adaptive reward-guided learning and decision-making within controlled experimental settings. These results challenge conventional assumptions about the detrimental effects of anhedonia on reinforcement learning and contrast with prior findings reporting negative or null associations in both clinical and non-clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Halahakoon et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Husain and Roiser, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pike and Robinson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vrizzi et al., 2023)</ref>. Although the mechanisms driving this association remain unclear, our findings suggest that anhedonia may play a more nuanced role in reward-related behavior, which can inform future research into aspects of motivated behavior and potential clinical translation.</p><p>Data availability: Complete behavioral data will be publicly available upon publication on the Open Science Framework.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Depression Scale (SDS), mini Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire -anhedonic depression (Mini-MASQ-AD), Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory -Revised (OCIR), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), Hypomanic Personality Scale -Short (HPS), Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale -Short (IUS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), Positive Valence Systems Scale (PVSS), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), and State Trait Inventory of Cognitive &amp; Somatic Anxietysomatic anxiety (STICSA).
