			<abstract>
				<p>Anxious emotional states are known to disrupt both decision-making processes and the control of dextrous motor actions. Theoretical accounts such as the Entropy Model of Uncertainty and Active Inference have characterised anxiety as closely related to situational estimates of uncertainty and a (perceived) inability to reliably predict future states (e.g., sensory outcomes) based on the current state. Computational work has shown that anxietyinduced uncertainty alters the rate at which we learn about the environment, but the subsequent impact on predictive sensorimotor control remains to be understood. In the present work we tested whether anxiety alters predictive (oculo)motor control mechanisms, as suggested by uncertainty-based accounts. Thirty participants completed an experimental task that consisted of manual interception of a projectile performed in virtual reality. Participants were subjected to conditions designed to induce states of high or low anxiety using performance incentives and social-evaluative pressure. We measured subsequent effects on physiological arousal, self-reported state anxiety, task performance, and eye movements. Under high pressure conditions we observed visual sampling of the task environment characterised by higher variability and entropy of position prior to release of the projectile, consistent with an active attempt to reduce uncertainty. Computational modelling of predictive beliefs, using gaze data as inputs to a partially observable Markov decision process model, indicated that trial-to-trial updating of predictive beliefs was reduced during anxiety, suggesting that updates to priors were constrained. These results support the idea that organisms may attempt to counter anxiety-related uncertainty by moving towards more familiar and certain sensorimotor patterns.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Both dextrous motor actions and control of our visual system are thought to depend on predictions about future states of the world and our own body <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Skilled movement also depends on the ability to flexibly adapt and update those predictions according to new contexts or new sensory evidence. As anxious emotional states can bias the way in which we make and update predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, they can disrupt motor actions with potentially damaging consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. It is well known that during highly pressurised situations, such as a job interview or the final of a sporting event, people can experience drastic breakdowns in task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. In the present work we sought to understand the impact of anxiety on predictive (oculo)motor control mechanisms. We first outline theoretical approaches that have described anxiety in terms of uncertainty or entropy and how sensorimotor control might reflect an active attempt to resolve that uncertainty.</p><p>Anxiety is a negative emotional response to a perceived threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>. It is often characterised along cognitive (worry) and somatic (physiological arousal) dimensions.</p><p>Anxiety can lead to distinct difficulties learning about the world and making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>, and can particularly disrupt the ability to adapt to changing task conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</p><p>One potential explanation for these effects is that anxiety may alter the way in which we make predictions about the world around us. For instance, several theoretical accounts have characterised anxiety as closely related to situational estimates of uncertainty and a (perceived) inability to reliably predict the absence of threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. For instance, Hirsh, Mar, and Peterson's <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Entropy Model of Uncertainty (EMU) describes uncontrollable or unpredictable situations as creating an aversive high-entropy state, in which an organism experiences a reduced ability to predict successive states (e.g., sensory outcomes) based on the current state. According to the EMU, organisms find such uncertainty aversive and experience it subjectively as anxiety.</p><p>The EMU characterisation of anxiety aligns closely with other dynamical systems approaches like the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference, which similarly conceptualise the goal of a cognitive-behavioural system as the minimization of internal entropy (or 'free energy') and an increase in prediction success <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. From this perspective, to cope with instability (e.g., during anxiety) organisms should seek to return to familiar low-entropy states. Under the FEP <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, this tendency to return to low entropy states is, by definition, true of a self-organising system as they must resist dissipative forces (i.e., states of high entropy) to maintain their own integrity and existence. One way to achieve this goal in the face of anxiety-induced uncertainty, is to adopt behaviours like withdrawal or avoidance to evade the aversive stimulus. Alternatively, the organism may seek out new perceptual information that will disambiguate any uncertainty (e.g., looking under the bed to check for monsters). These uncertainty-reducing behaviours may in some circumstances be detrimental, such as the sportsperson who's movements become rigid and constrained <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, but in others may be beneficial (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>) or just neutral.</p><p>It has previously been suggested that an adaptive response in times of uncertainty is to modify the rate with which you update your beliefs about the world; learning faster allows one's model of the world to better reflect the current 'reality' of an environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>Neurocomputational work has illustrated that this is indeed the case for perceptual learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> where learning rates (i.e., the speed at which we revise prior expectations) appear to be increased by noradrenergic up-regulation of prediction error signal strength. What remains to be determined, is whether anxiety-related uncertainty similarly induces faster updating of predictive aspects of sensorimotor control 1 , or if these might instead be impaired. While quickly revising predictions may be beneficial in some instances (e.g., when conditions are changing or inherently unstable), a constantly high learning rate would generally disrupt the formation of appropriate action beliefs or models (i.e., by limiting a person's ability to disregard atypical or uncharacteristic task outcomes). As a result, participants may display highly variable and reflexive sensorimotor responses, which correspond less accurately to the surrounding performance context. Moreover, it has previously been reported that participants will constrain movement degrees of freedom when placed in more unpredictable task environments as an active attempt to reduce uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>. These findings align with theoretical models of impedance control in the motor system where co-activation of antagonistic muscle pairs is a natural response to unpredictable perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. There is initial evidence that updating of predictions that guide sensorimotor control may indeed be slowed. Using a combination of EEG and computational modelling, Sporn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> demonstrated that rates of motor learning were reduced under anxiety, and that anxious states impaired reward processing and the updating of predictions about rewards associated with motor sequences. Similarly, Ellmers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> found that participants' approach velocity in the moving escalator paradigm (31) was updated more slowly under state anxiety. In essence, constraining updates to sensorimotor predictions could help the organism stay in familiar states when uncertainty is already high. Consequently, there may be important differences in how perceived uncertainty influences prediction updating in overt motor and oculomotor actions compared to simpler (perceptual) associative learning tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The present study</head><p>Previous studies have shown that visual attention can be disrupted during anxious states, leading to subsequent breakdowns in task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. An open question is what effect anxious states have specifically on the predictive mechanisms that underpin gaze control <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>. In the present study, participants performed an interceptive task in a virtual reality environment (see <ref type="figure">Fig 1)</ref> while we manipulated performance incentives to induce situational pressure (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>). We measured subsequent effects on physiological arousal, self-reported state anxiety, task performance, and eye movements. To examine changes to predictive beliefs underpinning gaze control, we adopted computational modelling approaches that are increasingly being employed in psychiatry and clinical neuropsychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</p><p>Our hypotheses were based on EMU and FEP characterisations of anxiety as a state of entropy which organisms will seek to resolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>. Our primary hypothesis was that updates to predictive eye movements (relating to the release location of a projectile) over trials would be impaired during state anxiety, as previous findings have indicated that participants may constrain both their movements and their rate of prediction updating under uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. We also examined some secondary eye movement metrics to understand how anxiety influenced oculomotor control. If participants are indeed uncertain about their ability to predict future states during anxiety, we would also expect impaired anticipatory tracking of predictable moving targets during the interceptive task. Given the importance of prior expectations in interceptive motor tasks (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42)</ref>), such uncertainty would likely be reflected in more variable, stimulus-driven (as opposed to prediction-driven) scan patterns under anxiety. We therefore hypothesised that high pressure conditions would also lead to greater variance and higher entropy of eye movements prior to the release of the interception target, as well as performance decrements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>We used a repeated measures design in which all participants took part in both high and low pressure conditions, the order of which was counterbalanced across participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency and openness</head><p>We report sample size determination, data exclusions, and all manipulations in the study. All data and analysis code are available at: https://osf.io/2amdv/. The hypotheses were not preregistered. Data were analysed using RStudio v1.4.1106 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(43)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Thirty participants (12 female; Mage = 20.8; SDage = 1.2; range = 18-23 years) took part in the study. Participants were recruited from the undergraduate student population at the host University. Eye tracking data was lost for one participant in one condition due to a recording error. In a previous study, we observed effects in the range of R 2 = .03-.06 for changes in predictive gaze position in this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(44)</ref>. Power curves using the simr package for R <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(45)</ref> showed that for linear mixed effects models (with participant as a random factor), 36 trials for 30 participants was sufficient to detect effects at the lower end of this range with more than 85% power (see power curves in the supplementary files: https://osf.io/2amdv/). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task and Materials</head><p>The experimental task consisted of manual interception of a projectile performed in virtual reality (VR). The task was a simplified racquetball game in which participants were instructed to intercept a ball projected from one of two possible locations at the front of the court using a virtual racquet operated by a tracked hand controller. Participants were given no prior cues as to which of the two locations the ball would appear from on each trial, but there was an auditory tone signalling the start of each trial. Overall, there was a 50/50 split of left and right sided trials which were presented to the participants in one of four pseudorandomised orders (counterbalanced across participants). However, the trial orders were designed to be volatile, with periods where the projection location was clearly biased to one side or the other to induce probabilistic learning. Illustrations of these orders are available in the online supplementary files (https://osf.io/pwmhy). Participants were given no information about the statistical structure of the task or the optimal strategy, so that any emerging eye movement patterns reflected a spontaneous response to the task structure. Balls were 5.7 cm in diameter and resembled the visual appearance of a real-world tennis ball. These balls remained visible from the moment of their release, through to the end of each trial, meaning that participants could observe the true projected location regardless of whether they intercepted or missed the target stimulus. The visible racquet in VR was 0.6 × 0.3 × 0.01 m, although its physical thickness was exaggerated by 20 cm to facilitate the detection of ball-toracquet collisions.</p><p>The virtual environment, which had the visual appearance of an indoor racquetball court, was developed using the gaming engine Unity (v2019.3.1f; Unity Technologies, San Francisco, CA) (see <ref type="figure">Fig 1)</ref>. The same task has been used to study predictive eye movements in previous papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46)</ref>. The task was displayed using an HTC Vive head-mounted display (HTC Inc., Taoyuan City, Taiwan). The HTC-Vive is a high-precision, consumergrade VR system which has proven valid for small-area movement research tasks (field of view: 110°, accuracy: 1.5 cm, jitter: 0.5 mm, latency: 22ms; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48)</ref>). Two 'lighthouse' base stations projecting infra-red light act as a reference point to record movements of the headset and hand controller at 90 Hz. The headset features inbuilt eye-tracking, which uses binocular dark pupil tracking to monitor gaze at 120 Hz (spatial accuracy: 0.5-1.1°; latency: 10 ms, headset display resolution: 1440 × 1600 pixels per eye). Gaze was calibrated over five virtual locations prior to each condition, and upon any obvious displacement of the headset during trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Virtual reality task environment for the high (left) and low (right) pressure conditions Note: The ball was projected from one of the two locations on the front wall. The ball passed the player without bouncing and they were instructed to intercept it with the racquet (videos of hit and miss trials of the task are available online: https://osf.io/2amdv/). The score counter was displayed right at the top of the participant's field of view and increased with every successful interception during the high pressure condition. In the low pressure condition (right) the score was not counted, and the red 'recording' text was replaced with 'not recording'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anxiety</head><p>State anxiety. State anxiety (S-ANX) during each experimental condition was assessed using The Anxiety Thermometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>, which requires participants to report their anxiety at the current moment on a simple scale ranging from 0-10 (0 = not at all anxious; 10 = extremely anxious). This is a time-efficient measurement tool that has been used in related studies that presented low-and high-threat conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Heart rate. Heart rate was used to index sympathetic nervous system activation changes related to anxious states. Participants wore a Polar H10 Heart Rate Sensor (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) around the chest, with data recorded via a Polar 2 Heart Rate Monitor Transmitter Watch (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland). The Polar H10 has a 100Hz sample rate and values were recorded from the watch at minute intervals and averaged across each block of trials. Reported values were baselined to participants' resting HR, which was taken over a 2 minute period while they were seated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye tracking</head><p>Gaze-in-world coordinates (i.e., the intersection point of the gaze vector with the task environment) were recorded from the VR eye tracking system and then denoised with a three frame moving median filter and a second-order 15 Hz lowpass Butterworth filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(50)</ref>. We subsequently calculated the following metrics:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive eye movements.</head><p>The primary variable of interest, was the predictive eye movement that took place immediately before ball release. Predictive gaze location, was defined as the horizontal (xcoordinate) gaze position (i.e., gaze vector intersection point with the world) at the termination of the auditory tones, averaged over a 50ms window. Following Harris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(44)</ref> this was taken as the most critical moment for anticipating the projection location and therefore the critical eye movement feature that would reveal participants' prediction about the upcoming trial. The predictive gaze location variable was then used as an input to model the updating of sensorimotor predictions over trials (described in the Active Inference Modelling section below). Our previous work using this task has shown that participants either make an overt prediction with their eyes (directing gaze to one of the two projection locations) or make no prediction and 'hedge their bets' by looking directly between the two locations (51). The fact that participants do not have to look at either location means that trials in which they choose to direct gaze towards one of the two locations is a strong indication of their expectation about the most likely upcoming release location. We therefore treated predictive gaze location as a discrete variable (left/right/centre); the central half of the space between the two locations (10.9 o of visual angle) was treated as non-predictive and those outside as left or right predictions (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(51)</ref>). This approach allowed us to adopt the widely used discrete state space approach to modelling active inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52)</ref> to infer the underlying belief (most likely location) from the eye position (anticipating left/right/neither).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-release variability and complexity</head><p>To address our secondary hypotheses, we examined patterns of eye movement shifts prior to release relating to (i) variability of position and (ii) complexity (entropy) of the signal (see example plots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 2)</ref>. Variability of eye position has been used in previous studies (e.g., in driving tasks; (53)) to indicate anxiety-induced disruptions to gaze. Gaze variability was defined as the 2-dimensional standard deviation of the gaze intersection position for the period from the trial start until the ball release cue. Here, we were interested in the eye movements that occurred just before the ball was projected from one of the two wall locations, as they would indicate participant's state predictions (e.g., about where the ball would emerge from) and expected uncertainty (i.e., relating to the environment and its 'hidden' task probabilities). Gaze entropy was calculated to index signal complexity, for which we adopted a sample entropy measure calculated from the natural logarithm of the conditional probability that a series similar for n points remains similar at the next point (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(54)</ref>). Entropy was calculated separately for horizontal and vertical planes. Entropy can be used to index the level of randomness or complexity in biological time series data, including eye tracking, and has previously been used to detect changes in visual scanning during anxious states <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55)</ref>. Sample entropy is generally robust to variations in sample size so recording durations do not need to be exactly matched. Higher entropy values (in bits) would suggest a more complex signal, indicative of more random and reflexive (i.e., less predictable) movements over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-flight tracking (pursuit gain)</head><p>For high speed targets (such as the ball in this task) close tracking of the target's inflight trajectory may only be achieved through anticipation of its future location <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(56)</ref>. Here, anticipatory head and eye movements can facilitate continuous smooth pursuit dynamics, while preventing a person's point of gaze from significantly 'lagging behind' the target. To index whether eye position was keeping up with the target in this way, we calculated a measure of pursuit gain. Following Palidis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(57)</ref>, this was computed as the saccade-free eye velocity divided by target velocity (i.e., values of 1 indicate that the eye perfectly kept pace with the ball). To do this, periods during which a saccade were made (identified as portions of data where gaze acceleration exceeded five times its median absolute acceleration; (58, 59)) were firstly removed from the data. Following Fooken and Spering <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(60)</ref>, gain values were then calculated for the closed-loop portion of tracking (i.e., based on observed motion feedback (57)) which was defined as 140ms after ball release. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Active Inference Modelling</head><p>To probe the mechanisms behind the trial-to-trial updating of predictions we fit a computational model to the predictive gaze location variable. The purpose of this model was to use the observed behaviour (eye position) to infer an unobserved variable (belief about the next release location). We therefore chose a gaze variable (position before release) that had a clear mapping to a task-relevant belief (release location) (as in (44)). A Bayesian generative model of perception derived from the Markov decision process (MDP) formulation of active inference (61) was chosen to align with the theoretical approach of the paper. This approach has previously been used to model individual characteristics of active inference in clinical states of depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62)</ref>. It has also been used for predictive eye movements in a task similar to the one reported here <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Such computational modelling of behavioural data allows us to estimate the mechanisms that generated that data and therefore move towards a better understanding of underpinning mechanisms. This modelling approach requires specifying a generative structure for the inference process of interest (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>), inputting observed values for known parameters, and optimising other, unobserved, model parameters to best explain the data. In the current case, the predictive eye movements that participants made (left/right/centre), and their subsequent observations (left or right outcome) are known. Given these known values, a gradient descent optimisation routine can be used to estimate participants' ongoing beliefs about the most likely release location, the best courses of action available to them, and the rate at which these beliefs were updated over time.</p><p>In the model (see Each trial was modelled as consisting of three timesteps: τ = 1 was the start state before any observations had been made; τ = 2 was the cue timepoint when participants hear the onset cue and where the eye position is taken to be a prediction about release location; and τ = 3 is the ball appearance timestep when participants observe which release location was correct. Models did not extend past the observation of the ball appearance (i.e., into the swing of the racquet) because task related uncertainty effectively ended with the ball observation. At τ = 3, the participant observed the true release location and inferred whether the true state was left or right. That is, they inferred a posterior distribution over P(sτ = 3) that assigned a probability to the left versus right state, based on a Bayesian integration of prior beliefs about transitioning to the respective states P(sτ = 2|sτ = 1) and P(oτ|sτ) (i.e., the likelihood mapping). The inferred posterior formed the prior for the next trial. Bayesian belief updating in the model was based on the following equations for the timepoints (τ = 1 and τ = 2-3, respectively):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">̅ = = ( 1 2 (ln + ln • +1 ) + ln • ) ̅ = − = (ln −1 + ln • )</formula><p>Here, indicates a SoftMax function which converts the belief to a proper probability distribution and ln refers to the natural logarithm. Posteriors over states were estimated using an optimization routine (gradient descent) that minimises free energy in the model.  Next we fit the models to observed data and extracted participant-wise estimated parameters for learning rate, action precision, and loss aversion. Average action probabilities (i.e., the probability of a participant's actions under the model) were 73% suggesting high explanatory power of the model. Next, we checked parameter recoverability and independence (https://osf.io/2amdv/supplementary 4). Finally, the estimated model parameters were subject to between-condition comparisons (see Results). </p></div>

They first completed an informed consent form and were fitted with the heart rate chest strap. While they were seated, their baseline heart rate was recorded over a period of 2 minutes. All participants then watched a short video explaining the broad aims of the study and what would be required during the experiment, to standardise the instructions. Next, participants were fitted with the VR headset and performed a familiarisation block of the interception task, consisting of four trials (two left and two right-sided trials). They then completed the high and low threat conditions in their preassigned (counterbalanced) order. Before each condition, participants watched a pre-recorded video (available from: https://osf.io/2amdv/) which explained the task to them and then completed the S-ANX measure (anxiety thermometer). The in-built eye trackers were calibrated at the start of the first block and on any obvious displacement of the headset. Participants then completed 36 interception trials in each of the high and low threat conditions. On each trial, participants began in the centre of the court, just behind the 'short line'. The appearance of each ball was cued by three auditory tones which were followed by a variable onset delay. Based on previous pilot testing, the onset delay was randomly selected from a uniform distribution over a 0-5 second window. This variable onset window was required to create sufficient levels of challenge and uncertainty in the task. Participants then had to intercept the oncoming ball by reaching their racquet out to the left or right. When participants successfully intercepted the ball it 'popped', and a rewarding 'ding' sound was played, alongside a haptic vibration from the handheld controller. If the ball was missed, a 'buzz' sound was played.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anxiety induction</head><p>The anxiety induction consisted of a threat manipulation similar to that used in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>. This was based on the provision of evaluative and ego-threatening instructions, monetary incentives, and immediate consequences for performance failure. Two pre-recorded videos presented by the head of department were used to deliver these instructions to give them added legitimacy. During the low-threat block of trials, participants were advised that their score was not important and that they should just do their best. On the game screen, the score was replaced with 'N/A', and the text 'not recording' was shown in the bottom left (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). By contrast, in the high-threat block of trials, participants were told that they if they performed well enough they would receive a monetary prize, whereas if they scored in the bottom three, they would be consented into a follow-up study which examines people who choke under pressure. They were also told that at the end of testing a league table of participants' scores would be made public to all those who participated. On their head-set display, their score was displayed in front of them along with a sign saying 'Recording', to reinforce these elements of evaluative pressure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present work, we examined how eye movements, and their underpinning predictive mechanisms (e.g., uncertainty-related learning and belief updating) were affected by temporary states of anxiety. Based on EMU and FEP accounts of anxiety (20, 41), we hypothesised that performance pressure would increase internal entropy and reduce participants' ability to predict future states (impaired ball tracking), which they would seek to resolve by: i) more reflexive sampling of the task environment; and ii) constraining updates to predictive eye movements. Our hypotheses about resolving internal entropy through reduced learning rates and increased visual sampling were supported by the data. However, we found no disruption to performance or in-flight tracking during the high-pressure condition; instead, there were small improvements in these variables. Overall, these findings, based on advanced modelling techniques, provide a critical new understanding of the interaction between active inference behaviours and pressurised performance scenarios.</p><p>These findings have clear relevance for neurocomputational theories of anxiety and contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of how motor skills may be affected (positively or negatively) by situational pressure.</p><p>Firstly, the manipulation checks indicated that we successfully increased participants' state anxiety, as shown by clear increases in S-ANX and HR in the high (compared to the low) pressure conditions. Our primary hypothesis was that updating of predictive eye movements (i.e., not actual pre-release position but trial-to-trial changes) would be impaired under state anxiety. Model-based estimates of trial-to-trial updating indeed indicated a lower learning rate in the high pressure (anxiety) condition. This finding accords with previous work reporting disrupted reward processing and updating of motor predictions under anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. Adding to this picture, Lang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref> found more rigid, repetitive, and redundant hand movement patterns during state anxiety, which they characterised as an attempt to return to familiar low-entropy states. Taken together, these results suggest a growing picture that people attempt to counter uncertainty (either in the form of internal entropy or shifting environmental probabilities) by moving towards more familiar and certain sensorimotor patterns.</p><p>The slowed updating of sensorimotor predictions observed here contrasts with the relationship between anxiety and increased rates of learning (belief updating) reported by <ref type="bibr">Lawson et al. (18)</ref>. However, this apparent discrepancy is easily resolved by appealing to active inference models of perception and action <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71)</ref>. Within active inference theory, a distinction is made between minimising two types of 'prediction error' known as variational free energy (VFE) and expected free energy (EFE). VFE is effectively momentary prediction error arising from inferences about the likely causes of sensations (e.g., during simple perceptual or associative learning tasks). By contrast, EFE refers to minimisation of future prediction errors through action. The ability to infer future states (of the body or world) with confidence is critical in computing EFE, as action policies are most likely to be selected when they (i) minimize uncertainty over states and (ii) maximize the probability of preferred observations. Uncertainty about future states (i.e., expected precision) is explicitly represented by the E term in our active inference model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Consequently, if the organism is generally less confident predicting its own future states, it is unlikely to switch to new actions where the outcomes may be more uncertain. In this way, perceptual beliefs about the world (e.g., during associative learning tasks; (18)) may be updated more quickly during states of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, while actions (e.g., predictive eye movements in our interceptive task) may not. A question for future work is, therefore, whether learning rates for beliefs about environmental states can diverge from those relating to sensorimotor predictions during the same task.</p><p>There are additional variables to consider that may influence this relationship between uncertainty and belief updating. For instance, 'degrees of uncertainty' are hard to compare between studies/tasks, therefore results from associative learning and motor learning studies may not be directly comparable. Prediction updating is also dependent on higher-level beliefs about uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73)</ref>. Indeed, probabilistic relationships in the world can themselves be more or less changeable <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(74)</ref>, and this additional 'volatility' can, itself, have varying levels of stability. When uncertainty is short-lived, faster prediction updating will be adaptive, but if it is persistent, updating your predictions is ineffective and wasteful. Here, the source of uncertainty is also relevant. For instance, if uncertainty is purely a function of probabilistic relationships in the environment and the outcome of one's actions can be estimated with certainty, predictive movements should be adapted more quickly. If, on the other hand, the organism has high internal entropy (e.g., anxiety) and cannot predict their own future states with assurance, prediction updating may be slower. Given the widespread impact that these variables can have on performance and learning, future investigations may wish to explore the (inter-)relationships between uncertainty, volatility, and anxiety beliefs during naturalistic sensorimotor tasks.</p><p>We also observed relationships between S-ANX and both loss aversion and action precision parameters from the active inference model. As these were exploratory analyses, they should, however, be interpreted with caution. The relationship between S-ANX and reduced action precision (i.e., less deterministic mapping from beliefs to choices) makes intuitive sense and aligns with the theoretical models we have discussed above. Indeed, states of high entropy can mean that an organism is less able to predict its current or future states with confidence, so there may be an increase in the apparent randomness of their sensorimotor actions. Reduced loss aversion, however, seems in the opposite direction to what we would generally expect for anxious emotional states. Generally, research has suggested a positive association between these constructs, particularly in perceptual decisionmaking tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(75)</ref>. Sporn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> have previously reported that anxiety disrupts reward processing in a motor learning task, so this unexpected result could be related to a reduced ability to predict the rewards associated their own actions (eye movements).</p><p>Turning to our secondary hypotheses, we found that in-flight gaze tracking was not disrupted under anxiety. In fact, participants in the high-pressure condition actually had higher pursuit-gain values, indicating that they were following the path of the ball more closely and continuously than in the low-pressure conditions. This effect was unexpected but might be an artefact of an increased motivation to succeed in the high pressure conditions, given the performance incentives. This would be consistent with the observed increase in performance success. Indeed, while anxiety is typically associated with performance decrements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, it can also lead to performance improvements through greater effort and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77)</ref> that mitigate against any disruptive effects. Such increases in task engagement might have led participants to track the ball more closely and perform more successful interceptive motor actions, despite the observed changes in learning rate. This divergence illustrates that attempts to reduce uncertainty through sensorimotor behaviours may have beneficial or detrimental effects, depending on other features of the task. For instance, here, participants may have been able to maintain (or even improve) their performance through additional effort despite a constrained learning rate (in line with (77)).</p><p>Our hypotheses related to increased sampling of the environment prior to release were, however, supported. We observed small but statistically significant increases in both the variability and the complexity of gaze position before target release. These findings align with previous studies that have reported similar anxiety-induced disruptions to gaze control <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78)</ref>. Many of these studies have proposed attentional mechanisms (10)such as an altered balance between top-down and bottom-up systems (79)as responsible for these effects. We have instead suggested that they could be conceptualised as an active attempt to reduce uncertainty in the environment through increased sampling of visual information (e.g., as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(80)</ref>). While attentional mechanisms could equally explain the changes to gaze variability and entropy, the alterations to learning rate that we observed are more consistent with an entropy reduction explanation.</p><p>The present work has both theoretical and practical implications. Our results contribute to an improved theoretical understanding of the interactions between motor and affective states, illustrating that the feedforward and predictive mechanisms which are fundamental to sensorimotor control may be impaired during high pressure (or high anxiety)</p><p>conditions. Our findings align with EMU and FEP accounts of anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>. The results also have implications for our understanding of motor skill breakdowns under pressure, such as during sports. While previous explanations have focused on attentional explanations (10), our findings suggest that disruptions to predictive mechanisms could also contribute to episodes of 'choking' (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> for a review). Even though we did not observe performance deficits in this task, expert-like motor control depends on 'statistically optimal' predictionmaking (in many ways), hence, altered predictive models during anxious states may provide an explanation for episodes of performance failures. Finally, our results have implications for designing motor skill training programmes. It has previously been suggested that training in the presence of anxiety may 'inoculate' sports performers to the subsequent effects of performance pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(81)</ref>. Our results, however, suggest that the presence of anxiety during training could alter the learning of critical predictive sensorimotor control mechanisms. As such, it is crucial to understand these effects more deeply in order to determine the likely value of such 'stress inoculation training'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>A limitation of the current work is that we most probably did not achieve genuinely high states of anxiety, such as would occur during public speaking, job interviews, or highpressure sporting events. Scores on the anxiety thermometer unmistakably increased in the high pressure condition (with a large effect size) yet were still in the mid-to-low range of the self-report scale. For instance, no participants reported scores of eight or nine out of ten.</p><p>Hence, the conditions in the experiment cannot be said to replicate some of these real-world experiences of anxiety. We did, however, observe large increases in HR suggesting a notable activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These lower states of anxiety may well account for why participants did not 'choke' and actually performed better under the high-pressure conditions. Notably, the fact that performance improved while prediction updating was slowed appears to suggest that predictions did not particularly matter for performance.</p><p>However, as the trial order was highly uncertain and shifted between periods that favoured left and right release locations, faster updating of predictions was not necessarily beneficial nor disadvantageous here (i.e., conditions were genuinely unstable and trial n-1 was not always strongly predictive of trial n). We would expect such disruptions to be detrimental to sensorimotor skills in cases where there was a greater statistical regularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p></div>

Arrows connecting nodes indicate dependencies between variables. Following the notation of Smith et al. (2021), circles ('nodes') correspond to the following variables: s = state; o = observations; = action policies. Squares indicates factors mediating conditional relationships and take the form of matrices in the model: A = likelihood mapping between states and outcomes (i.e., ( | )); D = initial state priors (i.e., ( 1)); B = state transition matrices encoding beliefs about how hidden states evolve over time (i.e., ( +1| ,)). Observation and state subscripts correspond to time points in a trial ( ). When &gt;1, the B matrix from −1 acts as an empirical prior, playing the same role as the D vector at = 1. Action policy selection (π) depends on the expected free energy associated with each policy (G), which in turn depends on prior preferences for outcomes (C), as well as expected precision of action policies (E). Policies expected to i) minimize uncertainty over states and ii) maximize the probability of preferred observations will have the highest probability of being selected. Sigma (σ) in the update equations (bottom left) refers to a SoftMax function (normalized exponential). After identifying the model structure, we compared different combinations of free parameters to determine the best approach for fitting to participant data. We examined five possible free parameters and compared model fits with different combinations of these values. Full details of the competing models and the comparisons are available in the supplementary files (https://osf.io/2amdv/supplementary 5). Successive models were compared using a Bayesian random effects model (spm_BMS.m function: Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 toolbox; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/), which assesses the variational free energy of each model fit and returns the relative probabilities (e.g., [0.9, 0.1]) of the better fit (the protected exceedance probability; (66). The winning model had three free parameters: η (learning rate), α (action precision), and loss aversion. The parameter η describes the magnitude of belief updating at each timestep of the model and therefore indicates how fast prior expectations(e.g., about likely ball location) are being adjusted in response to sensory observations (e.g., about the ball's actual observed location). It is worth noting that, in this context, learning rate does not refer to improving at the experimental task; indeed, a high learning rate could be detrimental to task performance as it equates to disregarding potentially valuable prior observations (e.g., beliefs which have been formed through previous sensorimotor experiences and longer-term exposure to interception cue-outcome contingencies). Action precision refers to the mapping between beliefs and actions, it encodes the degree to which action choices are deterministic or random. Loss aversion describes the strength of the prior preference against observing a particular outcome.</figDesc></figure>

These results indicate that there was no systematic difference in predictive gaze position, variance of that position, or the correctness of that position between high and low pressure conditions. Active inference model variables Next, we examined whether there were differences in active inference during anxiety, based on the model-estimated parameters. A linear mixed effects model indicated that there was no statistically significant effect of pressure condition on α (action precision) [β = 0.97, 95% CI [-0.23, 2.17], p = .11; std. beta = 0.33, R 2 conditional = .40, R 2 marginal = .03], showing no change in the randomness of action selection. Similarly, there was no effect of condition on the loss aversion parameter [β = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.85, 0.42], p = .51; std. beta = -0.08, R 2 conditional = .80, R 2 marginal = .002]. We did, however, observe a significant reduction in learning rate (η) in the high pressure condition [β = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.16, -0.02], p = .009; std. beta = -0.62, R 2 conditional = .26, R 2 marginal = .10], with a large effect indicating slower updating of gaze predictions under state anxiety. We also examined whether there were relationships between the model-derived parameters and self-reported or physiological measures of anxiety. For change in selfreported anxiety (i.e., high pressure minus low pressure), the correlation with learning rate was weak and non-significant [r = -0.24, p = .21]. There were, however, significant relationships with α [r = -0.44, p = .02] and loss aversion [r = -0.51, p = .005] indicating that greater increases in felt anxiety were associated with more random and less deterministic action choices, as well as a reduced aversion for unpreferred outcomes. There were no correlations between change in HR and α [r = -0.12, p = .54], η [r = 0.04, p = .85], or loss aversion [r = -0.11, p = .57].</figDesc></figure>

Pursuit gain To examine whether pressure condition also affected in-flight tracking, we ran a linear mixed model on log-transformed pursuit gain values. The model (with participant as random effect) had a conditional R 2 of .40 and marginal R 2 of .01. The effect of Condition [High] was statistically significant but small [β = 0.33, 95% CI [0.21, 0.45], p &lt; .001; std. beta = 0.10] indicating higher gain values (closer to 1) under high pressure conditions (see Figure 5top].</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_11"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>we ran a linear mixed model on the two dimensional standard deviation of eye position for the period preceding the auditory cue. The model (with participant as random effect) had a conditional R 2 of .41 and marginal R 2 of .01. The effect of Condition [High] was statistically significant but relatively small [β = 0.04, 95% CI [0.02, 0.05], p &lt; .001; std. beta = 0.15] indicating an increase in the variance of eye position before ball release under high pressure. Entropy Finally, we tested whether the complexity of pre-release sampling was different between conditions. A linear mixed model on sample entropy of eye position indicated a small but statistically significant difference between the low and high pressure conditions for both the horizontal [β = 0.01, 95% CI [3.38e-03, 0.01], p = .002; std. beta = 0.12] and vertical [β = 0.01, 95% CI [3.38e-03, 0.01], p = .036; std. beta = 0.09] planes. This indicates a higher degree of randomness or complexity in eye movements in the high pressure condition.</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">Here we refer to aspects of movement that are driven by expectations, like anticipatory saccades that jump ahead of a moving target or looking towards the most likely ball release location, rather than predictive mechanisms like efference copy.</note>
