			<abstract>
				<p>Affective bias-a propensity to focus on negative information at the expense of positive information-is a core feature of many mental health problems. However, it can be caused by wide range of possible underlying cognitive mechanisms. Here we illustrate this by focusing on one particular behavioural signature of affective bias-increased tendency of anxious/depressed individuals to predict lower rewards-in the context of the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) modelling framework. Specifically, we apply this framework to a tone-discrimination task (Aylward et al., 2019a), and argue that the same behavioural signature (differential placement of the &apos;decision criterion&apos; between healthy controls and individuals with mood/anxiety disorders) might be driven by multiple SDT processes. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose five experiments to test five hypothetical sources of this affective bias: beliefs about prior probabilities, beliefs about performance, subjective value of reward, learning differences, and need for accuracy differences. We argue that greater precision about the mechanisms driving affective bias may eventually enable us to better understand and treat mood and anxiety disorders.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>havioural Therapy, are able to successfully target affective biases without a clear understanding of how these biases emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Beck, 1991)</ref>, a large number of individuals fail to respond to any of our current treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aylward et al., 2019a)</ref>. Development of new treatments has also, unfortunately, stalled in part due a large number of failed clinical trials over the last decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Choi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Scannell and Bosley, 2016)</ref>. At least one reason for this is that treatments are largely targeted at endpoints (e.g. depressed mood) and not directly at the neurocognitive mechanisms that drive these symptoms, such as affective bias. A clearer and more mechanistic account of how affective bias emerges may therefore faciliate the development of improved treatments that target the causes of mental ill health at their source.</p><p>One way to achieve this understanding is to comprehensively break-down all possible underlying causes of a given behavioural bias and then systematically narrow down the root cause.</p><p>In this paper, we therefore take recent example of a translational perceptual task that is sensi-2 tive to affective bias in individuals with mood and anxiety disorders (as well as animal models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al., 2019a)</ref> and explore the multiple potential sources of this bias from a Signal Detection Theory perspective. We highlight how this perspective can force us to be more precise about the nature of affective bias and ultimately enable us to narrow down the underlying cause of this bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimal decision making</head><p>Optimal decision making involves the the selection of the best possible choice taking into account the choice context <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berger, 1980)</ref>. Choice contexts typically have two salient features that need to be considered: the prior probability of possible states of the world and the rewards or losses for selecting or not selecting each choice, often referred to as payoffs. For example, when a doctor is deciding on a cancer diagnosis for a patient, they may consider other aspects of the patient's history to gauge the prior probability of developing cancer (e.g., smoker/non-smoker) in addition to the medical results they have just obtained. They should also consider the payoffs of different choice and outcome pairings. For the doctor, these could be: correctly detecting cancer early is good for survival chances but incorrectly diagnosing cancer is stressful and costly for the patient, whereas correctly identifying there is no cancer relieves stress but incorrectly telling the patient they are cancer-free can be deadly.</p><p>Once the priors and payoffs are known, the best possible choice can be made by selecting the choice alternative that maximises the expected reward. Many real-world cases have complex rewards and losses that are difficult to quantify expected gain, like in our medical example, but in economic or laboratory settings, choice outcomes can expressed in terms monetary or points-based payoffs. For example, consider a lottery game with two choices, A and B, where selecting A gives a 25% chance of winning a reward of 4 pts versus selecting B which gives a 75% probability of winning 2 pts. The expected gain of selecting lottery A is 1 pt (0.25 × 4) and for B is 1.5 pts (0.75 × 2). Thus, the optimal decision would be to select lottery B because 1.5 pts is greater than 1 pt. In our medical scenario, we cannot usually make such a precise calculation, but weighing up the relative risk of death (extremely high cost) versus causing some mental and financial stress (lower cost), the doctor might err towards a positive diagnosis in an ambiguous case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>The Signal Detection Theory framework Signal Detection Theory (SDT) is a well established computational framework for modelling perceptual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Green and Swets, 1966)</ref>. Perceptual decision-making is based on noisy information reaching our senses that is then stochastically represented in the brain. Both of these factors add an additional layer of uncertainty in the decision process. Returning to our medical example of a doctor deciding on a cancer diagnosis, the information the doctor receives can be corrupted by noise in various ways, such as the visual blur in an x-ray image or neuronal noise involved in the sense of touch when inspecting a lump. The SDT framework is flexible in that can be applied to most scenarios of repeated perceptual discrimination or categorisation, such as reporting whether stimuli have rightward motion or leftward motion in the laboratory, or a series of cancer/not-cancer diagnoses in the hospital. SDT can be both descriptive, when applied in the context of empirical observations (e.g., quantifying how two doctors differ in how readily they diagnose cancer), or prescriptive, in the sense that it can describe what the ideal observer would do according to statistical decision theory. A feature of this approach, and perhaps its greatest strength, is SDT's ability to dissociate the separate effects of perceptual sensitivity and perceptual bias on the decision making process. That is, the degree of noise in the sensory evidence vs. the observer's propensity to choose one choice alternative over the others. Furthermore, the measurements of sensitivity and bias provided by this modelling framework can be directly compared between observers and tasks.</p><p>From the perspective of affective bias, SDT enables us to quantify biases in the decisionmaking process towards or away from differently rewarded stimuli, that takes into account individual variation in the perception of the stimuli (i.e., sensitivity). In other words, breaking down whether an individual is biased towards negative stimuli because they actually perceive the stimuli differently, or whether they accurately perceive the stimuli but subsequently decide to use the information differently (for example, this approach has been used to examine the response biases and anhedonia by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pizzagalli et al., 2005)</ref>. In addition to simply improving the measure of bias, there are also many theories of bias, developed in the SDT framework, potentially relevant for understanding the source of affective bias that can be tested experimentally.</p><p>Together, increasing measurement quality and better understanding the cause for the bias have the potential to improve the understanding of and treatments for affective bias. The standard SDT model describes the decision-making process for when one of two potential sensory stimuli, A and B, can be presented to an observer and asking them to report which A) The observer makes a measurement, x, of the stimulus, either stimulus A or stimulus B. The probability of a measurement, conditioned on the stimulus, is assumed to be Gaussian distributed due to the effect of sensory noise. The observer selects a decision criterion, k, that provides a mapping from x to a response (e.g., say "A"). B) When priors are not equal for the two choice alternatives, the optimal criterion, k opt is no longer at the neutral location centred between the two measurement distributions. As shown, stimulus A is more probable than stimulus B, causing a rightward shift in k opt . Consequently, stronger evidence of B is needed to report "B". C) Similarly for unequal payoffs. Correctly guessing A receives 2 units of reward, whereas correctly guessing B receives 4 units. This shifts the optimal criterion leftward so that stronger evidence of A is needed to report poorly rewarded "A". In an unequal reward context, affective bias is an increased preference to report the low-reward option (here "A"). This can be modelled as a shift in the criterion towards the high-reward distribution. An example of a criterion influenced by affective bias is shown by the dashed line. D) Conservatism is an insufficient shift of the criterion from neutral, k neu , to k opt . Where k falls between these two locations can be described by the proportional constant, α. Here the observer is conservative with α = 0.6 as denoted by the shading behind the plot. they perceived. The presentation of stimulus A does not produce the same sensory response in the observer each time it is shown, due to the various sources of noise (e.g. in neural processing) corrupting the signal, nor does B. Instead, we refer to the noisy measurement of the stimulus in the observer's brain as x, the value of which is unobserveable to the experimenter.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A Decision Variable, x Probability P (x|A) P (x|B) say "A" say "B" k B Decision Variable, x Probability P (A) = 0.75 P (B) = 0.25 k opt C Decision Variable, x Probability V A,A = 2 V B,B = k opt k Aff.Bias</formula><p>An assumption of the standard SDT model is that the sensory noise affecting A and B is Gaussian, with the conditional-measurement distributions p(x|A) and p(x|B) modelled as two equal-variance Gaussian distributions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). These distributions represent the values of x one can expect to observe for repeated presentations of identical A and identical B.</p><p>The perceptual sensitivity of the observer is reflected in the separation of these distributions in units of SD of noise,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d = µ B − µ A σ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and is referred to as d ("dee-prime"). A common modelling choice, which we adopted for this paper, is to rescale the decision axis by a factor of 1/σ so the variance of p(x|A) and p(x|B) is 1. This allows d to be read directly as the distance between the distributions because the re-scaling takes care of the denominator in Eq. 1. Consequently, when sensory noise is higher, the measurement distributions are closer together, and perceptual sensitivity (d ) is lower. This is intuitive: from the observer's perspective, they must infer if their measurement x came from the p(x|A) or the p(x|B) distribution, which are more easy to confuse if the distributions are closer together. If the decision axis is unscaled the confusion resulting from increasing noise can be thought of in terms of simply a greater overlap in the two conditional distributions.</p><p>To convert the noisy measurement x into a categorical response "A" or "B", the observer must place a decision criterion, k. This criterion divides the decision space into two regions:</p><p>values of x that lead to "A" responses and those that lead to "B" responses. The criterion can also be converted to the more general β representation, which is independent of perceptual sensitivity, through the following relationship:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">k = ln β d<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The criterion can be placed at any point along the decision axis, but there is only one location that is optimal according to statistical decision theory. This theoretical benchmark is often referred to as the ideal observer, who makes the best decision possible given the noisy sensory input <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tanner and Birdsall, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Green and Swets, 1966)</ref>. The optimal criterion, k opt , depends 6 on both the prior probability of A and B as well as payoff structure of the environment (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>-D):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">k opt = ln β opt d (3)</formula><p>where . If one alternative is more probable or is rewarded more highly, the ideal observer will shift their criterion from the neutral position (k neu = 0) so more responses will be of that category (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). This is equivalent to requiring less sensory information consistent with that category to select it. When both priors and payoffs are asymmetric, then their effects on the optimal criterion are additive <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Stevenson et al., 1990)</ref>. Biases in perceptual decision making can be quantified by comparing where the observer chose to place their criterion relative to the optimal criterion, in a manner that takes into account the perceptual sensitivity of the observer. For example, one way a 'negative' affective bias might emerge is by moving the criterion towards the highly rewarded option relative to the optimal (e.g. a criterion rightward of k opt in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>), leading the individual to choose the low-reward option more frequently than they should.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">β opt = P (A) P (B) V A,A − V A,B V B,B − V B,A .<label>(4</label></formula><p>In sum, the SDT framework quantifies both the perceptual sensitivity and perceptual bias of an observer, with independent measures, that is directly comparable to optimal decisionmaking. As affective bias can manifest as a suboptimal propensity to choose the low reward outcome, as shown in the following example, we propose that the SDT framework is ideal for quantifying affective bias in perceptual tasks and comparing amongst observers with potentially different perceptual capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using SDT to understand affective bias in tone discrimination</head><p>To illustrate how affective bias can distort optimal decision-making, we consider the response of human participants in the tone-discrimination task of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al. (2019a)</ref>. This paper recruited participants were either experiencing clinically significant low-mood and/or anxiety symptoms or were asymptomatic controls. They discriminated between a high tone (1kHz), which was highly rewarded when correctly identified, and a low tone (0.5kHz), that yielded four Increasing sensitivity <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: The tone-discrimination task of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al. (2019a)</ref>. A) Participants reported if they heard the low-frequency tone (red) or the high-frequency tone (blue). The reward for correctly guessing the high-frequency tone was four times larger than for the lowfrequency tone. On some trials, an ambiguous tone (purple) was played and was rewarded randomly. The graph illustrates the SDT model with the expected probability distributions of the decision variable for each of the tones. Example shown for an observer with a perceptual sensitivity of d = 3.5 (i.e., the sensitivity of the average anxiety-group participant). The optimal decision boundary (dashed grey) provides the decision rule that maximises expected reward: choose "low tone" if the decision variable is lower than this value, and "high tone" if it is above. Critically, this boundary does not align with the mid-point between the red and blue distributions (peak of the purple distribution) because it is optimal to have a bias for responding with the more highly rewarded "high tone". B) Boxplots of the empirical distributions of the proportion of "high tone" judgements for the ambiguous stimulus, split by test population. The lower proportion of high-tone responses of the anxiety group is the affective bias effect. Horizontal dashed lines indicate the expected proportion of responses for the ideal observer who uses the optimal decision boundary. The expected proportions are shown for several perceptual sensitivities ranging from no sensitivity (d = 0) to near-perfect sensitivity (d = 4).</p><p>times less reward. Occasionally, an ambiguous intermediate (0.75kHz) tone was played and was randomly treated as a low or high tone for scoring purposes including the magnitude of reward (i.e., half the trials a low-tone response was required and furnished the small reward value, and the other trials a high-tone response was required and was rewarded well). <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref> shows the SDT diagram for this experiment, with three distributions for each of the three possible tones. Participants had overall high discrimination performance between low and high tones,</p><p>reflecting high perceptual sensitivity. The mean d for the control and anxiety groups were 3.6 and 3.5 respectively.</p><p>To maximise reward, the participant should be biased towards responding "high tone" because it is more highly rewarded. This can be seen in the criterion (dashed grey line) depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>, which is shifted leftward from the neutral position at 0. The bias should be most the evident for the ambiguous trials, where the proportion of "high-tone" to "low-tone" trials is a good indicator of criterion placement. The dashed lines in <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref> show the expected proportion of "high-tone" judgements in the ambiguous condition for ideal observers with several different levels of perceptual sensitivity. The optimal criterion is affected by sensitivity (see Eq.1): the higher the sensitivity, the more the observer should trust the sensory measurement and consequently lowering the bias from reward. Yet, even for extremely high perceptual sensitivity, it is still optimal to have a bias for the more rewarded stimulus.</p><p>Participants in this task, however, showed a wide range of biases when presented with the ambiguous stimulus. On average, the control group responded "high tone" more often than the anxiety group. But many of them, as well as, critically, more than half of the anxiety group, showed a preference for selecting the low-rewarded "low-tone" option, interpreted as an affective bias. Thus, in this choice task, the affective bias is in direct opposition with optimal decisionmaking. We also note that using a log-space representation, typical for auditory experiments of tone frequency discrimination (to match the encoding characteristics of the cochlea), does not change the interpretation of the results and in fact predicts overall higher proportions of "high-tone" responses. There are a number of possible causes of this affective bias away from optimal decision-making, which we discuss in turn below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biased Criterion Placement</head><p>It is not uncommon to find that 'healthy' control observers fail to place their criterion at the optimal location <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ulehla, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackermann and Landy, 2015)</ref>. In the <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al. (2019a)</ref> example, the average control-group participant had a rate of "high tone" responses outside the range that could be considered optimal for even the most sensitive observer, instead responding with "high tone" and "low tone" more or less equally ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). In the terms of SDT, we can say the average observer placed their criterion between the neutral criterion at 0 (i.e., the mid-point between the two conditional response distributions) and the optimal criterion that maximises expected gain. This phenomenon is referred to as conservatism in criterion placement <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Green and Swets, 1966)</ref> and can be quantified as the fractional shift from the neutral to the optimal criterion, α = k/k opt , with 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 consistent with conservatism (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>).</p><p>Criterion conservatism, as well as other criterion biases more generally, can be a behavioural signature of one or more processes influencing the decision making process, which we discuss in turn below with reference to the tone task of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al. (2019a)</ref>.</p><p>1: Incorrect beliefs: Correctly calculating the optimal criterion requires three pieces of knowledge: the prior probabilities of each stimulus, the payoff structure of the environment, and perceptual sensitivity of the observer. If the observer is incorrect in their beliefs for one or more of these components, then they may set their criterion suboptimally. Humans can learn the properties of the choice environment through experience, however this takes time and and can be conservatively distorted <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Norton et al., 2019)</ref>. Alternatively, information about priors and payoffs can be explicitly conveyed to the observer, but they still may choose to rely on the recent stimulus history for judging the context <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Yu and Cohen, 2009)</ref>. How observers come to form an estimate of their own perceptual sensitivity is less understood and rarely discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rouault et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rouault and Fleming, 2020)</ref>, but it has been proposed observers may make incorrect inferences about the underlying noise distributions when placing a criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kubovy, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Locke et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, if the observer judges their d to be greater than it actually is (i.e., overconfidence) then this will lead to conservative criterion placement.</p><p>From an affective bias perspective, the anxious/depressed individuals of Aylward et al.</p><p>(2019a) may have misjudged the experimental context or their perceptual abilities. The most likely explanation is that they incorrectly believe that the highly rewarded high-tone stimulus is presented less frequently than the low-tone stimulus, leading to conservative criterion placement due to an incorrect assessment of prior probabilities. This may be due to a general belief that things good things do not happen often, or a focus towards remembering low-reward events and forgetting high-reward events.</p><p>2: Subjective probability and value: Another way the optimal criterion may be miscalculated is if cognitive biases distort the prior probabilities and payoff values. According to Prospect Theory, both the probability of events and the value of rewards are susceptible to biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fox and Poldrack, 2009)</ref>. That is, humans tend to overestimate the probability of unlikely events and under-estimate quite certain events. There is also a consideration of the utility of the possible rewards against what is already obtained or possessed. Gaining rewards is more useful to someone that has very little, compared someone who has a lot, and so the value of the reward is higher to a poorer individual. In general, individuals can differ significantly in how they perceive the value of a reward. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackermann and Landy (2015)</ref> showed that both these factors were predictive of criterion placement, suggesting distorted subjective prior probabilities and the expected utility of rewards contribute to 10 conservatism in perceptual decision-making.</p><p>In the tone-discrimination task, both groups may have been aware the high tone leads to higher reward, but the anxious/depressed individuals may be more indifferent to the relative reward value (i.e., the utility of the low and high rewards are more similar). This is most likely from under-valuing the large reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermann and Landy, 2015)</ref>, but over-valuing the small reward would also produce a similar result.</p><p>3: Maximisation strategy: The optimal strategy for maximising expected gain will sometimes lead to scenarios where the ideal observer selects the choice alternative that is less likely to be correct because it is rewarded more in terms of points/money/etc. This is because there is the tension between maximising gain versus maximising accuracy when payoffs are unequal. It has been suggested that human observers attempt to find a trade-off between these two goals, which leads to conservative criterion placement but higher overall choice accuracy <ref type="bibr">Bohil, 1998, 2003)</ref>. It is as if there is a cognitive cost to being incorrect and/or cognitive reward for being correct that is at play in perceptual decision-making. Another explanation for this phenomenon is that sacrificing some gains for better accuracy may foster more accurate judgements of perceptual confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Locke et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Applied to the tone-discrimination experiment, the depressed/anxious individual understands the reward structure of the experiment, but is less inclined to choose the high-tone response they think might be incorrect even if they will earn more money overall for doing so; they value more giving the correct answer in the task than their final earnings. Alternatively, if they are unable to prevent rewards from influencing their confidence, they will also have a sense of confidence more closely calibrated to reality if they do not let the payoff structure influence their decision. By selecting the low-and high-reward options more equally, they will avoid falsely optimistic confidence for high-reward responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4: Criterion adjustment:</head><p>Criterion placement may also be the result of a learning process by which the observer incrementally adjusts their criterion in response to the rate of change in reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Busemeyer and Myung, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Maddox and Bohil, 2003)</ref>. Adjustment stops when the rate of reward appears to be no longer increasing (i.e., the maximum is found). Conservatism occurs when there is insufficient adjustment of the decision criterion, from the neutral criterion, to reach the optimal criterion. According to this theory, the priors-payoff structure of the environment play a large role in determining the degree of conservatism. When small changes in the location of the decision boundary dramatically affect the rate of reward, learning should lead to a placement close to optimal. Conversely, inconsequential changes in reward rate are thought to lead to greater conservatism, as there is little to gain from further adjustment.</p><p>From the perspective of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al. (2019a)</ref> example, the anxious/depressed individuals may simply learn and/or adjust their criterion more slowly. If they were given more stimulus presentations they may eventually match the performance of the controls, although this is perhaps unlikely in this case as there is little change in performance in either group over time (and a version of this task has been shown to have very high split half reliability in a large sample; Daniel-Watanabe et al., 2020).</p><p>5: Other sources of bias: There are also general response biases that arise for various reasons: the observer has a task-unrelated preference for one stimulus (e.g., they have place a sentimental value on an outcome), the experimenter's instructions, perhaps inadvertently, encourage bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Morgan et al., 2012</ref>) (e.g., the experimenter says that they should select one option if unsure), or there different amounts of effort required to make each of the responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hagura et al., 2017</ref>) (e.g., an individual chooses the lower value option that is easier to obtain). It should also be noted that if the Gaussian-noise assumption of the basic SDT model is incorrect, then the predicted ideal criterion placement may also appear biased due to model misspecification rather than any actual bias in the individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Maloney and Thomas, 1991)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directions for future research</head><p>Affective biases have been long known to play a critical role in promoting and maintaining core symptoms of mental ill health. We have highlighted, however, how even a relatively clear-cut example of affective bias (e.g. reduced bias towards high vs low rewarding options in a simple perceptual task) can have multiple underlying causes. While biases in general are not unusual in perceptual tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rahnev and Denison, 2018)</ref>, investigating the source of the bias responsible for divergent behaviour between clinical and healthy populations could lead to a more precise understanding of the underlying symptoms. Furthermore, narrowing down which of these causes drives the overall bias can provide us with more precise targets for treatment intervention. In this next section we suggest a number of future directions to clarify the underlying cause of biased decision-making behind affective bias from a signal detection perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Beliefs about prior probabilities</head><p>Perhaps the most compelling hypothesis for affective bias in perceptual tasks is the incorrect beliefs about prior probabilities. One of the key clinical features of depression and anxiety is a belief that bad things are more likely to happen than good things. This is the basis, for example, of negative cognitive schemata that are targeted by cognitive behavioural therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beck, 1964)</ref>. If the individual believes that low-reward stimuli are presented more often than the high reward stimuli (due to their negative schemata), then it is rational to shift the decision criterion so as to select the low-reward stimulus more often. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A</ref>-B, this bias can offset the optimal shift due to the payoff structure (i.e., move the criterion back towards the neutral location), or, in the case of extreme over-estimation of the low-reward stimulus probability, reverse the bias entirely. Previous work has indicated that those with higher trait anxiety make stronger use of prior probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kraus et al., 2021)</ref>, so an incorrect belief is likely to have a large behavioural effect such as the reversal of preference from high-to low-reward stimuli. Thus, incorrect beliefs about priors can account for both the affective bias signature of showing a degree of conservatism in their responses, as well as showing stronger attraction to the low-reward stimulus than the high-reward stimulus (e.g., as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al., 2019a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposed prior-beliefs test:</head><p>To test this hypothesis, patients and controls could be given a task where the prior probability of the stimuli are directly manipulated. For example, in one block of trials the split between low-and high-reward stimuli could be 30%-70% and the next 60%-40%, and so on. Participants would be told at the beginning of each block the probabilities of the stimuli have changed but would be left to work out the ratio themselves. Then, at the end of a block, they would be asked to report their belief about the prior probabilities. A survey before beginning the experiment could also be conducted to gauge to their beliefs about prior probabilities in laboratory settings, and ensure task comprehension. These reported priors could be used in several analyses. The first, to assess if the clinical group overestimates the probability of the low-reward event as compared to the non-clinical group. The second, would be to see how these reported prior beliefs predict criterion placement. The greater the estimated probability of A (P (A)), the greater the rightward shift in the criterion. B) The proportion of low-reward responses, for different beliefs about the prior probability of A. Prediction for the use of the optimal criterion with correct beliefs shown by the red marker, and incorrect prior beliefs by the black markers. The more the observer believes A is probable, the more low-reward responses. C) Criterion placement for different beliefs about perceptual performance. Under-estimations of performance (d &lt; 1) lead to leftward criterion shifts, and over-estimations of performance (d &gt; 1) lead to rightward criterion shifts. D) The proportion of low-reward responses, for different beliefs about performance. Predicted proportion with correct beliefs shown by the red marker, and incorrect beliefs by the black markers. Over-estimations of performance lead to more A responses and under-estimations to less.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Beliefs about performance</head><p>Another incorrect belief that could lead to an affective bias is the observer's belief about their own performance. Specifically, if an observer believes their performance to be much better than it actually is (i.e., higher perceived d ), then we would expect to see conservatism in their criterion placement consistent with the affective bias identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al. (2019a)</ref>.</p><p>This is because the influence of contextual factors, such as payoffs and prior probabilities, is diminished when the perceptual sensitivity is high. Thus, over-estimation of ability will lead the observer to trust their senses more than they should. Conversely, observers who under-estimate their ability should show the opposite pattern, responding more strongly in accordance with the relative value of rewards. These predictions are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3C</ref>-D.</p><p>Consistent with low self-confidence that forms a key part of the clinical presentation of deperession <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beck, 1964)</ref>, previous research shows that individuals with anxiety/depression symptoms tend to report low confidence when performing perceptual tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rouault et al., 2018</ref>). These trial-to-trial reports, if they inform a global sense of belief in performance, would predict a bias in criterion placement that is a reverse of affective bias. That is, the observer would be strongly influenced by the reward structure of the task, reporting the high-reward option against their own sensory evidence. It is for this reason that we believe investigating beliefs about overall task performance is important to understanding the interplay between affective bias and metacognitive differences in observers with anxiety or mood disorders. Recent research has demonstrated that beliefs about task performance are influenced by external feedback and trial-to-trial judgements of confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rouault et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus the role of feedback and confidence should be examined for their role in affect biases.</p><p>Proposed performance-beliefs test: An experiment to investigate beliefs about performance could vary the task difficulty in blocks. After each perceptual decision, the observer would report their sense of confidence in the correctness of their decision. At the end of each block, the observer would report their belief about their performance (e.g., on a scale of 0 to 100% correct). The prediction is that the anxiety/mood individuals would report lower confidence in their performance. They may have both the conservative criterion placement indicative of affective bias and low beliefs about performance (in conflict with the predictions of SDT), or the signature of affective bias with high beliefs about performance. Additionally, given that beliefs about performance are typically lower when no trial feedback is given <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rouault et al., 2019)</ref>, half of the blocks could contain feedback and the other half with no feedback. This would permit a within-subject analysis on the relationship between criterion placement and belief about performance as a function of feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Subjective value of reward</head><p>Another plausible explanation is that the individuals with affective bias actually value rewards differently. In particular, if there is is a devaluing of the high reward, then the subjective value of the low and high reward are more similar, and thus there is less motivation to prefer one outcome over the other. This would be consistent with anhedonia in depression, framed as 'loss of interest or pleasure' in diagnostic criteria <ref type="bibr">(American Psychiatric Association, 2013)</ref>, in which previously enjoyable things lose their value to depressed individuals. This is indeed observed on a wide range of reward-based cognitive tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pizzagalli et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Halahakoon et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>To understand how an individual subjectively experiences reward, scientists can measure the subjective utility function, which maps the objective value of a reward, V , to its subjective value, u(V ), and is typically expressed as in terms of a power function</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">u(V ) = V α<label>(5)</label></formula><p>(see <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>) with 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 typical <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fox and Poldrack, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In the SDT context, changing the subjective utility function has implications for the reward landscape ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>) and consequently the placement of the decision criterion ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4C</ref>).</p><p>The closer the subjective reward values are to equal, the closer the rational observer will place their criterion to the neutral location, because biasing the responses in favour of the high-reward stimulus makes little sense if the difference in reward is small, resulting in fewer high-reward responses ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4D</ref>). Given this context, we would hypothesise individuals expressing affective bias have smaller α values than a healthy control population if subjective utility is the source of affective bias in perceptual tasks. Clinical support for this hypothesis on subjective value in mood and anxiety disorders is limited and of mixed results <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chung et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Charpentier et al., 2017)</ref>, suggesting further research is required to understand the role of reward value distortions in choice behaviour. Additionally, to our knowledge, subjective reward values and bias in a perceptual task have not been compared within individuals with anxiety or mood disorders.</p><p>Proposed subjective-value test: To measure the subjective utility functions of participants, it is necessary to include Prospect Theory measures in addition to the perceptual task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermann and Landy, 2015)</ref>. Presenting a series of lottery choices like we described earlier (e.g., 25% chance of winning dollars, or 100% chance of 2 dollars), it is possible to measure each participant's subjective utility function. Then one could assess group-level differences in the subjective evaluation of reward (i.e., differences in α), as well as the degree to which subjective value predicts criterion placement in the perceptual task (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4C</ref>-D). Utility Function α Proportion "A" Responses <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: The effect of subjective value on decision-making. Predicted results shown for low-reward stimulus A (red) and high-reward stimulus B (blue), with equal priors (P (A) = P (B) = 0.5), correct B responses being rewarded twice as much as correct A responses (V A,A = 2 and V B,B = 4), and perceptual sensitivity of d = 1. A) Example subjective utility functions. When α &lt; 1, the subjective value of the two reward outcomes (A/B) is more similar. B) Reward landscape is affected by subjective utility function. Dashed lines show the criterion placement expected to maximise expected gain with the subjective reward values. When α &lt; 1, there is a dampening affect, with the perceived consequence of criterion misplacement being small (i.e., loss incurred is minimal for other values of k). C) Optimal criterion placement according to the subjective reward ratios. As α → 0, the criterion placement that maximises expected reward with these distorted reward values shifts towards the neutral position between the distributions. D) The proportion of low-reward responses when criterion is adjusted according to the subjective value of reward. When the subjective value matches objective value (red), the proportion of A responses is lower than if the subjective value is used with α &lt; 1 (black).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Learning the context</head><p>In several aspects, observers must succeed in learning about the context and their own performance to respond optimally. There is extensive clinical evidence for learning differences in depression and anxiety, from general cognitive impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rock et al., 2014)</ref> through to more specific changes to learning captured by, for example, reinforcement learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aylward et al., 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Halahakoon et al., 2020)</ref>. In perceptual tasks, participants must learn to correctly estimate the prior probabilities of the stimuli and the reward contingencies, as well as monitoring feedback and confidence to estimate perceptual sensitivity. Some models consider this learning process as a gradual adjustment of the criterion to its optimal position <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Busemeyer and Myung, 1992)</ref> whereas others investigate the learning process at the component level (e.g., priors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Norton et al., 2019)</ref>. An additional consideration is that the reward landscapes experienced by the participant can be affected by their subjective value of the reward (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>).</p><p>Additionally, if learning rates differ between those with and without anxiety/mood symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Vrieze et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aylward et al., 2019b)</ref>, this could increase criterion conservatism. Supporting this hypothesis is work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pizzagalli et al. (2008)</ref> showing that clinically depressed individuals have difficulties integrating the reinforcement history over time to correctly bias their responses towards highly rewarded options.</p><p>Proposed learning test: To investigate the role of learning in affective bias, one could use the overt-criterion task of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Norton et al. (2019)</ref> where observers complete a perceptual task with high external noise (i.e., experimenter controlled noise) that requires them to continually monitor the stimulus priors and adjust their criterion accordingly. Instead of reporting stimulus A or B, observers are asked to explicitly place a criterion and their response would be scored as correct if this criterion correctly categorises the stimulus. This modification allows for rapid shift in criterion to be detected and modelled. We predict that observers who display affective bias could either 1) have a slower learning rate, 2) a stronger bias towards equal probabilities, or 3) a bias inflating the probability of the low-reward stimulus. This task would be well complemented by including additional learning tasks, such as the multiarmed bandit task <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aylward et al., 2019b)</ref>, to directly compare learning parameters with SDT parameters, as well as the Prospect Theory measures mentioned in the previous future direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Need for accuracy</head><p>There are two ways in which a need for accuracy could affect criterion placement. The first is by selecting a decision strategy that emphasises getting the perceptual judgements correct over earning the most reward in the task. In the extreme, ignoring the reward values entirely would lead to the highest perceptual decision accuracy, but in practice observers are more likely to select a mixture strategy that is a trade-off between accuracy and gains <ref type="bibr">Bohil, 1998, 2003)</ref>. This trade-off behaviour in strategy selection can also be interpreted as a different need for accuracy: the need for our sense of confidence to best reflect true probability of being correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Locke et al., 2020)</ref>. The payoffs of a task can influence confidence ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lebreton et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Locke et al., 2020)</ref> despite not changing that probability that the decision was correct. For example, this can be an overconfidence when reporting the highly rewarded stimulus and underconfidence when reporting the low reward option. As such, the less influence such observers give to the payoffs of a task, the more accurate their confidence judgements will be. This hypothesis is supported in the affective bias literature by a phenomenon known as a 'catastrophic response to perceived failure' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Elliott et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Roiser et al., 2011)</ref>, where one instance of failure can have a snowball effect for a future series of failures. Thus the consequence of making a judgement against what the observer believes to be correct has a strong psychological cost that has not been factored into the optimal criterion calculation (Eq. 4) by the experimenter. In terms of confidence ratings, individuals with anxious-depression symptoms are also more accurate in their confidence judgements than those with other psychopathologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rouault et al., 2018)</ref>, as would be predicted by this hypothesis.</p><p>Proposed need-for-accuracy test: To test this hypothesis, individuals with and without anxiety and/or mood disorder symptoms could perform a perceptual task with the reward values changing from block to block. Strategy could be assessed by asking participants to self-report the importance they placed on getting the answers correct versus earning the most reward at the end of each block. Additionally, confidence judgements, on the correctness of their decision, could be included after every trial. Standard extensions of the SDT framework for confidence would then reveal if that observer let the rewards influence their confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Locke et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>If affective bias is driven by a need for high accuracy, we would see the anxiety/mood disorder individuals giving greater preference for being correct over earning more reward and being more susceptible to letting reward influence their sense of confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>In this paper, we have highlighted the advantage of considering the SDT framework for quantifying suboptimal decision-making and the various underling mechanisms which may drive affective bias in psychiatric disorders. We have also suggested a series of studies that could tease apart which of these mechanisms lead to affective bias, reframed as criterion conservatism within the SDT framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermann and Landy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rahnev and Denison, 2018)</ref>. The appeal of studying affective bias with low-level perceptual tasks is that such tasks are particularly amenable for testing both humans and animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Choi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Scannell and Bosley, 2016)</ref>. Thus, being more precise about the causes of affective bias in humans will allow us to more precisely test how representative the animal models are, and hence bolster the theoretical underpinnings of drug development pipelines for treatments of anxiety and mood disorders. The approach we outline also allows us to recast seemingly "irrational" behaviour as rational decision-making operating on incorrect or subjectively-distorted information. A better understanding of these distortions may eventually allow us to more precisely target treatments, and hence close the treatment gap in mood and anxiety disorders.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>.8 α = 0 .6 α = 0 .4 α = 0 .2 Illustration of the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) framework.</figDesc></figure>
