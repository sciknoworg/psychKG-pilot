			<abstract>
				<p>Cyber operations unfold at superhuman speeds where cyber defense decisions are based on human-tohuman communication aiming to achieve a shared cyber situational awareness. The recently proposed Orient, Locate, Bridge (OLB) model suggests a three-phase metacognitive approach for successful communication of cyber situational awareness for good cyber defense decision-making. Successful OLB execution implies applying cognitive control to coordinate self-referential and externally directed cognitive processes. In the brain, this is dependent on the frontoparietal control network and its connectivity to the default mode network. Emotional reactions may increase default mode network activity and reduce attention allocation to analytical processes resulting in sub-optimal decisionmaking. Vagal tone is an indicator of activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal node of the frontoparietal control network and is associated with functional connectivity between the frontoparietal control network and the default mode network. The aim of the present study was to assess whether indicators of neural activity relevant for the processes outlined by the OLB model were related to outcomes hypothesized by the model. Cyber cadets (N = 36) enrolled in a three-day cyber engineering exercise organized by the Norwegian Defense Cyber Academy participated in the study. Differences in prospective metacognitive judgements of cyber situational awareness, communication demands, and mood were compared between cyber cadets with high and low vagal tone. Vagal tone was measured at rest prior to the exercise. Affective states, communication demands, cyber situational awareness, and metacognitive accuracy was measured on each day of the exercise. We found that cyber cadets with higher vagal tone had better metacognitive judgments of cyber situational awareness, imposed less communication demands on their teams, and had more neutral moods compared to cyber cadets with lower vagal tone. These findings provide neuroergonomic support for the OLB model and suggest that it may be useful in education and training. Future studies should assess the effect of OLB-ing as an intervention on communication and performance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Cyber operations unfold at superhuman speeds which pose high demands on human cyber operators (CyOs). Due to the growing global network coverage and increasing interconnectedness between cyber and physical domains, cyber operations are conducted in a complex socio-technical system consisting of diverse human-machine and human-human interactions. Performance in this socio-technical system is influenced by several factors across multiple contexts including unique challenges spanning cyber, physical, cognitive, and social domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agyepong et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jøsok et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jøsok et al., , 2017</ref>. The resulting working-environment poses a complex selective pressure requiring a seemingly unique but currently understudied competency profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jøsok et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jøsok et al., , 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Knox et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., , 2018</ref>.</p><p>Organizations source their cyber operations to Security Operation Centers (SOCs) consisting of teams and organizational units that work around the clock to detect, assess, and respond to cyber threats. SOCs are usually hierarchically organized where analyst-level responsibilities such as detecting, investigating, and reporting on cyber threats are assigned to technical personnel (CyOs), while decision-making responsibilities are assigned to other individuals higher up in the SOC hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Staheli et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, CyOs are responsible for establishing situational awareness (SA) during cyber threat situations and communicating their SA to decision-makers. According to the SA model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Endsley, 1995)</ref>, establishing SA for decision-making in a socio-technical system is achieved in three levels <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1 (A)</ref>), where all levels must be achieved in order to have full SA. SA Level 1 entails perceiving the elements of the situation, SA Level 2 entails comprehending the relationship between these elements, and SA Level 3 entails using the comprehension to predict possible future situational states <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Endsley, 1995)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Endsley, 1995)</ref>. Communication has been added to the model due to its role in SOC team decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ask et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018)</ref>.

These requirements can be arranged under the SA model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1 (B)</ref>) where the establishment of SA Level 1 starts with having perceived indicators of compromise <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barford et al., 2009)</ref>. Establishing shared CSA during a cyber threat situation depends on both technical expertise and socio-cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Franke &amp; Brynielsson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jøsok et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jøsok et al., , 2019</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jøsok et al., 2016)</ref>.

(C) Communication between individuals located in different quadrants of the HS. (D) The OLB model. S = Strategic. P = Physical. T = Tactical. C = Cyber. OLB = Orient, Locate, Bridge.

CyOs must therefore be capable of flexibly transitioning between cyber-oriented analytical processes and socially-oriented processes such as adjusting communication to the needs of the recipient. This makes communication for shared CSA a dynamic and challenging process where the same complex information is communicated in different ways depending on the recipient's background <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahrend et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Staheli et al., 2016)</ref>. The Hybrid Space (HS) framework <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2  (A)</ref>) was developed to illustrate the interconnectedness between the cyber and physical (cyberphysical) domains, the tension between strategic and tactical goals in decision-making and action, thus outlining the cognitive landscape that CyOs must navigate <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jøsok et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Transitioning between quadrants in the HS to relay technical information to non-technical individuals, will in theory require the CyO to switch between mindsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jøsok et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018)</ref>. Doing this effectively depends on the CyOs ability to monitor and regulate their cognitions. Metacognition is the ability to direct attention internally to observe one's own cognitions, emotions, and behaviors, and assess if they align with goals, and consciously regulate them if needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Efklides, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Flavell, 1979)</ref>. Metacognition is required for establishing accurate SA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Endsley, 2020)</ref>. Previous studies on cyber cadets have shown that self-location and movements in the HS is predicted by metacognition and self-regulation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2 (B)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jøsok et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Knox et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Knox et al., , 2019</ref> and team communication measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lugo et al., 2017a)</ref>. When individuals are processing information in different domains, their cognitive focus is in different quadrants of the HS. Communicating across quadrants of the HS <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2 (C)</ref>) requires constant re-adjustment of communication flow and message content <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jøsok et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Recent reviews suggest that there is a lack of research on individual-and team-level SOC team communication and performance indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agyepong et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ask et al., 2021a)</ref>. The Orient, Locate, Bridge (OLB) model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2 (D)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018)</ref> was developed based on the HS framework to serve as a metacognitive tool supporting communication and sharing of CSA between individuals located in different quadrants of the HS. The OLB model is a three-phase model where each phase builds on the previous phase to facilitate efficient communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018)</ref>. In the orienting phase, the CyO applies metacognition to self-locate in the HS to get a grasp of their current mindset (e.g. where their focus is, if they are stressed, etc.) and their CSA. In the locating phase, the CyO applies perspective taking to understand the specific information and communication needs of the recipient based on their location in the HS. In the bridging phase, the CyO uses the insights from the orienting and locating phases as guide for adapting communication style and content. This last phase ensures that communication can be grounded and CSA can be shared and calibrated between the CyO and the communication partner.</p><p>In more general terms, OLB-ing can be understood as a stepwise cognitive control process involving the deliberate (endogenously controlled) and flexible transition between attention to internal and self-referential states (e.g. HS location, stress levels) and externally-oriented cognitive processes. Cognitive control is the goal-directed coordination of task-relevant cognitive processes while inhibiting task-irrelevant automatic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Friedman &amp; Robbins, 2022)</ref>. In the brain, goal-directed cognitive processes are organized by a network of brain areas called the frontoparietal control network (FPN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Duncan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Menon &amp; D'Esposito, 2022)</ref>. This includes integrating attention to information from the external-present task environment and attention to internal-future goal-representations to coordinate externally directed cognitive processes and behaviors towards goal attainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Nee, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Nee &amp; D'Esposito, 2016)</ref>. On the other hand, attention to internal and self-referential information such as thoughts or the intensity and significance of one's emotional state is processed and maintained by the default mode network (DMN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Raichle, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Raichle et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>Both the FPN and DMN have anatomical hubs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Menon &amp; D'Esposito, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Raichle, 2015)</ref>. The dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) is one of the main hubs in the FPN <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Menon &amp; D'Esposito, 2022)</ref>, while medial PFC structures (MPFC) constitute one of the main hubs of the DMN <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Raichle, 2015)</ref>. Activity in the FPN and DMN is often anticorrelated <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chang &amp; Glover, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fox et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Raichle et al., 2001)</ref>, and DLPFC and MPFC activity is often anticorrelated during FPN-related tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Liston et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Both the DLPFC and MPFC are involved in metacognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fleur et al., 2021)</ref>. The DLPFC is specifically involved in metacognitive decision-making, while both DLPFC and MPFC are involved in prospective metacognitive judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fleur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Vaccaro &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>. Cognitive processes can go from being metacognitively controlled <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Friedman &amp; Robbins, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Shimamura, 2014)</ref> to reactive (stimulus-driven) when subjected to stress or under emotional influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baek &amp; Falk, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Poth, 2021)</ref>. Previous studies on CyOs identified several emotional processes that may have differing effects on teamwork and communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ask et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lugo et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lugo et al., , 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lugo et al., , 2021</ref>. Emotions can be interpreted according to intensity (arousal) and whether they are positive, negative, or neutral (valence; or mood), and are processed differently by <ref type="bibr">DMN and FPN structures (Golkar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fujimoto et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nejati et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Terasawa et al., 2013)</ref>. Stress reduces connectivity between the DMN and FPN <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chand et al., 2020)</ref>, suggesting ways for how environmental pressures can disturb the flexible transition between self-referential and analytical processing.</p><p>From a neuroergonomics perspective, when faced with a challenging environment, the brain will find something akin to 'the path of least resistance' to optimal performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Botvinick, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hagura et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Khalil et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wickens et al., 2015)</ref>. This means initiating the cognitive processes and behaviors that are the least taxing to apply in order to reach a goal, given the environmental demands. If resulting in goal-attainment, they become part of a strategy for reaching the same goals under similar circumstances. The precision, combination, and order of the cognitions and behaviors, or trying new strategies to compare efficiency with older successful ones, are deliberately or unconsciously adjusted with experience via metacognitive and cognitive control processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Efklides, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Flavell, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Khalil et al., 2019)</ref>. Because the cybersecurity working-environment places such a heavy cognitive load on CyOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agyepong et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jøsok et al., 2016)</ref>, strategies for improved communication must not only be successful, they must also be neuroergonomic to be sustainable. If the processes outlined by the OLB model are both successful and neuroergonomic in a cybersecurity working-environment, then they should be selected for through evolutionary processes by the individuals working in those environments. If so, correlates of the neurocognitive processes underlying OLB-ing should be related to the outcomes predicted by the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Expert cyber incident response teams impose less communication demands on their teams compared to novices <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Buchler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lugo et al., 2017a)</ref>. Because experts have spent more time in cybersecurity working-environments, they have also had more time to go through evolutionary cycles for selecting neuroergonomic approaches to make communication more efficient. If the OLB model is neuroergonomic, the discrepancy in imposed communication demands between novices and experts may suggest that expert teams have a higher conscious or unconscious adoption rate of OLBrelated cognitive processes for communication.</p><p>The main aim of this study is to assess some of the neurocognitive assumptions of the OLB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018)</ref> to begin validating its potential as a neuroergonomic approach for CSA communication in cyber threat situations. This is done using peripheral proxies for DLPFC activity and FPN-DMN connectivity, and measurements of CSA, metacognition, and team communication. Prefrontally modulated vagal tone, quantified as vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV), represent the beat to beat variations in heart rate that are influenced by the vagus nerve and modulated by the PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appelhans &amp; Luecken, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Thayer et al., 2012)</ref>. Vagal tone is an indicator of DLPFC activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brunoni et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nikolin et al., 2017)</ref> and functional connectivity between the FPN and the DMN at rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chand et al., 2020)</ref>. Associations have been found between metacognition and vagal tone in non-cyber tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Meessen et al., 2018)</ref>. Vagal tone may therefore serve as a potential marker for the FPN-DMN interactions relevant for OLB-ing during cyber operations. Thus, we hypothesize that individuals with higher vagal tone have higher metacognitive accuracy and impose lower communication demands on their teams than individuals with lower vagal tone (hypothesis 1: H1).</p><p>The processing of emotional stimuli may influence cyber team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ask et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lugo et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lugo et al., , 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lugo et al., , 2021</ref> for example by diverting attention away from externally directed and endogenously controlled cognitive processing and more towards stimulus-driven external <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Poth, 2021)</ref> or internally directed self-referential processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baek &amp; Falk, 2018)</ref>. The DLPFC is involved in the self-report of valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Nejati et al., 2021)</ref> and can be distinguished from other prefrontal structures based on this function <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fujimoto et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nejati et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Terasawa et al., 2013)</ref>. Higher vagal tone is associated with stress resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hildebrandt et al., 2016)</ref> and endogenous control over attention during emotional distractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Geisler &amp; Kubiak, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Park et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Park et al., , 2013</ref> known to elicit DMN processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Winston et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Zhou et al., 2020)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesize that individuals with higher vagal tone, which reflects DLPFC function, will have different self-reported mood ratings than individuals with lower vagal tone (H2).</p><p>Metacognition is required for establishing accurate SA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Endsley, 2020)</ref>. The HS framework and the OLB model suggests that metacognition is required for efficient communication of CSA with other individuals in the HS <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jøsok et al., 2016)</ref>. Metacognitive accuracy, how correctly an individual is in evaluating their own performance, can manifest as correctly judging performance as bad or good. Because both establishing SA and sharing CSA though communication is reliant on metacognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Endsley, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jøsok et al., 2016)</ref>, we hypothesize that individuals with more correct CSA ratings have higher metacognitive accuracy than individuals with less correct CSA ratings (H3).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Ethics Statement</head><p>The present study conformed to institutional guidelines and was eligible for automatic approval by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services' (NSD) ethical guidelines for experimental studies. Participation was voluntary and all participants were informed about the aims of the study, the methods applied, that they could withdraw from participation at any time and without any consequences, and that if they did so all the data that was gathered from them would be deleted. After volunteering to participate in the study, participants were asked to provide informed consent on the first page of an online form where baseline data was collected. Participants were asked to generate and remember a unique participant ID that they would use during data collection for the duration of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Participants and setting</head><p>Cyber cadets (N = 36) that participated in the Norwegian Defense University College, Cyber Academy (NDCA) annual Cyber Engineering Exercise (CEX) were recruited for the study. The CEX is conducted during the fifth semester for graduating students at the NDCA. By this stage in their bachelor degree education they have chosen and begun their specialized training. The specializations are military Information Communication Technology (ICT) systems and Cyber Operations. The specialization split was eleven (11) cadets pursuing Cyber Operations and the remaining twenty-five (25) military ICT. The CEX is intended to provide the cyber cadets with a deeper understanding and appreciation for the breadth of a cyber engineer's profession and tasks in a military operative context. In particular, they develop more advanced technical skills in the domain of cyber operations, and provide insight into how incidents occurring in the military cyber domain may influence and be influenced by operations in other military and non-military domains. The cadets learn how to make good judgements, give honest recommendations through clear communication, and make good decisions that result in the effective use of cyber tools and technologies to achieve operational goals. The CEX was divided into two independent operations: military ICT Operations and Cyber Operations. Both operations lasted for five days (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> for an overview of the CEX and study). For the CEX, the cadets were divided into two platoons, with each platoon consisting of three teams. One platoon participated in military ICT Operations for five days, while the other platoon participated in Cyber Operations for five days. Each team consisted of six individuals that were composed by a mix of military ICT and Cyber Operations cadets. The first two days involved orders, preparation and training. This was followed by three days of mission execution. On day six there was a rotation where the platoons switched operations.</p><p>The present study took measurements when each group was undertaking the Cyber Operations track of the CEX. The defensive Cyber Operations involved scenario-based investigations of a network intrusion where the cadets experienced technical and operational uncertainty and complexity related to an exploitation of their military cyber domain. After the initial preparation and training phase, the cadets deployed to a notional area of operations. For the CEX this took the form of a separate room, where the cadets deployed network sensor capabilities into their infrastructure and began targeted network surveillance based on their operational assessment and plans. The scenario developed allowing cadets to conduct different analytical tasks and investigate specific types and instances of network traffic. The cadets advanced through the exercise by solving these analytical and investigative missions. Each day the exercise would begin at 08:00 and end at 22:00 with the level of intensity (operational uncertainty and technical complexity) imposed upon them gradually increasing each day.</p><p>Data from four participants were excluded. Data from one participant were excluded for only providing baseline HRV data and not filling out daily questionnaires. A second participant was excluded due to measurement error during recording of inter-beat intervals. Lastly, two participants were excluded due to not filling out relevant questionnaires for most of the exercise. Participants per rotation (n = 16).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Materials and Procedure</head><p>On the first day of the study, two days before the start of the CEX all participants answered a battery of questionnaires followed by recording of cardiac activity for quantification of vmHRV. Affective state, performance rating, team, and CSA measurements were collected on each day of the exercise. In the morning of each day of the exercise (approx. 7:30 am), participants answered questionnaires pertaining to their affective state and judgments about how well they think they would perform. At the end of each day (approx. 9 pm), participants answered questionnaires pertaining to judgments about how well they thought they had performed, team-workload demands, and CSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Vagally mediated heart rate variability</head><p>Cardiac activity was recorded at rest for seven minutes two days prior to the start of the exercise using the Alive Software (Alive TM by Somatic Vision, Inc.) biofeedback system. Alive measures heart rate through photoplethysmography. The recordings were conducted one at a time in a separate room that was secluded from other activities. Participants were seated in a comfortable chair. Three finger sensors were placed on the participant's non-dominant hand, after which they were told to rest for some minutes by themselves. After giving the instructions, the researcher left the room for the entirety of the sevenminute recording period.</p><p>Inter-beat intervals were extracted via R-peak detection and HRV was analyzed using ARTiiFACT software <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kaufmann et al., 2011)</ref>. Artifacts were detected and corrected according to established methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berntson &amp; Stowell, 1998)</ref>. The high frequency component of HRV (HFHRV: 0.15-0.40 Hz) and the time-domain measure of HRV, root-mean-squares of successive NN differences (RMSSD), were extracted following recommendations by the Task Force <ref type="bibr">(Task Force, 1996)</ref>. Both indices are commonly used as indicators of vagal tone. We were mainly interested in HFHRV as RMSSD has suggested to also be influenced by sympathetic input <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berntson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Williams et al., 2019)</ref> and evidence relating transcranial stimulation over DLPFC to prefrontally modulated vagal tone used HFHRV as indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brunoni et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nikolin et al., 2017)</ref>. HFHRV and RMSSD are usually highly correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Goedhart et al., 2007)</ref>, thus we included RMSSD in the initial analysis to check for this correlation as an indicator of vmHRV index quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Self-Assessment Manikin</head><p>The self-assessment manikin (SAM) is a non-verbal assessment of affective states <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bradley &amp; Lang, 1994)</ref>. It consists of three pictorial items: Valence (mood; ranging from very negative to very positive), arousal (activation; ranging from very low to very high), and dominance (control; ranging from very low to very high) that are each measured on a 9-point scale, where participants indicate what they feel in the moment for each item. The SAM was administered at the beginning of each day during the exercise. The mean for mood, activation, and control scores were computed for each individual for all three days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Judgement of Performance</head><p>A judgment of performance (JOP) questionnaire was used to assess the participants' prospective estimations of how well they would perform. The JOP questionnaire is used to assess how confident participants are about their future performance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Sütterlin et al., 2022)</ref>. The questionnaire consisted of six items that were handed out at the beginning and at the end of each day, and included questions such as "How well do you think you will do?", and "How well will my team do?". The prospective JOP questionnaires were handed out at the beginning of each day. On each item, participants indicated their performance on a scale ranging from 0 to 100%.</p><p>For this study, daily prospective JOP at the individual and team level were z-transformed before averaging to generate prospective self-assessment (JOP) and team assessment (JOP team) JOP scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">Team Workload Questionnaire</head><p>Establishing CSA is a team effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Champion et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jøsok et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">McNeese et al., 2011)</ref>. The team workload questionnaire (TWLQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sellers et al., 2014)</ref> was administered at the end of each day and used to assess how participants experienced workload demands on team tasks during the exercise. The items are scored on an 11-point Likert scale ranging from very low to very high. High scores indicate higher levels of subjective workload. The TWLQ consists of six subscales divided on two dimensions, the Teamwork component (communication, coordination, team performance monitoring) and Task-Team component (time-share, team emotion, team support). Average scores for all three days were generated based on these subscales. TWLQ shows good reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sellers et al., 2014)</ref>. Reliability was also good in the present study (Cronbach's α = .839). The perceived team success item from the NASA Task Load Index assesses retrospective confidence judgements of team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hart &amp; Staveland, 1988)</ref> and was also included in the daily TWLQ questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5">Cyber Situational Awareness Questionnaire for Analysts</head><p>To assess CSA among participants, the CSA Questionnaire for Analysts (CSAQA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lif et al., 2017)</ref> was administered at the end of each day. The CSAQA consists of a combination of qualitative and quantitative questions. Among the questions included in CSAQA, the following four were used for the purpose of study 1: "Where in the Kill Chain is attack 1?" (Kill chain), "How critical is the system?" (System critical), "How Severe is the Attack?" (Attack severity), "How urgent is it to take action?" (Action urgency).</p><p>For all CSA items, participants had to indicate which estimate they thought was correct on a Likert scale from 1-7. For the Kill chain item, participants had to indicate on a Kill chain flow chart where the attack was (seven options). Their answers were converted to a score from 1 to 7 depending on where in the kill chain they indicated that the attack was, with 7 corresponding to 'Action on objectives', which is the last step in the kill chain.</p><p>Participants were instructed to leave items they did not know what to answer blank but to write their participant ID on the front page, in which case those items were coded as 0 (thus making CSA items range from 0 to 7). Responses were coded as missing if the entire form was left empty. Reliability for CSA items was good (Cronbach's α = .771).</p><p>Correct answer for the Kill chain item was 7. Correct answer for Attack severity was 7. Correct answer for Action urgency was 7. Correct answers for System critical was 6. CSA scores for the participants were generated by scoring correct assessments on the questionnaires for each day as 1 and erroneous assessments as 0. The scores for each day were z-transformed before averaging to generate CSA scores. Kill chain estimations could in theory be inferred from exercise instructions thus being too easy to tax metacognitive abilities. Metacognitive estimations for easy tasks are less subject to bias than for harder tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fleur et al., 2021)</ref>. Accounting for this possible confounder, a second CSA score was generated through the same steps as for the initial CSA variable except Kill chain scores were excluded, resulting in a CSA2 variable.</p><p>The same procedure was done at the team level, where team CSA scores were generated based on the averaged correct CSA estimations for the entire team, and a team CSA2 variable was generated by excluding Kill chain scores.</p><p>Due to the structure of the exercise, participants would only be able to make informed judgments on the attack severity item on day four and five, while informed judgments on kill chain, how critical the system was, and action urgency were possible on all three days. There was a very low number of correct CSA answers on day one which was likely due to participants spending time on sensor deployment and only starting to establish CSA during the tail end of the day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6">Metacognitive accuracy</head><p>The individual and team CSA scores for each day, and the personal and team JOP scores for each day were used to generate the metacognitive accuracy (MCA) scores. CSA scores were range converted to a 0-100 scale. MCA scores were calculated as a deviation score using the approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Meessen et al. (2018)</ref>. Briefly, scores were generated by squaring the product from subtracting the daily JOP scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for each day from the daily CSA scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for each day. This was followed by dividing by 100, using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ( − ) 2 100</formula><p>Because JOP scores are subtracted from the accuracy scores, CSA performance that matches performance estimations will give a score of zero, while performance estimations that are below or above CSA performance will give a score that deviates from zero. Squaring the product returns an equal positive value for all negative and positive equivalent deviations from zero. Thus, a low MCA score indicates high metacognitive accuracy, and a high MCA score indicates low metacognitive accuracy regardless of inaccuracy resulting from overconfidence or underconfidence. At the team level, a high metacognitive accuracy means having high accuracy when judging team-level CSA.</p><p>The z-transformed MCA scores for each day were averaged to generate two sets of MCA variables, MCA and team MCA. While the DLPFC is needed for making prospective metacognitive judgements about performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Vaccaro &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>, metacognition for team processes is suggested to rely on different neural systems than those for individual metacognitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Shea et al., 2014)</ref>. Following the rationale for generating the CSA variables, two separate MCA variables were generated for each set: MCA and team MCA, and MCA2, and team MCA2, where the MCA2 variables excluded Kill chain scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Statistical Analysis</head><p>Descriptive statistics were generated for all variables and presented in tables as mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum (min), and maximum (max) values for continuous and numerical variables, and frequencies and percentages (%) for ordinal variables.</p><p>Inspecting box-and-whisker plots of variables identified one outlier (value &gt; 1.5 times the interquartile range above the upper quartile) for HFHRV. After re-inspection of IBI recording and artifact analysis for the HFHRV outlier it was concluded that measurement error was unlikely, thus, HFHRV was log-transformed to pull in the outlier. Follow-up inspecting box-and-whisker plots confirmed that the log-transformed variable no longer contained extreme values. All subsequent analyses were performed on the log-transformed HFHRV variable.</p><p>For the purpose of the present study, we were mainly interested in the communication demand item of the TWLQ due to reported differences between expert and novice teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Buchler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lugo et al., 2017a)</ref>, and because the OLB model aims to reduce communication demands by making communication more efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018)</ref>. Because establishing CSA is a team effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Champion et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jøsok et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">McNeese et al., 2011)</ref>, all TWLQ items were included in the analysis to assess the relationship between team workloads and team-level CSA and MCA. All variables were z-transformed for analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test of normality and confirmatory visual inspection of bar-graph distribution plots revealed that many of the variables were not normally distributed. Subsequent correlational analyses were parametric for relationships between normally distributed variables (SAM, HFHRV, MCA2, team MCA, team performance monitoring, team support demand), and nonparametric for all other relationships including between normally and not normally distributed variables.</p><p>Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses (2-tailed) was performed simultaneously for all variables and results were presented in a heat map as Spearman correlation coefficients (⍴) for nonparametric associations and Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) for parametric associations. RMSSD was included in the correlation analysis to check for associations with HFHRV but was not included in the heat map. Separate linear regression analyses were performed for significant correlations. All regressions were checked for violation of assumptions regarding homoscedasticity, normality, linearity and multicollinearity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Analysis of group differences</head><p>The Differences between high and low HFHRV groups were assessed using Pillai's MANOVA and ANOVA for parametric comparisons and Kruskal-Wallis H tests for nonparametric comparisons. Results for the Pillai test were reported as Pillai's Trace (TracePillai), approximate F(degrees of freedom 1, degrees of freedom 2) (F(df1, df2)), and p-values. Results for ANOVA were reported as F statistic(df), p-values, and effect size. Kruskal-Wallis H test was reported as H statistic(df), p-values, and effect size.</p><p>Effect size (η 2 ) for Kruskal-Wallis H test was calculated as (H -k + df)/(n -k); where H was the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, k was the number of groups, and n was the total number of observations (32). Effect size (ω 2 ) for ANOVA was calculated as (sum of squares between -(k -1)mean square within)/(sum of squares total + mean square within). Dunn's post hoc test was used to assess significant relationships for non-parametric variables between groups and was reported as z-statistic and Bonferroni adjusted p-values (pbonf). Tukey's post hoc test was used to assess significant relationships for parametric variables between groups and was reported as mean difference (MD) and pbonf.</p><p>Violation of assumptions for MANOVA analyses were assessed with Box's M-test for homogeneity and Shapiro-Wilk test for multivariate normality. Violation of assumptions for ANOVA analyses were assessed with Levene's test for equality of variance and by inspecting Q-Q plots of residuals. There were no violations at any time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">Comparisons between low and high vagal tone groups</head><p>Median split was performed on HFHRV (vagal tone groups) to divide the sample into high HFHRV (HFHRV &gt; median) and low HFHRV (HFHRV ≤ median) groups. This method is commonly used in studies aiming to assess vagal tone-related group differences on cognitive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hansen et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hansen et al., , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Pu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Williams et al., 2017)</ref>. To test the hypotheses that individuals with higher vagal tone have higher metacognitive accuracy and impose lower communication demands on their teams than individuals with lower vagal tone (H1), and that individuals with higher vagal tone have different self-reported mood ratings than individuals with lower vagal tone (H2), ANOVAs were performed using vagal tone groups as fixed factors and mood, communication demand, and MCA variables as dependent variables. Metacognition has been suggested to be required for SA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Endsley, 2020)</ref> so CSA variables were also included in the analysis.</p></div>

However, vagal tone can be influenced by processes other than DLPFC activity <ref type="bibr">(Task Force, 1996)</ref>, but prospective metacognitive judgements are dependent on DLPFC activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fleur et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, median split was performed on MCA and team MCA to assess whether vagal tone was different between individuals with high and low MCA and team MCA. Due to low MCA scores meaning high accuracy, individuals below the median had high accuracy, and individuals above the median had low accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4">Comparisons of MCA between CSA accuracy groups</head><p>In the present study, high metacognitive accuracy (indicated by low MCA scores) could be due to accurately judging good or bad performance (e.g. having 0% correct answers and judging performance at 0%, and having 100% correct answers and judging performance at 100% would both give a score of zero). Median split was performed on the summed total of correct CSA ratings for both days to divide the sample two groups (CSA accuracy) according to whether they were less accurate or more accurate in their CSA ratings. To test the hypothesis that individuals with higher metacognitive accuracy have more correct CSA ratings than individuals with lower metacognitive accuracy (H3), two separate analyses were performed using MCA or MCA2 as dependent variable and CSA accuracy as fixed factor. This procedure was repeated for team MCA variables also, where median split was performed on the summed total of correct team CSA ratings after averaging for number of team members.</p><p>Alpha levels for hypothesis testing were set at the .05 level for all analyses.

This was done in a sample of cyber cadets participating in a cyber engineering exercise by using a combination of psychophysiological, CSA, metacognitive, and team measurements targeted at assessing some of the OLB model's implicit underlying neurocognitive assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jøsok et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018</ref>). The OLB model outlines an adaptive three-step metacognitive control process for how to communicate efficiently between individuals under varying cyber situational dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018)</ref>. In the OLB model, the communicator integrates self-referential, selfother, situational, and task-goal information to ground communication and establish a shared CSA.</p><p>This requires the prefrontal part of the brain to coordinate activity across brain structures and networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Friedman &amp; Robbins, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Morales et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nee, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Nee &amp; D'Esposito, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Being a proxy for activity in prefrontal structures relevant for OLB-ing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brunoni et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chand et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nikolin et al., 2017)</ref>, we hypothesized that individuals with high vagal tone had higher metacognitive accuracy and imposed less communication demands on their teams compared to individuals with low vagal tone (H1). In our initial analyses, we found that vagal tone was associated with higher metacognitive accuracy for prospective judgements about individual performance and team performance. This is in line with previous studies suggesting that the DLPFC is involved in prospective metacognitive performance estimations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fleur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Vaccaro &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>. In our betweengroup analyses comparing differences in metacognitive accuracy and communication demands between individuals with low and high vagal tone, we found that team-level metacognitive accuracy was significantly higher in the high vagal tone groups. Individual-level metacognitive accuracy was not significantly different between vagal tone groups. That the findings regarding individual metacognitive accuracy for the whole sample could not be replicated in the sub-group analysis could be due to the size of the sub-groups. Both vagal tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brunoni et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chand et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nikolin et al., 2017)</ref> and prospective metacognitive judgements are influenced by activity in the DLPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fleur et al., 2021)</ref>. Vagal tone is, however, influenced by several physiological processes other than DLPFC activity <ref type="bibr">(Task Force, 1996)</ref>, as opposed to prospective metacognitive judgements which are dependent on the DLPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Vaccaro &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>. Thus, to make sure to account for this possible influence on our results, we did a follow-up analysis assessing differences in vagal tone between individuals with high and low individual and team-level metacognitive accuracy. Vagal tone was higher in individuals with higher metacognitive accuracy for both individual and team-level performance estimations. Finally, in line with our hypothesis, we also found that individuals with high vagal tone imposed lower communication demands on their team compared to individuals with low vagal tone.</p><p>Our findings should be interpreted in light of previous research suggesting that communication inefficiencies are one of the main problems facing SOC teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agyepong et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ask et al., 2021a)</ref>. These inefficiencies occur both between analyst-level personnel, for example where CyOs fail to communicate threat and defense knowledge, ultimately resulting in team members wasting time researching a problem that someone on the team has already solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahrend et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Staheli et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Skopik et al., 2016)</ref>. Communication inefficiencies also occur between analysts-level and decision-making personnel, where critical information for establishing CSA may get lost as it is communicated from technical personnel and upwards in the decision-making hierarchy to less technical personnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jøsok et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Staheli et al., 2016)</ref>. Suggestions for improving communication between SOC teams have been proposed, such as establishing shared mental models for communication and transactive memories about the expertise and knowledge of team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hámornik &amp; Krasznay, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Steinke et al., 2015)</ref>. This is considered to be especially critical during cyber threat situations where time pressure is high, and one-way communication is required where all critical information is communicated at once. Our findings may indicate that OLBrelated metacognitive processes may help facilitate and proliferate a better understanding of the knowledge and competencies of individuals on the team, and that this is related to establishing better team-level CSA.</p><p>Our sample consisted of cyber cadets that know and are used to interact with each other. Nevertheless, our findings may also have relevance for the challenges that arise when information has to be communicated between people that have different priorities spanning the cyber-physical and strategic-tactical dimensions of cyber operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jøsok et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jøsok et al., , 2017</ref>. Suggested approaches for developing shared mental models for SOC team communication mainly focus on establishing what information that should be communicated ahead of time, or understanding the procedures related to performing the tasks of different members on the team <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hámornik &amp; Krasznay, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Steinke et al., 2015)</ref>. Due to different stakeholders having different communication needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahrend et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jøsok et al., 2016)</ref>, it is hard to define any set protocol for what to communicate, and it is generally understood that approaches must be adapted to the needs of SOC teams and their clients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ask et al., 2021a)</ref>. This is especially the case for communication between technical and non-technical personnel in situations where communication must be adapted according to changing situational dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ask et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jøsok et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, developing good process-based models for dynamic communication that can be implemented in cyber defense training and education is urgently needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ask et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018)</ref>. This is where the findings in the present study may be relevant. Due to the cognitive load associated with the cybersecurity working-environment, models for communication must be feasible to apply in high-stress situations to be sustainable. Applying metacognitive processes in a three-step fashion as outlined in the OLB model may also provide opportunities for regulating stress prior to communication. This may result in an increased capacity for processing the information that is communicated, or remembering what should be communicated Thus, while having a strategic plan for what to communicate during a cyber threat situation is considered crucial for communication to be efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hámornik &amp; Krasznay, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Steinke et al. 2015)</ref>, approaches such as the OLB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018)</ref> that are designed for situational adaptation may serve as a neuroergonomic complement to facilitate strategic communication.</p><p>The present findings may shed light on results from other studies on cyber defense teams indicating that experts impose less communication demands on their teams than novices <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Buchler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lugo et al., 2017a)</ref>. This may suggest that experts have a better metacognitive understanding of team competence and more efficient (shared) mental models for communication than novices. If expert team communication efficiency reflects a higher rate of adoption of neuroergonomic strategies in response to working under stress, then even unconscious strategy adoption may result in a higher number of shared, albeit implicit mental models for team communication. Overlap of implicit mental models may depend on the degree of strategy convergence that is enforced by environmental pressure. Learning cognitive skills is associated with reduced activity in brain areas responsible for the skill, which is considered a marker for increased processing efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fleur et al., 2021)</ref>. However, having an accurate mental model of the competencies of team members may serve as an anchor for cognitive effort one considers necessary for performing well during a cyber threat situation. An example may be finding a compromise between social loafing and effort where the highest level of cognitive output can be sustained for the longest period of time. Previous research has indicated that level 3 situational awareness is more taxing on working memory than preceding levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gutzwiller &amp; Clegg, 2013)</ref>. Cognitive strategies that serve to balance personal knowledge acquisition with cognitive offloading without compromising team performance may compete with strategies for maximizing expertise and being the one to solve any given problem. At intermediate levels of environmental stress, any one strategy, or a flexible combination of the two, may be equally sustainable. Under increasing loads, however, strategies should converge on those optimizing for balancing cognitive offloading with sustained effort, which may favor metacognitive team processes over individual processes. Strategy convergence may, however, depend on how salient tasks are, and the interests and priorities of the individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wickens et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>It has been suggested that individual and team-based metacognitions depend on different processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Shea et al., 2014)</ref>. Interestingly, while being associated with the accuracy of prospective performance judgements, vagal tone was not associated with prospective judgements of confidence in individual nor team performance, but was negatively associated with retrospective confidence judgements of team success. In turn, retrospective judgements of performance were negatively associated with the accuracy of prospective metacognitive judgements of team performance, but not individual performance. Retrospective judgments are associated with activity in the parahippocampal structures and the inferior frontal gyrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Vaccaro &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>, but are typically assessed at the individual level in neurocognitive studies and not in a team setting. While fast acting connections between the DLPFC and hippocampal structures have been established <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Friedman &amp; Robbins, 2022)</ref>, recent studies show that tracking dynamic social behavior is dependent on interactions between the DLPFC and dorsomedial <ref type="bibr">PFC (McDonald et al., 2020)</ref>. This paper argues that the processes outlined by the OLB model rely on the coordinated and flexible transition between FPN-and DMN-related information processing, which is a cognitive control process <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Friedman &amp; Robbins, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nee, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Nee &amp; D'Esposito, 2016)</ref>. Vagal tone measured at rest is associated with connectivity between the DMN and FPN <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chand et al., 2020)</ref>. The transition between cognitive processes can either be subject to self-regulated metacognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Shimamura, 2014)</ref> or stimulus-driven as a result of stress and emotional influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baek &amp; Falk, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Poth, 2021)</ref>. A recent study found that the FPN was involved in metacognitive judgements along with DMN structures, where activity in both the DLPFC and MPFC was negatively associated with confidence judgements <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Morales et al., 2018)</ref>. Emotions are processed differently by <ref type="bibr">DMN and FPN structures (Golkar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fujimoto et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nejati et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Terasawa et al., 2013)</ref>, while stress disrupts connectivity between the FPN and DMN along with its association with vagal tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chand et al., 2020)</ref>. Previous studies on cyber cadets identified several emotional and self-regulatory processes that may have differing effects on teamwork and communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ask et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jøsok et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Knox et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lugo et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lugo et al., , 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lugo et al., , 2021</ref>. As the DLPFC is involved in mood processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Golkar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nejati et al., 2021)</ref>, we hypothesized that individuals with higher vagal tone had different self-reported mood ratings than individuals with lower vagal tone (H2). In line with our second hypothesis, we found that vagal tone was negatively associated with mood. This finding was also replicated in our subgroup analysis where individuals with higher vagal tone had lower selfreported mood than individuals with lower vagal tone.</p><p>The valence-arousal plots showing daily mood and arousal for individuals with high and low vagal tone indicated that individuals with high vagal tone had more neutral moods on day three of the exercise, while individuals with low vagal tone had more positive moods. In a previous study, we found that variations in daily affect was associated with experienced team workloads among cyber cadets participating in a cyber defense exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ask et al., 2021b)</ref>. While the significance of such findings may be unclear with respect to exercise outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lund, 2022)</ref>, the findings in present study may serve to further elucidate their relevance beyond suggesting that individual characteristics influence team dynamics. While stress and urgency may disturb analytic cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Poth, 2021)</ref>, positive moods, as opposed to neutral moods may also result in transitioning from analytical processing to stimulus-oriented processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baek &amp; Falk, 2018)</ref>, for example as a result of optimism bias and mood congruent processing, lack of suspicion, or overconfidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Canham et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Sütterlin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Vishwanath et al., 2016)</ref>. In practice, this may result in reduced situational understanding, as indicated in our study by positive moods being a significant negative predictor of both individual and team-level prospective metacognitive judgements of performance, as well as being a positive predictor of retrospective judgements of team success. Retrospective judgments of team success were as noted negatively associated with the accuracy of team-level metacognitive judgements. These findings also mirror other studies where overconfidence have been associated with worse threat detection abilities among IT and cybersecurity personnel <ref type="bibr">(Butavicius et al., 2016, preprint;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Jampen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Sütterlin et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, having high metacognitive accuracy could be either due to accurately judging performance as bad or as good. Thus, it was technically possible that individuals with high metacognitive accuracy could perform equal to-or even worse on CSA estimations than individuals with low metacognitive accuracy as long as they were more correct in their performance estimations. Because good cyber defense decision-making is based on having accurate CSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barford et al., 2009)</ref>, and metacognitive accuracy is necessary for correct SA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Endsley, 2020)</ref>, we also tested the hypothesis that individuals with higher metacognitive accuracy would have more correct CSA ratings than individuals with lower metacognitive accuracy (H3). We found that individuals with higher metacognitive accuracy also had more correct CSA ratings at both the individual and team-level. This supports our hypothesis and the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Endsley (2020)</ref>. That no measurement of team dynamics other than retrospective judgements of performance were associated with accurately judging team performance and team-level CSA ratings, stresses the importance of training metacognitive skills to ensure that SOC teams are able to generate and share accurate CSA. In other words, team based training in absence of metacognitive training may not efficiently provide all the skills necessary for ensuring SOC team performance. This should arguably occur during education rather than relying on individual SOC teams to ensure that new recruits learn metacognitive skills. This may, however, challenge traditional educational and organizational practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jøsok et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knox et al., 2018)</ref> as reflected in the plethora of challenges SOC teams face <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agyepong et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ask et al., 2021a)</ref>. Originally developed as a pedagogical tool, the OLB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018</ref>) may serve as a flexible approach to metacognitive training that is easy to implement across learning situations and institutions.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providing neuroergonomic insights into the relationship between communication in teams and metacognitive CSA accuracy in a cybersecurity setting. While we aimed to provide neuroergonomic support for the OLB model, the present findings could also be used to argue for the importance of psychophysiological measurements in recruitment, training, and performance monitoring. Previous research found associations between vagal tone and performance among tactical personnel in non-cybersecurity settings (including military; <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tomes et al., 2020)</ref>. The present study is the first showing that vagal tone may also serve as an indicator of performance in a cybersecurity setting. To the extent that vagal tone reflects ability for self-regulation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Segerstrom &amp; Nes, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Reynard et al., 2011)</ref>, our findings are an addition to a growing body of literature showing relationships between self-regulation and movements in the Hybrid Space <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jøsok et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Knox et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Knox et al., , 2019</ref>. Finally, the present findings also provide support for a scarce literature on relationships between vagal tone and metacognitive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Meessen et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Limitations and future directions</head><p>The aim of this study was to assess the neurocognitive assumptions of the OLB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018)</ref> to determine its potential as a neuroergonomic approach to improve communication. We did this using vagal tone as a proxy for neural activity thought to be relevant for OLB execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brunoni et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chand et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nikolin et al., 2017)</ref>. The present study goes some length in achieving this, however, future studies should use an intervention design where some participants are trained in explicitly applying the model. While vagal tone is considered a stable trait that is hard to change with intervention (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brunoni et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Neyer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wheeler et al., 2014)</ref>, metacognition is something that can be trained <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fleur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jøsok et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, it would be both interesting and necessary to assess whether individuals who are trained in applying the OLB model but have low vagal tone perform better than individuals who are not trained in using the model but have high vagal tone. To ensure that this is done in a naturalistic setting may require experimental collaboration between cognitive scientists and cyber defense exercise organizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ask et al., 2021a</ref>).</p><p>Albeit comparing team-level and individual level MCA is not addressed in this study, <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> indicates that the number of correct individual answers for each CSA item per day is mostly overlapping between individuals with high individual-and team-level MCA, although slightly favoring individual MCA. However, when looking at the descriptive statistics for the mean percent of correct answers within teams, the proportion of the mean of correct team answers appears larger for individuals with high team MCA, even though the number of their individual contributions are lower. As noted in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ask et al., 2021a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ask et al., , 2021b</ref>, including both team-and individual-level measurements is important to develop SOC team performance metrics, and future studies should assess how teamlevel and individual-level metacognition contributes to team performance. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> it appears that individuals with high individual-and team-level metacognitive accuracy on day one were completely overlapping. The OLB model suggests using metacognition to make communication of CSA between team members more efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Knox et al., 2018)</ref>. Supra-individual metacognitive processes are suggested to be involved in inter-individual cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Shea et al., 2014)</ref>, thus it would be interesting to see whether individuals with high metacognitive accuracy in the beginning of a cyber defense exercise influence the evolution of team performance.</p><p>As part of the exercise, the cadets were also assessed on leadership skills and factors other than CSA and mission success. It is possible that some participants included these factors when making prospective judgements of their own and team performance, thus inflating or deflating their confidence relative to our outcome measurements. Because excluding this possibility would require probing each participant of what they based their estimations on, it is safer to assume that our MCA estimates are conservative. Furthermore, there have been reported sex differences in relationships between social orientations and vagal tone <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lischke et al., 2018)</ref>. Due to conducting the study in a security setting, we did not ask participants to provide information on their sexes. While the sex of participants is commonly underreported in cybersecurity studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ask et al., 2021a)</ref>, a recent study suggested that sex may play a role in communication among cyber engineers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fisher, 2022)</ref>. Future studies should therefore make an effort to also assess whether findings are differentially influenced by sex. A final limitation of the current study is the sample size. While the present study included the entire cohort of the studied population, more studies are needed to replicate findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Prefrontally modulated vagal tone, an indicator of activity in brain structures relevant for coordinating the cognitive processes underlying OLB model execution, is associated with metacognitive cyber situational awareness and imposing lower communication demands on the team. Based on the assumption that individuals working in high-stress-, high-cognitive load-environments will choose neuroergonomic cognitive strategies to reach task goals, the present findings suggest that the OLB model is neuroergonomic in such environments. Individuals with higher vagal tone had more neutral moods which could be necessary for allocating more attentional resources to analytical processing. Furthermore, individuals with higher CSA had higher metacognitive accuracy compared to individuals with lower CSA supporting previous studies suggesting that metacognitive accuracy is necessary for achieving situational awareness. The present study highlights the potential of using neurophysiological measurements as performance indicators. Future studies are needed to explicitly address the effect of using the OLB model as basis for a metacognitive intervention to improve communication and team performance, as well as replicating the findings of the present study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Situational Awareness model with suggested requirements for achieving Cyber Situational Awareness.
