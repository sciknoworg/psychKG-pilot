			<abstract>
				<p>Recent perceptual experiences can impact the processing of a new stimulus. In visual perception, evidence has shown that the reported perception can be biased away from the prior stimulus even when the stimulus is completely irrelevant to the task at hand. Prevailing theories suggest that this repulsive serial bias is driven by low-level visual processes (i.e., adaptation), directly impacting the perception of the stimulus itself. The present study tested this hypothesis by investigating the speed of response in a continuous motion direction estimation task commonly used in serial bias studies. If the repulsive serial bias reflects the changes in the representation itself driven by the low-level adaptation mechanism, then the response time (RT) for direction reports should be independent of prior motion direction. However, results showed a systematic modulation of RT by prior motion direction, with RT being faster for larger direction differences. Follow-up experiments replicated this finding and further demonstrated that the RT effect occurred only when the repulsive serial bias was present, indicating that the repulsive serial bias and the RT effect are the products of the same underlying processes. These results provide converging evidence that prior stimulus not only biases but also impacts the speed of decision for a new stimulus, demonstrating that the low-level adaptation mechanism alone is not sufficient to account for the repulsive serial bias. We argue that theories in serial bias should incorporate decision-making mechanisms that modulate the speed of response in relation to the biases in the reports.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Our perceptual experience is shaped not only by the perception of an object currently in view but also by the memory of recent perceptual experiences. For example, finding well-ripened red tomatoes can be influenced both by the color of the tomatoes that one is currently looking at and by the memory of the tomatoes that the person saw a moment ago. In laboratory experiments, research have consistently found that the reported perception of a new stimulus is systematically biased by the prior stimulus even when the prior stimulus is completely irrelevant to the task at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fischer &amp; Whitney, 2014)</ref>. This serial bias occurs in the processing of various visual features <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kiyonaga et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pascucci et al., 2023)</ref> and studies proposed that the serial bias is a general phenomenon that reflects a fundamental goal of visual information processing: the visual system should stabilize perceptual experiences over time in the face of perceptual uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cicchini et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fischer &amp; Whitney, 2014</ref>). The visual system may achieve this goal by relating new visual inputs with the information obtained in the recent past.</p><p>One key aspect of this serial bias is that the direction of the bias can be either attractive <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ceylan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cicchini et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fornaciai &amp; Park, 2018)</ref> or repulsive <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Bliss et al., 2017)</ref>. The exact cause of the opposing directions of serial bias is still under active investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Pascucci et al., 2023)</ref>. Studies have found that the bias direction is dependent on multiple factors, including the delay between the stimulus encoding and the report <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Bliss et al., 2017)</ref>, the task-relevance of the prior stimulus , and the way the stimulus was maintained in working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chen &amp; Bae, 2024)</ref>. It has also been shown that both directions of serial bias coexist within the same task: the reports are biased toward the prior response but away from the prior stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sadil et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sheehan &amp; Serences, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>To account for the complex nature of the serial bias, studies proposed a framework that includes two computational principles that may underlie attractive and repulsive components of the serial bias effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fritsche et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fritsche et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moon &amp; Kwon, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pascucci et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>According to the framework, the visual system recruits an adaptation mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gibson &amp; Radner, 1937)</ref> during the encoding of the new stimulus, producing repulsive bias away from the prior stimulus, and it recruits a mechanism for decision making during the post-perceptual stage of the processing (e.g., Bayesian decoding), producing attractive bias toward the prior stimulus.</p><p>The framework assumes that the bias in the reports reflects the combined results from the two processes. For example, a stronger weight on the adaptation mechanism should lead to an overall repulsive serial bias. Indeed, the overall pattern of repulsive serial bias resembled the pattern of perceptual after-effects driven by adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Clifford et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we tested predictions derived from the "two process" model, focusing on the repulsive serial bias. If the repulsive serial bias is mostly driven by low-level adaptation mechanism, which should directly bias the representation itself (e.g., Tilt aftereffect), then the response time (RT) for the new stimulus should be unaffected by the prior stimulus. However, the adaptation mechanism may expedite the decision process by increasing sensitivity. In such case, the response time should be faster for the trials with small direction differences. Alternatively, it is possible that the repulsive serial bias is driven by higher-level decision processes. If the decision is made by avoiding the prior stimulus while achieving precise reports, then the response time should be faster for the trials with large stimulus differences because the decision should be easier when the direction difference is large <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chen &amp; Bae, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>To test these predictions, we used a continuous motion direction estimation task with random-dot-kinematograms (RDKs) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref>). To accurately measure the response time, the report period started with only a fixation dot and a probe line appeared as soon as participants moved the mouse for a report. Note that this was not the case in many previous studies: the report started with a randomly oriented response probe and participants adjusted the probe using a button-press (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fisher &amp; Whitney, 2014)</ref>, which should have impacted the response time measure.</p><p>Figure 1. (a) Motion direction estimation with random-dot-kinematograms. After 1000 ms of RDK (100% coherence), only a white fixation dot on the black disk remained on the screen, indicating that participants should report the motion direction. As soon as participants moved the mouse, a response probe (a white line started from the central dot and aligned with the current mouse pointer) appeared, and participants adjusted the response probe to report the perceived motion direction. Response time was measured by the time difference between the onset of the response screen and the mouse click. (b) Mean bias as a function of absolute direction differences between the current and prior trial. Positive errors indicate repulsive serial bias. The inset bar graph represents the average bias for small (0°&lt;Δ&lt;90°) and large (90°&lt;Δ&lt;180°) direction differences. (c) Mean response time as a function of absolute direction difference between the current and prior trial. The inset bar graph represents the average response time for small and large direction differences. Error bars indicate ±1 S.E.</p><p>In three experiments, we found that the direction reports exhibited repulsive serial biases and that the response time was faster when the current motion direction was more dissimilar to the prior motion direction. This RT effect was observed only when the repulsive serial bias was present, indicating that the bias and the response time effects were driven by the same mechanisms. These results suggest that adaptation mechanism alone is not sufficient, and a higher-level decision mechanism is necessary to fully account for the repulsive serial bias, placing significant constraint on the current theories in serial bias.</p></div>

A priori power analysis indicated that at least 10 participants would be necessary to detect such an effect with the power of 0.8. Because the present study used a different task paradigm and the task may lead to a smaller effect size, we recruited a total of 20 college students (17 female). Participants provided informed consent. The study was approved by the Arizona State University Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Stimuli &amp; Tasks</head><p>Stimuli were generated in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) using Psychtoolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brainard, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pelli, 1997)</ref> and were presented at 60Hz on an LCD monitor (Dell U2412M) with a white background (87.6 cd/m 2 ) at a viewing distance of 70 cm. A white fixation dot (87.6 cd/m 2 ) was continuously visible on a black disk (5° diameter, &lt; .1 cd/m 2 ) at the center of the screen except during the intertrial interval (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref>).</p><p>We used a standard RDK algorithm to generate the motion stimulus <ref type="bibr">(Roitman &amp; Shadlen, 2002)</ref>. Motion coherence was set to 100% because lower coherence RDK can exhibit opposite direction motion perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2022)</ref>. Each trial began with the fixation dot for 500 ms on the black disk. The RDK was then presented for 1000 ms (60 frames). The direction of motion on a given trial was one of 16 discrete values (from 11.25° to 348.75°, in steps of 22.5°).</p><p>Cardinal directions were excluded to prevent potential noise created by systematic interaction between the serial bias and the cardinal bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bae, 2024)</ref>. At the end of the RDK, a mouse cursor appeared at the center of the disk (without a response probe). As soon as participants moved the mouse cursor, a white line connecting the center of the disk and a point on a circumference of the disk appeared. The orientation of the white line was continuously updated depending on the orientation created by the cursor and the center of the screen, allowing observers to adjust the orientation of the white line to the perceived motion direction. The observer finalized the direction report by clicking a mouse button. Note that many prior studies in serial bias presented a probe in random value at the start of the report <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bergen &amp; Jehee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ceylan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cicchini et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fischer &amp; Whitney, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fritsche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hajonides et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Manassi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pascucci et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Samaha et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Teng et al., 2022)</ref>. Such method is not ideal to investigate response time because response time can be impacted by the randomly presented probe. In the present study, the probe line appeared only after participants moved the mouse for a report.</p><p>After 16 practice trials, each participant completed 240 experimental trials, with exactly 15 trials for each of the 16 directions of motion. Participants took a short break after each block of 48 trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Data Analysis</head><p>For each trial, we computed the direction difference between a given trial and its preceding trial. The first trial in each block was necessarily excluded (total of 5 trials per participant).</p><p>Because we used 16 discrete motion directions, there were 16 discrete direction differences. To increase signal-to-noise ratio in bias estimation, we used 9 absolute direction differences (0°, 22.5°, 45.0°, 67.5°, 90.0°, 112.5°, 135.0°, 157.5°, 180.0°) for analyses.</p><p>Response error and response time were our main dependent variables. Response errors were computed for a given trial by taking the difference between the reported direction and the true motion direction for the current trial. The grand average of response errors was subtracted for each participant to compensate for the general bias in the reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Samaha et al., 2019)</ref>. We assigned positive sign to the response errors if the direction report was biased away from the previous-trial direction, and vice versa. The signed response errors were then averaged separately for each of the 9 absolute direction differences. Serial bias exhibit greater biases for small stimulus differences than for large stimulus differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fischer &amp; Whitney, 2014)</ref>. We therefore assessed the presence of a serial bias by averaging the signed response error for the small direction difference trials (i.e., 22.5°, 45.0°, and 67.5°) and comparing this to the average of the signed response error for the large direction difference trials (i.e., 112.5°, 135.0°, and 157.5°) using a two-tailed paired t test. Trials with 0° and 180° differences were excluded from the statistical comparisons because the direction of the bias (i.e., attraction versus repulsion) is undefined for them. And the trials with 90° difference was excluded to balance the number of data points for small and large direction differences.</p><p>To confirm that our analysis accurately reflects the direction of serial bias, we conducted a simulation where we simultaneously presented a sign for prior motion direction (red dot) and a sign for current motion direction (white dot) on the perimeter of the black aperture during the response period. We intentionally generated repulsive serial bias by clicking on the opposite side of the red dot (i.e., the previous) from the white dot (i.e., the current). This was repeated for 240 trials. Our analyses from this simulation showed repulsive bias as intended, confirming that our analyses accurately reflect the direction of serial bias.</p><p>The response time was measured by the time difference between the onset of the response screen and the mouse click. The effect of the prior motion direction on the response time for the current motion direction was assessed by comparing the average response time for small direction difference trials (i.e., 22.5°, 45.0°, and 67.5°) and large direction difference (i.e., 112.5°, 135.0°, and 157.5°) trials using a two-tailed paired t test. This was to match the statistical comparison with for the serial bias analysis (i.e., the bias for small direction differences versus the bias for large direction differences). We conducted additional analyses where we used all the direction differences in statistical test for the response time (Supplementary material). The results from these analyses were consistent with the results reported in the main text. Because the mean may not accurately reflect the central tendency of response time, we conducted additional response time analysis using median response time and found the consistent results (Supplementary material).</p><p>In all analyses, we excluded trials on which the current-trial response error was larger than 60° (0.54% of the total trials), which were likely to reflect lapses of attention. We also excluded trials with response time faster than 300 ms and slower than 5 second (.25% of the total trials) as they can bias the mean estimation. These trial-exclusion criteria were set following our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chen &amp; Bae, 2024)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Direction reports exhibited a repulsive serial bias (i.e., positive error) for the trials with small direction differences <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>. We tested this effect by comparing the average response errors for small (0°&lt;Δ&lt;90°) versus large direction differences (0°&lt;Δ&lt;90°). Paired t test confirmed that the effect was significant (M = 3.60º, t(19) = 5.49, p &lt; .001, 95% CI = [2.23º, 4.97º], Cohen's d = 1.23).</p><p>The reports were faster for large direction differences <ref type="figure">(Figure 1c</ref>). This effect was tested by comparing the average response time for small (0°&lt;Δ&lt;90°) versus large (90°&lt;Δ&lt;180°) direction differences. A paired t test confirmed that the response time difference was significant (M = 113 ms, t(19) = 8.12, p &lt; .001, 95% CI = [84 ms, 142 ms], Cohen's d = 1.82). In a follow-up analysis, we confirmed that this RT effect was not a mere consequence of speed-precision tradeoff (Supplementary material).</p><p>The RT effect might be driven by the discrete stimulus sampling (i.e., 16 discrete directions) or the evidence accumulation process for the RDK task. However, we found the same RT effect even when the stimulus was randomly sampled from the 360° space and when the task did not require evidence accumulation processes (Supplementary material; see also, Chen &amp; Bae, 2024).</p><p>Together, these results demonstrate that the prior stimulus modulates the speed of decision for the new stimulus, consistent with the hypothesis that the higher-level decision processes underlie the repulsive serial bias but inconsistent with the hypothesis that the repulsive serial bias is purely driven by the representational biases. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. (a) A dual-feature motion task with a precue. At the start of each trial, a fixation dot on the black disk was shown for 500 ms (not shown in the <ref type="figure">figure)</ref> and then a precue-either D or Cwas presented (equal probability for each), indicating which feature should be reported on a given trial. RDK was then displayed either with pink or green dots. For direction reports, the response cue was presented on the screen until mouse movement (as in Experiment 1). As soon as participants moved the mouse, a response probe appeared, and they adjusted the orientation of the response probe for reporting. For color reports, a pink and a green circle were presented on each side of the black disk (the side was counter balanced) and participants pressed either left or right arrow key (2AFC) on the keyboard to report the color of the dots in the RDK. (b) Serial bias following direction report (black) and color report (red). Positive error indicates repulsion from the prior motion direction. The inset represents the mean of bias for small (0°&lt;Δ &lt;90°) and large (90°&lt;Δ &lt;180°) direction differences for prior motion report (grays) and for prior color report (reds). (c) Mean response time for direction reports after previous direction report (black) and previous color report (red). The inset represents the mean of response time for small (0°&lt;Δ &lt;90°) and large (90°&lt;Δ &lt;180°) direction differences for prior motion report (grays) and for prior color report (reds). Error bars indicate ±1 S.E. The RT effect observed in Experiment 1 might have been driven by the process independent of the serial bias. To rule out this possibility, Experiment 2 used a dual-feature version of the motion task where participants reported the color instead of the direction of the dots in random half of the trials <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a</ref>). The to-be reported feature was indicated via a 100% valid pre-cue.</p><p>In a post-cue version of this task (i.e., the to-be reported feature was determined after the stimulus presentation, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>), it was found that otherwise significant repulsive serial bias for the direction estimation was either eliminated or significantly reduced when the color was reported in the previous trial even when the direction was encoded into working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2020)</ref>. Because the encoding of direction information was not necessary in the pre-cue task, we predicted that serial bias would occur only after prior direction reports. More importantly, if the RT effect is not independent of the serial bias, then the RT effect should occur only after prior color reports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Participants</head><p>A previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2020</ref>) used a post-cue design reported large effect sizes (Cohen's d &gt; 0.9). A priori power analysis indicated that at least 12 subjects are necessary to detect such an effect with the power of 0.8. The present experiment recruited a total of 24 college students between the ages of 18 and 30 (12 female). All participants gave informed consent. The study was approved by the Arizona State University IRB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli, Tasks, &amp; Analysis</head><p>The RDK was presented with either green <ref type="bibr">(RGB = [68,</ref><ref type="bibr">190,</ref><ref type="bibr">170]</ref>) or pink <ref type="bibr">(RGB = [236,</ref><ref type="bibr">143,</ref><ref type="bibr">173]</ref>) dots. Each trial started with a presentation of the central fixation dot on a black disk (500 ms). A 100% valid precue (letter "D" for direction or "C" for color; 87.6 cd/m2; 0.8° x 1.0°</p><p>for width x height) was then provided at the center of the disk for 500 ms. The precue randomly indicated the to-be-reported feature across the trials. At the end of the RDK, participants reported either the direction of the dots or the color of the dots according to the precue. The letter cue was presented on the black disk to remind the participants which feature should be reported. The method for the direction report was identical to Experiment 1. For the color report, two colored circles-red and green (diameter 1.5°)-were presented on 4° to the left and to the right of the fixation dot. Participants pressed either the left or right arrow key on a computer keyboard to report which of the two colors was identical to the color of the dots. The correct color was equally likely to appear on the left and right sides. We used this simple 2AFC color task to avoid any possible interference from the color task to the motion task. The next trial began after 1000ms intertrial interval during which only the black disk was visible. As in Experiment 1, a discrete set of 16 motion directions was tested. Participants performed a total 448 trials (244 trials for color report and 244 trials for direction reports) after completing 16 practice trials.</p><p>Analysis focused on the presence of serial bias in the direction reports separately for the trials after color reports and direction reports. The general procedure for quantifying serial bias was identical to Experiment 1. A statistical test comparing the serial bias between the two types of previous trial was conducted using a 2 (small versus large direction differences) x 2 (prior direction reports versus prior color reports) within-subject ANOVA.</p><p>The general procedure for quantifying the RT effect was identical to Experiment 1. However, the response time was analyzed separately for the trials preceded by color reports and for the trials preceded by direction reports. As in the serial bias analysis, a 2 x 2 within-subject ANOVA was conducted to test statistical significance of the RT effect.</p><p>We applied the trial exclusion criteria used in Experiment 1. We excluded trials on which the current-trial response error was larger than 60° (2.36% of the total direction-report trials) and trials with response time faster than 300 ms and slower than 5 seconds (1.55% of the total direction-report trials) as they can bias the mean estimation.</p></div>

The two-way interaction was significant (F(1, 23) = 15.76, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .41). Planned pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction confirmed a significant response time effect following direction reports (M = 147 ms, t(23) = 4.95, p &lt; .001, 95% CI = [85 ms, 209 ms], Cohen's d = 1.01, paired t test) but not following color reports (M = -1 ms, t(23) = -.04, p = .97, 95% CI = [-62 ms, 60 ms], paired t test). In a supplementary analysis, we confirmed that the RT effect following direction reports was not merely driven by speedprecision trade off (Supplementary material).</p><p>These results clearly show that the RT effect occurred only when the repulsive serial bias was present. Therefore, these results provide evidence that the response time effect and the repulsive serial bias are the products of the same underlying mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response time analysis for Bae &amp; Luck (2020)</head><p>Bae&amp; Luck (2020) conducted post-cue versions of the motion-color task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3a)</ref> and found that the repulsive serial bias for direction reports was eliminated or significantly reduced following color reports as in Experiment 2. Here, we investigated whether the RT effect in the study occurred only when the repulsive serial bias effect was present.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants, Stimuli, Tasks, &amp; Analysis</head><p>Bae &amp; Luck (2020) recruited a total of 72 college students between the ages of 18 and 30 (46 female, 26 male). The procedure of the color-motion tasks used in the study was similar to those used in Experiment 2 of the present study. The main difference was that a post-cue was used to indicate which feature should be reported at the end of the RDK <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bae &amp; Luck (2020)</ref> used three versions of post-cue motion-color experiments (N = 24 for each). The difference among the three experiments were on the color sampling (within-category versus between categories) and the method for the color report (AFC versus Estimation). However, the motion direction task was identical among all three experiments.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bae &amp; Luck (2020)</ref>. The to-be-reported feature for a given trial was indicated by a post-cue (letter D or C) presented at the end of the motion stimulus. The study used three different versions of this task. (b) Serial bias collapsed across the data from the three experiments of Bae &amp; Luck (2020) (N = 72) for prior direction report (black) and for prior color report (red). Positive errors indicate repulsion from the prior motion direction. The inset represents the average bias for small direction differences (0°&lt;Δ &lt;90°) separately for previous direction reports (gray) and previous color reports (red). Bae &amp; Luck (2020) reports serial bias analysis for each of the three experiments separately. Here, we show the results collapsed across the three experiments. (c) Mean response time as a function of direction difference following direction reports (black) and following color reports (red), collapsed across the three data sets. The inset represents the mean response time for small (darker) and large (lighter) direction differences after direction reports (black) and after color reports (red). Error bars indicate ±1 S.E.</p><p>The present study focused on the aggregated data from the three experiments. This increased the signal-to-noise ratio by 73% compared to Experiment 2 of the present study (because the sample size was three times larger than the sample size in Experiment 2). Our main goal was investigating the response time effect for direction reports (which has not been reported previously) in the study as a function of the feature reported in the previous trial. As in Experiments 1 and 2 of the present study, we excluded trials with response error larger than 60°</p><p>(1.36% of the total direction-report trials), and trials with response time faster than 300 ms and slower than 5 second (.71% of the total direction-report trials). The results of response time analysis for each individual experiment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bae &amp; Luck (2020)</ref> are reported in the supplementary material.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The repulsive serial bias was evident after prior direction reports, but not after prior color reports <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3b)</ref>. Similarly, the RT effect was more evident after direction reports <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3c</ref>).</p><p>These effects were tested using the 2x2 ANOVAs as in Experiment 2.</p><p>For the repulsive serial bias, the main effect of direction difference was significant (F(1, 71) = 42.14, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .37), and the main effect of the previous-trial type was also significant (F(1, 71) = 38.7, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .35). The two-way interaction was significant (F(1, 71) = 23.42, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .25). Planned comparisons with Bonferroni correction confirmed a significant repulsive serial bias following direction reports (M = 2.88°, t(71) = 8.23, p &lt; .001, 95% CI = [2.18°, 3.58°], Cohen's d = .97). Direction reports following color reports exhibited a hint of serial bias, mostly driven by the attractive bias for large direction differences <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3b</ref>).</p><p>However, this was not significant after the Bonferroni correction (M = .78°, t(71) = 2.17, p = .034 (&gt; .025), 95% CI = [-.062°, 1.58°]).</p><p>For the RT effect, the main effect of direction difference was significant (F(1, 71) = 38.33, p &lt; .001, ηp 2 = .35), and the main effect of the previous-trial type was also significant (F(1, 71) = 10.9, p = .002, ηp 2 = .13). The two-way interaction was significant (F(1, 71) = 25. . We confirmed that the RT effect following direction reports was not merely driven by speed-precision tradeoff (Supplementary material).</p><p>In a post-hoc analysis, we tested whether the RT effect was driven by expedited decisions for large direction differences or delayed decisions for small direction differences by comparing the response time between the types of preceding trials separately for small and large direction differences with Bonferoni corrections. For large direction differences, response time following direction reports was significantly faster than response time following color reports (t(71) = -6.12, p &lt; .001, 95% CI = [-145 ms, -74 ms], Cohen's d = -.72). However, for small direction differences, the response time was comparable between the two types of preceding trials (t(71) = .268, p = .79, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-35 ms, 47 ms]</ref>). This result suggests that, at least in the context of this experiment, the response time effect was mainly driven by expedited decision for large direction differences (see Supplementary material for corresponding analysis for Experiment 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Reported perception of a new stimulus is systematically biased by task-irrelevant prior stimulus.</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms for this serial bias have been a central issue in visual cognition because the bias may reflect how the visual system achieves perpetual stability over time under uncertainty while maintaining efficiency in visual information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cicchini et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kiyonaga et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pascucci et al., 2023)</ref>. And yet, serial bias is a complex phenomenon that exhibits large variabilities across different task contexts , groups of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bansal et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Stein et al., 2020)</ref>, and depending on how the bias is assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sadil et al., 2023)</ref>. Despite the complexity of the phenomenon, however, serial bias has been predominantly studied by measuring biases in the reports, neglecting other relevant aspects of perceptual behavior. In particular, despite the fact that the current models assume that postperceptual decision process is a key component of the phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fritsche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moon &amp; Kwon, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pascucci et al., 2019)</ref>, the speed of response, which has been studied as a key variable in perceptual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hanks &amp; Summerfield, 2017)</ref>, has not been systematically investigated in the studies of serial bias.</p><p>Across three experiments, the present study found that prior stimulus not only biases but also systematically modulates the speed of response for a new stimulus. Reports were faster when the current stimulus was more dissimilar to the prior stimulus and this RT effect was dependent on the presence of the repulsive serial bias. Current computational models of serial bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fritsche et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moon &amp; Kwon, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pascucci et al., 2019)</ref> are unable to account for this finding because the models assume that the repulsive serial bias is driven by low-level visual processes (i.e., adaptation), which should impact the perceptual representation itself rather than the decision for the new stimulus. Even if we assume that the adaptation increases sensitivity under the context of serial bias, it would be difficult to explain how the increased sensitivity that enables better detection of small stimulus differences can lead to faster decision mostly for large stimulus differences. Although our findings do not necessarily rule out the hypothesis that adaptation contributes to repulsive serial bias effect, they clearly show that adaptation alone is not sufficient to explain the repulsive serial bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chen &amp; Bae, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>To account for the present results, we suggest that the current models should incorporate mechanisms that can modulate the speed of decision for a new stimulus in relation to the prior stimulus. One possible mechanism would be a choice response selection mechanism for a continuous response scale proposed in the context of perceptual decision making. Traditional choice response selection mechanism was developed in a simpler scenario where a perceptual decision is made between a small set of discrete alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">E. E. Smith, 1968)</ref>. Recent studies, however, have shown that similar mechanism can be applied to cases where a decision is made on a continuous response scale, such as the typical estimation paradigm used in many serial dependence studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kvam et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">P. L. Smith, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>According to this model, choice response time is dependent on the number of response alternatives and the similarity among them, with response time being slower when alternative responses are more similar to the target response. If we assume that the serial bias is driven by response selection process that takes the prior stimulus into account, then it makes sense that the response selection should be easier (i.e., faster RT) when the prior stimulus is more dissimilar to the current stimulus because one has to avoid selecting the prior stimulus to accurately report the newly perceived stimulus. Likewise, if the response selection process does not take the prior stimulus into account (i.e., no serial bias), then RT should be independent of the prior stimulus,</p><p>as observed in the present study.</p><p>Because the present study focused on repulsive serial bias, it is unclear whether the same conclusion can be held when the reports exhibit attractive serial bias. As we pointed out earlier, response time has been neglected in the studies of serial bias and it is generally unknown how response time may vary with attractive serial bias. One study, however, has shown that reports</p><p>were faster when the current stimulus was identical to the prior stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cicchini et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Although more evidence is necessary to firmly conclude that attractive serial bias exhibits RT effect that is opposite of the RT effect for the repulsive serial bias (due to the suboptimal task procedure used in previous studies on attractive serial biases), it is possible that the decisionrelated process recruited in attractive serial bias may be different from the decision process for repulsive serial bias. Investigating this possibility would be an important direction for future research to better understand how the visual system integrates past experiences into the decision for a new stimulus.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>(a) The post-cue motion-color paradigm used in Experiment 1 of</figDesc></figure>
