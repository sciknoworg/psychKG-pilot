			<abstract>
				<p>Across three studies and three different samples, we investigated whether decision-making styles exhibit incremental validity in predicting various real-life outcomes over and above cognitive abilities and personality traits. In Study 1, we showed that decision-making styles (especially avoidant and spontaneous one), but not cognitive abilities, predict important real-life and academic outcomes in a sample of undergraduate students. In Study 2, on a sample of employed adults, we showed that although the effects of decision-making styles were diminished once the effects of personality traits were taken into account, styles nevertheless remained important for several important work-related outcomes. Finally, in Study 3, on a sample of entrepreneurs, decision-making styles generally exhibited stronger correlations with indices of entrepreneurial success and employee work-related attitudes than the need for achievement, a motivational trait that was meta-analytically shown to be one of the most important traits for the entrepreneurial success. In sum, we believe that our research program fills the gap in research of decision-making in organizational behavior domain, offering convincing evidence that decision-making styles matter for various important work-related outcomes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Decision-making styles have been defined as the learned, habitual response patterns exhibited by an individual when confronted with decision situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Scott and Bruce, 1995)</ref>. More recently, Tunholm <ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref> broadened the definition to include the aspects of individual differences among decision-makers.</p><p>According to him, in addition to task and decision-making situation, habitual patterns of responses are influenced by individual differences in basic cognitive abilities, self-evaluation and self-regulation. A number of studies supported this expansion by showing that decision-making styles are substantially correlated with cognitive abilities and personality traits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dewberry, Juanchich &amp; Narendran, 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gambetti &amp; Giusberti, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Juanchich, Dewberry, Sirota &amp; Narendran, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ülgen, Sağlam, &amp; Tuğsal, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ward, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wood, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wood &amp; Highhouse, 2014)</ref>. However, this has raised the questions about the constructs overlap and practical validity of assessing decision making styles. In response to the recent calls (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dalal &amp; Brooks, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dalal, Bonaccio, Highhouse, Ilgen, Mohammed &amp; Slaughter, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Moore &amp; Flynn, 2008)</ref>, this paper reports results of a research program that investigated whether decision-making styles exhibit incremental validity in predicting various real-life outcomes over and above cognitive abilities and personality traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Decision making styles: definition and measurement</head><p>One of the open questions in the decision-making styles realm is the dimensionality and the number of styles that can adequately capture various ways in which people approach the decision-making process.</p><p>The propositions range from two styles (e.g., rational decision style and intuitive decision style; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hamilton, Shih and Mohammed, 2016)</ref> to seven styles <ref type="bibr">(e.g., vigilant, intuitive, spontaneous, dependent, anxious,</ref> brooding, and avoidant decision-making style; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Leykin and DeRubeis, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Thunholm (2004)</ref> noticed that the rational (or vigilant in different models) and intuitive decision-making style have a high resemblance with the analytic and intuitive dimensions of more general cognitive styles <ref type="bibr">(Kozhenikov, 2007)</ref> and are therefore not problematic from the theoretical point of view. However, the other decisionmaking styles such as dependent or avoidant style cannot be classified along the analytic-intuitive dimension defined by information gathering and evaluation. Stated differently, individuals' approaches to decision-making cannot be evaluated only in terms of the amount of information they gather and the way they evaluate those information (i.e,. whether they are looking for as much information as possible prior to making decisions in the case of rational, or whether they are relying on hunches and feeling when making decisions as in the case of intuitive decision-making style), but the conceptual framework needs to be expanded in order to accommodate for other identified styles.</p><p>One such attempt was made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dewberry, Juanchich and Narendran (2013b)</ref> who distinguished between the differences in cognitive processes that people use to make decisions (captured by rational/vigilant and intuitive styles) and regulatory processes concerned with choice regulation (captured by avoidant, dependent, or anxious style). More specifically, they related the three styles concerned with cognitive processes in decision making (rational/vigilant, intuitive and spontaneous) with well-known dual-process theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kahneman, 2011)</ref> that differentiates between System 1 <ref type="bibr">(intuitive, automatic, associative, fast)</ref> and System 2 (analytic, explicit, rule-based, relatively slow). Consistent with the distinction between the two systems, intuitive style and spontaneous style seemed to indicate the extent to which individuals rely on heuristic/System 1 processing, while rational/vigilant style pertains to deliberate/System 2 processing.</p><p>The remaining styles are not related with the two systems of information processing but more with the regulation of choice, i.e. with the extent to which decisions tend to be delayed or avoided (avoidant style), referred on to others (dependent style) or are followed by negative affect (anxious style). The main insight here is that the feeling of anxiety over making decisions underpins the regulatory styles in several ways.</p><p>For example, in addition to experiencing recurrent unpleasant emotional state while reaching decisions (anxious style), people anxious about making decisions are more likely to avoid making decisions completely (avoidant style), or, if deciding still needs to be done, refer them to other people (dependent decision-making style).</p><p>The most used and widely cited model of decision-making styles seems to be the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Scott and Bruce (1995)</ref>. Their model is broad enough to encompass both styles related with cognitive processes and those related with regulation processes. Initially, based on the prior theorizing and empirical research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Scott and Bruce (1995)</ref> proposed four different decision-making styles and defined them in behavioral terms. Specifically, they proposed that the domain of decision-making styles can be successfully described by four styles: rational (a tendency towards thorough search for and logical evaluations of alternatives); intuitive (an inclination to rely on hunches and feelings), dependent style (a propensity to search for advice and direction from others) and avoidant (a proclivity to avoid decision making). They tested their assumptions across four different samples, confirmed the existence of the four styles but also uncovered the existence of an additional style related to the amount of time devoted to decision making, the spontaneous decision-making style. The spontaneous style is characterized by the sense of immediacy and a desire to get through the decision-making process as soon as possible. They also showed that, based on correlations among these styles, the decision-making styles were not mutually exclusive and that individuals do not rely on a single style, but are able to rely on different ones. The factorial structure of</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Predictive validity of decision-making styles</head><p>Decision-making styles were shown to be related to a broad range of real life outcomes. For example, Bruine de <ref type="bibr">Bruin, Parker &amp; Fischoff (2007)</ref> showed that decision-making styles predicted the Decision Outcome Inventory (DOI) score, a self-reported measure of decision making success in various domains of life, both positively (r = .21 and r = .16, for rational and intuitive style) and negatively ( r = -.29 and r = -.33, for avoidant and spontaneous styles). DOI is a measure of negative events an individual experienced, ranging from mild ones (e.g. "Threw out food or groceries you had bought, because they went bad") to those more serious (e.g. "Been in a jail cell overnight for any reason"), with higher score indicating that the person experienced less such outcomes. This means that those relying more on rational 6 and intuitive decision-making style experienced lower number of negative outcomes that followed their decisions, while those that relied more on spontaneous style or avoided making their decisions experienced more negative outcomes following their decision.</p><p>Decision-making styles were shown to be important predictors of indicators of decision-making quality and experience. Wood (2012) correlated individual differences in decision-making styles with peer reports of decision making quality. In her study, the rational style was positively correlated with peer ratings of general decision-making quality but also with a reputation of reasonable decision maker (r = .28 and r = .21 respectively), while the spontaneous style was negatively correlated with those outcomes (r = -.18 and r = -.23, respectively). The avoidant style was also negatively correlated with peer-rated reasonable decision-making (r = -.20). Recent meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Phillips, Fletcher, Marks and Hine (2016)</ref> that focused only on the rational and intuitive styles showed that the rational/analytical style positively predicted both decision performance (normatively correct responding) and decision experience (speed and enjoyment) whereas intuitive style was negatively related to performance but positively with experience. However, absolute size of the meta-analytically estimated correlations were relatively small (between .06 and .14).</p><p>Decision-making styles were shown to be important for educational/vocational behavior among adolescents. Among adolescents, rational style was positively correlated with higher school achievement (r = .11) while spontaneous (r = .15) and avoidant (r = .13) styles were positively related with the number of absences from school <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baiocco, Laghi, &amp; D'Alessio, 2009)</ref>. Decision-making styles also reflected in using planning strategies and organizing information when choosing a college major. Specifically, rational style was shown to be positively correlated with frequency of planning among students (r = .49), while avoidant (r = -.35) and spontaneous (r = -.27) styles were negatively correlated with the same type of behavior. The relationship of intuitive and dependent styles with the criterion were non-significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Galotti, Ciner, Altenbaumer, Geerts, Rupp, &amp; Woulfe, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>When it comes to work related outcomes such as job performance or work-related well-being as indicated by job attitudes, empirical evidence seems to be sparse. A recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alaybek, Wang, Dalal, Dubrow, &amp; Boemerman, 2021a)</ref> examined how rational and intuitive style are related with task performance and found significant positive correlation between rational style and task performance (r = .22), but essentially non-existent relationship for intuitive style. Apart from this, there seem to be only few studies that explored the relationship of all the five decision making styles concurrently with workrelated outcomes. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Russ, McNeilly and Comer (1996)</ref> correlated the decision-making styles of sales managers with overall performance ratings (calculated by averaging the manager's self-reports of global managerial effectiveness with supervisor's and subordinates ratings of the same construct) and behavioral performance ratings (operationalized as supervisor's ratings of nine behaviors affecting the sale force). When controlling for type of business, number of subordinates, overall managerial experience, and experience on the job, rational, avoidant, and spontaneous styles predicted overall performance ratings while behavioral performance ratings was predicted only with the avoidant style. Consistent with expectations, only the rational style correlated positively with the criteria with avoidant and spontaneous styles showing a negative correlation with the criterion. Intuitive and dependent styles were shown to be independent from the managerial performance criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Thunholm (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Thunholm ( , 2009</ref> explored validity of the five decision styles in the military context. The results showed that when it comes to making decisions, military team leaders described themselves as more spontaneous but less rational, dependent or avoidant than their team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Thunholm, 2009)</ref>. In another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Thunholm, 2008)</ref>, the same author related the decision-making styles with negative stress experienced by leaders when making demanding decisions. Out of the five styles, only individual differences in avoidant style were (positively) correlated with negative stress as indicated with saliva cortisol levels.</p><p>Other studies focused on validity of some of the styles from the Scott and Bruce model in the work context. For example, two studies explored validity of the rational and intuitive style in vocational behavior domain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Singh and Greenhaus (2004)</ref> explored association between three decision-making styles (rational, intuitive, and dependent) when making career-related decisions with person-job fit among professionals who recently changed jobs. Their study showed that the use of the rational style was related to higher levels of person-job fit. No relationship was found between intuitive or dependent career-related decision-making style with the same criterion. Using a large sample of employees, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Crossley and Highhouse (2005)</ref> showed that more frequent reliance on both rational and intuitive decision-making style while making job choice reflected in higher job satisfaction and satisfaction with the job search process.</p><p>Several studies explored specific decision-making styles in the organizational leadership context. For example, using interviews on a sample of executives, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agor (1986)</ref> showed that frequency of intuitive decision making increases on higher levels of organizational hierarchy and that managers experienced excitement and harmony when making intuitive judgments. Sadler-Smith (2004) reported a significant correlation between entrepreneurs' inclination towards using intuitive decision-making style with financial and non-financial performance of small and medium sized companies. In the same study, the rational style showed non-significant relation with the criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Present research</head><p>There seems to be some evidence that decision-making styles might be substantially predictive of various real-life outcomes, especially those in organizational behavior domain. Based on our overview of the studies, stronger inclination towards rational style in most cases led to more favorable outcomes. The findings are somewhat more mixed when it comes to intuitive style that was shown to be positively, negatively or unrelated to criteria indicating contextual specificity/boundary conditions (e.g., expertise of decision maker or predictability of the decision making environment) for validity of that style. The remaining three styles from the GDMS have been less frequently researched but were shown to be mostly negatively related to the outcomes. This was especially the case for avoidant style that was shown to be consistently negatively correlated with the outcomes.</p><p>What is even less clear is how much of unique predictive validity the styles can add over and above more common predictors, such as cognitive abilities and personality traits. The research on the relationship between decision-making styles and cognitive abilities is relatively sparse. However, a recent metaanalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alaybek, Wang, Dalal, Dubrow, &amp; Boemerman, 2021b)</ref> showed that both rational and intuitive decision-making style were related to intelligence. However, the magnitude of these correlations was small (r = .14 for rational and r = -.14 for intuitive style). Similarly, it has been shown that there is very little overlap between decision-making styles and the well-known Cognitive Reflection Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Juanchich et al., 2016)</ref>. The intuitive decision-making style was the only one that was significantly related to cognitive reflection and even that correlation was low (r = -.15). Therefore, it seems that, to the extent that decision-making styles manage to explain some part of the variance in different outcomes, that variance will be largely independent from cognitive abilities. This was recently confirmed in the metaanalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alaybek et al., 2021a)</ref> for rational style that incrementally predicted task performance beyond both intelligence and conscientiousness, but the picture is much less clear for other types of styles.</p><p>Although some research found that the styles were predictive of certain outcomes beyond the effects of personality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alaybek et al., [2021a]</ref> meta-analysis, also <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wood [2012]</ref> who found that rational style uniquely predicted peer-rated decision-making quality after accounting for the effects of personality traits), it is nevertheless still a question how much of a predictive validity they can add over personality traits as some other studies shown that it was not able to add any predictive validity over personality traits for some outcomes (for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Juanchich et al. [2016]</ref> styles failed to predict DOI beyond the effects of personality traits). Furthermore, it has consistently been shown that the decision-making styles Therefore, the goal of our research program reported in this paper was to extend the findings of relevance of decision-making styles for a broad range of outcomes across three different samples (undergraduate students in Study 1, employed adults in Study 2 and entrepreneurs/leaders in Study 3) and to see whether styles can uniquely contribute to predictiveness of outcomes beyond effects of cognitive abilities (Study 1), personality (Study 2), and motivational variables (Study 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Study 1</head><p>In Study 1, we wanted to see whether decision-making styles will be able to predict decision outcomes in a sample of undergraduate students. In this study, we wanted to see if we can replicate earlier findings about the relationship of decision-making styles with negative decision outcomes (Bruine de <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bruin et al., 2007)</ref> and academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baiocco, Laghi, &amp; D'Alessio, 2009)</ref> but also expand the criterion domain with a variable that parallels counterproductive work behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Spector, Bauer &amp; Fox, 2010)</ref> in the academic domain. Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether the decision styles will remain important for decision outcomes after the effects of cognitive abilities, such as intelligence and numeracy, are taken into account.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Sample</head><p>A total of 253 undergraduate University of Zagreb students participated in this study (214 from the Faculty of humanities and social studies -mostly psychology students, 34 from other faculties and five undeclared). There were 187 females, 62 males and four participants refused to give their gender. The mean participants' age was 21.47 (SD = 1.89; Min = 18, Max = 29).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Instruments</head><p>General decision-making style. To measure decision-making styles, we used <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Scott and Bruce (1995)</ref> General Decision Making Style (GDMS) scale that assesses five different decision-making styles: rational, intuitive, avoidant, spontaneous and dependent. Each of the styles is assessed by five self-report items and the task of participants was to indicate their level of agreement with each of the statements on a five-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree). The total score was calculated by averaging responses on items for each of the five styles so that theoretical range is one to five. We report all of the items for all our instruments in the Appendix.</p><p>Fluid intelligence. We measured fluid intelligence with a 16 items version of the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR; for details see icar-project.com and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Condon and Revelle, 2014)</ref>. ICAR is a broad cognitive ability assessment tool consisting of four different types of tasks: letters and numbers series, matrix reasoning items, verbal reasoning items and three-dimensional rotation items. The validation of this measure is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Condon and Revelle (2014)</ref>. We formed the total score as an average of responses to these 16 items.</p><p>Numeracy. We used The Berlin numeracy test (BNT; Cokely, Galesic, Schulz, Ghazal, &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2012) as a measure of numeracy. The BNT is a four-question test for assessing numeracy and risk literacy. The questions are designed in a way that they gradually become harder and we calculated total score as a ratio of number of correct responses and total number of responses.</p><p>Negative decision outcomes. We measured negative decision outcomes (NDO) with the decisionoutcome inventory (DOI). DOI was developed by Bruine de <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bruin et al. (2007)</ref> as a measure of decisionmaking success in terms of avoiding negative decision outcomes. We used 33 different outcomes and our outcomes somewhat differed from the original inventory. A total score was calculated by averaging the experienced outcomes weighted by their severity 1 .</p><p>Counterproductive academic behavior. Apart from the total negative decision outcomes score, we also calculated a score for what can be deemed as a parallel to counterproductive work behavior in the academic domain. Specifically, among the 33 DOI items, there were six that were related with students' behavior related to academic obligations. We averaged the score on these six items to get the counterproductive academic behavior indicator.</p><p>Academic achievement. We measured academic achievement by asking our participant to report their average college grade.</p></div>

At the same time, decision-making styles were related to each of the three outcomes. Specifically, students relying on rational decision-making style experienced somewhat less of negative outcomes in life and college, while those that tend to avoid making decisions or to make them quickly and spontaneously experienced substantially more negative real-life and college related outcomes. Similarly, students with tendency of avoiding making decisions or making them spontaneously and based on hunches had lower college grade point average. Therefore, the conclusion of the first study is that decision-making styles are able to predict important everyday-life and academic decision outcomes even when cognitive abilities fall short.</p></div>

First, we used a sample that is more heterogeneous in its socio-demographic characteristics than the student sample is. Second, along with the decision-making styles, we also measured personality traits, enabling us to investigate the styles' incremental validity above the personality traits. Third, we captured a much wider range of potential decision outcomes. In addition to DOI, we measured peer-reported decision-making quality and important work-related outcomes -job attitudes (job and career satisfaction), and job performance (inrole performance and counterproductive work behavior).</p></div>

Specifically, 183 participants also participated in the second part of the study. There were 79 male and 103 female participants (28 unknown). The average participants' age was M = 34.31 (SD = 10.63, Min = 19, Max = 63).

The scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wood (2012)</ref> and consists of four items. Participants' peers were instructed to rate their agreement with the statements describing their colleague/friend participants on a five-point scale (1 = Completely disagree, 5 = Completely agree). Each participant was rated by up to three different peers. Therefore, before calculating final scores for these two scales, we averaged peer's ratings on the four items per scale. The final score is calculated as an average of ratings and the higher it is, the better peers perceive decision-making abilities of their colleague.</p></div>

Specifically, it was related to more negative decision-making outcomes (positive correlation with DOI), lower career-satisfaction, higher frequency of counterproductive work behavior, lower job satisfaction and lower self-reported in-role performance.</p><p>Spontaneous style was related to more negative decision-making outcomes, more negative peer perceptions of person's general decision-making quality, lower career satisfaction and greater counterproductive work behavior. Rational style was related to two of the seven outcomes: negatively with DOI and positively with peer-rated general decision-making quality, while intuitive style's only relationships with outcomes was the negative one with peer-rated decision-making quality. Dependent style was the only one that failed to show a significant relationship with any of the outcomes. Therefore, it seems that relying on the others when making decisions is irrelevant for many of the potential realworld decision outcomes.</p><p>Regarding the personality traits, emotional stability showed five significant correlations with our outcomes. It was negatively related to DOI (predicting lower number of bad outcomes), positively with job satisfaction, career satisfaction and self-reported in-role performance and negatively with counterproductive work behavior. Agreeableness and conscientiousness were related to three outcomes:</p><p>former was positively related to peer-rated decision-making quality, job and career satisfaction and selfreported in-role performance, while latter showed negative correlations with DOI and counterproductive work behavior and positive with in-role performance. Extraversion was related to two outcomes (positive relationship with career satisfaction and self-reported in-role performance), while the openness was the least relevant for our outcomes, showing a small positive relationship only with job satisfaction.</p><p>Therefore, both decision-making styles and personality traits are relevant for a number of real-life outcomes that we assessed. However, we know both from the previous literature and from our current study that decision-making styles and personality traits are mutually correlated. Most notable of these correlations are the positive one between rational style and conscientiousness and negative ones between avoidant style and conscientiousness/emotional stability. Therefore, the question is whether the decisionmaking styles can add some predictive validity over personality traits in predicting the outcomes.</p><p>To answer this question, we conducted two types of analysis. First, we conducted classical hierarchical linear regressions where we wanted to see whether decision styles show incremental validity over personality traits for our outcomes. However, this type of analysis has serious problems due to imperfect reliabilities of measures (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baron, Gürçay, &amp; Metz, 2017)</ref>, resulting in often serious Type I error inflation and unreliable conclusions about the significance and importance of predictors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Westfall &amp; Yarkoni, 2016)</ref>. To alleviate this problem and to select, among all of the possible models the most appropriate constellation of predictors for our outcomes given the data, we implemented a Bayesian Model Averaging method (BMA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hinne, Gronau, van den Bergh, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">van den Bergh et al., 2020)</ref>. The detailed description of this analysis can be found in the Supplement.</p><p>We report the results of these two analyses in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. For each of the outcomes, we report two columns.</p><p>In the first column we report Beta weights from the second step of the classical hierarchical regression analysis (in this step all of the predictors are included), indicating which of the predictors are significant for that specific outcome, as well as the R 2 and ΔR 2 . In the second column we report Bayes factors <ref type="bibr">(BFs)</ref> indicating the strengths of evidence that each of the predictors is important predictor for that specific outcome and indicate the best model from the BMA analysis together with its model BF (BFm). Bayes factor (BF) can be interpreted in the following way: BFs ranging from 1 to 3 means anecdotal or insufficient evidence for model/predictors, BFs from 3 to 10 means moderate evidence, BFs from 10 to 30 means strong evidence, BFs from 30 to 100 means very strong evidence and BFs greater than 100 means extremely strong evidence.  Looking at the significance of β coefficients and the magnitude of BFs, it appears that the BMA is somewhat more conservative than the "classical" regression. Specifically, in four instances where the β coefficients for predictors were significant, BMA indicated that there is insufficient evidence for the importance of predictor (e.g. openness and avoidant style as predictors of job satisfaction, extraversion as predictor of in-role performance and agreeableness as predictor of decision-making quality).</p><p>Conversely, there was only one instance where the β was not significant but the BF showed moderate evidence for predictor, although the strength of evidence here barely surpassed the cut-off of BF = 3 for moderate evidence (intuitive style as predictor of general decision-making quality). To reduce the chance of false positives, we will focus on the BMA analysis. Thus, it is apparent that the personality traits, at least one of them, are important predictors for five out of six outcomes (none seem to be important for the prediction of peer-rated general decision quality), whereas decision-making styles are important for only three outcomes (job satisfaction, in-role performance and peer-rated general decision quality).</p><p>Therefore, it seems that personality traits are generally more important than decision-making styles in predicting real-life outcomes and that decision-making styles only rarely contribute over traits to that prediction. They seem to be important for perceptions of peers about one's decision-making quality (very strong evidence for a positive effect of rational style) where personality traits do not have an effect, and they seem to contribute above the personality traits in predicting in-role performance (strong evidence for a negative effect of avoidant style) and job satisfaction (moderate evidence for a positive effect of intuitive style).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Study 3</head><p>In Study 3 we collected a small, but specific sample of entrepreneurs, owners and managers of small businesses. Recent reviews of research showed that individual differences in entrepreneurs' traits predict both entrepreneurs' behavior and business performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collins, Hanges, &amp; Locke, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Frese &amp; Gielnik, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pekkala Kerr, Kerr, &amp; Xu, 2017)</ref>. Considering that decision making is an essential part of every leadership position <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mintzberg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Yukl, 2013)</ref>, we believed that decision making styles should reflect in subordinate ratings of entrepreneurs' in-role performance, and, specifically, in their leadership behavior thus determining employees' job attitudes and job performance.</p><p>In our study, we assessed entrepreneurs' performance with employees' perception of efficacy of their employer in the entrepreneurial role, but also a number of variables reflecting employees' job attitudes and job performance. To be more specific, in our study employees' self-reported about perceived organizational support, job satisfaction and intention to leave the organization (job attitudes), as well as about their own in-role performance and counterproductive work behavior (the two key dimensions of job performance). In this study, we used motivational trait of need for achievement as a benchmark against which we compared the effects of decision-making styles. Several meta-analyses showed that the need for achievement is one of the key psychological characteristics that both differentiate between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Collins et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stewart &amp; Roth, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zhao &amp; Seibert, 2006)</ref> as well as between successful and non-successful entrepreneurs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collins et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rauch &amp; Frese, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Sample</head><p>A total of 53 entrepreneurs who were owners and CEOs of small businesses (up to 30 employees) participated in our study (34 males and 19 females; Mage = 47.15, SDage = 10.66, Min = 27, Max = 69).</p><p>37% of them had high school, 49% completed college while 14% obtained master's degree or PhD. On average, they started 1.74 companies (SD = 1.04; Median = 1) and have 10.68 employees (SD = 7.95).</p><p>Our entrepreneurs were also rated by a total of 154 of their employees (average 2.91 per employer). Most of the entrepreneurs were rated by three of their employees, but the number of employees that rated each entrepreneur ranged from one to seven (see Supplement for detailed description of the procedure).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Instruments</head><p>Instruments that were the same as in previous studies were GDMS (solved by entrepreneurs), in-role performance and counterproductive work behavior (both solved by employees). We describe only the new instruments here (we put in brackets who solved the questionnaire, entrepreneurs or their employees).</p><p>Need for achievement (entrepreneurs). We measured need for achievement (NfA) using the Unified motive scale (UMS) developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schönbrodt and Gerstenberg (2012)</ref>. Achievement motivation is assessed with goal related items that require importance ratings on a six-point scale (1 = not important to me; 6 = extremely important to me). The total score is calculated as an average of importance ratings on all the items.</p><p>Perceived entrepreneurial efficacy (employees). We adopted a self-report scale of entrepreneurial selfefficacy from <ref type="bibr">Slabbinck et al. (2018)</ref> by reframing the items to be appropriate for employee ratings. The efficacy of entrepreneur was measured in terms of his/her employees' confidence in the ability of entrepreneur to perform critical entrepreneurial tasks. Employees rated the entrepreneur on a seven-point scale (1 = Much worse than other entrepreneurs, 7 = Much better than fellow entrepreneurs). The total score was calculated as an average level of ratings on the nine items and the higher the score, the better the perception of entrepreneur's efficacy.</p><p>Perceived organizational support (employees). Perceived organizational support represents set of global beliefs concerning the extent to which an organization values contribution of its employees and cares about their well-being. We measured it with eight items taken from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison and Sowa (1986)</ref> scale, where participants indicated their level of agreement with the statements on a seven-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 7 = completely agree). We calculated total score as an average level of agreement on these eight items.</p><p>Job satisfaction (employees). We measured job satisfaction with five items taken from longer Index of Job Satisfaction measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brayfield &amp; Rothe, 1951)</ref>. Participants rated their level of agreement with five statements on a five-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree), and the total score</p><p>represents an average of their ratings on these five items.</p><p>Intention of leaving organization (employees). We measured this with three items assessing turnover intentions, adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Konovsky and Cropanzano, (1991)</ref>. Participants rated their level of agreement with these statements on a five-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree), and the total score was calculated as average of their ratings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Results</head><p>We report descriptive statistics and reliabilities of our Study 3 focal variables in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> and correlations among them in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>.  A specific sample such as entrepreneurs can serve as a valuable additional source for validation of decision-making styles. For example, as entrepreneurs are characterized by higher risk tolerance, proactiveness in seeking and utilizing new opportunities and higher need for autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahmetoglu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Frese &amp; Gielnik, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rauch &amp; Frese, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, we can at least expect that entrepreneurs will be less avoidant in their decision-making and less willing to rely on others when making decisions than the population of non-entrepreneurs, i.e. that they will score lower on avoidant and dependent decision-making than non-entrepreneurs. We therefore conducted five t-tests to examine the difference in the five decision-making styles between a more general population from our Study 2 and the entrepreneurs from our Study 3.</p><p>T-tests showed that there were significant differences in rational style, with the entrepreneurs scoring somewhat higher than the general population (t = 2.02, p = .04, Cohen's d = 0.31), dependent style, with the entrepreneurs scoring lower than the general population (t = 3.18, p = .002, Cohen's d = 0.48) and avoidant style, with the entrepreneurs scoring lower than the general population (t = 2.42, p = .02, Cohen's d = 0.39). There were no significant differences in intuitive and spontaneous decision-making styles.</p><p>Therefore, these results suggest that entrepreneurs do differ from general population in their decisionmaking tendencies in a sense that they are more rational, autonomous and decisive in their decisionmaking than the non-entrepreneurial population.  In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, we flagged significant correlations between our variables. However, due to relatively small sample, we decided to increase our power by increasing a cut-off p-value for a significant effect from .05 to .10. Therefore, we treat all the effects with p-value lower than .10 as significant. We are aware that at low sample sizes the correlation effects are still not stabilized and could therefore be far from true effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Schönbrodt &amp; Perugini, 2013)</ref> and that this way we risk a greater number of potential false positives, but we believe that in this case it was sensible to make small trade-off between Type 1 and Type 2 errors in order to be able to detect potential relationships between our variables.</p><p>By looking at correlations, what immediately catches the eye are quite large correlations among all of the outcome variables. Indicatively, the perception of employer's efficacy was highly correlated with employees' work behaviors (positively with in-role performance and negatively with counterproductive work behavior) and even more with employees' work-related attitudes (positively with job satisfaction and perceived organizational support and negatively with leaving intentions). These results support <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hogan and Kaiser (2005)</ref> conclusion that employee job satisfaction largely reflects satisfaction with their supervisors.</p><p>Regarding the decision-making styles, avoidant decision-making style appears to be the most relevant decision-making style for employee related outcomes. This finding complements the findings from the leadership literature which showed that "laissez-faire" style leadership that is characterized by avoidance or absence of leadership is correlated negatively with leadership outcomes such as follower job satisfaction, follower motivation and group/organization performance (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Judge &amp; Piccolo, 2004)</ref>. In our study avoidant decision-making style was positively correlated with employees' self-reports of counterproductive work behavior and intentions of leaving organization, and negatively with perceived organizational support and job satisfaction. Conversely, need for achievement, as one of the most relevant personality factors for entrepreneurial success did not seem to matter as much for measured outcomes.</p><p>In a nutshell, these finding point to potential validity of decision-making styles in predicting outcomes in entrepreneurial/leadership domain even beyond the effects of one of the most relevant traits for entrepreneurial success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">General discussion</head><p>Across three studies and three different types of sample, we aimed to investigate the predictive validity of decision-making styles for a wide range of significant real-life outcomes, with a focus on organizational behavior domain. In short, our findings confirmed that the way individuals typically make decisions is related to a range of real-life outcomes. Generally, avoidant decision-making was the most relevant of the five styles for the outcomes we measured. Across the three samples, it was consistently related to worse outcomes, including generally experiencing more negative life outcomes, lower job and career satisfaction, lower quality of academic/in-role job performance, more counterproductive academic/work behavior, and worse performance in entrepreneurial/leadership role. It also differentiated between a sample of entrepreneurs and a sample of general population. Spontaneous decision-making style showed a similar pattern of negative relationships with positive outcomes and positive with negative outcomes, although not on a sample of entrepreneurs. The other styles were also correlated with some of the outcomes, although they seem to be somewhat less relevant for our outcomes than the avoidant style.</p><p>For example, those scoring higher on rational decision-making style experienced on average lower number of negative decision outcomes and had a reputation of high quality decision-makers by other,</p><p>whereas those scoring higher on intuitive style were perceived as somewhat worse decision-makers.</p><p>Although Study 2 showed that the effects of decision-making styles are frequently diminished after accounting for the effects of personality traits on outcomes, there were still instances where styles remained as significant and important predictors even after accounting for personality traits. This was especially true in the case of in-role performance where the avoidant decision-making style was one of the most important predictors and in the case of decision-making quality where the rational decisionmaking style was by far the most important predictor. Furthermore, in our Study 3, avoidant style exhibited far greater correlations with entrepreneurial outcomes than the need for achievement, a quintessential personality trait determining entrepreneurial success.</p><p>The main reason for somewhat diminished role of styles (especially avoidant style) after accounting for the effects of personality, we believe, is that decision-making styles are in part a product of personality.</p><p>Specifically, as we explained in the introduction, avoidant decision-making style is posited to follow from negative affects and emotions, such as anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dewberry et al., 2013b)</ref>. These same traits are captured in part with an emotional stability scale (although not fully as our short emotional stability scale was more related to negative affectivity than specifically anxiety), that was the most potent predictor among personality traits for our outcomes. Therefore, the avoidant decision-making and emotional stability are probably correlated with our outcomes partly because they capture similar traits relevant for those outcomes, making avoidant scale less able to contribute by explaining additional variance over emotional stability. This is not to say that avoidant decision-making is not relevant for important life outcomes in reality. It probably is, as it is quite easy to imagine how being reluctant in making important decisions can lead to more problems and bad outcomes, However, if this reluctance arises in part from anxiety and negative affects, emotional stability captures those traits and therefore explains the relevant parts of the variance in outcomes. Looking from this angle, it could perhaps be said that decision-making styles could be proximal determinants of outcomes, partly arising from personality traits that could be seen as distal determinants.</p><p>By using many work-related outcomes and relating them to decision-making measures, such as in-role performance, counterproductive work behavior or job satisfaction, this study answers the calls for integration of the judgment and decision-making field with organizational behavior field. In this regard, it is possible to differentiate between decision-making styles and decision-making skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dalal &amp; Brooks, 2013</ref>). Here, we tested the relevance of decision-making styles on different outcomes. However, by far more understudied area is the one testing decision-making skills in the work environment. Decisionmaking skills can be defined as the ability to make rational and normative choices and decisions and can be measured with different heuristics and biases tasks from the judgment and decision-making domain (e.g. Bruine de <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bruin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stanovich, West &amp; Toplak, 2016)</ref>. There are still many open questions in this area. For example, we still do not know whether more rational decision makers (i.e. scoring higher on decision-making skills) actually experience more positive work-related outcomes, can decisionmaking skills predict important outcomes beyond more commonly assessed cognitive abilities or are some biases particularly relevant in the workplace.</p><p>Literature</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>are substantially related with most of the Big 5 traits. Most notable of those correlations are generally medium to high correlations between conscientiousness and rational style (i.e. r = .34 in Dewberry et al., 2013a; r = .33 in Juachich et a., 2016; r = .49 in Wood, 2012; r = .47 in Ülgen et al., 2016), conscientiousness and avoidant style (i.e. r = -.33 in Dewberry et al., 2013a; r = -.54 in Juanchich et al., 2016; r = -.41 in Wood, 2012; r = -.26 in Ülgen et al., 2016) and neuroticism and avoidant style (i.e. r = .53 in Dewberry et al., 2013a; r = .43 in Juanchich et al., 2016; r = .27 in Wood, 2012; r = .41 in Ülgen et al., 2016). This latter relationship, together with studies showing that avoidant style is positively related to negative affect and negatively to positive affect (r = .54 and r = -.34; in Ward, 2016), in some ways confirms an emotional base of avoidant style proposed by the Dewberry et al. (2013b) model.</figDesc></figure>
