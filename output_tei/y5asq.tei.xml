			<abstract>
				<p>This research aimed to use the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify biomarkers in Children and Adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) apart from age-matched healthy young individuals. To achieve this, resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) was pre-processed, and the analysis was performed based on frequency bands and Regions Of Interest (ROI). We computed several resting-state Functional Connectivity (rsFC) measurements using a Multi-Variate Auto-Regressive (MVAR) model. We analyzed the best-performing model to understand the model decisionmaking process and identify the learned bio-markers. Overall, results achieved an F1-Score of 0.790 and a Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.745 in the rsFC measurement of full frequency Partial Directed Coherence (ffPDC). We found that Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) performed better than Coherence, Partial Coherence, and Directed Transfer Function (DTF). We also found that the full-frequency version of PDC and DTF outperformed PDC and DTF and their other variants.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Early diagnoses of various types of depression have received significant attention from the scientific community as there are more globally than 350 million people who suffer from this multifactorial psychiatric disorder (World Health Organization, 2017; Kessler &amp;. Bromet, 2013). Depression has been classified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V, 2013) as clinical depression (known as major depressive disorder (MDD)), postpartum depression, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia); premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and depressive disorder due to another medical condition. In this study, we focus on MDD as a more severe form of depression which, unlike normal depression, chronically and significantly affects patients' daily function. MDD as a unipolar and chronic disorder requires a long period of clinical management and appropriate therapeutic approaches. As a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder, MDD is distinguished by continuous low mood, feelings of worthlessness, diminished interest, cognitive impairment, vegetative symptoms, feelings of excessive guilt, anhedonia, disrupted sleep, feeling very tired or low in energy, and suicidal tendencies/ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Whitton et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jia et al., 2010)</ref>. During the last two decades, numerous algorithms have been used by researchers to identify neuro-biomarkers of MDD to improve the diagnostic models and tools as a single stand or in combination with psychiatric evaluation of patients' state which is focused on reported symptoms, events, occurrences, and psychological assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The current research concentrates purely on the classification of MDD and the comparison with healthy participants. This aligns with our prior studies attempting to improve classification-based models among children and adolescents suffering from MDD (see Jahanian-Najafabadi &amp;. Bagh, 2023; Jahanian-Najafabadi &amp;. Bagh, under review). Comprehending the biomarkers associated with MDD holds great significance in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition, and that can be used by medical specialists as a complementary or confirmatory method for their research and its future applications for diagnostic purposes (Jahanian-Najafabadi &amp;. Bagh, 2023).</p><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) as a non-invasive neuroimaging technique with high temporal resolution has been used extensively to achieve the goal of developing diagnostic-based tools for a wide range of brain and neuro-developmental or psychological disorders (Ciodaro et al, 2020; Bhaskarachary et al., 2020, 2021; LÃ³pez et al., 2015 cite <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; Shah et al., 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>). Under specific conditions (at rest, eye closed, eye open, etc.) it is possible to distinguish between healthy brain activities and abnormal activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II-A. Resting-state Functional Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder</head><p>In recent years, studies focused on the analysis of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) using EEG to uncover how depression affects the brain network in patients diagnosed with depression <ref type="bibr">(Whitton et al., 2018 [5]</ref>; Mumtaz et al., 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>; Olbrich et al., 2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>; Xie et al., 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>). rsFC represents an innovative method in neuropsychiatric research, providing a dynamic view of the brain's functional networks during a state of rest. Unlike traditional EEG analysis that focuses on isolated brain regions or specific event-related potentials, rsFC examines the temporal synchronization of neural activity across different brain areas. This approach offers valuable insights into the intrinsic connectivity networks that are disrupted in MDD. By revealing patterns of hypo-or hyper-connectivity within these networks, rsFC enhances our understanding of the complex neural underpinnings of MDD, facilitating the identification of potential EEG biomarkers that distinguish individuals with MDD from healthy controls. This method not only deepens our comprehension of MDD pathophysiology but also holds promise for improving diagnosis and guiding personalized treatment interventions.</p><p>In this context, an earlier study by Fingelkurts et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> found that increased rsFC in the alpha frequency band is associated with depressive symptoms, particularly in the frontal, posterior, and left hemisphere regions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III-A. MDD dataset</head><p>This study involved 214 datasets of children and adolescents aged 5 to 21, with 44 diagnosed with MDD and 170 classified as healthy (labeled HBN). The data was obtained from the publicly available Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Resting-state data un-der closed eyes conditions was chosen for this study, recorded at a sampling rate of 500 Hz and a bandpass of 0.1 to 100 Hz using a 128 Channel EEG HydroCel Geodesic system by Electrical Geodesics Inc. However, after processing and excluding outer channels, only 109 channels were retained. The EEG electrode distribution on the scalp is depicted in figure 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III-B. Pre-processing</head><p>The data pre-processing was divided into two main steps, EEG data pre-processing and connectivity model computation. The pipeline used is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. The EEG pre-processing involves using the prep pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> to detect bad channels, followed by interpolation of the bad channels. A bandpass filter (1-70 Hz) was applied, followed by a notch filter at 60 Hz to eliminate power line artifacts. The data was then resampled at 256 Hz and referenced based on channel average. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was then applied to detect bad artifacts to be removed before further computations. The EEG data was segmented into chunks of 4000 samples (15.6 seconds), and then for each segment a single Multi-Variate Auto-Regressive Integrated Component Analysis (MVARICA) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> was fitted to the data. First, the model hyper-parameters were optimized; to that end, the EEG data chunks were epoched into a single second epoch (15.6 seconds produced 15 epochs). The model order parameter was optimized by minimizing the mean squared generalization error on the epoched data by leaving one out cross-validations; the optimization process was done on model order between 1 and 20. The delta ridge penalty parameter was optimized through the bisection search method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. It should be noted that the optimization step was performed on all EEG chunks independently under the assumption that the EEG signal was nonstationary. The MVARICA model was then fitted to the original EEG chunk data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Using the fitted model, it was possible to compute several connectivity measures <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Channel location of 128 channels in the HBN dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>: from MVARICA, the noise covariance matrix and the model coefficient were extracted to compute the Coherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, Partial Coherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, PDC <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, ffPDC <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, PDC factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, generalized PDC (gPDC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, DTF <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, full frequency DTF (ffDTF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, direct DTF (dDTF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, and generalized DTF (gDTF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> between all channels in both directions.</p><p>Where Coherence is a measure of the statistical dependencies between different signals, Partial Coherence is a measure that evaluates the linear time-invariant relationship between two signals. Both Coherence and Partial Coherence measure the strength of the connection between two signals, however Partial Coherence is better suited to isolate other channels' effects and noise. PDC is a measure used to determine if two signals are significantly correlated (coherent); it also relies on the Granger causality principle to introduce a direction that governs these interactions, i.e. which channel/area of the brain influences other channels/areas. ffPDC and gPDC are different versions of PDC, where ffPDC is normalized across all frequency bands, unlike PDC, which is normalized for each frequency band. gPDC is a scale-invariant version of PDC immune to static gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. PDC Factor is similar to the PDC measure, but it focuses on direct interactions between the channels ignoring any indirect interaction. DTF is derived from the transfer function of a multi-variate auto-regressive (MVAR) model, where DTF would estimate the connectivity measure and direction between two signals within the model. ffDTF, dDTF and gDTF are modified versions of DTF, where ffDTF is normalized across the full frequency band instead of each one as in DTF, dDTF provide more direct measures, where it ignores indirect channels relationship through a middle channel, removing indirect influence between any two channels, and gDTF provides a more robust scale-invariant measurement.</p><p>It should be noted that all measures were computed with a frequency resolution of 2500 samples between 0 and half the sampling rate (0-128 Hz). The measures were then split according to the frequency ranges Delta: 1-4 Hz, Theta: 4-8 Hz, Alpha: 8-12, Beta: 12-30, and Gamma: 30-70 Hz. Each connectivity measurement was used to construct an image as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 2</ref>, where each column and row corresponds to a channel, and the intersection of these rows and columns is the connectivity measure of these channels. The channels were arranged according to the ROI (FL, FR, TL, TR, OL, OR, Center), and the channel's columns and rows were then duplicated to cover the frequency ranges as illustrated in figure 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III-C. Architecture of CNN</head><p>The CNN model's architecture is built upon the VGG16 network, with the top layers replaced by a global average pooling layer. This was succeeded by two fully connected layers, each containing 512 neurons activated by ReLU. Subsequently, a dropout layer of 0.2 was inserted, followed by another dense layer comprising 512 neurons activated by ReLU, further followed by a decision-making layer with 1 neuron activated by Sigmoid. The AdaBelief optimizer was employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, with binary cross-entropy serving as the loss function. The evaluation metrics employed were F1 score, Specificity, Cohen Kappa, MCC, and Pearson Correlation.</p><p>The F1 score, which ranges from 0 to 1, is a measure of a model's accuracy, particularly useful in situations where the data is imbalanced. A good F1 score is greater than 0.7, indicating high precision and recall.</p><p>Cohen Kappa is a statistic that measures the interrater reliability for categorical items. It is a more robust measure that takes into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance in classification. The score is between 0 and 1, with 0.6-0.8 being good and a score greater than 0.8 being very good. MCC is a measure mainly used in machine learning. It is used to measure the quality of binary classification, especially in the case of imbalanced data; the score ranges between -1 and 1, with a score close to 1 or -1 being good. Pearson Correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between two datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III-D. Model training</head><p>During the CNN training implementation, various factors were taken into account, with particular emphasis on the data size. To overcome the limitations posed by the small dataset, we opted to segment the data, resulting in an expanded dataset of up to 5840 samples (MDD + HBN) for each connectivity measurement, with the RGB channels duplicated, except in the cases of Coherence and Partial Coherence, where one channel was chosen for the imaginary values and two channels for the real values. To address overfitting, the model was trained using a subject-wise split to prevent the mixing of inherent subject features between the training and testing phases. Furthermore, we introduced an early stop during the training process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III-E. Visualization of EEG-Based Brain Network Patterns</head><p>Seven regions of interest (ROI) are identified, illustrated in figure 3. To discern discrepancies in MDD and HBN across different frequency bands, Class Activation Map (CAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and Occlusion Sensitivity (OS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> were deployed. OS is a method used for interpreting CNNs which is done by excluding a small patch of the image, usually by zeroing the values in the patch in the shape of a square. This is carried out systematically across the image, then the change in score is observed to discern the importance of each patch. In this case, Sensitivity and Specificity are observed, mainly to understand the change in the true positive rate and true negative rate. This is achieved by making the patch in the shape of each ROI-to-ROI interaction. CAM is another method used to interpret CNNs which uses the weight of the last convolutional layer weighted by the importance of the class in the last prediction layer. CAM is used to generate a heatmap of the important features, and this is achieved by averaging the heatmaps from all the test data, after which the CAM heatmaps are generated based on the test data for each class separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV-A. Setup</head><p>The training method was 5 K-fold cross-validation training. The fold split was based on subjects. Five different models were trained for each fold. The training was set to 100 epochs with early stopping triggered when the F1-Score hit 0.8, batch size was set to 90, and the learning rate was set to 0.000004. Before initiating training, weights were added to each class to account for the class imbalance. The weights were calculated in each fold according to equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Interestingly, the CNN model failed to learn in the case of Coherence and Partial Coherence, where it should also be noted that using only the real value for Coherence and Partial Coherence was better than including the imaginary values as well. Taking a look at the CAM heatmap in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 4</ref>, it is observable that in PDC heatmap in figure ??, which achieved the highest test score, the model places similar attention on the Delta, Theta and Beta frequency bands, with the largest emphasis being placed on PDC from FL to FL, FR, TL, TR and PDC from TR, OL, OR, Center to FL. Another focus is on PDC from TR, OL, OR to Center. In the overall frequency band, the model's focus is placed on PDC from Center to FL, FR, TL, TR and from OR to FL, FR, TL and from OL to FL, FR, and from TR to FL. Interestingly, the model did not place much importance on the alpha frequency band, with the strongest interaction being from Center to FL, FR, TL, and TR. Finally, the model placed a large focus on interactions from TR, OL, OR, and Center-to-Center. When comparing figure 4 of PDC of both HBN and MDD classes with figures 5a and 5b for MDD and HBN respectively, it is noticeable that there is not much difference between the heatmaps when the classes are separated or combined. However, comparing figures 5a and 5b, the model places similar attention in both cases, however, there is a slight difference concerning the areas the model ignores.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W j =</formula><p>Comparing the Occlusion Sensitivity (see appendix), when observing different ffPDC from one ROI into another, we observe a similar pattern in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. There is a large drop in the Sensitivity and almost no change in the Specificity, indicating a general bias towards HBN. The drop in the Sensitivity throughout the frequency bands indicates that the model is relying on the occluded parts in each frequency band to classify correctly (i.e. the occluded area is statistically important). However, a behavior change is observed in the section containing all frequency bands, where occluding the ffPDC interactions between FR-Center, FR-OL, OR-Center, OR-OL, OR-TR, TR-Center, TR-OL, OL-Center, and OL-FL in both directions have caused the model to become biased towards MDD, causing a drop in the Specificity and no notable change in the Sensitivity. Looking at delta interactions, we can see that all occluded ROIs did not affect Specificity. As for Sensitivity, we can see a drop in the score, except for FL-Center, FL-FR, FL-OR, and FL-TR in both directions, where the drop is relatively small, indicating that these ffPDC ROI interactions are statistically less important.</p><p>Looking at ffPDC for each ROI with itself, we see the same pattern of HBN bias as previously mentioned, with general drops in Sensitivity and an increase or no </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV-C. Discussion</head><p>In our research, we implemented a CNN model to identify MDD biomarkers using several connectivity measurements computed from MVARICA model. We found that our model managed to achieve the best score with ffPDC measurement with F1-Score of 0.790, Specificity of 0.914, MCC of 0.745, Cohen Kappa of 0.732, and a Pearson Correlation of 0.786. When comparing PDC and DTF and their different versions, we see that PDC outperforms DTF. Between the two, one is not inherently better than the other measurement; instead, there are specific reasons that made PDC perform better than DTF within the context of this study; the biggest being the training data available for the MVARICA model, which has several effects on the model. We can assume that the issue of the influence of volume conduction is occurring. This issue is more prominent in DTF <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, and while less data does not make the problem worse, it lessens the MVARICA model's ability to mitigate the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Just as well, having less data to fit the MVARICA model causes the model to be less accurate, and it is shown that PDC tends to be more robust in these cases, which might make it degrade less than DTF <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. In the context of this study, a trade-off had to be made: The segmented data was set to 15 seconds, resulting in 15 epochs, which were used to optimize the model parameters and then fit the model to the data. Increasing the size of the segmented data would improve the model accuracy and improve the DTF measurement, but would decrease the amount of available data for the CNN module to train on and therefore decrease the accuracy of the CNN model. Therefore, we recommend focusing on PDC and PDC-related measurements when working with machine learning models and MVARICA model, as data scarcity is more prominent here. It is also noted that the fullfrequency PDC and DTF perform better than any other versions of PDC and DTF, this can be attributed to the fact that normalizing over the entire frequency band instead of normalizing the respective score over each frequency band preserves the PDC or DTF relative peaks, which would allow the CNN model to more easily detect any differences that are specific to these peaks.</p><p>In regards to analyzing the differences between MDD and HBN in CAM and Occlusion Sensitivity, Occlusion Sensitivity managed to provide local, detailed, and specific insight into the importance of each ROI in each frequency band, to discern any ROI that the model might completely ignore, indicating a statistically less important ROIs. While CAM provided a global and high-level overview of which features the model uses to classify, that is not to say that unimportant features in CAM are not used for classification, but that the model is using more subtle and more complex information in these regions, which is not necessarily captured by CAM. CAM is used to understand important areas that are easy to detect and in some cases can be discerned by the naked eye, while Occlusion Sensitivity manages to analyze the ROIs in terms of the model's complex understanding.</p><p>We suggest future studies to test the same models on higher data samples and more balanced ones if possible, to better understand the best connectivity measurement for CNN classification, and we also recommend analyzing different chunks split thresholds on the EEG data to better understand the effect it has on both the CNN and MVARICA model. Finally, we recommend trying different MVAR models that are better adapted to scarce data, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We conclude that MDD biomarkers can be detected by CNN modules with connectivity measurements, achieving good classification results in ffPDC. The offered classification approach has promising future applications in the clinical field, where the identified biomarkers and their interpretation within the context of a nonscientific perspective require further research and understanding.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Example of input data for Partial Coherence, Where ROI C is Center.</figDesc></figure>
