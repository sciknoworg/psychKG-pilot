				<p>Perceptual decision-making is the process of using sensory information to guide behaviour. This process is affected by uncertainty arising from the reliability of incoming sensory evidence (i.e., perceptual uncertainty), and the categorisation of that evidence relative to a choice boundary (i.e., categorical uncertainty). Here, we investigated how these factors impact the temporal dynamics of evidence processing during decision-making, including metacognitive judgements. Human participants (N=36, 26 females) performed a visual-motion discrimination task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. We manipulated perceptual uncertainty by varying motion coherence, and categorical uncertainty by varying the angular offset of motion signals relative to a criterion. To assess metacognition, participants rated their desire to change their mind after each trial. High uncertainty impaired perceptual and metacognitive judgements and reduced the amplitude of the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), a neural marker of evidence accumulation. Importantly, the coherence and offset manipulations affected the CPP at different time points, suggesting that perceptual and categorical uncertainty affect decision making in sequential stages. Moreover, the CPP predicted behavioural outcomes, with greater amplitude associated with faster and more accurate responses. The CPP also predicted metacognitive judgments: larger pre-decisional CPP amplitude was associated with a lower tendency for participants to want to change their mind, whereas larger postdecisional CPP amplitude predicted a higher tendency for participants to want to change their mind. These findings reveal a dissociation between pre-and post-decisional processes and suggest that the CPP is a common neural signature of evidence accumulation that tracks distinct sources of evidence before and after decisions. Significance statement Decisions are often made under uncertainty. This uncertainty can arise from the reliability of incoming sensory evidence (i.e., perceptual uncertainty) or from the categorisation of that evidence relative to a choice boundary (i.e., categorical uncertainty). Here, we investigated how these factors impact the temporal dynamics of evidence accumulation during decision-making, and the relationship between evidence accumulation and metacognitive judgements. We found that centroparietal neural activity, which tracks evidence accumulation, was modulated early by perceptual uncertainty and later by categorical uncertainty. Moreover, this activity predicted participants&apos; metacognitive judgments. Our results shed light on how distinct aspects of uncertainty contribute to evidence processing within a single decision interval and elucidate how evidence processing informs decision-makers&apos; evaluations of their performance.</p>

These processes are affected by at least two sources of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>. At the perceptual level, the reliability of incoming sensory information determines the precision of neural representations, with less reliable stimuli being associated with greater uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bitzer &amp; Kiebel, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rangelov et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. Uncertainty can also arise from the categorisation of internal representations relative to a category boundary. As the distance between the boundary and the encoded representation is reduced, uncertainty increases <ref type="bibr">(Gold &amp; Ding, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hebart et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kepecs et al., 2008)</ref>. Previous neuroimaging studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Shankar &amp; Kayser, 2017)</ref> have used random dot motion paradigms to combine parametric manipulations of perceptual uncertainty (i.e., motion coherence) and categorical uncertainty (i.e., angular offset between motion direction and a criterion). In addition to reporting effects on behavioural performance (i.e., reaction time, accuracy), these studies found that perceptual and categorical uncertainty are differentiated neurally <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>, and weighted differently during the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Shankar &amp; Kayser, 2017)</ref>. It remains unclear, however, if perceptual and categorical uncertainty also exert dissociable effects on the temporal dynamics of evidence processing during decision-making.</p><p>Along with reaction time and accuracy, previous research has explored the effects of perceptual and categorical uncertainty on decision-makers' subjective evaluations of the quality of their choices. Such metacognitive behaviours (e.g., confidence ratings, changes of mind) reflect the combined readout of internal uncertainty computed from all sources, including the reliability of sensory evidence and its distance from the category boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boundy-Singer et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pouget et al., 2016)</ref>. This research has found that increased perceptual and/or categorical uncertainty leads to lower confidence ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boldt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Spence et al., 2015)</ref> and more frequent changes of mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atiya et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barca &amp; Pezzulo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Freeman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Resulaj et al., 2009)</ref>, but has not considered the neural time course of these effects. By one account, metacognition is based on the same evidence used to inform the initial decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Moran et al., 2015)</ref>. Uncertainty may therefore impact metacognitive judgments via its effect on pre-decisional evidence processing. For example, the difference in accumulated evidence between choice alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Vickers &amp; Packer, 1982)</ref> or the precision of the accumulated evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref> may be readout as a confidence rating. Alternatively, metacognition may be informed by post-decisional evidence processing, with uncertainty impacting metacognitive judgments via processing of new sensory information (e.g., from the sensory processing pipeline or stimulus display; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Resulaj et al., 2009)</ref> or internally generated conflict signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desender et al., 2021)</ref>. Disentangling these alternatives remains an ongoing topic of investigation as past research has reported inconsistent results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Feuerriegel et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grogan et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>When investigating the temporal dynamics of evidence processing, past work has utilised the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) to characterise neural correlates of evidence accumulation (i.e., centroparietal positivity (CPP); <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">O'Connell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rangelov &amp; Mattingley, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Twomey et al., 2015)</ref> and internal representations of sensory inputs (i.e., neural tuning strength; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bode et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McIntyre et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wolff et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wolff et al., , 2017</ref>. Here, we used these methods to examine the effects of perceptual and categorical uncertainty on the dynamics of evidence processing during decision-making and subsequent metacognitive judgements. We developed a motion discrimination task in which we manipulated both motion coherence and angular offset of the motion direction from a criterion. Following each response, participants rated their desire to change their mind on a continuous scale, allowing us to quantify subjective uncertainty. Finally, we performed time-resolved analyses of the CPP and neural tuning strength to motion signals, allowing us to characterise the relationship between evidence processing and behavioural performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p>Participants. Thirty-seven participants (26 females, Mage = 24.16 ±5.17 years) were recruited via The University of Queensland's research participation scheme in exchange for reimbursement (20 AUD/h). One participant was excluded due to an interrupted session, leaving a final sample of 36. Participants were aged 18-40 years and had self-reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Additional exclusion criteria included abnormal colour vision, acute neurological illness or drug use. The study was approved by The University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee (ID: 2021/HE000161) and participants provided written informed consent prior to participation.</p><p>Apparatus. Participants were seated in a dark, acoustically and electrically shielded room with their head stabilised by a chinrest at a viewing distance of 56 cm. Stimuli were displayed on a 22.5" VIEWPixx monitor with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and 100Hz refresh rate. The task was coded using the PsychoPy toolbox in Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Peirce, 2007)</ref>. EEG data were collected using a BioSemi ActiveTwo system from 64 Ag-AgCl electrodes placed according to the 10-20 system with a sampling frequency of 1024 Hz. Electrooculographic data were collected using electrodes placed above and below the left eye and on the outer canthi. Eye-movement data, which are not reported here, were collected using an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research). Experimental design. The task display consisted of 320 moving dots (diameter: 0.2 degrees of visual angle (dva); dot life: 0.2 s; dot speed: 5 dva/s) within a circular display area (diameter: 15.6 dva). A black [RGB: 0, 0, 0] circular aperture was positioned at the centre of the display area (diameter: 2.34 dva), and a coloured, oriented Gabor patch (diameter: 1.2 dva; one half blue <ref type="bibr">[RGB: 0,</ref><ref type="bibr">127,</ref><ref type="bibr">255]</ref>, the other orange <ref type="bibr">[255,</ref><ref type="bibr">128,</ref><ref type="bibr">0]</ref>) was presented at the centre of the aperture. No dots appeared within the aperture (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). On each trial, participants were required to report, as quickly and as accurately as possible, whether the dots moved toward the orange or the blue side of the Gabor using the left and right mouse buttons (colour-key mapping was counterbalanced).</p><p>Each trial began with random dot motion for 0.35-0.65 s to prevent evoked responses from stimulus onset contaminating EEG epochs of interest. A period of coherent motion lasting for maximally 1.5 s was then presented, during which time participants could register a response. If participants did not respond, a "!" appeared in place of the Gabor for 0.75 s. Coherent dot-motion signals were generated by randomly and independently sampling the displacement of each dot between two frames from a von Mises distribution defined by two experimentally manipulated parameters. The location parameter (µ) defined the central value of the distribution, or the average motion direction, whereas the concentration parameter (K) defined the width of the distribution, or the motion coherence. On each trial, the average motion direction (µ) was pseudo-randomly offset by either ±30° (large) or ±15° (small) relative to the Gabor's orientation (i.e., the criterion). The criterion orientation was pseudo-randomly selected from one of four values (i.e., 0/180°, 45/225°, 90/270°, or 135/315°) and remained constant within a block of trials. The coherence value was pseudo-randomly selected per trial, varying between high (K = 1.13) and low (K =.72). The K values were chosen to achieve approximately 70% and 85% behavioural accuracy, which was confirmed in an independent testing session. The experimental design was thus a 2 (Motion Coherence: low, high) x 2 (Offset Value: small, large) fully within-subjects design. Criterion orientation was varied as a control variable but was not of interest for analyses. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Illustration of the experimental procedure. a, Example trial sequence from the motion discrimination task. Each trial began with a period of random dot motion randomly drawn from a uniform distribution of between 350-650 ms in 1 ms steps. Random motion was followed by coherent motion until response or for maximally 1500 ms. If a response was made, the dots stopped moving and remained stationary at a lower opacity for the remainder of the trial. A fixation cross was then displayed for 850 ms, after which the change-of-mind (CoM) display was shown until response or for maximally 2000 ms. b, The task manipulations. During the coherent motion period, the coherence of the dot motion (i.e., the probability that the dots would move in the specified direction) and its angular offset from the criterion orientation were pseudo-randomly selected per trial to induce greater uncertainty (i.e., low coherence and/or small offset) or lesser uncertainty (i.e., high coherence and/or large offset).</p><p>Following each response, a fixation cross was displayed for 0.85 s, followed by a change-ofmind display presented for 2 s (maximum). The change-of-mind display consisted of a Likert scale with 10 white, vertical notches placed on either side of a question mark ("?") centred in the middle of the display space. Participants were instructed to report to what extent they would like to change their mind regarding their response about motion direction. To do so, participants positioned a yellow response disk via the computer mouse along the horizontal axis of the display, with the right-most position of the scale anchored by "Completely" and the left-most position anchored by "Not at all". Responses were recorded by pressing the left mouse button. The use of this scale allowed us to capture a bi-directional readout of participants' subjective uncertainty in their decision. The next trial began immediately after the response or if participants failed to respond within the 2 s limit. Participants completed eight blocks of 20 practice trials (160 in total), followed by 16 blocks of 64 experimental trials (1024 in total).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses.</head><p>Behavioural analyses. Trials with missing motion direction responses (5.2% of all trials) or responses faster than 0.2 s (&lt;1% of responses) were removed from further analysis. Reaction time for correct responses and change-of-mind scores were analysed using general linear mixed-effects models with maximum likelihood estimation using the lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref> in the R statistical programming language. Accuracy data were also modelled with the lme4 package, but using a generalised linear mixed-effects model with a logit link function and a binomial conditional distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brown, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jaeger, 2008)</ref>. Change of mind scores were first Z-scored per participant to remove the influence of individual response bias for or against changes. Trials with Z-scores greater than 5 or less than -5 were then excluded (1.4% of trials). To assess metacognitive sensitivity, we subtracted Z-scored change of mind values on correct trials from those on error trials. Larger difference scores reflect greater separation between correct and error responses, or better metacognitive sensitivity. For each dependent variable, a series of four nested mixed-effects models with increasingly complex fixed-effects structures involving Coherence and Offset as predictors and per-participant random intercepts was compared using likelihood ratio tests. Specifically, Model 1 was an intercept only model; Model 2 included the fixed effect of Coherence; Model 3 included the fixed effects of both Coherence and Offset; and Model 4 included both fixed effects and their interaction.</p><p>EEG analyses. EEG data were pre-processed using the MNE toolbox in Python <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gramfort et al., 2013)</ref>. Data were re-referenced offline to the average of all electrodes, band-pass filtered between 0.1-99 Hz, and notch filtered at 50 Hz. The data then underwent automated artifact rejection using the FASTER algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Nolan et al., 2010)</ref>. The continuous data were then segmented into epochs time-locked to the onset of the coherent motion signal (-0.1 s to 0.9 s). These epochs were baselinecorrected relative the -0.1 -0.0 s period pre-stimulus and linearly detrended. Response-locked epochs were created by aligning the stimulus-locked data to the response onset (-0.3 s to 0.7 s), enabling us to use the same pre-stimulus baseline correction. The segmented data were down-sampled to 256 Hz and bad epochs were removed using the FASTER algorithm (M/SD=44/17 across participants, range: 16-92). Finally, we applied a current-source density transformation to better isolate event-related potential (ERP) components <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Feuerriegel et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>For analyses involving the ERPs, we selected a cluster of five centro-parietal electrodes centred on CPz (i.e., Cz, CPz, Pz, CP1, CP2). This cluster was selected to increase the signal-to-noise ratio by averaging across multiple electrodes, and to align with the locations of previously reported ERP correlates of evidence accumulation; specifically, the CPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">O'Connell et al., 2012)</ref>, P3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rausch et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Twomey et al., 2015)</ref> and error positivity (Pe; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boldt &amp; Yeung, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Steinhauser &amp; Yeung, 2012)</ref>. Although these components have been differentiated in the literature (e.g., being either stimulus-or response-locked), all three components overlap considerably, sharing polarity and similar topographies/latencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(O'Connell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ullsperger et al., 2010)</ref>. For simplicity, we thus refer to our ERPs as pre-decisional and post-decisional CPP. The CPP was analysed per time-sample using a general linear mixed-effects model with fixed effects for Coherence, Offset, and their interaction, and by-participant random intercepts. False discovery rate (FDR) corrections across time samples were applied to control for multiple comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>We also performed a multivariate analysis to characterise feature-specific brain activity across the entire scalp. Specifically, we used the Mahalanobis distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wolff et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wolff et al., , 2017</ref> to compute the similarity between neural activity in individual trials (i.e., the test trial) and the mean neural activity of all other trials (i.e., training trials) grouped into 16 bins according to the angular difference between the motion direction presented in the test and training trials. The partially overlapping bins each spanned 45° and were centred around 16 equidistant angles (i.e., ±11.25°, ±33.75°, ±56.25°, ±78.75°, ±101.25°, ±123.75°, ±146.25°, and ±168.75°). To estimate the similarity between the test trial and the training bins, Mahalanobis distances were computed using the cdist function in the SciPy Python package <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Virtanen et al., 2020)</ref> using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, resulting in 16 distance values per trial. If the recorded neural signals contain information about the presented motion direction, the Mahalanobis distance should be greater when the angular distance between trial motion direction and the centre of the bin orientation is large. To quantify motion decoding, the 16 distance values were mean-centred and sign-reversed to transform the distances to similarities.</p><p>Strong population tuning to a presented motion signal should result in a bell-shaped profile of similarities, with the strongest response at the motion direction presented in the test trial and a gradual decrease in tuning strength with increases in the angular distance between the presented motion direction and the bin centre. An absence of tuning, by contrast, would be reflected in a uniform response profile across all bins. To quantify an aggregate metric of tuning strength, we computed the sum of the dot product between the vector of similarities per bin and the vector of the cosine-transformed centres of the bin <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wolff et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wolff et al., , 2017</ref>. This non-parametric index strongly correlates with the profile of responses, taking a value of 0 for uniform profiles and increasing monotonically as the profile approaches the idealised bell-shaped curve. As per our CPP analyses, we analysed tuning strength per time-sample using a general linear mixed-effects model with fixed effects for Coherence, Offset, and their interaction, and by-participant random intercepts. Additionally, to test for periods in which tuning strength for each condition differed from zero, we performed a one-sample t-test per time-sample. FDR corrections across time samples were applied to control for multiple comparisons.</p><p>Finally, to investigate the time-periods in which neural markers were associated with behavioural performance, we modelled reaction time, error rate, and change-of-mind scores as a function of both trial-wise CPP and tuning strength in independent analyses. We sought to isolate variability not explained by the task manipulations to reveal the relationship between subjective fluctuations in uncertainty and behavioural outcomes more clearly. As such, we first regressed tuning strength/CPP per time sample onto Coherence and Offset in separate general linear mixed-effects models and extracted the residuals from these models. The residual tuning strength and CPP amplitude reflect trial-wise variability in these measures unrelated to the perceptual and categorical uncertainty and serve as an estimate of internal uncertainty independent of sensory input. Each model included fixed effects for Coherence and Offset and their interaction, and by-participant random intercepts. The residuals were then Z-scored per-participant and entered as predictors in separate models for reaction time, accuracy, and change-of-mind scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Behaviour. For each dependent variable, the mixed-effects model that provided the best fit to the data included the fixed effects of Coherence and Offset but not their interaction (Model 3, all p &lt;.001). Fixed effects parameters of Model 3 for each dependent variable are thus reported below.</p><p>We first examined the effects of Coherence and Offset on participants' motion discrimination decisions (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). As expected, response accuracy was lower as uncertainty increased, with both the simple-main effects of Coherence (B = -0.202, SE = 0.027, t = -7.59, p &lt; .001) and Offset (B = -0.651, SE = 0.027, t = -24.20, p &lt; .001) being significant. That is, trials with a smaller offset and low coherence significantly decreased accuracy relative to larger offset and high coherence trials. Similarly, reaction times became longer as uncertainty increased, with the effects of Coherence (B = 0.031, SE = 0.002, t = 12.62, p &lt; .001) and Offset (B = 0.038, SE = 0.002, t = 15.26, p &lt; .001) again being significant. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Motion discrimination performance. Boxplots of accuracy (a) and reaction time (b) split by Coherence and Offset conditions. In both panels filled circles denote the mean. Between-participants variability was removed using previously described methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Morey, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>We next examined the effect of uncertainty on participants' willingness to change their mind. Given the use of a continuous change-of-mind measure, we first looked at the distribution of changeof-mind scores. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3a</ref>, there was significant heterogeneity in participants' use of the change-of-mind scale, with some participants expressing a much greater desire to change their motion discrimination responses than others. To remove these individual biases, the raw change-ofmind responses were Z-scored per participant, such that positive values indicate a stronger desire to change one's mind relative to the participant-specific average, and vice versa <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 3b</ref>). Z-scored change-of-mind scores are reported for all further analyses. Greater uncertainty increased participants' desire to change their mind, with change-of-mind scores being positive for low coherence trials and negative for high coherence trials (M/SD= 0.023/0.077 vs. -0.039/0.074) and positive for small offset trials and negative for large offset trials (M/SD = 0.067/0.104 vs. -0.081/0.097, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3c</ref>). The simple-main effects of Coherence (B= 0.062, SE= 0.010, t= 6.17, p&lt;.001) and Offset (B= 0.149, SE= 0.010, t= 14.88, p&lt;.001) were both significant.</p><p>While these results reveal that greater uncertainty increased participants' tendency to want to change their mind overall, it is important to consider the relationship between uncertainty and the accuracy of participants' motion discrimination. As such, we conducted an analysis to assess participants' metacognitive sensitivity. Specifically, we repeated the above analysis using difference scores computed by subtracting change-of-mind scores following correct responses from those following error responses. Larger difference scores indicate greater metacognitive sensitivity. We again found that the simple-main effects of Coherence (B = -0.220, SE = 0.059, t = -3.699, p &lt; .001) and Offset were significant (B = -0.394, SE = 0.059, t = -6.640, p &lt; .001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3d</ref>), such that the separation between correct and error responses was greater when uncertainty was low. Thus, although uncertainty increased participants' tendency to want to change their mind, it reduced their ability to do so accurately. Electroencephalography. Having established that greater uncertainty impaired both the quality of participants' initial decisions and their ability to reflect on those decisions, we next explored how uncertainty affected neural markers relevant to decision formation. We first examined the effects of Coherence and Offset on the CPP, a neural marker of evidence accumulation, during stimulus-and response-locked epochs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>). In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">O'Connell et al., 2012)</ref>, we observed a positive deflection over a cluster of centro-parietal electrodes beginning approximately 180 ms after onset of coherent motion. Unlike in previous studies, however, we observed a dual-peaked CPP, with a second positive deflection occurring at approximately 500 ms after stimulus onset. These two CPP peaks were differentially sensitive to the Coherence and Offset manipulations. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4a</ref>, when split by Coherence, the CPP reached a significantly greater amplitude during high-relative to low-coherence trials from the onset of the first peak. This difference was then maintained throughout the second peak until approximately 750 ms post-stimulus onset. In contrast, when split by Offset, large offset trials reached a significantly greater amplitude than small offset trials during the second CPP peak only (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4b</ref>). Filled circles in stimulus-locked epochs denote mean reaction time. In all panels, horizontal bars denote periods of statistical significance (p &lt; .05) for fixed effects of condition, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons. Error bands denote normalised 95% confidence intervals as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Morey, 2008)</ref>. Data were smoothed using a Gaussian window (SD = 16 ms) for visualisation.</p><p>When considering the response-locked epochs, we observed build-to-threshold dynamics consistent with previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">O'Connell et al., 2012)</ref>. Moreover, we observed a second, late positive deflection occurring from approximately 400 ms post-response. This late deflection plausibly reflects the start of a second, post-decisional evidence accumulation process, as has been proposed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desender et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murphy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Steinhauser &amp; Yeung, 2012)</ref>. However, there were no periods of statistically significant difference between conditions during the response-locked epoch. Similarly, there were no periods in either the stimulus-or response-locked epochs during which the interaction between Coherence and Offset was significant.</p><p>We next performed a motion decoding analysis to characterise the effects of uncertainty on the strength of internal stimulus representations of motion direction, as reflected in feature-specific brain activity across the entire electrode array. Specifically, we used the Mahalanobis distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wolff et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wolf et all., 2017)</ref> to compute the similarity between individual trials and the mean of all other trials grouped into 16 orientation bins, each spanning 45°. If feature-specific information about the presented motion direction is contained within the recorded EEG signal, the similarity between the signal on a given trial and that of the orientation bins should be greater when the angular distance between that trial's motion direction and the centre of an orientation bin is small. To quantify the strength of the decoded motion signal, we computed an aggregate measure of neural tuning across orientation bins per time-sample (see Methods).</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5a</ref> and 5b, we observed consistent and reliable motion tuning from approximately 220 ms post-stimulus onset, peaking at approximately 400 ms, for all conditions. Moreover, as would be expected from a neural marker that tracks the strength of internal stimulus representations, tuning strength was numerically greater for high coherence relative to low coherence trials from the onset of significant motion decoding, with two small points of statistically significant difference at approximately 300 ms and 350 ms post-stimulus. However, there were no periods in which large and small offset trials differed from one another. This likely reflects the fact that our Offset manipulation theoretically affects a higher-order cognitive process involving the categorisation of stimuli relative to a choice boundary, which is not well captured by a method reflecting the strength of representations of those stimuli. In the response-locked epoch, motion tuning was significantly different from zero for all conditions until approximately 200 ms postresponse. Following this, tuning strength decreased considerably, albeit remaining significantly different from zero for certain periods in all conditions. This pattern is consistent with neural representations of the stimulus persisting until all late-arriving information from the sensory processing pipeline has arrived <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Resulaj et al., 2009)</ref>, and/or the storage of stimulus representations in working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(McIntyre et al., 2021)</ref>. Regression analyses. Having derived neural markers of evidence accumulation and internal stimulus representations, we next examined the relationship between these markers and behavioural outcomes (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6)</ref>. In a time-resolved, trial-wise analysis, we regressed reaction time, accuracy, and change-of-mind scores onto CPP amplitude and tuning strength (see Methods). During stimuluslocked epochs, the CPP was a significant negative predictor of error rate, reaction time, and changeof-mind scores <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>), indicating that higher CPP amplitude was associated with faster and more accurate responses and less desire to change one's mind. These negative relationships appeared reliably and consistently for all dependant variables from approximately 400-500 ms post-stimulus onset, corresponding to the time of the second CPP peak (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4)</ref>. Accordingly, when considering response-locked epochs, these negative relationships were also present for all dependent variables around the response time. Importantly, however, the relationship between the CPP and change-of-mind scores revered after the response, with higher CPP amplitude associated with greater desire to change one's mind from approximately 600 ms post-response. This time window corresponds with the peak of the second positive deflection observed in the response-locked ERP analysis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>). There was also a period from approximately 400-550 ms post-response in which CPP amplitude was significantly associated was faster response times. Note, however, that this result should be interpreted with caution as the temporal relationship between the variables is reversed (i.e., post-response CPP is predicting an event that occurred earlier in time). In contrast to the CPP, there were no periods in which tuning strength was a significant predictor of reaction time, errors, or change-of-mind scores during either the stimulus-or response-locked epochs. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Time-resolved regression analyses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Decisions are often made in the face of uncertainty. Here, we utilised the high temporal resolution of EEG recording to investigate how distinct sources of uncertainty related to the reliability of sensory evidence (i.e., perceptual uncertainty) and distance of that evidence from a category boundary (i.e., categorical uncertainty) impacted the temporal dynamics of evidence processing during perceptual decision-making. Moreover, we examined the time course of the relationship between evidence processing and behavioural performance, including participants' metacognitive judgements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-decisional centroparietal positivity dissociates perceptual and categorical uncertainty</head><p>To manipulate perceptual and categorical uncertainty, we used a motion discrimination paradigm in which we varied motion coherence and angular offset of dot motion from a choice boundary, respectively. In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Shankar &amp; Kayser, 2017)</ref>, we found that low coherence and small offsets impaired participants' motion discrimination performance, leading to slower and less accurate choices. Poorer behavioural performance for low coherence and small offset trials was accompanied by lower pre-decisional CPP amplitude. To formally assess the relationship between the CPP and perceptual judgements, we performed trialwise regression analyses which revealed that greater CPP amplitude predicted lower error rates and faster reaction times. This finding supports the interpretation of the CPP as a neural correlate of evidence accumulation, as higher quality evidence should lead to better performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">van Vugt et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">O'Connell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rangelov et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rangelov &amp; Mattingley, 2020)</ref>, the pre-decisional CPP waveform we observed was characterised by two distinct peaks, and our task manipulations affected these two peaks in distinct ways. Specifically, the first peak occurred about 200 ms post-stimulus onset and was strongly modulated by motion coherence. As this time-course aligns with that reported in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rangelov et al., 2021)</ref>, the observed difference between Coherence levels plausibly reflects decision-related processing and not merely differences in sensory stimulation. By comparison, the second peak was modulated by Offset and was closely aligned with the average reaction time. Given that our task design combined Coherence and Offset manipulations, it is likely that the observed CPP waveform reflects sequential processing of distinct aspects of uncertainty within a single decision interval. Specifically, the first peak might reflect evidence accumulation for the pure motion direction (i.e., the direction of the coherently moving dots), whereas the second peak might reflect evidence accumulation regarding the relative motion direction (i.e., whether the coherent motion signal was to one side or the other of the criterion). This interpretation fits with notion of a hierarchically organised visual processing system in which lower-level sensory features are processed before higher-level abstractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Freedman &amp; Miller, 2008)</ref>. For example, previous studies have shown that object position can be decoded from multivariate patterns of brain activity prior to high-level features such as category membership (e.g., face vs. car; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carlson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Robinson et al., 2023)</ref>. Further supporting this explanation, the period in which CPP amplitude predicted behavioural performance in our regression analyses coincided with the second peak. If this second peak reflects evidence accumulation regarding motion direction relative to the criterion, it follows that it should also predict behavioural outcomes, as it is this evidence upon which participants' decisions were ultimately based.</p><p>Unlike CPP amplitude, tuning strength did not consistently differ between levels of the Coherence or Offset manipulations despite there being reliable motion decoding from ~200 ms post-stimulus onset. Numerically, however, tuning strength was significantly greater for high relative to low coherence trials for two periods during the stimulus-locked epoch. This finding is in the expected direction, with high motion coherence theoretically conferring more precise internal stimulus representations. In support, a recent study in which the difference between high and low coherence conditions were larger has shown significant differences in tuning strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rangelov et al., 2021)</ref>. Tuning strength was also not a significant predictor of behavioural performance in any of the regression analyses in our study. These results might suggest that information about the reliability of incoming sensory information (of which tuning strength is a proxy) affects behavioural performance indirectly by being fed into the evidence accumulation process itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential influence of pre-and post-decisional brain activity on metacognition</head><p>Previous studies have proposed that the brain uses estimates of both perceptual and categorical uncertainty to inform metacognitive judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bitzer &amp; Kiebel, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boldt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boundy-Singer et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. Indeed, here we observed that participants' desire to change their mind increased additively with low coherence and small offsets. However, while uncertainty increased participants' desire to change their mind, the separation between change-of-mind scores following correct and error responses decreased with uncertainty, reflecting poorer metacognitive sensitivity with worsening motion discrimination performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Past research has debated the role of pre-versus post-decisional evidence in contributing to metacognitive judgements <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Moran et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Steinhauser &amp; Yeung, 2010)</ref>. Some theories propose that metacognition is informed by the same information that contributes to the decision process itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kiani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Van Den Berg et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vickers &amp; Packer, 1982)</ref>, while others propose that evidence processing continues post-decisionally, and it is the latter that principally determines metacognitive judgements <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Resulaj et al., 2009)</ref>. Contrary to these proposals, our results converge with an emerging set of studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Feuerriegel et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grogan et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murphy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Turner et al., 2022)</ref> that have highlighted the importance of both pre-and post-decisional evidence processing. Here we found that greater CPP amplitude was associated with lower change-of-mind scores prior to the initial response, and with higher change-ofmind scores after the response. This pattern could reflect a change of reference with respect to what evidence is being accumulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desender et al., 2021)</ref>. That is, pre-decisional evidence accumulation maps sensory information to the choice alternatives, whereas post-decisional evidence accumulation may instead correspond to the accuracy of one's initial choice (i.e., "error evidence"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Desender et al., 2021)</ref>. This idea accords with the current results as well as past research showing positive correlations between CPP amplitude and confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Herding et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rausch et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">van Vugt et al., 2019)</ref> and negative correlations between Pe amplitude and confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boldt &amp; Yeung, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Feuerriegel et al., 2022)</ref>. Is it worth noting that one recent study failed to find a relationship between the CPP and confidence judgements after applying a current-source density transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Feuerriegel et al., 2022)</ref>. The authors instead identified a fronto-central component which indexed decision confidence and suggested that past studies may have actually observed the effects of this frontal component on parietal electrodes via volume conduction. Nevertheless, in the current study we observed a relationship between CPP and change-of-mind scores with CSD transformed data, suggesting that the CPP does indeed index internal uncertainty.</p><p>As with reaction time and accuracy, however, tuning strength did not predict change-of-mind scores at any time point. This finding is surprising given the past research demonstrating that decisionmakers adjust their metacognitive judgements according to stimulus reliability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boldt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Spence et al., 2015)</ref>. Our results may again indicate that information about the reliability of stimulus information is incorporated into the evidence accumulation process itself, which in turn regulates behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Here we have shown that distinct forms of uncertainty reflecting perceptual processing and higherorder categorisation combine to impair decision-making and reduce metacognitive insight into decision quality. Moreover, we identified that the CPP dissociated perceptual and categorical uncertainty, possibly reflecting sequential processing stages within a single decision interval. Finally, pre-and post-decisional CPP amplitude, but not neural tuning strength, predicted behavioural outcomes, including oppositely signed metacognitive judgements. This latter finding identifies the CPP as a common neural signature of evidence accumulation for the initial choice as well as the metacognitive judgements, capable of tracking distinct sources of evidence both before and after a perceptual decision is made.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Change-of-mind responses. a, Histograms of raw change-of-mind (CoM) scores for two example participants, highlighting substantial individual differences. b, Histogram of Z-scored changeof-mind scores.
