A number of studies have demonstrated that these face judgments, especially judgments of trustworthiness, influence decisions in domains such as voting, personnel selection, and criminal sentencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Olivola, Funk, &amp; Todorov, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Olivola &amp; Todorov, 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Todorov, Olivola, Dotsch, &amp; Mende-Siedlecki, 2015)</ref>. The widespread influence of facial trustworthiness is surprising, given that the human ability to accurately identify trustworthy individuals based on facial cues is generally poor .</p><p>Why do people rely on first impressions based on facial cues? On the one hand, models of cue selection propose that the perceived diagnosticity of a cue (i.e., how well it is thought to predict a certain outcome) determines how much people rely on it when making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brunswik, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hammond, Hursch, &amp; Todd, 1964)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, the influence of facial cues has been attributed to the perceived validity of face judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Olivola et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Rezlescu, Duchaine, Olivola, &amp; Chater, 2012)</ref>: This view suggests that people rely on facial trustworthiness judgments because they believe that their judgments are accurate. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that face judgments affect decisions because of their intuitive accessibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Olivola &amp; Todorov, 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006)</ref>. Faces are processed quickly and efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Freeman &amp; Johnson, 2016)</ref> and people tend to prioritize cues that come to mind easily <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Evans &amp; Krueger, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Shah, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Simmons &amp; Nelson, 2006)</ref>. Relying on facial cues might therefore constitute a mental shortcut that reduces decision effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gigerenzer, Hertwig, &amp; Pachur, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Shah &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008)</ref>. Here, we test these two accounts, illuminating the mechanisms that give rise to the widespread influence of facial cues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Facial trustworthiness influences social decision-making</head><p>The ability to judge trustworthiness in others is crucial in mixed-motive settings, where there is a motivational conflict between self-interest and the collective good <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kelley et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>When this conflict arises, people must judge whether their interaction partners can be trusted to cooperate <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dawes, 1980)</ref>. Researchers employ simplified interactions, such as the trust game <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>, to capture the essential structure of this dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berg, Dickhaut, &amp; McCabe, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>In the binary version of the game <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Snijders &amp; Keren, 1999)</ref>, the trustor can decide to keep the status quo, which ends the interaction, or to trust the other player. In the event of trust, the trustee FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL  can choose between betrayal and reciprocation. Reciprocity leads to equal payoffs for both, and these outcomes are better than the status quo. The trustee gains even more by choosing betrayal, but this leads to the worst possible outcome for the trustor. Trust is risky; once it is chosen, the trustee has full control over the outcomes, and is faced with the temptation to choose betrayal.</p><p>In the trust game, people rely on facial cues when making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Ewing, Caulfield, Read, &amp; Rhodes, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Rezlescu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">van't Wout &amp; Sanfey, 2008)</ref>. In general, trustworthy-looking partners are more likely to be trusted. Similar effects have been observed for consequential trust decisions outside the lab: Trustworthy-looking individuals ask for higher rent on Airbnb <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ert, Fleischer, &amp; Magen, 2016)</ref>; have a higher chance of being granted loans on crowdsourcing websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Duarte, Siegel, &amp; Young, 2012)</ref>; and are more likely to be appointed as CEOs after firm misconduct <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Gomulya, Wong, Ormiston, &amp; Boeker, 2017)</ref>. Facial trustworthiness also influences legal decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Porter, ten Brinke, &amp; Gustaw, 2010</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berry &amp; Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1988)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Rule (2015, 2016)</ref> found that untrustworthylooking criminals were more likely to receive the death penalty (as opposed to life in prison). In short, perceived facial trustworthiness has far-reaching consequences. Despite widespread reliance on facial cues, evidence on whether people are able to accurately infer others' trustworthiness from their facial appearance is mixed <ref type="bibr">(Bonnefon, FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 5 Hopfensitz, &amp; De Neys, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Todorov, Funk, &amp; Olivola, 2015)</ref>. Some studies point to modest accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnefon, Hopfensitz, &amp; De Neys, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">C. Lin, Adolphs, &amp; Alvarez, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Slepian &amp; Ames, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Tognetti, Berticat, Raymond, &amp; Faurie, 2013)</ref>, whereas others provide evidence against it both on empirical <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rule, Krendl, Ivcevic, &amp; Ambady, 2013)</ref> and theoretical grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(McCullough &amp; Reed, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Vogt, Efferson, &amp; Fehr, 2013)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Todorov and Porter (2014)</ref> found substantial variation in judgments of trustworthiness across different photos of the same person, which speaks against the idea that there are stable cues signaling an underlying trait (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Sutherland, Young, &amp; Rhodes, 2016)</ref>. More evidence is needed to determine when people are able to accurately discern trustworthiness from facial cues. However, the current literature suggests that this ability is limited at best, and people would often make better decisions by relying on other cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Olivola &amp; Todorov, 2010b)</ref>.</p><p>The observation that facial trustworthiness judgments affect so many consequential decisions (in spite of their poor accuracy) has led several researchers to propose that the influence of face judgments constitutes a bias that should be eliminated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Olivola, Funk, &amp; Todorov, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Porter et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Wilson &amp; Rule, 2015)</ref>. However, the origin of such a face bias (i.e., why there are such persistent effects of facial trustworthiness) remains poorly understood, and this shortcoming has hindered efforts aimed at curbing the bias. Here, we set out to address this gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explanations for reliance on facial trustworthiness</head><p>Scholars have long been interested in how people use different types of information, or cues, when making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brunswik, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Slovic &amp; Lichtenstein, 1971)</ref>. Normative models propose that rational decision-makers should weigh all available cues according to how strongly they correlate with an outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dawes, Faust, &amp; Meehl, 1989</ref>). Yet, people often lack insight into the true validity of a cue (e.g., how diagnostic facial trustworthiness judgments really are) and descriptive decision models acknowledge that cues are weighed (or ranked) according to their subjective, rather than objective, validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brunswik, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hammond et al., 1964)</ref>. A weaker definition of rationality holds that cue utilization should be determined by how valid people think the cue is. Reliance on facial trustworthiness may then be explained by the subjective belief that it is a particularly valid cue. This argument has been raised in a review by <ref type="bibr">Olivola and colleagues (2014)</ref>, who point to the historically persistent FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL  belief in the correspondence between facial cues and personality <ref type="bibr">(Aristotle, trans. 1936;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lavater, 1775)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hassin and Trope (2000)</ref> report that most people believe that faces contain at least some valid cues to individual personality traits (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Suzuki, Tsukamoto, &amp; Takahashi, 2017)</ref>. We refer to this explanation of the face bias as the subjective validity account.</p><p>An alternative explanation can be derived from research into heuristic decision-making.</p><p>People are often unable or unwilling to consider all available information and therefore rely on heuristics-strategies that consider only a subset of all available information-to reduce cognitive effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gigerenzer et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Payne, Bettman, &amp; Johnson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Simon, 1955)</ref>. In fact, people favor cues that are intuitively available <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dimov &amp; Link, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Shah, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Simmons &amp; Nelson, 2006)</ref>. Faces attract attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Ro, Russell, &amp; Lavie, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Theeuwes &amp; Van der Stigchel, 2006)</ref> and trustworthiness impressions are formed spontaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Klapper, Dotsch, van Rooij, &amp; Wigboldus, 2016)</ref>, quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006)</ref>, and effortlessly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnefon et al., 2013)</ref>. From this perspective, reliance on facial trustworthiness may be explained by the intuitive accessibility of the cue <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Olivola &amp; Todorov, 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006)</ref>. We refer to this explanation of the face bias as the intuitive accessibility account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the studies</head><p>We present six studies to test the two accounts of the face bias: Do people persistently rely on facial trustworthiness because they believe it is a particularly valid cue, or because face judgments are intuitively accessible? We examine this question in the context of the trust game ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Berg et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Snijders &amp; Keren, 1999)</ref>, by comparing the effects of facial trustworthiness and economic payoff information, a cue we predict to be more subjectively valid, but also more difficult to evaluate. The combination of these two cues, which differ in subjective validity and accessibility, offers a critical test of the factors underlying cue preferences.</p><p>In Study 1, we test the perceived validities of facial trustworthiness and economic payoff information, with the prediction that people believe economic payoffs are more valid cue than facial trustworthiness. In Study 2, we examine the time it takes to make decisions based on facial trustworthiness and economic payoffs; here, we expect it takes less time to reach a decision based on facial trustworthiness than on economic payoffs. Studies 3a-c examine how much people rely on the two cues when both are presented simultaneously. In these studies, we determine whether people favor the subjectively more valid cue (economic payoffs), or the cue that is processed more efficiently (facial trustworthiness). Finally, Study 4 tests how cognitive FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 7 reflection affects reliance on the two cues. If people favor facial trustworthiness because it is easier to process than payoff information, then making intuitive (vs. reflective) decisions should reduce reliance on economic payoffs, but not reduce reliance on facial trustworthiness.</p><p>All data and analysis scripts are available at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/h6dsj/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>Study 1 examined explicit preferences for facial trustworthiness and economic payoff information. <ref type="bibr">Krueger (2011, 2014)</ref> found that trustors are aware of the importance of the trustee's economic payoffs-people trust less when the trustee faces a greater temptation (i.e., a greater economic incentive to choose betrayal). In turn, trustees actually reciprocate less when temptation is large <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Evans &amp; Krueger, 2014)</ref>. Thus, like facial trustworthiness, temptation is used as a cue when making trust decisions. However, prior work has not examined which of the two cues is seen as more valid. Given that temptation is actually predictive of trustees' behavior while facial trustworthiness has poor predictive validity, we set out to test whether people's explicit preferences for the two cues correspond to their predictive validities. To address this question, we let participants play a trust game where participants could choose which cue they would want to have available: temptation (the trustee's economic payoff to betray trust) or facial trustworthiness (a facial photograph of their interaction partner).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. Dutch undergraduate psychology students (N = 126; 81.0% female) from Tilburg University participated in the study in return for partial course credit (Mage = 19.83, SDage = 2.96). The sample size was based on the number of students that participated in the study within one week.</p><p>Materials and procedure. The experiment was administered in the lab. First, participants saw an exemplary decision tree (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) and learned about the rules of the trust game. They were told that they would have to make a single decision between IN and OUT (trust and status quo) and that they would be randomly paired with another participant who would act as the trustee. If they chose OUT, the interaction would end. If they chose IN, then the trustee would make a choice between RIGHT and LEFT (reciprocation and betrayal). Choices were hypothetical and participants were asked to imagine that the points they were playing for would FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 8 be converted into actual money at the end of the game. All participants played the role of the trustor.</p><p>Next, participants chose what kind of information (i.e., economic payoff or facial appearance) they wanted to have available. They could choose to see how much your interaction partner would gain in case he/she chooses LEFT or a photo of your interaction partner. The order in which they read the description of the two cues was counterbalanced. Participants then saw a different decision tree (with different payoffs) that was relevant for their choice.</p><p>Depending on their choice of cue, either the betrayal payoff or the photo of their partner was revealed. The photo was taken from the Radboud Faces Database (RaFD; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Langner et al., 2010)</ref> and showed a female person with a happy facial expression. The trustee's temptation corresponded to a 100% increase in payoffs when choosing betrayal over reciprocation.</p><p>Participants made their one-shot trust decision and indicated their confidence in having made the right decisions by dragging a slider along a scale ranging from 0 (not at all confident) to 100 (extremely confident).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>To measure preferences for the two types of cues, we compared the percentages of participants who chose to see the photo of their partner versus the payoffs of their partner. A clear majority of participants (78.6%) preferred to see the trustee's temptation, p &lt; .001 (exact binomial test). Participants explicitly prioritized economic payoff information over facial trustworthiness information.</p><p>After cue selection, a total of 23.02% of participants trusted. Confidence ratings were similar for trust (M = 58.45, SD = 18.85) and distrust decisions (M = 62.92, SD = 23.11), t(55.54) = 1.06, p = .29, d = 0.22. 1 There was also no significant difference in confidence ratings between participants who chose to see their partner's payoffs (M = 61.86, SD = 22.80) and those who chose to see their partner's photo (M = 62.00, SD = 20.30), t(45.53) = 0.03, p = .98, d = 0.01.</p><p>Confidence was not affected by the type of information available at the moment of decisionmaking. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We report the results of Welch's t-tests which, compared to a Student's t-tests, provides equal power but superior error control in case of unequal variances between groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Delacre, Lakens, &amp; Leys, 2017)</ref>. In our first study, people perceived economic payoff information to be more valid than facial trustworthiness information. Our second study had two goals: First, we wanted to compare the cognitive effort required to make decisions based on payoffs versus facial trustworthiness.</p><p>Previous research has shown that facial trustworthiness is processed spontaneously, quickly, and effortlessly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnefon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Klapper et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006)</ref>. However, it is still unclear if making decisions based on facial trustworthiness is less effortful than making decisions based on other cues. Reduced decision effort should be reflected in faster decision times (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bettman, Johnson, &amp; Payne, 1990)</ref>. We therefore hypothesized that people would make decisions more quickly when they relied on facial trustworthiness rather than economic payoffs. Differences in response times may also be caused by differences in decision conflict rather than decision effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Evans &amp; Rand, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Krajbich, Bartling, Hare, &amp; Fehr, 2015)</ref>. Thus, we measured participants' confidence, as increased decision conflict leads to decreased confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Neys, Cromheeke, &amp; Osman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Zakay, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we examined how facial and economic cues influenced the extent to which people rely on expectations of reciprocity. Expectations play a central role in psychological and economic models of trust, providing a conceptual link between cues and trust decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bacharach &amp; Gambetta, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Thielmann &amp; Hilbig, 2015)</ref>. People are more likely to trust if they have high expectations of reciprocity (Costa-Gomes, Huck, &amp; Weizsäcker, 2014;</p><p>Thielmann &amp; Hilbig, 2014). The subjective validity account suggests that people should rely more on their expectations when they are based on economic payoffs (vs. facial trustworthiness) since economic payoffs are subjectively more valid. The intuitive accessibility account makes the opposite prediction, as using appearance to form expectations requires less cognitive effort.</p><p>Thus, comparing the extent to which people rely on their cue-based expectations served as a critical test of the two accounts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. A total of 134 students from Tilburg university (75.4% female; Mage = 21.30, SDage = 1.45) participated in exchange for partial course credit. The sample size was based on the number of students that participated in the study within two weeks.</p><p>Materials and procedure. The experiment was administered online. Participants were randomly assigned to the temptation condition or the face condition. In both conditions, FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 10 participants first learned about and then played a series of 24 hypothetical trust games in the role of the trustor.</p><p>In the face condition, participants saw a photo of their interaction partner next to the decision tree on each trial. The photos were again taken from the RaFD <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Langner et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We selected 24 frontal photos of Caucasian Dutch adults with a forward gaze, of which half were male and half were female. Similar to previous investigations, half of the selected faces displayed a neutral expression and half a happy facial expression (i.e., they were smiling) in order to introduce variance in the perceived trustworthiness of the faces (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Evans &amp; van de Calseyde, 2017)</ref>. Previous research has shown that smiling individuals are perceived to be more trustworthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Krumhuber et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Said, Sebe, &amp; Todorov, 2009)</ref>. To ensure that any observed effect of facial trustworthiness is not due to the attractiveness of the face (R. K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Wilson &amp; Eckel, 2006)</ref>, we selected faces of 12 male and 12 female individuals judged to be equally attractive <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Langner et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In the temptation condition, we varied the trustee's temptation, i.e., the economic incentive to choose betrayal. Following previous work by Evans and Krueger <ref type="formula">2014</ref>, we defined temptation as the difference between the trustee's gain in case of betrayal ( ) and reciprocation</p><p>( 2 ) divided by the value of betrayal: ( − 2 )⁄ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). On half of the trials, temptation was low (0.33) and on the other half, it was high (0.60). These values correspond to a 50% (low temptation) and 150% (high temptation) increase in payoffs for the trustee in case betrayal is chosen over reciprocation. Note that payoffs in the face condition always corresponded to a temptation parameter of 0.5 (100% increase in payoffs) which ensured that the average temptation across the 24 trials was equal in both conditions.</p><p>We assessed participants' response time for each trust game decision. Five extremely slow responses (0.16% of all decisions) were excluded because they were between 3 and 56 standard deviations slower than the mean. Response times were log10-transformed to account for their right-skewed distribution.</p><p>After making decisions in the 24 trust games, participants were shown each trust game again and they were asked to state their expectations of reciprocity. Specifically, we asked: How likely is it that Player 2 will choose RIGHT [reciprocation]? They could drag a slider along a scale ranging from 0 (Player 2 will definitely choose LEFT [betrayal]) to 100 (Player 2 will definitely choose <ref type="bibr">RIGHT [reciprocation]</ref>). Participants also rated how confident they are that FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 11 their expectations are accurate by dragging a slider along a scale ranging from 0 (I am not confident at all) to 100 (I am extremely confident). Following this, participants in the face condition saw each face one more time and were asked to rate how trustworthy the person in the photo is.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of Study 2 shed more light on how facial trustworthiness and economic payoffs differently influence trust decisions.

Expectations influenced trust decisions when they were based on either payoffs or facial trustworthiness. Crucially, consistent with the intuitive accessibility account, participants relied more on their expectations when they were based on facial trustworthiness (even though Study 1 showed that facial trustworthiness is seen to be a less valid cue). We suggest that this is due to the fact that forming expectations based on easily accessible face judgments is less effortful than considering economic payoffs. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We also examined the possibility of a non-linear relationship between expectations and trust decisions by estimating regression models that included linear, quadratic, and cubic terms for the effect of expectations.

We examined how the presence of facial trustworthiness information affects reliance on economic payoff information (Study 3a). The intuitive accessibility account predicts that people will rely less on economic payoffs when they can also rely on facial trustworthiness, since it takes less effort to rely on the latter.

This setup also allowed us to address an alternative explanation for the discounting of economic information. It is plausible that any cue is discounted if another cue (that is seen as at least somewhat valid) is available as well. Based on this alternative explanation, one would also expect people to discount facial trustworthiness in the presence of economic payoff information.</p><p>After conducting these two initial studies, we ran a third pre-registered study that examined both reliance on temptation and facial trustworthiness in an integrated design (Study 3c).

We asked participants to reach each decision within five seconds. A timer counting backwards from five to zero was displayed on each decision page. Participants could still indicate a decision after the timer reached zero and the page only forwarded to the next trial once a decision was made. In the reflection condition (n = 398), participants were prompted to think carefully and make reflective decisions. Participants were informed that on each trial, they could only indicate a decision after ten seconds had passed. They were asked to take at least ten seconds to weigh all options and reflect on their decision. After they had made their decisions, participants were shown each face again and we asked them to rate how trustworthy they think the person in the photo is.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Results of Study 4 revealed that the influence of temptation, but not facial trustworthiness, on participants' trust decisions was reduced when participants made intuitive as opposed to reflective decisions. This finding is consistent with prior research suggesting that reliance on facial trustworthiness does not require cognitive reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnefon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">De Neys et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mieth, Bell, &amp; Buchner, 2016)</ref>. The results of the current study also shed light on the question of how the intuitive accessibility of face judgments causes their persistent effects on decision-making. Given enough time or motivation to reflect on their decisions, people might realize that relying on different information will lead to better decisions. However, it might also be the case that the effect of facial cues is more implicit: People could be unaware of how their decisions are influenced by intuitive face judgments, or they could be unable to suppress this influence (T. D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Wilson &amp; Brekke, 1994)</ref>. From this perspective, additional reflection would not necessarily undermine the effect of facial cues on decisions. The current results are in line with this latter view, as we did not find any evidence that the effect of facial trustworthiness is diminished when people made reflective as opposed to intuitive decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We asked whether reliance on facial trustworthiness in social decision-making can be explained by beliefs in the diagnosticity of the cue (i.e., by subjective cue weighing) or by the fact that the cue is intuitively accessible which makes it relatively effortless to rely on it (i.e., by intuitive accessibility). Across six studies, we systematically tested how much people rely on facial trustworthiness and economic payoff information (i.e., the trustee's temptation to betray trust)-a cue that is perceived to be more valid but takes more effort to process. Across our studies, we find consistent support for the intuitive accessibility account.</p><p>In Study 1, we found that economic payoff information is seen as a more valid cue than facial information. Study 2 showed there was a positive correlation between reliance on economic payoffs and decision time, while no such relationship was found for reliance on facial <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Excluding 15 participants (1.88%), who indicated not having made intuitive or reflective decisions on all trials did not change the pattern of results.</p><p>FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 24 trustworthiness. These findings replicated in Study 3a-c, with a substantially larger sample. To the extent that longer response times are an indicator for more effortful decision strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bettman et al., 1990)</ref>, these results suggest that it takes less cognitive effort to rely on facial trustworthiness rather than temptation. Thus, Study 1 identified economic payoff information as a cue that is seen as more valid, whereas Study 2 and Study 3a-c showed that economic payoff information is also more effortful to process than facial trustworthiness.</p><p>In Study 3a-c, we tested to what extent people rely on economic payoff information and facial trustworthiness when both cues are available simultaneously. Results showed that people rely less on a subjectively more valid cue (i.e., temptation) when facial trustworthiness is available as well. However, people do not rely less on facial trustworthiness when temptation is simultaneously manipulated. This pattern of results is in line with the argument that persistent reliance on facial trustworthiness is driven by the intuitive accessibility of the cue. If cognitive reflection is required for reliance on economic payoff information, but not for reliance on facial cues, then we would expect that restricting reflection during decision-making only decreases the influence of payoff information, but not the influence of facial cues. This prediction was explicitly tested in Study 4. This final study confirmed that payoff information had a diminished effect on trust when people made intuitive (vs. reflective) decisions. Taken together, our data suggest that the persistent reliance on facial trustworthiness can be better explained by the intuitively accessibility of the cue, which makes reliance on it relatively effortless, rather than by the belief that it is a particularly valid cue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision effort and trust</head><p>The present results converge with prior research on the processing of trait information from faces. A host of studies has demonstrated that trustworthiness impressions from faces are formed in a particularly efficient manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnefon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Klapper et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006)</ref>. We extend these findings by showing that reliance on economic payoff information requires more effort than reliance on facial cues. Similar results were observed when we manipulated how much people could reflect on their decisions. Intuitive decisions were less reliant on economic payoff information, but the manipulation of reflection time had no effect on reliance on facial cues. Our interpretation that reliance on facial trustworthiness is relatively effortless is also in line with studies showing that subjecting participants to a cognitive load FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 25 manipulation does not impair their use of facial cues when making trust decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bonnefon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">De Neys et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mieth et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In Study 2 and Study 3a-c, we measured response times as a proxy for the cognitive effort needed to make a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bettman et al., 1990)</ref>. Previous investigations in the domain of social decision-making have highlighted that other factors such as decision conflict can also drive response times <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Evans, Dillon, &amp; Rand, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Krajbich et al., 2015)</ref>. Perhaps, decisionmakers felt more conflicted when relying on temptation, which increased their decision times.</p><p>According to this view, we would also expect participants to be less confident when relying on temptation as decision conflict is associated with decreased confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Neys et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Zakay, 1985</ref>). Yet, across our studies, we found no evidence that participants reported lower levels of confidence in the presence of temptation as opposed to facial trustworthiness, suggesting that decision conflict was not driving our results.</p><p>Our results also fit within broader frameworks of how people decide whom to trust. With regard to the question which cues people rely on in trust situations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Evans and Krueger (2016)</ref> suggest in their model of bounded prospection that people approach trust decisions egocentrically: People focus on their potential costs and benefits while neglecting the probability that these outcomes will occur as assessing an interaction partner's trustworthiness requires perspective-taking and thus cognitive effort (S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lin, Keysar, &amp; Epley, 2010)</ref>. We go beyond contrasting cues pertaining to the self with cues pertaining to the situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Thielmann &amp; Hilbig, 2015)</ref> or the interaction partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Evans &amp; Krueger, 2011)</ref> and provide evidence for a more general claim that the extent to which people rely on information in trust decisions with multiple cues is determined by the ease with which the information is processed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>We provided evidence that the persistent reliance on facial trustworthiness can at least partly be explained by the intuitive accessibility of face judgments. We demonstrated this by showing that people favor relying on facial trustworthiness over temptation even though the latter is seen as a more valid cue. More specifically, we found that people did not rely less on facial trustworthiness when they could also rely on temptation. This finding stands in contrast to previous studies showing that people discount facial cues when other information is available <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Graham, Harvey, &amp; Puri, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Rezlescu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Yu, Saleem, &amp; Gonzalez, 2014)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">Rezlescu and colleagues (2012)</ref> showed that, the influence of facial trustworthiness on FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 26 trust decisions was reduced, but not eliminated, when information on a partner's past behavior was available. Maybe the subjective validity of temptation is still comparatively low and a stronger cue would have reduced or even eliminated reliance on facial cues in our studies.</p><p>Arguably, people may prioritize past behavior over facial trustworthiness because past behavior is both easy to process and subjectively valid. To date, there is relatively little work that examines how people prioritize different types of cues in dilemmas of trust; future studies need to test how reliance on facial trustworthiness changes in the presence of different cues that vary in both subjective validity and ease of accessibility.</p><p>In addition, more research is needed to understand how the efficient processing of faces influences cue selection and cue weighing. Following the fast accessibility of face judgments, do people ignore other cues altogether? Our results speak against such a strong version of onereason decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gigerenzer et al., 2008)</ref> as the effect of temptation was still apparent even when decision-makers could have relied solely on facial trustworthiness. Individual differences in rational versus heuristic processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Epstein, Pacini, Denes-Raj, &amp; Heier, 1996)</ref> or need for cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982)</ref> might help explain why some individuals reach a decision after face judgments are accessible whereas other consider additional cues. People who score higher on heuristic processing may rely more on facial trustworthiness even when other cues are available.</p><p>Alternatively, it could be the case that our participants did in fact consider all available cues but that the efficient processing of faces influenced how the cues were weighed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Shah (2007)</ref> has argued that efficiently processed cues are weighed more heavily. Since participants only read a description of the face cue and did not experience the efficient processing of it in Study 1, our measure of subjective cue validity might have underestimated how valid participants perceived the cue to be while making decisions. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dimov and Link (2017)</ref> showed that processing efficiency does not affect cue weights, but rather the order in which cues are considered. In the context of our study, it is thus conceivable that the discounting of temptation was due to a sequential process where fast facial trustworthiness judgments anchored participants' response and subsequent adjustment on the basis of temptation was insufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Tamir &amp; Mitchell, 2012)</ref>. This view holds that the primary processing of faces influences the weighing of subsequently processed cues. Future research could test whether a serial FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 27 presentation of cues, where participants first learn about temptation and then see the face of their interaction partner, eliminates the discounting of temptation in favor of facial trustworthiness. 7</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for debiasing interventions</head><p>The primary goal of our current investigation was to shed light on the process giving rise to the face bias. In addition, our findings may also be used to inform the design of interventions aimed at curbing the bias. One previously proposed recommendation is to inform decisionmakers about the poor accuracy of their impressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Porter et al., 2010)</ref>. Our results suggest that this approach might not be sufficient as the face bias does not stem from a conscious (albeit subjective) weighing of cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dawes et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">T. D. Wilson &amp; Brekke, 1994)</ref>. Another idea would be to increase the importance of the decision in order to motivate people to process the available information more deeply <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chaiken, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chaiken &amp; Maheswaran, 1994)</ref> or to reduce processing constraints (e.g., time pressure) or decision complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Payne et al., 1988)</ref>. Both approaches might lead to an attenuation of the face bias but we are skeptical that it will completely eliminate reliance on facial cues. Previous studies have shown that the influence of facial trustworthiness persists for extremely important decisions, such as legal sentencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blair, Judd, &amp; Fallman, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eberhardt, Davies, Purdie-Vaughns, &amp; Johnson, 2006</ref>; J. P. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Wilson &amp; Rule, 2015)</ref> or voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Olivola &amp; Todorov, 2010a)</ref>, as well as for relatively simple, self-paced decisions in the lab <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mieth et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Rezlescu et al., 2012)</ref>. As a further case in point, Study 4 showed that, while making people reflect on their decision increased their reliance on temptation, we found no evidence that it reduced the influence of facial trustworthiness.</p><p>Our findings suggest that interventions that disrupt the primary and efficient processing of faces might hold more potential for success. Inverting photos or misaligning its parts might disrupt the efficient processing of faces while still enabling the identification of an individual <ref type="bibr">7</ref> An anonymous reviewer raised the possibility that people might simply be reluctant to report that they see faces as valid cues. While more research is needed to measure how accurate people think their face judgments are, the available evidence suggests that people do think and report that faces contain information about a person's personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hassin &amp; Trope, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Suzuki et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, in a survey by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hassin and Trope (2000)</ref>, they found that 75% of respondents agreed that at least some traits can be read from a person's facial appearance.</p><p>FACIAL CUES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING 28 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bindemann, Burton, Hooge, Jenkins, &amp; de Haan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Todorov, Loehr, &amp; Oosterhof, 2010)</ref>, but requesting photos to be displayed upside-down in case files or on websites such as Airbnb is not realistic. However, in many situations, decision-makers could be asked to reach a decision in absence of facial cues first-ideally based on valid information. In the next step, a photo is displayed while the decision can still be revised. With this setup, initial decisions should be less biased. Any incorporation of face judgments into the decision-making process would now require a conscious revision of the decision, which is less likely if more diagnostic cues are also available. Future studies should test interventions targeting the efficient processing of faces and compare their effectiveness to simply teaching decision-makers about the biasing potential of faces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Despite their poor predictive validity, face judgments influence decisions ranging from the relatively trivial choice of which apartment to rent (which might determine the fate of the next vacation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ert et al., 2016)</ref>, to the selection of a CEO (which might determine the fate of a company; <ref type="bibr">Gomulya et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Graham, Harvey, &amp; Puri, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Stoker, Garretsen, &amp; Spreeuwers, 2016)</ref>, to the sentencing of a criminal (which might determine the fate of a human being; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Blair, Judd, &amp; Fallman, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eberhardt et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">J. P. Wilson &amp; Rule, 2015)</ref>. It may thus not be surprising that researchers have called for a more nuanced understanding of why people persistently rely on face judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Olivola et al., 2014)</ref>. We contribute to this debate by showing that peoples' reliance on face judgments is better explained by the intuitive accessibility of the cue, which make reliance on it relatively effortless, rather than by beliefs that facial cues are particularly valid. We recommend that future attempts at designing interventions focus on disrupting the primary and efficient processing of faces to attenuate the effects of face judgments on social decisions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The sequential trust game with exemplary payoffs.</figDesc></figure>
