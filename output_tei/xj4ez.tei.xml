			<abstract>
				<p>The development of formal models of decision making under risk has largely focused on monetary outcomes. Cumulative prospect theory (CPT), the most prominent model, describes monetary choices well but performs less well for nonmonetary, nonnumerical outcomes (e.g., medications with side effects). We suggest that affective processes, which are omitted in CPT, play a larger role in nonmonetary than in monetary choices, and propose two psychologically motivated modifications: (a) using affect ratings rather than monetary equivalents to represent the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes (affective valuation); and (b) allowing the probability weighting of an outcome to depend on the amount of affect triggered in a choice problem (affective probability weighting). In a model comparison involving four datasets (N = 240), we show that the modifications improve model performance relative to standard CPT for the nonmonetary, but not for the monetary choices. A complementary eye-tracking study on nonmonetary choice (N = 68) further supported the predictions of affective probability weighting: increasing risk aversion and decreasing attention to probabilities, as the affective value of the worst outcome in a choice problem increases. Our work integrates previous ideas on how affect modulates decision processes in naturalistic nonmonetary contexts and offers a refined framework for modeling such decisions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beyond Lotteries: Affect Guides and Modulates Nonmonetary Risky Choice</head><p>The consequences of many everyday decisions cannot be predicted with certainty.</p><p>People deciding whether to get vaccinated, buy travel insurance, or gamble on a sporting event may be aware of the possible outcomes and have information (or a hunch) about the probability of those outcomes, but they can never be sure which outcome will actually ensue. Empirical research on such decision making under risk has focused primarily on a specific type of stimuli: monetary lotteries. In these tasks, both the possible outcomes (monetary gains or losses) and the probability of each outcome are stated-for instance, a lottery ticket might offer a 0.01% chance of winning $1,000, and a 99.99% chance of winning nothing. Observations of how people make decisions about monetary lotteries motivated the development of expected utility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bernoulli, 1954)</ref>. After being axiomatized by von <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Neumann and Morgenstern (1944)</ref>, expected utility theory was widely applied to analyze and model decision making under risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Edwards, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Schoemaker, 1982</ref>).</p><p>Yet empirical studies of risky decisions showed that people's choices often deviate from the predictions of expected utility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allais, 1953)</ref>. This motivated the development of alternative models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Wu et al., 2004</ref>, for an overview), the most prominent of which is arguably (cumulative) prospect theory (CPT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>. CPT introduced theoretical assumptions such as nonlinear probability weighting, gain-loss separability, and loss aversion, which enabled it to account for a range of regularities observed in decision making under risk, including the certainty effect, the reflection effect, and the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Wu et al., 2004)</ref>. Crucially, almost all of the behavioral regularities that motivated the development of CPT were identified when studying risky decisions in the context of monetary lotteries.</p><p>Consistent with the type of stimuli that served as the basis for its development,</p><p>CPT is widely used to describe people's preferences in contexts with monetary outcomes, such as finance, insurance, or racetrack betting (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Camerer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Weber &amp; Johnson, 2009)</ref>. However, it is also used to describe risky choices with nonmonetary outcomes-for BEYOND LOTTERIES 4 instance, the area of forest saved under different wildfire protection programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bartczak et al., 2015)</ref>, travel times for different modes of transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ghader et al., 2019)</ref>, the area of ocean cleaned by different methods after an oil spill <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Riddel, 2012)</ref>, or even choices between electric shocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Berns et al., 2007)</ref>. CPT is particularly popular in the medical context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fuławka et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Rasiel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Schwartz et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Verma et al., 2014</ref> Applying CPT to nonmonetary choices assumes that it adequately describes risky decision making not only in the monetary context in which it was developed, but more generally. As we will show, however, there are indications that this is not the case, and that CPT's ability to account for people's preferences is considerably poorer in nonmonetary than in monetary choices. One possible reason is that people might process and evaluate outcomes and probabilities differently in the two contexts. Indeed, there is evidence that neural activity and patterns of predecisional information search differ qualitatively across monetary and nonmonetary contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lejarraga et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pachur et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Suter et al., 2015)</ref>, potentially also because nonmonetary outcomes often trigger higher amounts of affect than abstract, monetary outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Loewenstein, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Suter et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">but see McGraw et al., 2010)</ref>. Further, in nonmonetary choices outcomes are often not explicitly numeric, which might impact their evaluability and lead to a different basis for valuation than for monetary outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">McGraw et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, when the outcomes of options are nonmonetary, they may not be directly commensurable (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Walasek &amp; Brown, 2023)</ref>. For instance, how does someone weighing the risks of side effects trade off a possible headache against possible insomnia? Such <ref type="bibr">1</ref> For research in which risky choices between nonmonetary outcomes but where the choices are not modeled with CPT, see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Siegel (1956)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hurst and Siegel (1956)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Levy and Glimcher (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Seaman et al. (2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Martin et al. (2016)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Attema et al. (2018)</ref>. These studies have examined choices between risky options with outcomes such as books, cigarettes, M&amp;Ms, milliliters of water, minutes spent with a social partner, milligrams of medication, desserts, TV programs, and months of extended lifespan.</p><p>incommensurability of outcomes may influence the decision making process.</p><p>Our goal in this article is to flesh out psychological differences between monetary and nonmonetary choice and to elaborate on the implications of those differences for modeling decision making under risk in the context of nonmonetary outcomes. To that end, we examine the possibility that some implicit assumptions made when applying CPT to model risky choices-for example, that probability weighting depends only on the rank of the respective outcome among other outcomes, or that the subjective value of an outcome is well represented by its subjective monetary equivalent-fail to adequately capture nonmonetary choice. We propose psychologically motivated modifications to how</p><p>CPT is used to model people's choices and show, in a re-analysis of published datasets comparing monetary and nonmonetary choice, that these modifications help account for nonmonetary choice (but receive no support in monetary choice). A key tenet of our proposed modifications is that the affective response triggered by the nonmonetary outcomes guides and modulates the process of evaluating the options (importantly, note that this does not imply that nonmonetary outcomes necessarily trigger stronger affective responses than monetary outcomes, although they often do; e.g., <ref type="bibr">Frank &amp; Pachur, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pachur et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Popovic et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Suter et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">but see McGraw et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In a process-tracing study, we provide evidence that-as predicted by one of the modifications-affect influences the level of risk aversion and the allocation of attention to risk information in nonmonetary choice. Overall, we demonstrate that a key feature of nonmonetary choice is that more pronounced affect leads to more risk aversion (for loss outcomes) and lower sensitivity for probability information.</p><p>Our proposed modeling approach contributes to the long-standing discussion on how to directly integrate affective processes within descriptive formal models of decision making under risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Charpentier et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hsee &amp; Rottenstreich, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Loewenstein et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mellers et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mukherjee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Reid &amp; González-Vallejo, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rottenstreich &amp; Hsee, 2001</ref>). Further, our approach complements other work on risky decision making involving qualitative (rather than quantitative) outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Doyle &amp; Thomason, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Korem et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Staunton et al., 2019)</ref>, which has focused mainly on estimating the utilities of qualitative outcomes, but has not considered specificities in the processing of risk information.</p><p>Given the large number of formal models that have been proposed for decisions under risk (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">He et al., 2022)</ref>, one might ask why we do not abandon CPT altogether for nonmonetary choice and consider alternative models that may achieve a better fit in this context. Some models may indeed capture nonmonetary choice better than CPT (in its original form). However, in our view, there are good reasons for analyzing nonmonetary choice within the general framework of CPT. First, doing so allows us to directly integrate previous suggestions on how aspects of risky choice might differ when outcomes are nonmonetary rather than monetary-which have been cast in the conceptual language of CPT (e.g., probability weighting, outcome sensitivity; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rottenstreich &amp; Hsee, 2001)</ref>. Second, in light of analyses that have demonstrated a link between CPT's conceptual constructs and information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hirmas et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pachur et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Zilker &amp; Pachur, 2023)</ref>, we can derive predictions for process-tracing measures, such as attention allocation. Finally, using CPT as a computational framework retains a degree of generality, as CPT can represent the choice behavior of other strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Pachur et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Zilker &amp; Pachur, 2022)</ref>. We return to this issue in the General Discussion.</p><p>The article is organized as follows. We begin by describing CPT and how it is typically applied to model nonmonetary choice. Next, we review previous applications of CPT to model nonmonetary choice and summarize conclusions of these applications as to whether and how nonmonetary differs from monetary choice. We then provide theoretical and empirical motivations for modifying two common assumptions of CPT when applied to nonmonetary choice; specifically, we propose that instead of monetary equivalents measures of valuation-by-feeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hsee &amp; Rottenstreich, 2004)</ref>, such as affect ratings, be used to represent the subjective value of monetary outcomes (affective valuation), and that the decision weight attached to an outcome be allowed to depend on the amount of affect triggered by the choice (affective probability weighting). To test these modifications, we conduct computational modeling analyses on four published empirical datasets (with a total of 16,160 choices). The results of a model comparison show that models equipped with the proposed modifications outperform the standard implementation of CPT in the nonmonetary, but not in the monetary context, especially when outcomes are negative.</p><p>Finally, in an empirical study with eye tracking, we test key predictions on behavioral and cognitive processing that derive from the notion of affective probability weighting-namely that in nonmonetary choices people's willingness to choose a risky option depends on the amount of affect triggered; and that sensitivity to probability information is lower for choice problems that trigger higher affect. The results demonstrate-for the first time and consistent with the notion of affective probability weighting-that across-trial variability in the amount of attention individuals pay to probability information is associated with across-trial variability in affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cumulative Prospect Theory</head><p>Here we describe a simplified version of CPT that applies to choices between risky options with only negative or only positive outcomes (i.e., no mixed lotteries). 2 Consider a risky option A with N outcomes x 1 , ..., x N (negative or positive) and corresponding probabilities p 1 , ..., p N . According to CPT, the overall subjective valuation of option A, denoted as V (A), is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V (A) = N i=1 v(x i )π(p i ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where v() represents the subjective value of an outcome determined by a value function and π() is a decision weight, determined by a probability weighting function.</p><p>In the context of monetary choices, the input x to the value function is a monetary </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v(x) = sgn(x) × |x| α ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where sgn(x) is sign function. The parameter α ∈ [0, 1] captures sensitivity to differences in outcomes (i.e., outcome sensitivity). Higher values of α indicate higher outcome sensitivity ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref>). Equation 2 also applies when the outcome is nonmonetary. If the nonmonetary outcome is numerical (e.g., waiting time in minutes), the numerical value may be used as input (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdellaoui &amp; Kemel, 2014)</ref>. If it is nonnumerical, a common approach is to obtain a monetary equivalent (i.e., willingness to pay; WTP) for the outcome and enter that in the value function (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Suter et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">von Helversen et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The decision weight π(p i ) for outcome x i is a function of the difference between the cumulative probability of obtaining a negative (positive) outcome that is at least as bad (good) as x and the cumulative probability of obtaining an outcome that is strictly worse (better) than x. Thus, the decision weight is rank-dependent. The decision weights for outcomes ranked |x 1 | &gt; ... &gt; |x N | &gt; 0 are determined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">π(p 1 ) = w(p 1 ), π(p i ) = w( i j=1 p j ) − w( i−1 j=1 p j ), 2 ≤ i ≤ N.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The function w() is a probability weighting function. Here, we rely on a two-parameter form of the function that was originally proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Goldstein and Einhorn (1987)</ref>; it separates the function's curvature and elevation (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gonzalez &amp; Wu, 1999)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">w(p) = δp γ δp γ + (1 − p) γ .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The parameter γ ∈ [0, 1] controls the curvature of the probability weighting function and captures the decision maker's sensitivity to probability differences, with higher values indicating higher probability sensitivity ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref>). The parameter δ &gt; 0 controls the function's elevation, with higher values resulting in more elevated functions and thus a more pronounced overweighting of probabilities relative to the objective probabilities ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref>). The elevation is often interpreted as indicating the decision maker's pessimism (optimism) for losses (gains) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wakker, 2001)</ref>. When fitted to empirical data, the probability weighting function often takes on an inverse S-shape (as in <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref>), indicating lower probability sensitivity in the mid-range of the probability scale, as well as overweighting of small and underweighting of large probabilities.</p><p>Finally, in binary choices, the subjective valuations of the two options A and B are entered into a stochastic choice rule to derive a predicted probability of choosing A over B.</p><p>We use a logistic choice rule (also known as softmax):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P (A|{A, B}) = 1 1 + exp(−ϕ[V (A) − V (B)]) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where ϕ ≥ 0 is a choice sensitivity parameter that determines how the difference between the subjective valuations is mapped onto the probability of choosing option A. With ϕ = 0 the choice is random (i.e., P (A|{A, B}) = 0.5). The higher ϕ, the more deterministic is the choice of the option with the higher valuation.</p><p>It should be noted that CPT is mute with regard to the cognitive processing that gives rise to differences in the value function and probability weighting function (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Tiede et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Zilker &amp; Pachur, 2023)</ref>. However, several analyses have elaborated how CPT reflects differences in the amount of attention given to outcome and probability information. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pachur et al. (2018)</ref> showed that a more strongly curved probability weighting function was associated with less attention paid to probability information, and that a more strongly curved value function was associated with less attention paid to outcome information (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Pachur et al., 2017)</ref>. Importantly, this means that a strongly curved probability weighting function, implying an "overweighting" of small-probability events, does not mean that the probabilities are psychologically overweighted. Instead, it might primarily indicate that probability information did not play much of a role in the decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applications of (Cumulative) Prospect Theory to Nonmonetary Choice</head><p>We next review studies that have used CPT to analyze risky choices with nonmonetary outcomes. Our overview illustrates the range of nonmonetary domains in which CPT has been applied. We also summarize conclusions that have emerged on whether and how nonmonetary choice differs from monetary choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domains in Which Nonmonetary Choice Has Been Investigated With CPT</head><p>Human Health, Life, and Lifetime. CPT is frequently applied to model nonmonetary choice in the medical domain. In Van Houtven et al. (2011), for instance, patients with Crohn's disease were asked to choose between treatment options that were described in terms of four possible benefits (e.g., improvement in symptoms, time between flare-ups) and the 10-year mortality risks for three possible side effects (e.g., serious infection, lymphoma); the probability of the side effects was either 0.5%, 2%, or 5%. When the authors used CPT to model participants' choices (using a conjoint measurement approach to quantify the utility of the outcomes), they found a considerably lower probability sensitivity than what tends to emerge in the monetary domain (they did not collect monetary choices themselves). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bleichrodt and Pinto (2000)</ref> also studied preferences between medical treatments, but here the treatments differed in terms of the number of years of remaining life in good health. For instance, participants indicated whether they would prefer a treatment that would give them a 50% chance of living for another 55 years and a 50% chance of living for another 5 years, or a treatment that would give them a 50% chance of living for another 45 years and a 50% chance of living for another 6 years. The authors did not themselves collect monetary choices, but concluded that the obtained probability weighting function was more elevated than is typically found in the monetary domain. Similarly, a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Attema et al. (2013)</ref> involved choices between medications that could increase the remaining lifetime (relative to a reference value of 30 years). For instance, a safe option could increase lifetime by 10 years; a risky option had a 50% chance of increasing lifetime by 20 years and a 50% chance of no increase. The authors found loss aversion (which they concluded was lower than is usually reported for monetary choices) and probability weighting that deviated from a linear treatment of probability.</p><p>Kemel and Paraschiv (2018) studied preferences for options involving human life in a public policy context. Participants played the role of a decision maker choosing between policy measures. For instance, Project A would save 25 lives for sure, whereas Project B had a 50% chance of saving 50 lives and a 50% chance of saving no lives. These authors also collected choices between monetary options, where each human life was replaced by an amount of e1 million-the official value of a statistical human life in France (where the study was conducted). When participants' choices were modeled with CPT, the probability weighting function was less elevated and loss aversion was higher in the nonmonetary than in the monetary choices.</p><p>Physical Harm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Berns et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Berns et al. (2008)</ref> investigated choices between options involving electric shocks of differing intensities. For instance, participants chose between a 1/6 chance of getting shocked at 90% of their maximum tolerable voltage and a 1/3 chance of getting shocked at 60% of that level. The authors did not collect monetary choices, but modeling the nonmonetary choices with CPT (using the voltage administered to quantify the outcomes) indicated probability sensitivity levels that were similar to those typically observed for monetary choices.</p><p>Time. Some studies have used CPT to investigate risk preferences for time spent waiting. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdellaoui and Kemel (2014)</ref>, participants were invited to an experiment that they were told consisted of two one-hour sessions. In the first session, they made choices where the outcomes consisted of amounts of time by which the second session would be shorter. If they won, the second session would be shortened by the respective amount of time (up to one hour); if they lost, they would have to stay for the entire session. For instance, they might choose between Option A offering 15 minutes for sure and Option B offering a 50% chance of 30 minutes (otherwise nothing). The authors also collected choices for monetary lotteries, where the outcomes of the time lotteries (ranging from 15 to 60 minutes) were replaced with monetary amounts that "were found to be of interest to the subjects" (p. 1848). The outcomes ranged between e300 and e1,200. CPT applied to the choices indicated a higher elevation of the probability weighting function, higher outcome sensitivity, and lower loss aversion for the nonmonetary than for the monetary choices.</p><p>Environmental Damage. Finally, CPT has been applied in contexts where the options have environmental consequences. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bartczak et al. (2015)</ref> asked Polish participants to choose between programs to reduce the risk of forest wildfires. The programs' outcomes were described in terms of the average annual reduction in the area burned. For instance, Program A would lead to a reduction of 100 ha with a probability of 30% and a reduction of 25 ha with a probability of 70%; Program B would lead to a reduction of 312.5 ha with a probability of 10% and a reduction of 12.5 ha with a probability of 90%. The authors also collected monetary choices, where the outcomes of the options were between 10 and 400 Polish złoty (100 złoty equaling around e25 at the time of the study). When the choices were modeled with CPT (using the respective area sizes to quantify the outcomes), outcome sensitivity and loss aversion did not differ between the nonmonetary and monetary choices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Riddel (2012)</ref>  </p></div>

In addition, outcome sensitivity was higher (indexed by a less strongly curved value function) for the nonmonetary choices ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2c</ref>). These patterns also held when an individual's monetary equivalent was presented on the screen next to each side effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Suter et al., 2016</ref>), suggesting that the difference in the parameters cannot solely be attributed to a format effect. In addition, the probability weighting differed between nonmonetary and monetary choice irrespective of whether the probabilities were learned experientially or via description <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lejarraga et al., 2016)</ref>.

We then describe variants of CPT that include either or both of these modifications, testing their relative merits in accounting for nonmonetary risky choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affective Valuation</head><p>Although there is no a priori reason to expect that the willingness-to-pay approach described in the previous section is necessarily the most appropriate approach, measuring and representing the subjective value of any kind of outcome in terms of obtained monetary equivalents (or willingness-to-pay responses) is the standard approach in behavioral economics (and a key element of the contingent valuation approach; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carson, 2012</ref>). However, the risk-as-feelings framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Loewenstein et al., 2001</ref>) emphasizes the important role that immediate emotional responses to outcomes play in driving behavior, sometimes outweighing deliberate thought processes-especially when affective reactions are strong and cognitive and affective evaluations diverge. In the terminology of <ref type="bibr">Hsee and Rottenstreich (2004, p. 23)</ref>, choices might then rely more on "valuation by feeling" than on "valuation by calculation" (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kahneman et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Against this background, a more appropriate approach for representing a nonmonetary outcome numerically when modeling nonmonetary choice might therefore be to use a quantitative measure of valuation by feeling (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Reid &amp; González-Vallejo, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>A considerable literature has aimed to capture people's emotional responses to options in monetary choices and shown that emotions such as regret and disappointment sometimes influence their choices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mellers &amp; McGraw, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mellers et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mellers et al., , 1999</ref> In light of these findings, the first modification we propose is to use measures of feeling-based valuation (e.g., affect ratings; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hsee &amp; Rottenstreich, 2004)</ref> of nonmonetary outcomes rather than monetary equivalents when modeling nonmonetary choice with CPT.</p><p>For example, consider the case of choosing between medications where one medication may cause insomnia as a side effect. An affect rating can be obtained by asking: "On a scale from 1 (= not at all) to 10 (= extremely), how upset would you be if you experienced insomnia as a side effect of a medication?" Such rating scales are widely used in the affective sciences-for instance, to measure affective responses to words (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bradley &amp; Lang, 1999)</ref> or pictures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Marchewka et al., 2014)</ref>, or to assess a person's overall affective state (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Watson et al., 1988)</ref>. Affect ratings of words correlate with activation in the amygdala-a key brain area involved in the processing of emotional stimuli-during reading, suggesting that this measure can capture spontaneous affective reactions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Citron, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Straube et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Formally, according to our first modification, the subjective value of a nonmonetary outcome x (e.g., a side effect) is quantified by using the decision maker's affect rating for that outcome, denoted a x :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">v(x) = a x .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Unlike the standard value function of CPT (Equation 2), the modified value function does not include an adjustable parameter that indexes outcome sensitivity. This is because the affect rating already provides a measure of the subjective representation of the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affective Probability Weighting</head><p>In the formal specification of a probability weighting function proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Tversky and Kahneman (1992)</ref>, the shape of the function for a given decision maker is assumed to remain constant across trials (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gonzalez &amp; Wu, 1999)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001)</ref> obtained evidence that probability weighting can be influenced by the amount of affect triggered by an outcome. In their experiments, people's risky choices suggested that they were less sensitive to differences in probabilities when the outcome was relatively affect-rich (e.g., an electric shock) than when it was relatively affect-poor (e.g., losing $5).</p><p>Subsequent studies on affect-rich choice-which, in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001)</ref>, actually estimated a probability weighting function for the data-have consistently found an influence of affect on the shape of the probability weighting function. Specifically, in almost all of these studies (which involved negative outcomes), the probability weighting function was more strongly curved (indicating lower probability sensitivity) and more elevated for nonmonetary than for monetary choice <ref type="bibr">(Frank &amp; Pachur, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lejarraga et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pachur et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Pachur et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Suter et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Suter et al., , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">von Helversen et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Although few studies have investigated nonmonetary choices with positive outcomes, there is also some evidence that affect influences probability weighting in these problems: Pachur et al. <ref type="formula">2014</ref>found a more elevated probability weighting function than for monetary choices, but no differences with respect to probability sensitivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Petrova et al. (2014)</ref> found a slightly higher elevation and lower probability sensitivity in an insurance pricing task for a camera that was a gift from a grandparent (i.e., a relatively affect-rich outcome)</p><p>than for a camera ordered from a website (i.e., a relatively affect-poor outcome).</p><p>Despite the accumulating evidence that affect influences probability weighting, how to formalize the influence of the affective content of outcomes on risky choice remains unresolved. Most analyses have distinguished between affect-rich and affect-poor problems and simply estimated a separate probability weighting function for each-thus not directly incorporating measures of affect in parameter estimation. However, the influence of affect may be gradual: Even among problems with affect-rich outcomes, the amount of affect varies, and this variability may be linked to differences in probability weighting. It may thus be important to take trial-level factors into account. Failure to account for such continuous variation in affect is another possible reason for CPT's poorer fit in nonmonetary than monetary choice.</p><p>As a second modification, we therefore propose a probability weighting function that depends on the amount of affect triggered by the outcome with the strongest affective response in a given choice problem (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Martin et al., 2016)</ref>. Our approach thus allows for a problem-specific and continuous influence of affect on probability weighting. The modification involves both the curvature and the elevation of the probability weighting function.</p><p>Formally, in a choice problem i in which the maximum absolute affect is a max i , the affective curvature γ a i of the probability weighting function is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">γ a i = γ a max i A ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where γ is a baseline curvature level and A is a scaling factor that equals the maximum absolute possible value on the affect rating scale (i.e., A = 10 for both positive 1-10 and negative (-1)-(-10) rating scales). The normalization of the exponent of Equation 7 ensures that it takes on values between 0 and 1; for all combinations of the baseline level γ and the affect rating a i , the resulting parameter γ a will thus be in the range from 0 to 1. Importantly, with a given value of γ, the affective probability sensitivity decreases continuously as the value of the maximum affect a max i increases. For similar suggestions that extreme outcomes commonly serve as reference values see <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Martin et al. (2016)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure   3a</ref> shows how γ a changes for different levels of the maximum affect, separately for different levels of γ. The affective elevation δ a i of the modified probability weighting function is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">δ a i = δ × a max i A ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where δ is the baseline level of the function's elevation. The affective elevation parameter δ a i thus also directly depends on the maximum absolute affect a max i in a given choice problem i. For any given value of baseline δ, the higher the maximum affect ratings a max , the higher the affective elevation δ a . <ref type="figure">Figure 3b</ref> shows how δ a changes for different levels of the maximum affect, separately for different levels of δ.</p><p>To obtain the affective probability weighting function w a i (p) for a given choice problem i, the γ and δ parameters in Equation 4 are substituted with γ a i and δ a i , respectively: alternative probability weighting functions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Prelec, 1998)</ref> and options with multiple nonzero outcomes, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fuławka and Pachur (2022)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">w a i (p) = δ a i p γ a i δ a i p γ a i + (1 − p) γ a i .<label>(9)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of the Proposed Modifications</head><p>We have proposed two modifications to how CPT is commonly applied to model nonmonetary choice, both of which assign affect an important role in the evaluation of risky options (which, however, does not mean that affective responses are necessarily more pronounced for nonmonetary than for monetary outcomes). First, we proposed that measures of valuation by feeling, such as affect ratings, may be more appropriate than monetary equivalents for estimating the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes (which guides choice; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hsee &amp; Rottenstreich, 2004)</ref>. Second, based on empirical evidence that probability weighting is influenced by affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Rottenstreich &amp; Hsee, 2001)</ref>, we introduced an affective probability weighting function. Our proposal implies that the shape of this function depends on the maximum amount of affect triggered in a given choice problem.</p><p>As the amount of affect increases, probability sensitivity decreases and pessimism (for loss outcomes) increases. Unlike conventional conceptions of probability weighting, our affective probability weighting function is thus context-dependent and predicts that probability weighting can vary dynamically across trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Comparison</head><p>To test the proposed modifications, we specified three model variants that differ in terms of the modifications included. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref> gives an overview of the models. In the affective valuation (AV) model, CPT's standard value function is replaced by an affect rating. In the affective probability weighting (APW) model, CPT's standard probability weighting function is replaced by the affective probability weighting function, the shape of which is influenced by the maximum affect in a given choice problem. The AV-APW model combines the two models, implementing both modifications.  We conducted a model comparison using several empirical datasets, with the standard version of CPT serving as the benchmark model. While our primary focus was on the model variants' performance in nonmonetary choice, we also tested them in monetary choice. This allowed us to determine whether the modifications specifically help to predict nonmonetary choices, or whether they also improve accounting for monetary choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Datasets</head><p>We tested the model variants on four datasets in which economically and structurally matched choice problems were used to contrast nonmonetary and monetary risky choice. From the datasets in <ref type="figure">Figure 2d</ref>, we considered those of Suter et al. <ref type="formula">2016</ref> gains. In all datasets, each risky option included a single nonzero outcome (e.g., medications had one side effect with some probability, and no side effect otherwise).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Estimation, Performance, and Comparison</head><p>All models were implemented using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, allowing for simultaneous estimation of individual-and group-level parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Nilsson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Scheibehenne &amp; Pachur, 2015</ref> and a successful parameter recovery analysis for the best-performing model AV-APW.</p><p>We used approximate leave-one-out cross-validation implemented in the R package loo <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Vehtari et al., 2020)</ref> as a measure of predictive model performance; note that this measure takes differences in model complexity (e.g., number of free parameters) into account. For each model, we computed approximate leave-one-out expected log pointwise density (eldp loo ) and corresponding standard errors. Higher values of elpd loo indicate a better balance between model fit and model complexity. The elpd loo represents the sum of the (log-transformed) predicted probabilities of the observed events (e.g., choices of an option). To assess the reliability of the differences in model performance, we determined for each pair of models the differences in elpd loo estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Vehtari et al., 2017)</ref> and constructed 95% confidence intervals (CI 95% ) for these differences; if the CI 95% excluded zero, we concluded that the performance of the two models differed. Interpreting absolute elpd loo values is difficult because the statistic is on the log scale and depends on the number of observations. As a more directly interpretable measure of model performance, we also calculated an individual estimate of the out-of-sample proportion of correctly predicted choices, which we denote as accuracy loo . If accuracy loo = 0.5, the model correctly predicts, on average, 50% of the choices; in the context of binary choice problems, this indicates that the model is no better than chance. If accuracy loo = 1, the model predicts all choices perfectly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In the following sections, we report the models' performance in the context of nonmonetary and then monetary choice. By comparing the two, we can evaluate whether the modifications proposed are indeed specifically relevant for the nonmonetary context. Parameter estimates for all model variants are provided in the Online Supplement. Next, we discuss the modifications individually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonmonetary Choice</head><p>The AV model implements the first modification: using affect ratings of nonmonetary outcomes rather than monetary equivalents. As can be seen in the bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4</ref> In the second modification, the probability weighting of an outcome depends on the maximum affect triggered in a given choice problem (Equations 7-9). The APW model, which implements this modification, outperformed the standard version of CPT in both datasets with negative nonmonetary outcomes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4B</ref> To what extent did each modification make a unique contribution to predicting people's choices? To address this question, we compared the performance of the AV and APW models against that of the AV-APW model, which includes both modifications. As the bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4</ref> show, the AV-APW model outperformed both variants in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Pachur et al. (2017)</ref> dataset. It also outperformed the AV model in both the Suter et al. (2016, Condition A) dataset and the <ref type="bibr">Suter et al. (2016, Condition B)</ref> dataset. In the <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pachur et al. (2014)</ref> dataset, the AV-APW model only outperformed the APW model; its performance was similar to that of the AV model.</p><p>The results of the model comparison in the nonmonetary context thus provide support for both modifications, and indicate that affective valuation and affective probability weighting are particularly important in the context of negative outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monetary Choice</head><p>Do the proposed modifications play a lesser role (or none at all) in monetary choice?</p><p>We addressed this question by applying the model variants to the monetary choices collected in each of the datasets. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 5</ref>. Consistently across all datasets, the standard version of CPT outperformed all model variants (see bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 5</ref>). This means that the proposed modifications did not improve model performance in the context of monetary choice-and that the need for the modifications might indeed, as we argued, be specific to nonmonetary choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral and Cognitive Processing Evidence for Affective Probability</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Weighting</head><p>The results of the model comparison analyses support the idea that affect guides and modulates preference in nonmonetary choice, especially when negative outcomes are involved. While the notion of affective valuation seems relatively straightforward, the notion of affective probability weighting as implemented here may raise more questions.</p><p>After all, it makes several rather strong predictions. To formalize affective probability weighting, we proposed a specific functional form (i.e., Equations 7-9), in which affect influences both the curvature and the elevation of the probability weighting function. A first prediction following from our proposition is affect-modulated probability weighting:</p><p>when comparing probability weighting (using the standard probability weighting function;</p><p>Equation 4) between sets of (nonmonetary) choice problems with different amounts of maximum affect, there should be systematic differences in probability weighting patterns.</p><p>A second prediction is affect-modulated risk aversion: the degree of risk aversion differs depends on the amount of affect triggered by a choice problem. Specifically, choices should be more risk averse in high-than in low-affect choice problems. Consider a choice between two equally effective drugs that can lead to relatively mild (i.e., affect-poor) side effects:</p><p>Drug A: {Cough with 1%} v. Drug B: {Fever with 0.01%}, where fever is assumed to trigger a higher affective response than cough. Affective probability weighting predicts a close-to-linear impact of probabilities on choices (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), resulting in a preference for the drug with the less probable but worse side effect-that is, Drug B. Now consider a choice between drugs with relatively severe (i.e., affect-rich) side effects:</p><p>Drug C: {Insomnia with 1%} v. Drug D: {Blood clots with 0.01%}, where the affective response to blood clots is assumed to differ from that to insomnia in approximately the same way as the affective response to fever differs from that to cough.</p><p>Given the relatively high amount of maximum affect in this choice problem, affective probability weighting predicts that the probabilities are highly distorted, making the decision weights hardly distinguishable. Consequently, there is a preference for the drug with the less severe side effect-that is, Drug C. Thus, the higher the amount of affect triggered by the worst outcome in a choice problem, the more risk averse people should be.</p><p>Third, the assumption that probability sensitivity decreases as the maximum affect in a choice problem increases also has implications for how information is processed.</p><p>Although CPT is mute with regard to the underlying information processing, several analyses have shown that the curvature of the probability weighting function reflects the amount of attention to probability information. As mentioned above, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pachur et al. (2018)</ref> found in a process-tracing study that participants with a more strongly curved probability weighting function (as estimated from their choices) paid less attention to probabilities than those with a less strongly curved probability weighting function (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Pachur et al., 2017)</ref>. In light of this relationship between probability sensitivity and attention to probability information, our final prediction based on affective probability weighting is affect-modulated probability attention. Specifically, the amount of attention to paid probabilities should diminish as the maximum affect in a choice problem increases.</p><p>We tested these three predictions of affective probability weighting in an eye-tracking experiment in which participants chose between risky options with nonmonetary outcomes. In keeping with previous studies on nonmonetary choice, the options consisted of medications with some probability of side effects. Our study had two key design features. First, there were two within-subject conditions: the outcomes were designed to be either affect-poor or affect-rich. For each participant, side effects were assigned to one of the two conditions based on their individual ratings in an initial affect rating task. Second, we used eye tracking to measure how participants allocated their attention to outcome and probability information. This allowed us to investigate the relationship between attention to probabilities and affect. <ref type="bibr">Additionally, results by McGraw et al. (2010)</ref> indicate that differences in probability processing between monetary and nonmonetary options are due to fundamental differences in options' evaluations, and not necessarily to differences in affect. To our best knowledge, our study is one of the first to test the influence of affect on probability weighting purely within the nonmonetary domain (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Suter et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In the following, we briefly describe the method and materials used in the experiment; a more detailed account is provided in the Online Supplement. The study design and reported analyzes were preregistered: https://aspredicted.org/kkvx-cgsw.pdf.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We collected complete behavioral and eye-tracking data from 68 German-speaking participants (31 women and 37 men; M age = 25.19 years, SD age = 3.83). The sample size was chosen based on studies employing similar methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pachur et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Suter et al., 2016)</ref>. Participants were remunerated with €17 each. The experiment was conducted in the lab of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, and approved by the institute's ethics committee. The experiment consisted of two main tasks: (1) an affect rating task and (2) a choice task. In the affect rating task, participants used a slider to indicate the amount of (negative) affect triggered by each of 46 side effects on a 1-100 scale <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 6a</ref>; a higher value indicated stronger negative affect). The affect rating task was administered twice, once before and once after the choice task. For all analyses, we computed each participant's affect rating of each side effect as the average of the two measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect rating task</head><p>How much would you be upset by this side effect?   In each trial of the choice task, participants were asked to choose between two medical drugs, each of which had a stated probability of causing a specific side effect. To avoid trivial choice problems, one drug was always riskier than the other (safe drug); specifically, the risky drug had a more severe but less probable side effect than the safe drug. The choice task had two within-subjects conditions. The affect-rich condition involved the 17 side effects for which the participant had given the highest ratings in the initial affect rating task; the affect-poor condition involved the 17 side effects with the lowest ratings <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 6b)</ref>. The choice problems in the two conditions were pairwise matched, that is, each problem in the affect-poor condition had a corresponding problem in the affect-rich condition. Within each matched problem pair, the probabilities of side effects and the ordinal difference between side effects-that is, the difference in rank order based on the individual affect ratings-were the same; only the side effects differed (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 6c</ref> for an example, and the Online Supplement for more details). Overall, participants made 65 self-paced choices in both the affect-rich and the affect-poor condition (130 choices in total, including 10 attention check trials). The order of the affect-rich and affect-poor conditions was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>During the choice task, binocular eye movements were recorded using a Tobii Eye</p><p>Tracker 4C with a sampling rate of 90Hz. As preregistered, we used the proportional dwell time on probabilities to measure the trial-level amount of attention to probabilities.</p><p>Specifically, this metric was defined as the total duration of looking at all probabilities in a given trial divided by the total duration of looking at all outcomes and probabilities in the choice problem. Details on the eye-tracking setup and fixation detection from the raw gaze data are provided in the Online Supplement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We started by pitting the AV model and the AV-APW model against each other to see whether-as in the analyses of the previously published datasets-affective probability weighting contributed uniquely to improved model performance in the dataset. For the AV-APW model a single affective probability weighting function was estimated across both the affect-rich and the affect-poor conditions. Next, we tested the three predictions derived at the beginning of this section. First, to test the prediction on affect-modulated probability weighting, we compared within each participant the probability weighting patterns in the affect-rich and affect-poor conditions. To this end, we used a variant of the AV-APW model to estimate two separate probability weighting functions for each participant, one for the affect-poor and one for the affect-rich condition. We refer to this model as AV-2PWF. Second, we compared the degree of risk aversion between the affect-rich and affect-poor conditions to test the prediction of affect-modulated risk aversion. Third, we used the eye-tracking data to test the prediction of affect-modulated probability attention (i.e., that the amount of attention paid to probability information is linked to the amount of affect triggered in a given choice problem).</p><p>The estimation of the AV, AV-APW, and AV-2PWF models was analogous to that described in the "Parameter Estimation" section in the Online Supplement. However, due to experimental design involving only small probabilities of side effects, a reliable estimation of both probability sensitivity and elevation parameters was not possible. 6</p><p>Thus, in our analyses we fixed the elevation parameter to 1. The Online Supplement shows that the parameters of the reported models can be well recovered under our experimental design. We used Bayesian hierarchical (generalized) regression models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bürkner, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Bürkner, , 2018</ref> to estimate both between-and within-participant effects in the other analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Comparison</head><p>As in the model comparison based on previously published datasets, the AV-APW model (accuracy loo = .73) outperformed the AV model (accuracy loo = .71). The difference between the models was reliable, ∆elpd loo = −65.6, CI 95% : <ref type="bibr">[−97.9, −33.3]</ref>. Importantly, the AV-2PWF model (accuracy loo = .73) also outperformed the AV model, ∆elpd loo = −120.1,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">CI 95% : [−150.1, −90.2]</formula><p>, demonstrating that choices in the affect-poor and afect-rich conditions are better accounted for by assuming separate probability weighting functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect-Modulated Probability Weighting</head><p>As predicted by the notion of affective probability weighting, the individual probability weighting functions estimated with the AV-2PWF model were more strongly curved and more elevated in the affect-rich than in the affect-poor condition <ref type="figure">(Figure 7a</ref>).</p><p>As shown in the top panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 7b</ref>, the estimated group-level probability sensitivity-indicated by the curvature parameter γ-was credibly lower in the affect-rich condition (γ = .16, CI 95% : [.12, .21]) than in the affect-poor condition (γ = .39, CI 95% :</p><p>[.32, .47]). These results show that probability weighting is in fact influenced by the affective value of risky options, supporting the key functional assumption in our formal implementation of affective probability weighting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect-Modulated Risk Aversion</head><p>As a measure of risk aversion, we analyzed the proportions of choices of the riskier drug (i.e., the drug with the more severe but less probable side effect). A lower proportion indicates higher risk aversion. As a statistical model, we used a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression that included random intercepts and slopes for both participants and choice problems. The results showed that the probability of choosing the riskier drug was substantially lower in the affect-rich condition (P (Risky) = .30, CI 95% : [.25, .34]) than in the affect-poor condition (P (Risky) = .49, CI 95% : <ref type="bibr">[.43, .54]</ref>). Consistent with the predictions of affect-modulated risk aversion, participants' choices were thus more risk averse in the affect-rich than in the affect-poor condition. The difference between the two conditions was credible and held across most matched pairs of choice problems (see <ref type="figure">Figure   7c</ref>) and for almost all individuals (not shown).</p><p>In summary, the analyses of people's choice behavior provide clear evidence for specific predictions of affective probability weighting. First, participants' probability sensitivity was lower in the affect-rich than in the affect-poor condition, despite both conditions containing choice problems with the same numerical probability information.</p><p>Second, participants exhibited higher risk aversion when the outcomes triggered stronger affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect-Modulated Probability Attention</head><p>Finally, we turn to our perhaps most critical test, namely, the prediction that a key aspect of information processing, namely attention to probabilities, was lower in choice problems with higher maximum affect. We examined this prediction in several ways. As preregistered, we used the proportional dwell time on probabilities to measure the amount of attention to probabilities.</p><p>First, we tested whether attention to probabilities was lower in the affect-rich than in the affect-poor condition. To that end, we fitted a Bayesian hierarchical beta regression model to the trial-level proportional dwell time on probabilities, including condition as fixed effect and random intercepts and slopes for participants. The relative amount of time spent looking at probability information was indeed lower in the affect-rich (t dwell = .33, CI 95% : <ref type="bibr">[.31, .35]</ref>) than in the affect-poor condition (t dwell = .36, CI 95% : <ref type="bibr">[.34, .38]</ref>), and the difference between the two conditions was credible (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8a</ref>). As shown in the top panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 8b</ref>, which displays the individual-level effects of condition, this pattern held for a large majority of participants.</p><p>Second, because affective probability weighting predicts that probability sensitivity decreases as the maximum amount of affect triggered in a choice problem increases, we expected attention to probability to gradually decrease the higher the affect. To test this, In summary, the process-tracing data provide support for a key cognitive-processing prediction of affective probability weighting. Consistent with affect-modulated probability attention, participants paid less attention to probabilities in affect-rich than in affect-poor choices. In addition, there was evidence for a gradual decrease in attention to probabilities as the maximum amount of affect in a given choice problem increased.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The development of descriptive models of decision making under risk has been shaped largely by how people choose between options with monetary outcomes. Arguably the most prominent descriptive model of risky choice is CPT, which has widely and successfully been used to describe people's preferences in the monetary domain-that is, in contexts such as finance, gambling, and insurance. CPT has, however, also been used to describe preferences in the nonmonetary domain, where outcomes are often nonnumerical (e.g., side effects of medications). In this article, we highlighted that in previous analyses that have used CPT to systematically compare monetary and nonmonetary choices, the model has been found to perform consistently worse in the nonmonetary context. We argued that this pattern of results might point to differences in how risky options are evaluated in the two domains, and specified these differences in two psychologically motivated modifications to CPT: (a) affective valuation, according to which the subjective value of a nonmonetary outcome is represented by an affect rating (rather than a monetary equivalent); (b) affective probability weighting, according to which the probability weighting of an outcome depends on the amount of affect triggered by the choice context.</p><p>We tested the modifications in a model comparison that examined to what extent they improve model performance relative to the common implementation of CPT. Model variants including affective probability weighting consistently outperformed models with standard probability weighting in the datasets with negative outcomes; model variants with affective valuation outperformed models with the standard value function in all datasets in which nonmonetary outcomes-irrespective of whether they were negative or positive-were presented without their monetary equivalents. Further, in an eye-tracking experiment on nonmonetary choice we found support for several specific predictions of affective probability weighting, namely that the amount of affect triggered by a choice problem modulates not only probability weighting and the risk aversion in people's choices, but also how much attention is allocated to probability information. Attention thus seems to play a key role in the impact of affect in nonmonetary choice (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Zilker &amp; Pachur, 2022</ref>. In the following, we discuss the implications of our findings and further relate them to previous work examining how affect guides and modulates judgment and decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>A rich body of work has discussed the potential role of affect in risky choice with monetary outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bateman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Charpentier et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Mellers &amp; McGraw, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Mellers et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Mukherjee, 2010)</ref>. A key focus has been on understanding people's emotional responses to risky options (e.g., fear and disgust) and their anticipatory emotional reactions to feedback after a choice (e.g., regret and disappointment). Our findings complement this work and suggest that affect-guided processing of outcome and probability information might be particularly relevant in decisions involving nonnumerical outcomes. Moreover, it formally ties together ideas proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hsee and Rottenstreich (2004)</ref>, which suggest that affective and calculatory evaluations of outcomes might sometimes diverge (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Loewenstein et al., 2001)</ref>, with the proposal of <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001)</ref> that affect may modulate the weighting of probabilistic outcomes.</p><p>Our result that a measure of valuation by feeling may be more important than valuation by calculation to capture nonmonetary choice throws a critical light on the common practice in behavioral economics of using contingent valuation to measure people's subjective value of nonmarket public goods, such as a drop in fish populations in a lake or worsening visibility due to air pollution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carson, 2012)</ref>. Contingent valuation aims to assess people's subjective value of such public goods by asking them to specify the maximum amount of money they would be willing to pay to obtain or to retain them. Our findings suggest that this approach of obtaining monetary equivalents might give a distorted impression of how much people actually value these outcomes. Instead, affective measures seem much better able to reflect the valuations that feed into people's preferences.</p><p>Further, our work supports the idea that affect can have different functions in decision making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Peters (2006)</ref>, for instance, distinguished between affect operating as information and affect operating as a spotlight. Our notion of affective valuation suggests that affect serves as information for decision makers; our notion of affective probability weighting suggests that affect directs attention allocation toward or away from probability information (leading to differences in probability sensitivity). The evidence for our proposed modifications implementing these notions indicates that in decisions involving nonnumerical outcomes, affect can serve both functions simultaneously in the same task.</p><p>The notion of affective probability weighting shares some conceptual similarities with the notion of rank-dependent utility (for a discussion, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Weber &amp; Kirsner, 1997)</ref>. In both, the weight (or attention) that an outcome receives is influenced by the other outcomes in the choice context. In rank-dependent models, the decision weight is dependent on the rank of an outcome (e.g., worst or best) within a given option. In affective probability weighting the decision weight is dependent on how bad the worst outcome in the choice problem is. In this way, affective probability weighting also has links to recent theories suggesting that probability distortions are proportional to the outcome magnitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lieder et al., 2018)</ref>. In sum, the results presented in this article and recent research indicate that people assess outcomes relative to the worst possible outcome across options. Models targeting non-numerical and non-monetary choices should thus consider this contextualization effect.</p><p>Finally, our results may shed new light on the mechanisms underlying domain-specific risk preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Blais &amp; Weber, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Weber et al., 2002)</ref>. It has been shown that individuals' stated likelihood of engaging in a risky behavior differs across risk domains; for instance, a person may have a high willingness to take financial risks (e.g., "investing 5% of your annual income in a very speculative stock") but a low willingness to take health risks (e.g., "engaging in unprotected sex"). To some extent, such domain-specific differences in risk preference are attributable to differences in perceived risk and perceived benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Weber et al., 2002)</ref>. Given that outcomes tend to be monetary in some domains (e.g., financial risks) but nonmonetary in others (e.g., ethical, social, or health risks), divergent risk preferences might also result from corresponding differences in the underlying mechanism for deciding whether to engage in risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do the Modifications Generalize Beyond CPT?</head><p>In our analyses, we implemented the proposed modifications for nonmonetary choice within the modeling framework of CPT. To test whether our findings generalize when the modifications are implemented in a different modeling framework, we drew on a recently extended version of decision field theory (DFT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Johnson &amp; Busemeyer, 2016)</ref>. The DFT framework incorporates a probability weighting function that captures attentional processes during the predecisional phase and shares properties with the CPT probability weighting function. When we constructed model variants of DFT that included different combinations of our proposed modifications, we obtained qualitatively the same results as when implementing the modifications in CPT (see Online Supplement, <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>). This suggests that the idea that affect shapes how outcomes and probabilities are evaluated and integrated in nonmonetary choice is not specific to the CPT modeling framework but holds more generally.</p><p>On a related note, we would like to emphasize that the predictions of affective probability weighting could be accommodated differently than by modifying CPT's probability weighting function. For instance, affect-modulated probability sensitivity and risk aversion could also be modeled by assuming that higher affect leads to an increased use of the minimax (maximax) heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Savage, 1972)</ref> in the loss (gain) domain.</p><p>However, conducting the analyses in the context of CPT rather than assuming differences in the selection of qualitatively different strategies has several advantages. First, it allows us to directly integrate previous proposals of probability weighting in nonmonetary choices, which have been formulated using the conceptual language of CPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Rottenstreich &amp; Hsee, 2001</ref>). Second, implementing the effects of affect within a single computational framework circumvents concerns about the impact of auxiliary assumptions (e.g., regarding the formalization of probabilistic choice) on the result of model comparisons. For instance, if we also relied in our modeling on the minimax and maximax heuristics, we would need to turn these deterministic models into probabilistic ones. Although this modeling step would merely refer to an auxiliary assumption (and not to "core" theoretical assumptions), it could substantially affect the results of the model comparisons with CPT, for which an established stochastic implementation exists (for a discussion, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pachur et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Spiliopoulos &amp; Hertwig, 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Our results demonstrate that CPT can be successfully applied to decision making "in the wild," where outcomes are often qualitative and fuzzier than in the choice problems around which CPT was originally developed. Importantly, however, our results indicate that to do so, CPT needs to take into account psychological principles that do not feature in the standard implementation of CPT. One such principle is that affect modulates probability weighting. Specifically, when outcomes trigger higher levels of affect, people pay less attention to probabilities than when outcomes trigger lower levels of affect. As a consequence, they will be less likely to choose the normatively superior option, that is, the one with the higher expected value, in nonmonetary choice with affect-rich outcomes. To counteract this effect, and thus improve decision making, one could present probabilities in a format that is less likely to be neglected. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Waters et al. (2007)</ref> demonstrated that people's apparent neglect of the probabilities of affect-rich medical side effects is reduced when stick figures are used to represent the probability information (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fuławka et al., 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Outlook</head><p>Our analyses only considered situations in which all options offered either loss or gain outcomes. Future research could compare monetary and nonmonetary choices in more complex options that require a trade-off between gains and losses. Such an investigation could also test whether the degree of loss aversion-for which mixed options are required-also differs between monetary and nonmonetary choices. As reviewed in the section "Domains in Which Nonmonetary Choice Has Been Investigated With CPT," previous attempts to compare the degree of loss aversion between monetary and nonmonetary choice have been mixed. A more rigorous approach to comparing choices between the two contexts might help clarify these inconsistencies.</p><p>Further, future research could also consider choice problems in which the options' nonmonetary outcomes represent different amounts of the same event. For instance, the choice could be between medications that can have the same side effect, but with one medication the side effect (if it occurs) lasts for one week, and with the other for two weeks (but with lower probability). For such types of outcomes, it has been shown that valuations by feeling, such as affect ratings, display scope insensitivity, such that they are less sensitive to quantitative differences than valuations by calculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hsee &amp; Rottenstreich, 2004)</ref>. To the extent that nonmonetary choices are based on affective evaluations of the outcomes, it follows that such choices also display scope insensitivity to a greater extent than do monetary choices.</p><p>We proposed that affect ratings might be better indicators of the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes than monetary equivalents. Although our findings support this idea, affective responses may only partially capture the multidimensional nature of people's representation of nonmonetary outcomes. Future research could use more comprehensive techniques to quantify and measure subjective representations of nonmonetary outcomes.</p><p>For instance, large language models could be used to identify relevant semantic dimensions underlying the representation of nonmonetary outcomes, potentially yielding a richer measure of their subjective value than affect ratings alone (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bhatia, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bhatia &amp; Aka, 2022)</ref>. In general, the challenges of translating the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes into quantifiable measures have parallels with efforts to translate verbal probabilities into numerical ones (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Budescu et al., 1988)</ref>. Some of the methodological approaches used in that literature (e.g., determining the numerical equivalence of nonnumerical expressions) might also be productively applied here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The idea that the essence of decision making under risk can be studied by presenting people with monetary gambles has been immensely influential and helpful for characterizing key regularities in human preference. However, researchers have long noted that limiting the focus to monetary outcomes may overlook some psychological principles that contribute to decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Goldstein &amp; Weber, 1995)</ref>. For instance, stimuli with a richer semantic context than monetary gambles allow people to draw on narrative frames and other background knowledge to guide their judgments and decisions. Our work underscores the limitations of focusing exclusively on monetary gambles. Shifting the perspective to include nonmonetary choices highlights the key role of affect, which has often remained under the radar in research on risky choices.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Examples of the value function with different parameter settings. b: Examples of the probability weighting function with different parameter settings.amount.

The paradigm is particularly intended for situations in which the outcomes are nonnumerical (e.g., aversive physical experience)-as in the seminal work by<ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001)</ref> on affect-rich decisions. Following the contingent-valuation approach used in behavioral economics (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carson, 2012)</ref>, a measure of the subjective value of an outcome is collected by asking people about their willingness to pay. For example, participants are asked: "How much more would you pay for a drug that does not have [SIDE EFFECT] as a side effect, relative to a drug that always results in experiencing [SIDE EFFECT]?" Participants then choose between medications with various probabilities of side effects (medical choice task) as well as between lotteries with monetary outcomes (monetary choice task). Crucially, the choice problems in both tasks are the same, except that the side effects are replaced by their individual monetary equivalents.</figDesc></figure>

(2017)</ref>, because they included a relatively high number of participants (80 for each dataset) and a relatively high number of choice problems per person for each condition (44 choices). 5 In both studies, the design was very similar.First, participants provided monetary equivalents for nonmonetary outcomes (side effects). Second, each participant was presented with a set of nonmonetary choice problems (between medications with some probability of side effects) and a set of economically matched problems involving possible monetary losses (see Figure 2a for examples; a more detailed description is provided in the section "Systematic Comparisons of Nonmonetary and Monetary Risky Choice"). Finally, ratings of negative affect (on a scale from 1-10) were collected for both side effects and monetary losses. In Suter et al. (2016), the nonmonetary choice task included two between-subjects conditions: in one condition, for each medication only the side effects were presented; in the other condition, the medications were presented with their monetary equivalents. Because presenting monetary information in the nonmonetary choice task might affect people's choices, we analyzed and report the two conditions separately as Suter et al. (2016, Condition A) and Suter et al. (2016, Condition B), respectively. Further, we included the dataset from Pachur et al.

(2016, Condition B)-where the side effects were shown along with their monetary equivalents. For instance, in the Pachur et al. (2017) dataset, the AV-APW model correctly predicted, on average, 75% of choices, whereas CPT correctly predicted 70% (Figure 4, top). This corresponds to the AV-APW model correctly predicting an additional 176 of the 3,520 choices in the dataset. In the Suter et al. (2016, Condition A) and Pachur et al. (2014) datasets, the AV-APW model outperformed CPT by approximately six and three percentage points, respectively. It is noteworthy that all modified model variants performed considerably better in the Suter et al. (2016, Condition A) dataset than in the Suter et al.

As predicted, there was a credible negative effect of the maximum affect in a given choice problem on the proportional dwell time onprobabilities, β = −0.05, CI 95% : [−0.1, −0.01].As shown in the bottom panel ofFigure 8b, this effect held nominally for the majority of participants. When analyzed on the aggregate level, the relationship between maximum trial-level affect and attention to probabilities is clearly negative(Figure 8c).To complement the two sets of analyses, we also investigated the relationship between each participant's average (across trials) proportional dwell time on probabilities (i.e.,Figure 8a) and the individual probability sensitivity levels as estimated with the γ parameter of the AV-2PWF model (i.e.,Figure 7b). To this end, we ran a Bayesian robust regression with the average proportional dwell time on probabilities as the dependentvariable and the probability sensitivity level as a predictor, separately for each experimental condition. The results showed a moderate, positive relationship between the two variables: β poor = 0.39, CI 95% : [0.16, 0.61]; β rich = 0.46, CI 95% : [0.25, 0.69]. Testing the predictions of affective probability weighting for cognitive processing. a. Individual estimates of proportional dwell time on probabilities from a Bayesian hierarchical beta regression. The statistics at the top of the panel give the model-based expected posterior difference between the experimental conditions. Each pair of connected points represents a participant. b. Individual slopes from Bayesian hierarchical beta regressions (see text for details). The points and lines show the medians and CI 95% of the posterior distributions. The µ β are the group-level effects. c The relationship between binned maximum affect values (every 4 points) and mean proportional dwell time on probabilities. The points represent the mean proportional dwell time on probability within trials with a given level of maximum affect. Point size indicates the relative number of data points within a bin, and the vertical lines show the mean proportional dwell time +/− 1 standard error. The line, the corresponding 95% Credible Interval, and the statistics at the top of the panel are from a Bayesian robust regression.</figDesc></figure>

For the monetary lotteries, the square mile figures in the</cell></row><row><cell>environmental lotteries were multiplied by 20 (yielding dollar amounts between $50 and</cell></row></table><note>$17,000). When the choices were modeled with CPT (with the outcomes of the nonmonetary options again being quantified by the area sizes), probability sensitivity was lower for nonmonetary than for monetary choices. As this overview shows, a considerable literature has applied CPT to model risky choices beyond monetary lotteries. The applications suggest that CPT can be useful in characterizing preferences among nonmonetary options, and that nonmonetary choices may sometimes differ from monetary choices, particularly in terms of probability weighting. An important limitation of these studies, however, is that they either did not attempt to economically match the choice problems across the two contexts, or only approximated such a match, making it difficult to directly compare findings for nonmonetary and monetary choices. When monetary choices were collected, moreover, all participants were presented with the same monetary choices; possible individual differences in the subjective monetary valuation of the nonmonetary outcomes were thus not taken into account (e.g., people might differ in how unattractive they find having to wait for 30 minutes). In the next section, we review studies that have compared nonmonetary and monetary choice using an experimental paradigm in which the economically matched choice problems are tailored to each individual. This methodology enables a more rigorous comparison of how nonmonetary choices differ</note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>). Here we propose that a feeling-based valuation might play an even more important role for the assessment of outcomes when outcomes are nonmonetary. Results from empirical studies support this possibility.Pachur and Galesic (2013, Study 2)  provided indirect evidence that affect ratings of nonmonetary outcomes are better predictors of people's risky choices than are monetary equivalents. Modeling people's choices with various simple cognitive strategies, the authors found that in nonmonetary choices more participants were classified as using the affect heuristic (according to which choices are based on the amount of affect triggered by the outcomes) than the minimax heuristic (according to which choices of nonmonetary outcomes are based on the monetary equivalents). Further,<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hascher et al. (2021)</ref> showed that people's choices between food items were more consistent with individual liking ratings than with willingness-to-pay values. Similarly, in an investigation of choices between various consumer products (e.g., laptops),<ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Trujillo (2018)</ref> showed that affect ratings predicted choices better than attribute values and weights (especially in a condition with multiple options and attributes per option). Finally, in a model comparison by<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Charpentier et al. (2016)</ref>, a model that used people's feelings about outcomes to predict their risky choices between monetary options outperformed models that used monetary outcomes.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

However, this design choice introduced a considerable dependency between the parameters of the probability weighting function: Among such low probabilities, the γ parameter influences not only the curvature but also the elevation of the probability weighting function.</note>
