			<abstract>
				<p>Decision-making involves weighing up the outcome likelihood, potential rewards, and effort needed. Previous research has focused on the trade-offs between risk and reward or between effort and reward. Here we bridge this gap and examine how risk in effort levels influences choice. We focus on how two key properties of choice influence risk preferences for effort: changes in magnitude and probability. Two experiments assessed people&apos;s risk attitudes for effort and an additional experiment provided a control condition using monetary gambles. The extent to which people valued effort was related to their pattern of risk preferences. Unlike with monetary outcomes, however, there was substantial heterogeneity in effort-based risk preferences: people who responded to effort as costly exhibited a &quot;flipped&quot; interaction pattern of risk preferences. The direction of the pattern depended on whether people treated effort as a loss of resources. Most, but not all, people treat effort as a loss and are more willing to take risks to avoid potentially high levels of effort.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When making decisions, people often decide between courses of action that lead to the same outcome but vary in the possible levels of effort required. For example, should one take a known route or instead risk a potential shortcut that may be muddy and difficult to walk over? In such situations, people weigh up whether to put in a known amount of effort or choose a risky option where the effort exerted could be lower or higher. Prior research on decision-making under uncertainty has almost exclusively focussed on outcome uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wulff et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Camerer &amp; Weber, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rieskamp, 2008)</ref>. As a result, little is known about the fundamental question of how people treat uncertainty in the effort required to collect a reward, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. This paper addresses this question through three experiments that compared risk preferences in two effort-based tasks against risk preferences for numerically identical monetary gambles. Risky choices can be classified along two core dimensions: probability and magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tversky &amp; Fox, 1995)</ref>. When dealing with uncertainty in monetary outcomes, people choose</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effort Reward</head><p>Risk differently depending on whether the risky option includes common probabilities (e.g., p = .5) or rare events (e.g., p = .1). These differences in risk preferences can be attributed to overweighting of the rare outcomes by a probability weighting function, leading people to seek the rare win, but avoid the rare loss. Similarly, people choose differently depending on whether monetary gambles concern increases or decreases in magnitude. When risk preferences are compared across these four conditions, there is a perfect interaction between probability and changes in magnitude, often known as the fourfold pattern (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> Monetary Control group). These risk preferences are well summarised by Prospect Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>, which has been influential in understanding decision-making in a variety of contexts including politics, consumer psychology, healthcare, risk management and beyond <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Johnson &amp; Goldstein, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Treadwell &amp; Lenert, 1999)</ref>. Here, we use this fourfold risk pattern as the basis to examine people's risk preferences for effort.</p><p>Whilst behavioural economics primarily classifies decisions along the dimensions of risk and reward, the idea that effort operates alongside these two factors has gained traction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Westbrook et al., 2019)</ref>. The role of effort in decision-making, however, has been primarily studied in terms of its relationship with reward. Unlike reward, effort can be perceived as either a loss or a gain, across different individuals, contexts, and tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>For example, people are willing to accept a lower reward to exert less effort, known as effort discounting, implying that effort is costly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Botvinick et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hartmann et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Building on the assumption that effort is costly, early research, such as Hull's Law of Least Effort, concluded that when different actions provide equal reward, the option with least effort will be chosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hull, 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Solomon, 1948)</ref>. In labour markets, when wages are higher and therefore less effort (hours) are required to reach a target salary, taxi drivers and bike messengers do indeed exert less overall effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Camerer et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fehr &amp; Gotte, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Empirically, in lab tasks, people also generally choose lower effort tasks and avoid cognitive effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kool et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schouppe, et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>A considerable body of experimental work has investigated the relationship between effort and reward using the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), which was adapted from a task developed to investigate effort-based decision making in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Salamone et al.,1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Treadway, 2009</ref>). In the EEfRT task, people choose between an option that requires low effort to obtain a small reward and an option that requires higher effort for a larger reward. People's willingness to exert more effort to obtain more reward has been found to depend on many factors including motivation, personality traits, reward magnitude and the probability (risk) of obtaining the rewards (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ohman et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Treadway et al., 2009)</ref>. For example, people's willingness to exert more effort to obtain more reward generally decreases as the reward become less certain, but this tendency also interacts with trait anhedonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Treadway et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Other research has found, however, that although effort can be costly, it can also be valued, as described by the effort paradox <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, when people exert effort to produce items (e.g., IKEA, Lego), they value these products more than their identical pre-assembled counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Norton et al., 2012)</ref>. People may thus sometimes be motivated to choose high-effort options in anticipation of high rewards.</p><p>Although increased effort often yields higher rewards, in some situations, effort level is not related to (reward) outcome. For example, the outcome of determining the statistical significance of results should be the same, whether you laboriously compute the values by hand, or instead use statistical software. Less is known about decision making involving effort when the obtained reward does not vary with effort. Our research thus investigated people's risk preferences for effort irrespective of outcome and focussed on the trade-off between effort and risk. Moreover, given the occasionally paradoxical nature of effort preferences, we also explored whether people show a similar heterogeneity in their risk preferences for effort.</p><p>With non-human animals, examining the effect of variability in response requirements (i.e., effort variability) on choice to obtain the same reward has a long history (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fantino, 1967</ref>). These studies have generally found a preference for actions associated with variable levels of effort. For example, when rats choose between a lever that can be pressed a fixed number of times and a lever that varies in the number of presses required to obtain the same amount of food, they prefer the variable (risky) option, even when the mean number of required presses is equal (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sherman &amp; Thomas, 1968)</ref>.</p><p>A handful of studies have studied people's preferences for safe or uncertain effort levels in tasks that require people to learn the probabilities and potential outcomes of their choices based on experience, as would be the case with non-human animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Apps et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mason et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nagengast et al., 2011)</ref>. Those studies suggested that, when learned from experience, people's preferences for effort parallel their preference for reward outcomes under uncertainty. To our knowledge, no studies have examined explicitly described risk in potential effort levels. Given that people show different risk preferences for described and learnt information about monetary rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ludvig &amp; Spetch, 2012)</ref>, it seemed likely that risk preferences for described effort may not follow those for learned information about effort. The experiments reported here directly tested how people respond to described gambles involving effort.</p><p>The three experiments examine risk preferences for common and rare problems and for either increases or decreases in effort using a task that we created to predominantly require physical effort (clicking task: Exp 1), or a task that we created to predominantly require mental effort (adding task: Exp 2). Experiment 3 used monetary gambles as a control condition. The set of tasks allows for comparison of risk preferences for effort and money, without assuming whether effort is treated as a loss or a gain. We hypothesize that people will exhibit the standard fourfold pattern for money (Exp 3). For the effort tasks <ref type="table">(Exp 1 and</ref> 2), however, we predict that the direction of the pattern will depend on individual effort preferences. Specifically, we predict that individuals who show a preference for low effort will show a flipped fourfold pattern, whereas those who prefer the high-effort option may not.</p><p>These hypothesized fourfold patterns would appear as significant interactions between probability (rare vs common) and changes in magnitude (increases vs decreases).</p></div>

The methods and analyses follow the pre-registered plan, except where explicitly indicated. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted to follow up on some results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited on Prolific Academic. For all experiments, the target sample size after any exclusions was 128, which, with a frequentist approach, gives 95%</p><p>power for a within-subjects ANOVA (magnitude change, probability) with a small-medium effect size (Cohen's d= 0.4) and an alpha of .01. As per the pre-registered sampling plan, we aimed to initially recruit 150 participants for each experiment to allow for exclusions, incomplete datasets and dropout during the experiment. In the effort experiments, we then continued to recruit in groups of 20 until we reached at least a sample size of 128 participants who were low-effort choosers (as defined by the value-preference trials⎯see Trial Structure). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In all three experiments, participants completed a set of 96 decisions (see below for a detailed description of the trial types). At the start of the experiments, participants were told that one decision would be selected at the end of the experiment and that the option selected would be played out. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants made decisions in one of two effort-based tasks: the clicking task and the adding task (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The clicking task was based on prior work investigating experienced effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mason et al., 2022)</ref>. Before making any choices, participants completed 40 rounds of the clicking task. On each round, a black response circle was presented at locations randomly selected (with replacement) from 9 evenly spaced locations on the computer screen. The cursor was not repositioned between clicks. A 500-ms delay preceded each presentation of a response circle, and the circle remained on the screen until it was clicked with the mouse. In the adding task, participants were presented with a grid of numbers and asked to select the two numbers (to two decimal places) that summed to 10. If they answered incorrectly or if they chose to "skip", then a new grid appeared. Participants had to successfully complete 5 grids before they could proceed to the main task. In Experiment 3, participants made decisions about money. of the number grid used in the adding task. Participants had to select two numbers that summed to 10. When they clicked a number, it turned red. Once they submitted their answer, they were given feedback as to whether the answer was correct, and a new number grid was shown. Participants had the option to skip number grid, but to finish the experiment they still had to correctly complete the total number of grids required (40 +/-the outcome of the selected option).</p><p>Across all three experiments the options offered the chance for participants to increase or decrease either their effort expenditure (Exp 1 and 2) or monetary pay-out (Exp 3).</p><p>Therefore, participants were given an initial endowment of money or baseline effort level (Experiment 1: 400 clicks; Experiment 2: 40 correct sums; Experiment 3: £4), which their subsequent choices could increase or decrease.</p><p>On each trial, participants were presented with two options on screen, one on the left and one on the right (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>), and were instructed to pick the option they preferred.</p><p>Each option was clearly labelled as an "INCREASE" or a "DECREASE" trial for Experiments 1 and 2 and "WIN" or "LOSE" for Experiment 3. The text appeared in different colours for each condition (blue or orange), which was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>The relevant word appeared in the centre of the screen in capital letters. Participants selected one option by clicking on the black box beneath that option. The selected box was then highlighted with a white border for 1.2 s as visual confirmation of which option was selected.</p><p>Trials were self-paced, and after each choice a box appeared in the centre of the screen with the instructions "Click here to continue". the options referred to how many clicks the participant would have to make in the clicking task. For each choice problem, participants were presented with a choice screen with two options. Each choice problem gave the opportunity to either INCREASE or DECREASE the number of clicks required to complete the experiment. To select an option, they clicked on one of the two corresponding black boxes. The next choice then appeared on screen.</p><p>Participants were shown both increase and decrease choice problems for the value-preference and risk-preference trials. For the adding task (Experiment 2), instead of referring to clicks, each option was either the chance to INCREASE or DECREASE the number of grids that needed to be completed. In Experiment 3, participants chose between options for different amounts of money (in pence). Each trial was clearly labelled as a WIN or LOSE option to indicate increases and decreases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial structure</head><p>In all three experiments participants encountered a total of 96 choice problems which consisted of both risk-preference trials and value-preference trials. Experiments 1 and 3 contained the exact same set of choice problems (see Supplementary Materials <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for the full set of problems). For Experiment 2 (the adding task), the magnitude of the choice problems was reduced to keep the overall study time similar across experiments. In general, the numbers in each problem were divided by 10 but some had to be manually adjusted so that they all involved whole numbers (see Supplementary Materials <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>Risk-preference trials. These trials provided a choice between options that had equal expected value (i.e., in effort levels or in monetary amounts) but that differed in risk. There were 40 risk-preference trials involving increases in effort and 40 trials involving decreases in effort. The monetary-gambles control experiment used increases and decreases in money which corresponded to gains and losses. For both increases and decreases, 20 of the problems involved a rare, risky option (p=.1) and 20 were common problems (both p=.5). These 80 problems were generated according to two criteria: changes in magnitude and probability. We used a similar process to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Erev et al. (2010)</ref> to randomly generate a set of risk-preference problems. The exact process for generating the problems is explained in detail in the Supplementary Materials.</p><p>Value-preference trials. These trials provided a choice between options with different expected values. There were 16 value-preference trials: for increases and 8 for decreases. In these trials, there was always a strictly dominant option, whereby the fixed option was better (or worse) than both possible outcomes for the risky option. For the effortbased experiments, we cannot assume that people prefer the higher or the lower effort options. Instead, we use these value-preference trials to calculate the proportion of times a person chooses the high-magnitude option and classify them as high-or low-effort choosers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>For each statistical test reported, we report both frequentist (including effect sizes)</p><p>and Bayesian statistics. The value of the Bayes factors quantifies the strength of evidence in favour of the model of interest with respect to the null model, given the data obtained. We used R to run the analysis (v 4.1.3; R Core Team, 2020) and the BayesFactor package, with the default priors, was used to estimate Bayes Factors (v0.9.12-4.3; Morey &amp; Rouder, 2022).</p><p>Our pre-registered analysis plan was to examine risk preferences for participants who chose the low effort (Experiments 1 and 2) or high monetary amounts (Experiment 3) on at least 60% of the value preference trials. The 60% threshold has been used in many previous studies using monetary rewards and was designed to exclude participants who did not learn or were not motivated to maximize reward. In Experiment 2, we further pre-registered a plan to conduct parallel analyses on participants who selected the high-effort options on 60% or more of the value-preference trials, and this analysis was therefore conducted for both experiments. This subdivision resulted in the exclusion of participants who showed no consistent preference for either high or low effort. This additional analysis was not pre-registered for the monetary reward task because past research suggested that very few people would show preference for lower reward amounts (as indeed was the case; see <ref type="figure">Fig 6 below</ref>).</p><p>To ensure, however, that our pre-registered 60% thresholds did not bias the conclusions, we conducted two sets of additional follow-up analyses.</p><p>First, we conducted correlational analyses with all participants (including those who did not meet either threshold) to assess the relationship between patterns of risky choice and value preference across the full sample. To this end, we calculated a Fourfold Score for each participant. This score indicates the direction of the interaction in their risk preferences participant we also calculated the proportion of times they choose the higher magnitude (in effort or money) option in the value-preference choice to provide a measure of the degree of preference for higher magnitudes of effort or money, based on a preference threshold of 60%.</p><p>We additionally tested the robustness of our results using thresholds of 55%, 65% and 70%</p><p>and found similar conclusions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref> Supplementary Materials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Figure 4 plots the proportion of times participants chose the risky option in the effortclicking task (Exp 1), the effort-adding task (Exp 2), and the monetary-control condition (Exp 3). For the effort tasks, we first report the results for all participants and then we report the pre-registered analysis for high-and low-effort choosers. For the monetary control condition, we report the pre-registered analysis which excludes 3 people who chose the high-value option in fewer than 60% of the value-preference trials. For all tasks, there was a clear interaction between probability and direction of magnitude change, consistent with our hypotheses.</p><p>In the effort-based tasks, when all participants were included, people were substantially more risk-averse for rare increases than for rare decreases, and they were slightly more risk averse for increases with common gambles (more notably in the adding task). For the monetary control condition, the pattern of preferences was consistent with the typical fourfold pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>, with more risk seeking for rare increases (gains) than decreases (losses) and less risk seeking for common increases (gains) than decreases (losses). We ran a 2 x 2 (probability <ref type="bibr">[rare, common]</ref>   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low-Effort Choosers</head><p>Our pre-registered analysis plan was to examine risk preferences for high-and loweffort choosers separately. In Experiment 1, there were 132 participants who chose the loweffort option in at least 60% of the value-preference trials. In Experiment 2, 146 participants chose the low-effort option in at least 60% of the value-preference trials. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> plots the proportion of times that the low-and high-effort participants chose the risky option in the effort-clicking task (Exp 1) and the effort-adding task (Exp 2). For all tasks, there was a clear interaction between probability and change in magnitude. In the effort-based tasks, with rare gambles, people were more risk-averse for increases than for decreases. In contrast, with common gambles they were more risk-averse for decreases than for increases. Thus, as hypothesized, low-effort choosers showed a flipped fourfold pattern.</p><p>As pre-registered, for each experiment we ran a 2 x 2 (probability <ref type="bibr">[rare, common]</ref> x change in magnitude [increase, decrease]) within-subjects ANOVA. The hypothesized fourfold patterns should appear as a significant interaction. For low-effort choosers in both experiments, there was a significant interaction between probability and magnitude [Exp 1:</p><p>F(1,131) = 107.4, p &lt;.001, η 2 p = .45, BF = 1.36e+18; Exp 2: F(1,145) = 254.5, p &lt;.001, η 2 p = .64, BF = 3.28e+28]. There was also a main effect of magnitude across experiments (Exp 1:</p><p>F(1,131) = 21.3, p &lt;.001, η 2 p = .14, BF = 2122; Exp 2: F(1,145) = 98.6, p &lt;.001, η 2 p = .41, BF = 1.63e+20]. There was a significant main effect of probability in Exp 1 [F(1,131) = 18.1, p &lt;.001 , η 2 p =.14, BF = 3.62], but not in Experiment 2 [F(1,145) = 3.1, p = .071, η 2 p = .022, BF = 0.15].</p><p>To compare the specific patterns of risk preferences in each experiment, we ran a set In Experiment 2, with the adding task, low-effort choosers also exhibited a reversed fourfold pattern: 1) They chose the risky option 29.6 ± 2.2% less often for rare increases We also conducted this analysis for the monetary choices in the control condition </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-Effort Choosers</head><p>In Experiment 1 (the clicking task), 77 participants consistently chose the high-effort option on the value-preference trials more than 60% of the time 1 . In Experiment 2, with the adding task, there were only 20 high-effort choosers, making that analysis substantially underpowered. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> plots the risk preferences for these high-effort choosers for the clicking and adding tasks. For the clicking task, in contrast to the low-effort choosers, these people's risk preferences align with the fourfold pattern shown for monetary gambles (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>). For the adding task, these high-effort choosers trended toward the same pattern as the clicking task with rare outcomes, but they were mostly indifferent with common problems. We conducted the same 2 x 2 (probability <ref type="bibr">[rare, common]</ref> x change in magnitude [increase, decrease]) within-subjects ANOVA on this subset of participants to confirm the reliability of this pattern of risk preferences. There was a significant interaction between probability and change in magnitude in Exp 1[ F(1,76) = 26.43, p &lt;.001, η 2 p = .26, BF = 28798] but not in Exp 2, [F(1,19) = 2.71, p =. 12, η 2 p = .13, BF = 0.41], likely due to the low sample size in this subset. There was no main effect of change in magnitude [Exp 1: F(1,76) = 0.02, p =. 90, η 2 p &lt;.001, BF = 0.13; Exp 2: F(1,19) = 1.45, p =. 24, η 2 p = .07, BF = 0.45]. There was a main effect of probability [Exp 1: F(1,76) = 8.65, p = .004, η 2 p =.10, BF = 0.72] but not in Exp 2</p><p>[F(1,19) = 1.75, p =.20, η 2 p = .08, BF = 0.32].</p><p>Following up on the significant interaction, we conducted the follow-up t-tests for the high-effort choosers in the clicking task. In contrast to the low-effort choosers (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 5)</ref>, the risk preferences for effort for this subset of participants followed the classic fourfold pattern observed with monetary gambles: 1) The high-effort choosers chose the risky option 8. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Value preference and Risk preference</head><p>To further examine heterogeneity in risk preferences, we conducted a follow-up analysis to examine how well people's preferences for money and effort correlated with their risk preferences as measured by the Fourfold score. This analysis includes all participants. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the relationship between risk preference and value preference. In both effort tasks, people who choose the higher magnitude effort options in effort-preference trials have a higher Fourfold Score, more in line with the classic fourfold pattern. In contrast, people who choose the lower magnitude effort option have a lower Fourfold score (a flipped fourfold pattern). In both the effort tasks, this positive correlation was significant (Clicking Task: r(245) = .63, p &lt;.001; Adding Task: r(187) = .52, p &lt;.001), and there was a mild, but not significant, positive correlation in the Monetary Control task (r(148) = .12, p = 0.14). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The relationship between Fourfold Score (a measure of the pattern of risk preferences) and preference for high-magnitude options (increases in effort or money). There was a strong positive correlation between Fourfold Score and value-preference for both the effort tasks and a mild positive relationship for the Monetary-Control task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Risk, reward, and effort are three key determinants of human choices. Although the relationships between risk and reward, and between effort and reward, have been studied extensively, the relationship between risk and effort has been largely ignored (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Apps et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mason et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nagengast et al., 2011)</ref>. This set of three experiments establishes how people choose with risky effort. To answer this fundamental question, we explicitly varied both the probabilities and the magnitudes of the effort levels required to obtain a fixed reward outcome. Across two effort-based experiments, one more physical and one more cognitive, we demonstrated an interaction between probability and magnitude in people's risk preferences. This interaction parallels the fourfold pattern that has been observed with monetary gambles (see Exp 3 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>. Notably, however, there was substantial heterogeneity in the direction of people's effort preferences suggesting that people differ in how they value effort, which impacts their risk preferences.</p><p>The effort paradox highlights how effort can be both costly and valued <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Inzlicht et al. 2018</ref>), and the current work examines the impact of effort preferences on risk preferences.</p><p>Most people's risk preferences for effort show a "flipped" fourfold pattern. For risky choices, the prospect of exerting more effort ("increase" in the effort tasks) is viewed differently to the prospect of gaining a financial reward ("increase" in the monetary-control task). For gambles involving rare probabilities, most people were more risk averse for increases in effort and more risk seeking for decreases in effort. This pattern was reversed, but less pronounced, for common gambles, where people were equally or more risk seeking for increases in effort than for decreases in effort. This pattern highlights how effort is usually viewed as costly and that people and other animals typically choose to avoid both physical and cognitive effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kool et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schouppe, et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In the effort-discounting literature, the monetary value of a reward decreases in relation to the effort taken to obtain it <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Botvinick et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hartmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>. People's willingness to exert more effort to obtain more reward varies with trait anhedonia, reward magnitude, and reward probability as shown in the EEfRT task <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Treadway et al., 2009)</ref>. How the interaction between risk and effort depends on these</p><p>parameters is an open question. Furthermore, the reward regions of the brain have been</p><p>shown to respond to effort as a disutility <ref type="bibr">(Sayali &amp; Badre, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Botvinick et al., 2009</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schouppe et al., 2014)</ref>. Recent work has shown that people will exert more effort to avoid losses than to obtain gains <ref type="bibr">(Farinha &amp; Maia, 2021</ref>). In the current experiments, the parallel between effort increases and monetary decreases (losses) when faced with risk further ensconces this view of effort as disutility for most people.</p><p>Our results, however, indicate that the direction of people's risk preference patterns depends on their effort preference. This heterogeneity highlights that the utility of effort cannot be assumed across individuals and tasks. In Experiment 1, there was a large spread in people's effort preferences (see lower panels in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>). The people who preferred higher effort showed a pattern of risk preference consistent with effort being valued. This result is consistent with work demonstrating that higher levels of effort can be a desirable state used to motivate behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Larson, 2014)</ref>. People will contribute more to a charitable cause when there is increased effort or pain associated with a sponsored activity (e.g., a picnic vs a 5-mile run). Similarly, in public-goods games, willingness to contribute to a public cause is greater when the process is expected to be painful and effortful rather than easy and enjoyable <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Olivola &amp; Shafir, 2018)</ref>. In animal learning, increased effort has been found to increase the subjective value of the outcome obtained leading the animal to show a preference for the option requiring more effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kacelnik &amp; Marsh, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zentall, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lydall et al., 2010)</ref>. Under some conditions, effort clearly adds value <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, however, this effort-seeking pattern was only present for a much smaller proportion of participants in the adding task, which presumably predominantly involved mental effort (Experiment 2). These results add to existing findings that, in experimental mental-effort tasks, effort seeking is rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Embry et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The clicking task (Experiment 1) required participants to click a black circle that moved across the screen, which presumably required less mental effort. A high clicking speed is desirable for gaming, and the task may have been seen as a positive challenge by some. In Experiment 2, the adding task required participants to find numbers that added up to 10 and this presumably required mental effort. Other differences between the two experiments, however, may have also contributed to the difference in effort seeking. For example, there were some demographic differences between the experiments. Alternatively, the adding task may have been perceived as generally more effortful than the clicking task, and it included verbal feedback (correct or incorrect) that was not present in the clicking task. For both experiments participants completed practise trials. In the clicking task they simply had to click the circle to proceed to the next trial. In the adding task they had to complete 5 correct trials. An analysis of baseline performance in the adding task showed no difference in performance between high-and low-effort choosers (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Materials)</ref>.</p><p>Although a substantial proportion of high-effort choosers was observed only in Experiment 1, even in Experiment 2 there was more heterogeneity in effort preference than for monetary preference in Experiment 3 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>). Moreover, preference for effort correlated significantly with the fourfold pattern of risk preference in both effort experiments, suggesting considerable generality given the differences between the two tasks. Thus, consistent with the effort paradox literature, effort is not always treated as a disutility. The novel result we report here is that the extent to which people treat effort as a disutility determines their response to risk in effort.</p><p>Our findings, and the addition of risk, provide a new angle for several models of effort that formalise the costly nature of effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>. This cost is either quantified as a loss of physical resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000)</ref> or as an opportunity cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kurzban et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Otto &amp; Daw, 2019)</ref>. These models often focus on the trade-off between effort and reward outcome and suggest that people's decision to expend effort on a given task depends on a cost-benefit analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Botvinick &amp; Braver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gratton et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sandra &amp; Otto, 2018)</ref>. More recently, the cost of expending effort has been linked to the "sense of effort" associated with completing a task <ref type="bibr">(Embry et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Otto &amp; Daw, 2019)</ref>. The current results establish how uncertainty in these effort-cost functions gets translated into choice.</p><p>The time taken to solve a task and the difficulty of the task are potential confounds when looking at effort-based decisions. In many everyday decisions, however, effort and time are highly correlated. It takes longer to solve a hard crossword clue compared to an easy one.</p><p>In these experiments, the decision tasks all used a set of described choice problems where one choice was played out at the end of the task. Arguably, this set-up makes time less of an issue, but participants could still have been making their decisions in order to minimise their time spent participating in the experiment. A recent experience-based effort task controlled for time and found that risk preferences were stable irrespective of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mason et al. 2022</ref>).</p><p>The fourfold risk pattern succinctly summarises how changes in probability and magnitude influence people's risk preferences for (monetary) outcomes. In both effort experiments here, people who preferred lower-effort options also showed a fourfold pattern in their risk preferences, but in the opposite direction compared to monetary gambles. In Experiment 3 we replicated the direction of the classic fourfold risk pattern in the decisionsfrom-description literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>, using the same numerical outcomes and probabilities as were used in the first effort task. Although the general pattern is well established, the specific conditions and associated patterns (e.g., that people are riskaverse for rare losses) have typically been examined across rather than within experiments.</p><p>Each experiment here used a full set of gambles that included both rare and common probabilities and increases and decreases in magnitude. The monetary control condition (Exp 3) thus provides a clear empirical example of the fourfold pattern when all four conditions are included in a single experiment.</p><p>The current study details how people trade off risk and effort, in the absence of changes in extrinsic reward. The study extends the previous research which has examined uncertainty in effort during experience-based decision-making, where the probabilities and outcomes were learned through repeated experience with feedback (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Apps et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mason et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, in a physical-effort task, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nagengast et al. (2011)</ref> found that people were risk seeking to avoid effort; another recent paper, using a similar clicking paradigm to the current paper, found that people were overall risk averse for effort, but were more risk seeking for easy-effort problems compared to harder-effort problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mason et al., 2022)</ref>. These studies, however, did not study the impact of rare outcomes on effort risk preference and only included common risk probabilities. In our study, for the common described problems, participants were more risk seeking for the harder problems (i.e., increases in effort) compared to easier problems (i.e., decreases in effort). This pattern is opposite to the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mason et al. (2022)</ref> in their experience-based task. With monetary outcomes, risk preferences often differ depending on whether decisions are based on description or experience, known as the "description-experience gap" (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ludvig &amp; Spetch, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Olschewski et al., 2023)</ref>. These differences in risk preferences based on the information format indicate that this description-experience gap extends beyond rewarding outcomes to effort-based choices as well.</p><p>Despite this evidence of a potential decision-experience gap in effort-based risk preferences, there are still some further inconsistences in the literature. Another experiencebased study found that people were risk averse for cognitive effort (number of attention shifts required within a time period) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Apps et al., 2015)</ref>. A possible explanation for this inconsistency is the different types of effort tasks used. Previous work has suggested that physical and mental effort might be underpinned by different structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Apps et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The two effort tasks used in the current study aimed to measure different types of effort, but there is likely to be considerable overlap <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Thomson &amp; Oppenheimer, 2022</ref>  </p></div>

It is not yet clear whether these patterns would hold across purely physical or cognitive effort-based tasks or if such a distinction between cognitive and physical effort truly exists. This paper extends the study of risk preferences to effort-based decisions and demonstrates a clear fourfold pattern of risk preferences in effort, but one which varies across individuals. These individual patterns of choice in the current study reveal the heterogenous nature of risk preferences for effort and have important implications for real-world effort problems. The systematic differences in risk preferences for effort may help us understand individual differences in motivation and its associated disorders and why some people choose to avoid effortful options such as walking the longer route home, while others will take that risk, even if it involves potentially trudging through the mud.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>12</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>50</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>31</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>16</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>48</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>32</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>56</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>33</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>20</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>48</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>34</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>25</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>45</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>35</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>25</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>47</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>36</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>19</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>55</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>37</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>25</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>51</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>38</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>15</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>63</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>39</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>25</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>55</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>40</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>13</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>69</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>41</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell>Decrease</cell><cell>Common</cell><cell>20</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>64</cell><cell>0.5</cell><cell>42</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

For each of the 20 rare and common problems an expected value of between 30 and 49 is sampled without replacement. This is repeated for increases and decreases.</p><p>2. For the equiprobable problems a range is sampled from between 10 and 29 and the range is subtracted from the EV to create Option 1 and added to the EV to create option 2.</p><p>3. For the rare problems a value for the Risky Option 1 (p=.9) was sampled from between 10 and 29. The value of Risky Option 2 (p=.1) was calculated to maintain the expected value. 4. To create the effort value preference trials we randomly sampled 8 of the common problems from both increases and decreases. For half the problems the risky option was strictly dominant and for the other half the fixed option was strictly dominant.</p><p>We then randomly sampled a number between 5 and 10 and this and added or subtracted from the fixed or risky option in order to create a strictly dominant option.</p><p>For Experiment 2 the 96 problems are the same problems as used in Experiments 1 and 3 but to account for the fact that the adding task takes more time than the previous effort task, each problem has been divided by 10 and rounded to the nearest integer. For the effort preference trials , some problems had to then be manually adjusted to ensure that one option was strictly dominant. </p></div>			</div>
