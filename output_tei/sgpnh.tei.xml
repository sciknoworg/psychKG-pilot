			<abstract>
				<p>Military personnel are often required to make perceptual decisions based on noisy and uncertain information. Over the last decade, work from experiments using simple stimuli in visual psychophysical paradigms has provided evidence that in the visual periphery, observers are often prone to false alarms and variable confidence judgments in detection tasks. To better understand whether these characteristics extend to more naturalistic paradigms, our research group has developed visual detection experiments in virtual reality, where on each trial, observers are required to first fixate on specific objects, and then make judgments about whether a target (i.e., a green soldier in uniform) is present, and rate confidence in this decision. Inevitably, extending the study of peripheral vision to virtual reality involves trade-offs, with tension between the degree of experimental control that is employed and the ecological validity of the task. In this piece, we focus on the challenges that emerged and the lessons we have learned in pursuit of designs that strike a balance between these factors. In our first experiment, we required participants to ride in an automatically-controlled vehicle, fixate on each red stop sign, and determine whether targets were present in the periphery while looking at the stop sign. Results indicated that observers (1) did not successfully fulfill fixation requirements in the task in all trials, and (2) requiring targets to appear and disappear based on whether a fixation requirement was met resulted in flickering that served as an unintentional, salient cue. In our second experiment, we allowed participants to navigate the vehicle themselves, while again requiring the same fixation requirement and perceptual judgments at each intersection. Initial tests of this design found that variability in how participants navigated in the vehicles sometimes resulted in stopping at locations that did not allow for viewing the stop sign and soldier at the same moment. Finally, in our third experiment, we manipulated the presence of the targets on each trial, and expanded our confidence questions to include both target-present and targetabsent trials. Results revealed that confidence was similar in both target-present and targetabsent conditions. Based on these preliminary findings, we outline design-related recommendations for studies of the periphery, and explain the tradeoffs that extend across several military-relevant tasks, including both target detection and visual search. Finally, we also share our code to facilitate eye tracking in the HTC Vive Pro, as well as our target detection tasks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Peripheral vision (everything outside ~5° around the fovea <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vater et al., 2022)</ref>) differs from foveal vision in many important ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rosenholtz, 2016)</ref>. Empirical studies contrasting the two have documented specific domains in which the periphery is impoverished compared to foveal vision, including contrast sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Crassini et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wright &amp; Johnston, 1983)</ref>, color sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hansen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wooten &amp; Wald, 1973)</ref>, and the degree to which crowding impairs character and object perception in the periphery <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harrison &amp; Bex, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Levi, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Whitney &amp; Levi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xia et al., 2020)</ref>. Much research has probed where these differences arise, spanning mechanisms from the retina <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Curcio et al., 1990)</ref> to the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Yu et al., 2015)</ref>. Interestingly, despite noted limitations, peripheral vision is not always worse than central vision. For example, peripheral vision thrives in low-light conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Von Noorden, 1963)</ref>, but humans still often trust information from central vision more than peripheral vision in dark conditions, even when they shouldn't <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gloriani &amp; Schütz, 2019)</ref>. Events can also be perceived earlier in peripheral vision compared to central vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jovanovic &amp; Mamassian, 2020)</ref>. Further, scene perception has been shown to be surprisingly robust for peripheral vision compared to central vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Trouilloud et al., 2020)</ref>. Taken together, a complex picture has emerged in which peripheral vision makes important and notable contributions to performance on many real-world tasks, despite limitations in some domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rosenholtz, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Vater et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Two tasks with military relevance that involve important contributions by peripheral vision are visual search and yes/no detection paradigms. In visual search tasks, observers look for targets among distractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wolfe, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wolfe, , 2021</ref>. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lleras et al. (2022)</ref>, types of visual search can be categorized by conditions where targets differ from distractors by a particular feature (feature search), when targets are defined by two features, one of which is shared by distractors (conjunction search), or when situations require searching for objects embedded in real-world scenes. Recent theories of visual search posit that peripheral vision may reduce the number of locations that contain the target <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lleras et al., 2020)</ref> or directly compare items when the similarity between targets and distractors is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hulleman &amp; Olivers, 2017)</ref>. In this sense, peripheral vision likely plays a more critical role in visual search than previously assumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vater et al., 2022)</ref>, despite foveal vision playing the final role in determining the identity or presence of a target. Another line of work has focused on decision-making biases in peripheral vision using yes/no detection tasks, rather than visual search. In different versions of these tasks, the distance of visual targets from foveal vision is fixed or controlled, to ensure that peripheral vision's perceptual capacities are directly assessed. This line of research has shown that observers are often prone to thinking that simple visual targets are present, even when they are not, in the periphery <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pruitt et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rahnev et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Solovey et al., 2015)</ref>. Interestingly, this type of detection bias for targets has been shown to extend to more naturalistic scenarios implemented in video-game-like environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Li et al., 2018)</ref>. Preliminary evidence also indicates that peripheral vision may be prone to suboptimal metacognition, as confidence judgments are sometimes higher than they should be in conditions in which observers are incorrect in their judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Odegaard et al., 2018)</ref>, but more research is needed to characterize the perceptual and metacognitive decision-making profiles in research outside the fovea <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Toscani et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>A better understanding of how perceptual and metacognitive decisions unfold in visual search and yes/no target detection across the visual periphery is of critical importance for military personnel. Across different branches of the military, soldiers, and sailors must often make rapid perceptual decisions about (1) when targets are either present or absent in the environment, and (2) if a target is present, what action to take. In order to better understand how decision-making profiles may deviate from optimality, and whether observers can be trained to make better decisions with different types of training and feedback, it is imperative to develop realistic scenarios that can effectively assess both perceptual and metacognitive sensitivity across situations that vary in terms of overall environmental context (urban, suburban, rural), the number of potential targets in a scene, the time pressures to make decisions, and many other factors. Visual experiments using low-level psychophysical paradigms have revealed interesting findings regarding perception and metacognition in the periphery <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Knotts et al., 2019)</ref>, but what is currently needed are methods that can assess decision-making in both foveal and peripheral vision in immersive environments. To that end, recent studies incorporating virtual reality have shown promise, including tasks involving visual search <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(David et al., 2021)</ref> and the detection and awareness of certain perceptual attributes in the periphery, such as color <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cohen et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we describe three experiments that we performed as we developed and refined a virtual reality task to assess yes/no target detection in the visual periphery. Specifically, we aimed to design a task where observers drove down a suburban road and had to make judgments about (1) whether a target (a green soldier) was present (or absent), and (2) how confident observers were in their judgments. Our goal was to design an experimental paradigm that could explore the decision-making profiles of observers in the visual periphery. Inevitably, these types of real-world tasks raise many challenges and questions regarding the control, design, and execution of tasks to assess peripheral vision. For example, how can the distance between fixation and target presence be systematically manipulated? What problems arise in trying to assess peripheral vision when both head movement and eye movement are allowed to vary? If fixation is unconstrained, should the time or appearance of targets on the screen be altered to minimize the chance observers fixate on the item?</p><p>In this paper, we outline critical design-related issues that arose when developing the first iterations of our experiments, how we addressed and overcame these challenges, and the trade-offs that inevitably exist when assessing yes/no detection and visual search tasks in virtual reality environments. Following a discussion of results and issues in each experiment, we provide guidelines with suggestions for future directions for this line of research. To anticipate, the study of peripheral vision is more than possible with systems that incorporate eye tracking (e.g., the HTC Vive Pro), but tension remains between the degree of experimental control and ecological validity in virtual reality. We conclude with a brief discussion of current theoretical issues in the study of peripheral vision, a review of a few empirical studies of interest, and close with comments on the importance of extending this line of work to visual search tasks in military contexts. Lastly, we note that as a part of this project, our eye tracking code for the HTC Vive Pro and Unity-based task environments are publicly available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, we aimed to assess how effectively humans could detect targets (and rate confidence) for judgments about items outside the center of the visual field. In pursuit of this aim, we created a new detection task using virtual reality: on each trial, observers were passengers in a moving car in a suburban environment and were instructed to fixate on specific traffic signs (i.e., red stop signs), while making decisions about when a green soldier emerged in the periphery. The first version of the task that we piloted identified an important issue: while participants were sometimes able to maintain fixation on the stop signs while making decisions about target/presence absence in the periphery, occasionally, their fixation would go outside the region of interest. In this first version, we coded the task so that the target disappeared when the fixation condition was not met, but this resulted in a "flickering" of the target on the screen on some trials as the observer's fixation points flirted with the edge of the ROI, and the flickering served as a salient cue which aided target detection. Thus, a question emerged: if fixation conditions are not met when attempting to study peripheral vision, what should happen to the target? In the final version of Experiment 1 described below, we made a choice to have the target remain visible when fixation was violated. In our Results, we report performance metrics across observers in our task, to document how effectively participants could fixate on a peripheral location when making decisions about targets outside the fovea.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>All experiment procedures were approved by the University of Florida's Institutional Review Board (IRB no. 202200922), and participants were recruited via the University of Florida's SONA participant recruitment system. Participants filled out an informed consent form prior to participation. The experiment lasted up to 60 minutes, and participants were compensated 3 SONA credits for their time. Participants were recruited to be 18 years or older; required to have normal or corrected to normal vision without glasses; and required to not have a history of seizures, epilepsy stroke or motion sickness. Seventy-five participants from the University of Florida attended the experiment session. The session was divided into two parts, with 20 trials in each part. Regarding data exclusion, we (1) excluded six participants who only successfully fixated on the stop sign on fewer than 23.7% of trials (two standard deviations from the mean across subjects); (2) we also note that we excluded specific trials for each participant where fixation was violated, before computing measures of performance and confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus and Stimuli</head><p>To display the visual stimuli of the VR environment and monitor the experiment, this study used a BenQ PD3200Q monitor and a Dell Precision 7865 Tower computer equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card (NVIDIA Corp., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Participants used an HTC Vive Pro Eye to perform the task, which features dual AMOLED displays with a combined resolution of 2880 x 1600 pixels, a 110-degree field of view, a 90 Hz refresh rate, and eye tracking capabilities to facilitate a fully immersive virtual environment.</p><p>The experiment was programmed using Unity 2022.2.8f1 and streamed with SteamVR 2.7.4. The virtual environment for Experiment 1 was created using Unity free assets from the Unity Asset Store: specifically, Simplepoly City -Low Poly Asset, US Road Signs Free, and City People Lite. Throughout the virtual driving environment, participants were seated in an autonomous vehicle programmed to automatically stop at 40 stop signs, pausing for 5 seconds at each. Participants were explicitly instructed to focus their gaze on the closest red stop sign when the vehicle was stopped. Utilizing the SteamVR eye-tracking Version 2.0, once this fixation requirement was met, the target-a soldier created using the Unity free asset Low Poly Soldiers Demo-appeared at a predetermined location in the visual periphery. Whenever the participants perceived a soldier, the instructions noted that they should (1) report the presence of the soldier via the trigger on a hand-held controller, and then (2) report their confidence in this judgment via a dialogue-box that popped up on the screen. In Experiment 1, targets appeared in 80% of trials (i.e., when the gaze was fixated on the stop sign while the vehicle was stopped) and nothing appeared in 20% of trials. The location of the target was the same across all participants, as soldiers appeared in the same location at each trial for each individual.</p><p>As noted above, the primary issue with our first experimental design involved determining what to do with the target when the eye position deviated from the stop sign. Piloting indicated that eye position that flirted with the edges of the ROI around the stop sign caused the soldiers to flicker; the soldiers appeared and disappeared repeatedly, serving as a noticeable cue to signal target presence for participants. Therefore, we decided to allow the soldier to appear when the participant's gaze was directed at the stop sign and to remain visible throughout the five-second viewing period (the soldier remained on the screen as the vehicle drove to the next intersection, if it was not detected by the participant). With this paradigm, we could explore how frequently participants violated fixation requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Before the experimental task, participants underwent an eye-tracking calibration using SteamVR Tracking Version 2.0 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A)</ref>. After completing the eye-tracking calibration, participants read specific, written instructions that were placed in a text box on the screen ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>) and conducted a practice version of the task with 4 stop signs. This allowed us to confirm that the eye-tracking calibration was successful, and that they understood the instructions. The main task, with 40 stop signs, was divided into two parts with 20 stop signs each. Each trial in the experiment proceeded as follows: Participants were instructed to keep their gaze focused on the stop sign area within the boundary line (the stop sign object was set to a scale of X: 0.134, Y: 1, and Z: 0.134; for reference, other passing car objects in the project were uniformly sized at X: 1, Y: 1, and Z: 1). When participants looked at the stop sign, the soldier immediately appeared in their peripheral vision. These soldiers could appear anywhere from very close to the stop sign ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>) to considerably further away (specifically, the object distances from the center of the stop sign ranged from 0 to 40 meters for size and from -15 to 15 meters for eccentricity). Participants were instructed to report when they perceived the soldier by pressing the trigger button on the controller. This action paused the autonomous driving, and caused a confidence rating box to appear ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>), which allowed participants to rate their confidence in their target-present judgment on a scale of 1 (not confident at all) to 4 (very confident). If participants did not report seeing a soldier on a given trial, the autonomous vehicle stopped at the stop sign for 5 seconds before resuming. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In Experiment 1, participants were excluded from data analysis based on their ROI fixation success rate. The participants' ROI fixation success rates ranged from 0% to 100%, with an overall average of 81.3%. As mentioned earlier, six participants whose fixation success rate did not exceed two standard deviations from the mean across subjects were excluded. Excluding the six participants, the fixation success rates of those included in the data analysis ranged from 27.5% to 100%, with an overall average of 88%.</p><p>We used the hit rate and false alarm rate to estimate the participants' detection performance in Experiment 1. Performance in this first experiment was quite good: participants exhibited a high average hit rate (0.81), and the average confidence level for hit trials was 3.79. The false alarm rate was also low, with an average of 0.07, and the confidence level for false alarm trials was 2.83. The average miss rate was also low, with an average of 0.13, and the average correct rejection rate across subjects was 0.82.</p><p>We also compared hit rates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) and confidence levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>) as a function of size and eccentricity by binning how tall the soldier was (our size variable) and how far away it was from the center of the stop sign (our eccentricity variable) into quartiles. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  2A</ref>, as expected, hit rates decreased as the overall size of the soldier on the screen decreased: The average hit rate for size quartile 1 (the largest quartile) was 0.92, for size quartile 2 it was 0.89, for size quartile 3 it was 0.86, and for size quartile 4 it was 0.77. A one-way ANOVA was conducted to assess the significance of statistical differences between the hit rates by size quartiles, which revealed a significant effect (F(3, 65)=12.51, p=0.00). The effect size, as measured by eta squared (η²), was found to be 0.12, indicating a large effect according to Cohen's criteria. These results suggest that the hit rates significantly varied across size quartiles, indicating that size played a crucial role in participants' responses. Similarly, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>, hit rates also decreased with eccentricity. The average for the closest trials (quartile 1) was 0.98, for eccentricity quartile 2 it was 0.83, for eccentricity quartile 3 it was 0.81, and for eccentricity quartile 4 it was 0.80. A one-way ANOVA was conducted to assess the significance of statistical differences between the hit rates by eccentricity quartiles, with F(3, 65)=22.47, p-value=0.00, η²=0.20. These results suggest that the hit rates significantly varied across eccentricity quartiles, indicating a large effect according to Cohen's criteria.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, confidence levels were high in successful detections, both by size and eccentricity. The confidence level for size quartile 1 was 3.89, for size quartile 2 it was 3.74, for size quartile 3 it was 3.84, and for size quartile 4 it was 3.70. An ANOVA was conducted to assess the significance of statistical differences between the confidence level by size quartiles, with F(3, 65) =6.61, p-value=0.00, η²=0.07. These results suggest that the confidence level significantly varied across size quartiles, indicating a medium effect according to Cohen's criteria. Similarly, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>, the confidence level for eccentricity quartile 1 was 3.79, for eccentricity quartile 2 it was 3.76, and for eccentricity quartiles 3 and 4 it was 3.78. An ANOVA was conducted to assess the significance of statistical differences between the confidence level by eccentricity quartiles, with F(3, 65)=0.19, p-value=0.90, η²=0.00. These results suggest that the confidence level did not significantly vary across eccentricity quartiles, indicating a negligible effect according to Cohen's criteria.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>In our second experiment, we employed the same environment as Experiment 1, but added a second task to the paradigm that observers had to perform in between stop-sign fixations. Specifically, we aimed to assess the effect of requiring participants to manually drive the car with the hand-held controller, stop within a reasonable distance of each stop-sign, and then fixate the stop sign. The purpose of this was to evaluate if requiring driving would influence any head movements, eye movements, or perceptual judgments made outside the center of the visual field within the same environment as in Experiment 1. Adding a second driving task (despite the task not occurring simultaneously with the detection task) raises interesting questions: for example, what controls should be imposed to ensure that there isn't too much variability in where observers stop at intersections? That is, if a fixation condition must be met to make targets emerge, what are the preconditions that must be met before this happens (i.e., should the car be stopped? Should it have to be within a specific distance from the stop sign?) We noticed in piloting our second experiment that if participants were given free rein to stop wherever they wanted near the intersection, a problem emerged: sometimes, participants would pull too far into the intersection, because fixating the stop sign required them to move both their heads and eyes to such a large degree that on some trials, targets were no longer visible in their field of view. Therefore, in the final version of Experiment 2, we imposed an invisible "wall" that forcibly stopped their vehicle before it ran too far into the intersection to allow for both the fixation target (stop sign) and the soldier to be visible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The study recruited participants using the same procedure as Experiment 1. We obtained a total of fifteen participants. The session was divided into two parts. Regarding data exclusion, we (1) excluded two participants who only successfully fixated on the stop sign on fewer than 48.4% of trials (two standard deviations from the mean across subjects); (2) we also note that we excluded specific trials for each participant where fixation was violated, before computing measures of performance and confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus and Stimuli</head><p>Experiment 2 used the same apparatus and stimuli as Experiment 1, and as in Experiment 1, we designed the study so that soldiers appeared in 80% of the 40 trials. Participants drove using the controller's touchpad, with the movement constrained to the forward and backward directions. When creating the task, our main challenge in the experimental design was determining where participants should stop to ensure that the soldier would appear, since drivers exhibited variability in where they chose to stop the vehicle at the intersection. In Experiment 1, the autonomous vehicle was programmed to stop at a distance where the user's gaze could interact with the stop sign. However, in Experiment 2, since participants were driving the vehicle themselves, there was a possibility that if they did not stop within a range where their gaze could interact with the stop sign, the soldier would not appear as intended by the experimental design. Some drivers could choose to stop too far from the stop sign, which could prevent the soldier pop-up from being triggered. In contrast, an overly aggressive driver might stop at or past the stop sign while looking toward it, and this could cause them to successfully fulfill the fixation requirement, but for the soldier to no longer be shown in the display when it appeared (due to the field of view shifting).</p><p>Thus, after seeing this occur in many examples during our pilot of this experiment, we designed an invisible wall at the ideal location where participants were supposed to stop. The wall was designed to ensure that participants stopped at the proper location, allowing them to view the stop sign, and also preventing them from moving on if they had yet to fixate properly. If they were conservative drivers and stopped too early, thinking they had already seen the stop sign and attempting to move on, the wall would stop them when they reached the proper position, guiding them to recognize that the area was the correct spot to stop for the stop sign. Additionally, if they were aggressive drivers and attempted to pass by without focusing on the stop sign at the proper location, the wall would stop them and prompt them to recognize the correct stopping area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In Experiment 2, data exclusion was based on the ROI fixation success rate prior to hit rate analysis. The participants' ROI fixation success rates ranged from 37.5% to 100%, with an overall average of 88.1%. As mentioned earlier, two participants whose fixation success rate did not exceed two standard deviations from the mean across subjects were excluded. Excluding the two participants, the fixation success rates of those included in the data analysis ranged from 77.5% to 100%, with an overall average of 95.1%.</p><p>We used the hit rate and false alarm rate to estimate the participants' detection performance in Experiment 2. The average hit rate was 0.86, and the average confidence level for hit trials was 3.84. The average false alarm rate was 0.14, and the average confidence level for false alarm trials was 2.54. Further, the average miss rate was 0.09 and the average correct rejection rate was 0.80.</p><p>We also compared hit rates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>) and confidence levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>) using the mean values to estimate the effects of size and eccentricity quartiles. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>, hit rates decreased with size. The hit rate for size quartile 1 was 0.97, for size quartile 2 it was 0.94, for size quartile 3 it was 0.87, and for size quartile 4 it was 0.83. ANOVA was conducted to assess the significance of statistical differences between the hit rates by size quartiles, with F(3, 9)=3.95, p-value=0.01, η²=0.20. These results suggest that the hit rate significantly varies across size quartiles, indicating a large effect according to Cohen's criteria. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  4B</ref>, hit rates decreased with eccentricity. The hit rate for eccentricity quartile 1 was 0.97, for eccentricity quartile 2 it was 0.91, for eccentricity quartile 3 and 4 it was 0.87. An ANOVA was conducted to assess the significance of statistical differences between the hit rates by eccentricity quartiles, with F(3, 9)=2.19, p-value=0.10, η²=0.12. These results suggest that the hit rate did not significantly vary across eccentricity quartiles, indicating a large effect according to Cohen's criteria.</p><p>Similarly, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5A</ref>, confidence levels for size were high in successful detections. The confidence level for size quartile 1 was 3.84, for size quartile 2 it was 3.92, for size quartile 3 it was 3.79, and for size quartile 4 it was 3.83. ANOVA was conducted to assess the significance of statistical differences between the confidence level by size quartiles, with F(3, 9)=0.52, p-value=0.67, η²=0.03. These results suggest that the confidence level did not significantly vary across size quartiles, indicating a medium effect according to Cohen's criteria. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5B</ref>, the confidence levels for eccentricity were high in successful detections. The confidence level for eccentricity quartiles 1 and 2 was 3.84, and for eccentricity quartiles 3 and 4 it was 3.81. ANOVA was conducted to assess the significance of statistical differences between the confidence level by eccentricity quartiles, with F(3, 9)=0.05, p-value=0.98, η²=0.00. These results suggest that the confidence level did not significantly vary across eccentricity quartiles, indicating a negligible effect according to Cohen's criteria.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>In Experiment 3, we added confidence judgments after target-absent and miss trials (in addition to target-present trials), and also reduced target presence from 80% to 50% of trials. Research on visual decision-making has shown that observers tend to miss rare targets in visual detection tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Evans et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rich et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wolfe, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wolfe et al., 2013)</ref>, and accordingly, Signal Detection Theory predicts that the criterion observers use to make judgments can differ based on the expectation that observers may have for how often signals are present <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wickens, 2002)</ref>. Thus, although the primary goal of this task was to provide a preliminary assessment of how confidence judgments differ between target present and target absent conditions, these types of manipulations also can be used to assess how the perceptual criterion in observers is modified by expectations of how often targets appear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The study recruited participants using the same procedure as Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. We obtained a total of twenty-two participants that successfully completed the task. The session was divided into two parts. Regarding data exclusion, we (1) excluded two participants who only successfully fixated on the stop sign on fewer than 29.7% of trials (two standard deviations from the mean across subjects); (2) we also note that we excluded specific trials for each participant where fixation was violated, before computing measures of performance and confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus and Stimuli</head><p>Experiment 3 used the same apparatus and stimuli as Experiment 1. As mentioned before, the soldier pop-up trials accounted for 50% of all trials in the task. To enable a more comprehensive analysis, Experiment 3 collected confidence ratings for every trial, including those in which participants did not report seeing the soldier. If participants reported seeing the soldier within the 5 seconds that the vehicle automatically stopped during a trial, the confidence rating box would pop up, and participants would indicate their confidence level on a scale from 1 to 4. In contrast, if participants did not report seeing the soldier during the 5 seconds of the stop, a confidence rating box would pop up before the driving resumed, allowing participants to indicate how confident they were about not seeing the soldier.</p><p>To eliminate any cues that could create bias in participants' responses regarding the presence of soldiers or whether they saw the soldier, we decided to use the same confidence rating pop-up box across target-present and target-absent trials (How confident are you? 1: I am not confident at all ~ 4: I am very confident). But, in the initial instructions before the experiment, we used phrasing such as "You will also be asked to rate how confident you are in your judgment (whether you saw a soldier and pressed the trigger, or whether you don't think a soldier was shown and didn't push the button)."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In Experiment 3, participants to be excluded from data analysis were selected based on their ROI fixation success rate prior to hit rate analysis. The participants' ROI fixation success rates ranged from 12.5% to 100%, with an overall average of 82.3%. As mentioned earlier, two participants whose fixation success rate did not exceed two standard deviations from the mean across subjects were excluded. Excluding the two participants, the fixation success rates of those included in the data analysis ranged from 35% to 100%, with an overall average of 88.6%.</p><p>We first computed the average hit rate and false alarm rate to estimate the participants' detection performance in Experiment 3. The average hit rate was 0.57, and the average confidence level for hit trials was 3.09. The average false alarm rate was 0.33, and the average confidence level for false alarm trials was 3.13. Miss rate was 0.33 and correct rejection rate was 0.55.</p><p>For Experiment 3, since we collected confidence levels for all 40 trials, we compared the average confidence for target-present and target-absent trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>). As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>, the average confidence level for target-present trials was 2.80, while the confidence level for target-absent trials was 2.78. A paired samples t-test was performed to compare between the confidence levels for soldier-present and soldier-absent trials. There was not a significant difference in confidence level for soldier-present (M=2.80, SE=0.13) and soldier-absent (M=2.78, SE=0.11) trials; t(19)=0.12, p-value=0.90. The effect size, calculated using Cohen's d, was d=0.03, indicating a negligible effect according to Cohen's criteria. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The study of perceptual decision-making in ecologically valid and naturalistic environments always involves tradeoffs with how effectively one can control variables of interest, and how accurately one captures the free-flowing dynamics of observers' eye movements and the movement of objects in the world. Military personnel such as soldiers and sailors are often required to make rapid perceptual decisions based on noisy and uncertain information; thus, it is important to try to understand (1) the types of decision-making biases that extend across the visual field when observers make detection, discrimination, or identification judgments based on information outside the fovea, and (2) how peripheral vision and central vision interact in tasks requiring visual search, since foveal vision is often required to make the final judgment. In this paper, we outlined how we pursued the study of (1), as we developed paradigms to systematically manipulate the distance between where the eyes are fixated, and where targets emerge in a naturalistic visual scene. Across our three experiments, we showed that (1) fixating items in the periphery is challenging when the task requires peripheral judgments with the eyes held steady, (2) when motor-related elements are added (such as operating a vehicle on roads in a virtual reality environment), it may still be necessary to place constraints on where participants can move to, to ensure that fixated objects and targets can still be presented in the field of view, and (3) that it is important to assess both target presence and target absence, as the rate of target frequency could potentially impact detection or confidence-related behaviors.</p><p>Thus, if the goal is to use virtual reality to study peripheral vision, we have several considerations that must be reviewed, to determine whether the right balance between ecological validity and experimental control has been met to answer specific research questions of interest. First, based on results from experiment 1, it appears that it is easier for observers to fixate on a target in the center of the screen when objects emerge in the periphery, compared to requiring observers to fixate on a target that is (at first) in a peripheral location, and having targets pop out at eccentric portions of the visual field. This is based on contrasting results in this paper with previous empirical work from a senior author in our group: in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Li et al., 2018)</ref>, observers drove down a suburban road and fixated on a stoplight that hung over the road; once this was fixated, targets popped out at the same location in the periphery on every trial, and observers used covert attention to make judgments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> showed that observers successfully met the fixation requirement in 98.42% of trials. In Experiment 1 in this paper, observers drove down a suburban road and fixated on red stop signs on the side of the road; once a stop sign was fixated, targets popped out at variable locations in the periphery, and observers used covert attention to make judgments. Granted, the two studies differ in important ways: Li et al. used a standard computer monitor and SMI REDn eye tracker, and here we used an HTV Vive Pro for both display and eye tracking. Li et al. also had targets emerge in the same location on every trial, but in our study, we introduced positional uncertainty for where targets could emerge. Thus, while the lower rate of success for fixation (88%, including only participants who met the fixation success threshold after excluding those who violated it) in our study compared to the previous work (98.42%) could be driven in part by hardware or stimulus differences, we note that if the goal is to assess the decision-making profile for peripheral vision by systematically manipulating distance from the fovea, it may be easier for observers to do so when the fixation requirement involves something near the center of the screen, like a stoplight above a road.</p><p>Second, we note that when systematically manipulating distance from the fovea to assess peripheral vision, a choice must be made regarding the position of stimuli: stimuli can either appear anywhere in the visual display, regardless of whether it is plausible in a real-world environment, or stimuli may be forced to only appear in locations that are possible, given environmental constraints. In our experiments, we made the choice to only allow soldiers to appear in the periphery at locations that were possible in the real world, and we used the same environment to test each observer. Thus, our paradigm involves a tradeoff between (1) introducing order effects and expectations about where stimuli can appear, and (2) true randomization that allows systematic sampling of all possible distances from the fovea. In the real world, expectations about where stimuli can appear are constrained by where and how targets might be hiding in environments, and thus, we think our virtual reality tasks here capture these constraints effectively, but this comes at the cost of capturing a wider sample of eccentricities, as well as assessing target detection in environments where the placement is truly randomized. Future studies could attempt to increase the number of trials or relax these constraints if these variables are of interest.</p><p>Third, we noticed (especially based on results from our second experiment) that when trying to systematically manipulate the relationship between where the eyes are looking and potential targets could emerge, there is another variable that could influence whether participants could see the target at all: head position. If participants need to look at something off to the side of a virtual reality display, they can make a choice about how far to turn their necks to do so, and this introduces variability in whether the visible display field in virtual reality may or may not include the target. This is an extremely important factor to consider in paradigms that allow participants to freely drive or move, as in our Experiment 2, where we noticed in a first version of the task that if participants drove too far into the intersection, they could not properly fixate the stop sign and see the soldier. Thus, our recommendation on this point relates to our first point: if the goal is to try to systematically manipulate the relationship between fixation position and eye movements, it may be best to (1) place constraints on exactly how far or where participants can move to, and (2) attempt to place fixation targets close to wherever participants are required to move or act in the scene, to avoid having scenarios where the head rotates to such a degree that the item of interest is no longers shown.</p><p>Overall, with the lessons learned from these three experiments, research can move forward with more systematically characterizing the decision-making profiles across the visual field, systematically characterizing how different types of decisions (detection, discrimination, identification), metacognitive requirements (i.e., confidence judgments), contexts (urban, suburban, rural, with varying numbers of moving objects, lighting conditions, etc.) and time constraints (how rapidly participants must make decisions) all influence decisions. However, critically, we note that the ultimate example of military relevance may ultimately lie not in assessing the decision-making biases that exist across the visual field, but in how peripheral vision may interact with central vision as different types of visual judgments are made. For example, research on visual search has provided many important findings showing that peripheral vision contributes to the identification of targets, including how summary statistics computed by the periphery may aid search <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rosenholtz et al., 2012)</ref>, how peripheral vision encodes locations that are likely to contain the target <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lleras et al., 2022)</ref> and guides locations to which observers can make saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Erkelens &amp; Hooge, 1996)</ref>, how task difficulty and fixation time influence the role that peripheral vision may play <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hooge &amp; Erkelens, 1999)</ref>, and many other factors. Thus, moving forward, identifying the role that peripheral vision plays in guiding how the eyes move to specific locations to aid detection, discrimination, and identification of targets in central vision during visual search may ultimately provide the most fruitful endeavor for future military-inspired work.</p><p>Along those lines, we think the previous findings of detection biases in the periphery are worthy of further consideration: why, across several lines of psychophysical research, have studies shown that observers have a tendency to think targets are present, even when they are not, especially in peripheral and unattended parts of the visual field? <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pruitt et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rahnev et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Solovey et al., 2015)</ref> One hypothesis is that perhaps these liberal detection biases motivate a saccade to the possible location to gather more information. While there is still potential for these detection biases to be accounted for by purely cognitive mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abid, 2019)</ref>, a promising line of research could be found in better understanding how the decisionmaking biases that exist across the visual field may interact with processes in central vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Roux-Sibilon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stewart et al., 2020)</ref>, during visual search or other tasks, too.</p><p>In this manuscript, we explored how perceptual decision-making in virtual reality environments can facilitate exploration of decision-making profiles across the visual periphery. In our detection task, across three experiments, we assessed the ability of observers to fixate peripheral targets and use covert attention to make judgments, how adding in motor-related demands during a task can influence findings, and the role that target prevalence may play in characterizing how observers make decisions. Moving forward, with the guidance provided in this section, we aim to further explore the roles that decision complexity, context, and time constraints have in influencing observers' decisions in the periphery, with the ultimate goal of exploring how the periphery contributes to more free-flowing decisions during visual search. As the field aims to characterize not only how observers make decisions, but how they can make better decisions that reduce biases that have been previously reported, we think the field should further explore the role that training may play in reduce decision and metacognitive biases in the periphery <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Romeas et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zwierko, 2007)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Task design for Experiment 1.
