<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many of our decisions are guided by imperfect information about latent variables that govern our experiences. For example, to infer the quality of a restaurant, we must learn about it by trying different dishes. While doing so, small differences in the experienced quality can be written off as expected fluctuations around a baseline quality. However, unexpectedly large deviations could indicate that the quality has systematically changed, for example, because the restaurant has a new chef. In such a case, it may be necessary to update our beliefs more dramatically (and consider eating at a different restaurant). Attributing outcomes to variability or change points can be difficult in the face of uncertainty but is critical for controlling the degree to which new experiences should influence learning. Doing so effectively is crucial for adaptive behavior across the human lifespan, but on the other hand, doing so perfectly is computationally challenging and, in many situations, completely infeasible.</p><p>Previous work has identified normative mechanisms derived from principles of optimal Bayesian inference for implementing this sort of belief updating <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Behrens, Woolrich, Walton, &amp; Rushworth, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Meyniel &amp; Dehaene, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">O'Reilly et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Payzan-LeNestour, Dunne, Bossaerts, &amp; O'Doherty, 2013)</ref>. However, humans seem to deviate systematically from optimal behavior, raising questions as to whether they might rely on computationally cheaper alternatives. Computationally frugal strategies for approximating optimal inference may be resource rational in the sense that they demand less cognitive resources while ensuring a reasonable level of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Simon, 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Simon, , 1956</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The need for computationally inexpensive solutions might be particularly high when cognitive resources are limited, for example, during childhood when the relevant brain circuits are not yet fully developed or later in life when cognitive abilities are starting to diminish.

In typical decision-making and cognitive control tasks, these age groups often perseverate on previous responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blackwell, Chatham, Wiseheart, &amp; Munakata, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carroll, Blakey, &amp; FitzGibbon, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cepeda &amp; Munakata, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Crone, Jennings, &amp; Van der Molen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Crone, Ridderinkhof, Worm, Somsen, &amp; van der Molen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Head, Kennedy, Rodrigue, &amp; Raz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Munakata, Snyder, &amp; Chatham, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ridderinkhof, Span, &amp; Van Der Molen, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rutledge et al., 2009)</ref>. Conversely, when such tasks provide additional task-related cues, children and older adults show an over-reliance on available external cues or anchors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alarcón &amp; Bonardi, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chatham, Frank, &amp; Munakata, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Craik &amp; Bialystok, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gonthier, Zira, Colé, &amp; Blaye, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lindenberger &amp; Mayr, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Munakata et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Troller-Renfree, Buzzell, &amp; Fox, 2020)</ref>. Despite considerable lifespan developmental research on these topics, there is no satisfying computational account for why people are prone to these biases early and late in life.</p><p>Here, we examine the possibility that perseveration and anchoring biases across the human lifespan might result from computationally frugal belief-updating strategies calibrated to minimize cognitive resource expenditure. In particular, we propose that instead of incurring the total computational cost to update beliefs optimally, individuals approximate optimal inference by drawing "samples" from the Bayesian belief distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Daw &amp; Courville, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gershman &amp; Beck, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sanborn, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sanborn &amp; Chater, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vul, Goodman, Griffiths, &amp; Tenenbaum, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dasgupta, Schulz, &amp; Gershman, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lieder, Griffiths, Huys, &amp; Goodman, 2018)</ref>. With sufficient samples, such a strategy approximates optimal inference. However, satisfactory predictions might be achieved with even a very small number of samples, presenting a trade-off between the accuracy of beliefs and the computational cost of updating them. For instance, imagine a person thinking about a restaurant's quality after trying out a new dish <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1a)</ref>. To compute her belief about the quality, she could mentally draw samples approximating the optimal belief distribution <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. The sampling process would start from some initial value, such as the previous belief about the restaurant, and drift through different hypothetical beliefs. This could be considered a chain of thoughts where the decision-maker sequentially considers different potential beliefs about the restaurant. To minimize computational cost, the person might stop sampling when a criterion value of accuracy is reached.</p><p>We argue that differences in learning biases across the lifespan emerge because changes in cognitive resources across development shift the trade-off between the benefits and costs of sampling. When a previous belief is deemed accurate enough, it gives rise to perseveration, thereby saving cognitive resources <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b, left)</ref>. Similarly, when updating beliefs from an external anchor, an individual who tries to minimize resources may be more easily satisfied with only a small number of samples, leading to beliefs that are closer to the initial anchor (anchoring bias; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b, right)</ref>. From this perspective, it would be a rational strategy for children and older adults to integrate the costs and benefits of sampling. Thereby, they would rely on fewer samples compared to younger adults, which naturally amplifies their learning biases ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1c,d</ref>).</p><p>In the present study, we examine whether differences in learning across the lifespan emerge from efficient belief-updating mechanisms, taking into account the amount of cognitive re-sources that should be allocated to learning. We combine computational modeling with two age-comparative experiments using a predictive inference task. In the first experiment, beliefs were updated directly from their previous values. Assuming lower cognitive resources in children and older adults, a sampling model of belief updating predicts more perseveration in these groups compared to adolescents and younger adults. In line with this prediction, performance differences between age groups resulted from more perseveration in children and older adults than in adolescents and younger adults. In the second experiment, we built upon these results and manipulated the starting position from which participants had to update their predictions by providing external anchors. Here, a sampling model predicts that external anchors lead to greater anchoring biases in children and older adults. Consistent with this prediction, we found stronger anchoring biases in children and older adults compared to younger adults. Across participants, we show that greater levels of perseveration are associated with greater anchoring biases, consistent with our model's assumption that perseveration and anchoring originate from a common sampling mechanism. Taken together, our study suggests that perseveration and anchoring biases share a common cause, can emerge from a computationally frugal belief updating strategy, and are amplified in children and older adults in a manner consistent with resource rationality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>For the first experiment, we recruited 33 children, 31 adolescents, 35 younger adults, and 37 older adults from the participant pools of the Chair of Lifespan Developmental Neuroscience at Technische Universität Dresden, with participants recruited from the Dresden community. Due to errors in the data acquisition, we excluded 2 adolescents and older adults and 3 younger adults. The effective study sample consisted of 33 children (8 to 10 years, median age 9.0 years, 19 female), 29 adolescents (13 to 17 years, median age 15.0 years, 11 female), 32 younger adults (20 to 28 years, median age 24.0 years, 15 female), and 35 older adults (62 to 80 years, median age 71.0 years, 7 female). For the follow-up experiment, we recruited 34 children, 29 younger adults, and 38 older adults from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development Berlin participant pool. Due to errors in the data acquisition, we excluded 3 children and 4 younger and older adults. Here the effective study sample thus comprised 31 children (7 to 11 years, median age 9.0 years, 12 female), 25 younger adults (20 to 28 years, median age 24.0 years, 16 female), and 34 older adults (61 to 76 years, median age 67.0 years, 25 female). To compare basic psychometric profiles across our data sets and to previous work, we measured the participants' processing speed and verbal knowledge using the Identical Picture and Spot-a-Word test . The sample size was chosen based on our recent age-comparative work on learning using comparable methods . In both experiments, we obtained written informed consent from the younger and older adults. Moreover, we obtained written informed consent from the children and adolescents and their parents. The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Technische Universität Dresden ("Die Entwicklung habitueller und zielgerichteter Lern-und Entscheidungsprozesse über die Lebensspanne", protocol number: EK 276072013) and by the institutional review board of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development Berlin ("Age differences in goal-directed learning and decision making across the lifespan"). This study was not preregistered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental task</head><p>We begin with an intuitive description of the task and the experimental conditions that we applied in the first and the follow-up experiment. After that, we provide a formal description of the task structure. The task was framed in an intuitive cover story, in which a helicopter dropped bags that had to be caught by participants ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2a</ref>). Because clouds covered the sky, participants could not observe the helicopter directly, but they were required to infer the helicopter's position based on the previously dropped bags. Participants used a bucket that could be moved around via button presses to catch the bags (Prediction) using separate keys for fast movements (left: F, right: J) and slow movements (left: G, right: H). After participants had placed their buckets, they could not be adjusted anymore. Subsequently, the hidden helicopter dropped a bag (Outcome). After that, a red line indicated the prediction error, defined as the distance between the actual and predicted location of the bag (Prediction Error). Finally, participants updated their prediction of the next outcome (Update) and transitioned to the next trial.</p><p>The hidden helicopter represented the mean of a Gaussian distribution that generated the outcomes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. The standard deviation of this distribution determined the amount of variability across outcomes, framed as wind in the cover story. As a consequence, bags mostly appeared left or right to the helicopter. Occasionally, the helicopter moved to a different location (change point). Therefore, the challenge in the task was the distinction between (i) systematic changes and (ii) random influences (risk). A prediction error could thus be due to (i) a change point, which should optimally result in a considerable adjustment of the bucket towards the most recent outcome, or (ii) random variability in the outcomes attributable to risk, which should lead to more subtle bucket adjustments. Only on a few trials, when the helicopter was visible, could participants distinguish change points and random variability to adjust their predictions to the mean of the outcome-generating distribution (we refer to these trials as "catch trials" in the following). Before performing the helicopter task, participants underwent a training session described in SM Task instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First experiment</head><p>In the first experiment, we used two conditions that differed in the amount of variability across outcomes. In the first condition, bags were only weakly corrupted by the wind. Consequently, change points could more easily be distinguished from random variability. In contrast, in the second, the wind was stronger, and change points were harder to detect. These conditions were completed across four alternating task blocks, and the order of the conditions was counterbalanced between participants. Approximately half of the participants started with the low-variability condition, and the other half started with the high-variability condition. Since participants show smaller updates in the high-compared to the low-variability condition, this manipulation helped reduce the correlation between prediction errors and updates within participants . Moreover, in the high-variability condition, participants achieve less accurate predictions compared to the low-variability condition. To match the achieved performance across conditions, we increased the bucket size in the second one. Moreover, bags randomly contained gold coins or stones. The number of collected gold coins was translated into monetary reward at the end of the task, but collected stones were not rewarded. Participants were instructed that gold and stone bags were dropped by the same helicopter. However, note that whether the bags contained gold or rocks was only revealed after the bag was dropped. Consequently, to maximize the amount of reward, the best strategy was to try to catch every bag independently of what it might contain. The reward structure of the task was explicitly communicated to the participants. Additionally, for approximately half the participants, we inverted the reward value to control for potential saliency effects of the color associated with bag content. Here, rewarding bags were labeled as silver bags and neutral bags as sandbags, respectively. We included the reward manipulation to test if irrelevant reward information systematically affects participants' learning behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(McGuire, Nassar, Gold, &amp; Kable, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sharot &amp; Garrett, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lefebvre, Lebreton, Meyniel, Bourgeois-Gironde, &amp; Palminteri, 2017</ref>). Finally, the task was designed to minimize the contribution of working memory differences between the age groups to learning behavior. On each trial, we displayed the participants' previous prediction error using a red line at the bottom of the screen. At the ends of the prediction-error line, we presented tick marks that explicitly indicated the previous prediction and the previous outcome. This was done to allow participants to use this information to update their current predictions. In the instructions, we explicitly stated that the participants should update their prediction so that it falls within the range of the displayed prediction error.</p><p>Follow-up experiment In the follow-up experiment, our goal was to examine the influence of the starting location of the updating process and the reward associated with catching a bag on perseveration and estimation errors ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4a</ref>). First, in the "anchoring" condition, we manipulated the starting location of updates acting as an external anchor by replacing the initial position of the bucket. To do so, we used a Gaussian distribution with a mean equal to the previous bucket position to sample the starting position of the bucket randomly. Second, to examine the influence of reward magnitude on perseveration and anchoring, we indicated the bag content throughout the trial. This was done by displaying a '+' symbol above the bucket, which was presented in gold (for gold coins, high reward) or gray (for stones, low reward). To focus on the two above-described manipulations, we kept the amount of variability in the outcomes constant and used a variability level equal to the mean of the two conditions of the first experiment. This version of the task was divided into four task blocks (for all participants, block 1 and 3: anchoring condition; block 2 and 4: standard condition without externally provided anchor). Finally, as in the first experiment, we explicitly showed the trial-by-trial prediction errors using the red line and tick marks. Hence, in both experiments, participants had access to the same information about outcomes and predictions, and the key difference was the starting location of the prediction.</p><p>Formal description A short note on the notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bruckner, Heekeren, &amp; Ostwald, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ostwald, Bruckner, &amp; Heekeren, 2018)</ref>: We divide the formal documentation of our analyses into a task model, the description of the computational models, and the steps to evaluate and estimate the models based on behavioral data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reduced Bayesian model</head><p>The experimental task can be solved using a Bayesian change-point-detection algorithm that predicts future outcomes based on all previous outcomes . This solution requires considering all possible combinations of change points (see SM Optimal and approximate inference). However, given the unrealistic assumption that humans similarly rely on the memory of all previous trials during learning, Nassar and colleagues proposed a reduced learning model that approximates this algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Nassar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Wilson et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In the reduced Bayesian model, the learning-rate regulation depends on relative uncertainty, change-point probability, and the hazard rate. Relative uncertainty indicates the uncertainty of the model's belief about the helicopter location based on the history of outcomes relative to the variability in the environment. When the model has only observed a few outcomes, relative uncertainty tends to be higher and subsequently declines with each new observation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. After a change point, the previously learned helicopter estimate is not predictive of future outcomes anymore. Therefore, the best strategy is to restart the estimation of the helicopter position. However, because the model cannot directly observe change points, it keeps track of change-point probability, which indicates the probability of a change point based on the most recently observed outcome <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b</ref>). Change-point probability itself depends on the hazard-rate parameter, which reflects the model's assumption about the rate of change in the environment. That is, with a subjectively higher hazard-rate parameter, the model assumes more change points throughout the task. The learning rate is a weighted combination of relative uncertainty and change-point probability <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. When change-point probability is high, more recent outcomes have a greater impact on learning, whereas more distant outcomes are forgotten. When change-point probability is low, learning is mostly driven by relative uncertainty, and the model more strongly considers multiple previous outcomes.</p><p>In contrast to the task model, µ t (i.e., helicopter location) is unknown to the model and has to be learned throughout the task.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perseveration model</head><p>To model perseveration, we used the Dirac-delta function δ(a t ) = 1, a t = 0 0, otherwise</p><p>according to which perseveration probability is 0 everywhere except at 0, where it is 1. As described in the following section, we combined this perseveration model with the reduced Bayesian model, and we estimated the contribution of each model to updating behavior for each participant. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S4</ref>, we illustrate the mixture model combining the perseveration model and the reduced Bayesian model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation and estimation</head><p>We evaluated and estimated the mixture model using participants' prediction errors. That is, instead of computing a prediction error as the difference between the actual outcome x t and the learned µ t parameter of the reduced Bayesian model (see eq. (6)), we used the actual prediction errors of our participants as described in Data preprocessing. Using the participants' prediction errors is advantageous over model-based prediction errors because participant and model predictions might occasionally deviate from each other. Next to the free parameters described above, we estimated the following parameters:</p><p>• o 0 ∈ N &gt;0 is the motor-noise parameter, modeling noise in the placement of the bucket,</p><p>• o 1 ∈ N &gt;0 is the learning-rate noise parameter that accounts for increasing noise as a function of the required update magnitude,</p><p>• b 0 ∈ N is the intercept of the logistic function that determined the mixture weight between the learning and perseveration component,</p><p>• b 1 ∈ N is the slope of the same logistic function.</p><p>To evaluate the probability of the current update, we used a Gaussian distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">p εt (a t |x 1:T ) := N (a t ;â t , ε 2 t )<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">ε t := o 0 + o 1 |â t |.<label>(18)</label></formula><p>The rationale behind the motor-noise parameter o 0 and learning-rate noise parameter o 1 is that participants' reported belief updates are noisy to a certain extent. We decomposed updating noise into two different components. Motor noise reflects imprecision of the motor system (i.e., finger movements in our case), and learning-rate noise captures that larger updates tend to be more noisy than smaller updates. Thus, the ε t parameter in eq. (18) reflects a combination of these two noise components. Accordingly, trial-by-trial updates are defined to be sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to the model-predicted update a t and standard deviation ε t capturing updating noise (eq. (17)).</p><p>Next, eq. (17) reflects the predictions of the reduced Bayesian model. In order to combine the predictions of the reduced Bayesian model and the perseveration model, we developed a mixture model between the two. Specifically, the mixture between the probability of the learning component (reduced Bayesian model) and the probability of the perseveration component (perseveration model) was determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">p λt,δ (a t |x 1:T ) := λ t δ(a t ) + (1 − λ t )p εt (a t |x 1:T ),<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">λ t := 1 1 + exp(−b 1 (|â t | − b 0 )).<label>(20)</label></formula><p>Here, we assumed that trials with an update equal to zero could be due to the learning component or the perseveration component (where the higher the absolute predicted update of the reduced Bayesian model, the lower the probability that the trial was generated by the perseveration component). In contrast, for trials where participants did not perseverate, we assumed that data were exclusively generated by the learning component. The mixture between the two components was modeled using a logistic function with parameters b 0 and b 1 . The intercept b 0 indicates the function's midpoint, and the slope b 1 models the steepness. For an illustration, we refer to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S4</ref>.</p><p>We estimated the free parameters using the constrained minimization algorithm L-BFGS-B from the Python SciPy optimize framework. We repeated the estimation 10 times using randomly determined starting points and selected the parameters of the iteration that achieved the best fit to the data, i.e., the lowest negative log-likelihood. To ensure reproducible results, we used the same fixed value of the random seed for all analyses. Finally, consistent with our previous study , we used a weakly informative Gaussian prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 5 to regularize the estimation of the uncertainty-underestimation parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model comparison</head><p>To test if the mixture model between the reduced Bayesian model and the perseveration model describes the data better than the control model without perseveration, we compared the cumulated Bayesian information criterion (BIC;  and the corresponding protected exceedance probabilities .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling model</head><p>The sampling model translates the reduced Bayesian model described above to a sampling algorithm combined with a stopping criterion determining when the sampling process stops and the model commits to a belief update. We first give a brief introduction to Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling and then provide a formal description of our own sampling model. MCMC is a popular method for estimating posterior distributions in Bayesian inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(van Ravenzwaaij, Cassey, &amp; Brown, 2018)</ref>. A key challenge in Bayesian inference is computing integrals to obtain the posterior of a model. For example, optimal predictions of outcomes in the helicopter task can be computed using Bayes' rule</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">p(µ t |x 1:t ) = p(x 1:t |µ t )p(µ t ) p(x 1:t |µ t )p(µ t )dµ t ,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where µ t denotes the helicopter position and x 1:t denotes the observed outcomes (for more details, see SM Optimal and approximate Bayesian inference). The primary computational challenge for implementing a Bayesian solution is to compute the integral in the denominator since doing so requires not only evaluating the likelihood with which a single hypothetical mean might give rise to the data but also evaluating the likelihood of all possible means. While for the helicopter task, computationally costly analytical solutions exist , evaluating the posterior analytically is entirely intractable in many other cases. Monte Carlo strategies, such as rejection sampling, provide means for approximating Bayesian solutions without the need to evaluate the costly integral by selecting samples from a proposal distribution and "accepting" samples according to their un-normalized probability. Such methods can cut computational costs by requiring only the evaluation of the numerator of eq. (22). However, an issue is that these methods can be computationally costly if the proposal distribution deviates substantially from the true underlying target distribution being inferred.</p><p>Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) extends basic Monte-Carlo methods such that the proposal distribution (i.e., hypotheses about helicopter position that one might consider) evolves over time and depends on the most recent sample in a growing chain . The advantage of this strategy over full Bayesian solutions is that it does not require evaluating the integral in the denominator of Bayes rule, and the advantage over static Monte-Carlo methods is that since the chain of samples will evolve toward the target distribution, the proposal distribution will efficiently sample the space of likely hypotheses (i.e., helicopter positions that could have given rise to data). In broad strokes, the MCMC strategy approximates the posterior distribution by iteratively performing two steps: (i) draw a proposed sample from a proposal distribution centered on the last sample in the chain, and (ii) evaluate the un-normalized posterior probability of the sample and either accept the sample (add it to the chain) or reject it accordingly. When computing the approximate posterior, we build a chain of many samples that are accepted in the chain according to their un-normalized posterior distribution analogous to the numerator in eq. (22) ("target distribution"). Over time, these samples form a pattern that reflects the true distribution of the helicopter location, and the more samples that are generated in this way, the better the estimate tends to be.</p><p>One way to perform MCMC sampling is using the Metropholis-Hastings algorithm . To illustrate the sampling process of the helicopter location based on this algorithm, we enumerate the different steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>1. Begin with a starting value. The sampling process starts from an initial value, such as the last prediction or an external anchor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Propose a new sample.</head><p>A new sample is drawn from a proposal distribution that often corresponds to a Gaussian probability distribution. Each new sample from this proposal distribution can be interpreted as a hypothesis about the true but unknown helicopter location. The mean of the proposal distribution is equal to the last sample.</p><p>3. Compute acceptance probability. Compute the probability of accepting the proposed sample. This is based on how likely the newly proposed hypothetical helicopter location is under the un-normalized target distribution of the actual helicopter location compared to the most recent sample. For example, the target distribution might be a Gaussian with a mean of 180 and a standard deviation of 20. The algorithm would then compare the probability density of the proposed sample N (160; 180, 20) to the most recent sample <ref type="bibr">N (150; 180, 20)</ref>. It is accepted if the new sample is more likely (like in the example). If it is less likely, it will be accepted with a probability that is proportional to how much less likely it is.</p><p>4. Decide to accept or reject the proposed sample. The proposed sample is accepted according to the previously computed acceptance probability.</p><p>5. Repeat sampling and decide when to stop. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to generate a large number of samples. Given certain conditions and enough time, the chain of samples will represent samples from the true helicopter distribution. The total number of samples is typically chosen beforehand. In our own sampling model described below, the number of samples is chosen online and differs from trial to trial.</p><p>6. Use samples for inference. Once the posterior distribution over the helicopter location is approximated based on the samples, one can estimate properties of the distribution, such as the mean (most likely helicopter location) or variance (uncertainty about helicopter location).</p><p>Our own sampling model assumes that humans rely on sampling to approximate optimal belief updating under consideration of their cognitive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lieder et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sanborn &amp; Chater, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sanborn, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vul et al., 2014)</ref>. As explained above, each sample can be interpreted as a specific hypothesis about the helicopter location, and drawing more samples would more closely approximate the posterior distribution of the helicopter. However, at the same time, each sample represents a limited resource, and from a resource-rationality perspective, the benefits and costs of sampling should determine how much to sample. Therefore, we combined the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm sketched above with a dynamic stopping criterion determining when the sampling process is terminated <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6a</ref>). To do so, the model draws a certain number of samples (determined by the chunk-size parameter) and evaluates whether the new set of samples has improved the belief (governed by the stopping criterion). This evaluation is based on a comparison of the un-normalized posterior probability of the sample distribution's mean, both with and without the additional chunk of samples. If the new samples do not sufficiently boost the un-normalized posterior probability (evaluated at the mean of all samples in the chain), the model rejects them, terminates the sampling process, and uses the mean of the previously sampled values as its new belief. In contrast, if the new chunk of samples increases the unnormalized posterior probability of the belief considerably, the sampling process is continued. That is, the model would generate another chunk of samples and again evaluate whether the sampling process can be terminated or an additional set of samples is required. The next section explains the two parameters in more detail.</p><p>1. Chunk-size parameter. The chunk size determines how many samples one can draw per unit of time and can be interpreted as the available amount of cognitive resources.</p><p>Here, the idea is that people with more cognitive resources can generate more samples per chunk. Consequently, each chunk would include more samples, thereby being more accurate.</p><p>2. Stopping criterion. The stopping criterion governs at what point the sampling process stops, which can be interpreted as the willingness to invest resources. Here, the idea is that it is necessary to keep on sampling as long as more samples improve the accuracy of the belief. However, when new samples do not improve belief accuracy further, the model stops, thereby saving cognitive resources. Stopping is achieved by comparing the un-normalized posterior probability of the mean of the sample distribution with and without the new chunk of samples. For example, the target distribution might have a mean of 180. If the mean of the samples, including the new chunk is 170, and without the new samples, 165, then the new samples have improved belief accuracy, and the model would continue the sampling process. Intuitively, when the sample mean converges on the mean of the target density, the belief cannot be further improved, and thus sampling would stop. While one could imagine the conservative policy of stopping only when new samples provide exactly zero improvement, such a policy would require drawing a lot of samples. A more frugal strategy would be to set some criterion level of improvement that is required to continue sampling, with a level of improvement below this threshold indicating that the belief based on prior samples is good enough. This idea is often referred to as "satisficing" <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Simon, 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Simon, , 1956</ref>. Therefore, the stopping criterion governs at what point an individual decides that drawing new samples is unnecessary. A lower, more conservative stopping criterion (≈ 0) indicates that the two beliefs have to be virtually the same, while more liberal values (&gt; 0) would indicate that a minor difference between the two beliefs would be tolerated, in line with the idea of satisficing.</p><p>The basic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm combined with the chunk size and stopping criterion yields perseveration and anchoring in the following way: Perseveration takes place when the model rejects the first chunk of samples (the accuracy of the hypothetical belief based on the new samples is not sufficiently better than the prior belief). Anchoring, on the other hand, takes place when an external anchor determines the start location of the sampling process, and the model draws a limited amount of samples that do not fully compensate for the anchor.</p><p>More formally, the model is represented by the following parameters and distributions.</p><p>• x ∈ R denotes the set of samples drawn by the model, where we particularly distinguish the most recent sample x new from the previous sample x curr ,</p><p>• σ mh := 30 denotes the standard deviation of the sampling distribution,</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">• q(x new |x curr ) := N (x new ; x curr , σ 2 mh )</formula><p>is the Gaussian proposal distribution generating the samples,</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">• p * prior (x) := N (x; µ t , σ 2 t )</formula><p>denotes the Gaussian distribution for the model's prior belief about the latent helicopter location µ t ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">• p * lik (x t ) := N (x t , x, σ 2 )</formula><p>is the likelihood of the outcome x t given sample x,</p><p>• p * post (x) is the posterior belief distribution,</p><p>• n refers to the sample-chunk size, and finally,</p><p>• c is the stopping criterion.</p><p>On each trial, the model samples according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm . At each sampling step, a new sample is generated from the Gaussian proposal distribution q(x new |x curr ), where x new denotes the generated sample conditional on the current sample x curr and the sample variance σ 2 mh . The model probabilistically accepts and rejects a new sample based on the ratio of the new and current sample with respect to the target distribution p * post (x):</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">r mh = min(1, p * post (x new ) p * post (x curr ) ).<label>(23)</label></formula><p>That is, when x new is more likely, the model accepts the new sample, but if it is less likely, the acceptance probability is equal to the relative probabilities (mh in the subscript refers to "Metropolis-Hastings"). The posterior distribution over the belief</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">p * post (x) := p * prior (x) • p * lik (x t ) • (1 − h) + (1/300) • p * lik (x t ) • h (24)</formula><p>is a weighted combination of the case that no change point occurs (</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">p * prior (x) • p * lik (x)) and that a change point occurs ((1/300) • p * lik (x)).</formula><p>In the no-change-point case, we obtain the posterior by multiplying the prior by the likelihood. In the change-point case, we assume a flat prior (1/300) denoting that all outcomes ∈ [1, 300] are equally likely.</p><p>To adjust the amount of sampling dynamically, we added a stopping criterion inspired by the rule for acceptance of new samples as described above. Before sampling starts, the model initializes the hypothetical belief µ sat in the location where the belief update starts (sat in the subscript indicates "satisficing"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Simon, 1956</ref>). Depending on the task condition, this initial belief is equal to the previous belief (standard condition) or determined by an external anchor (anchoring condition). According to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm described above, the model then generates a chunk of n samples and computes a hypothetical belief µ mh reflecting the sample mean. Subsequently, the relative posterior probability of the new sample mean</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">r sat = p * post (µ mh ) p * post (µ sat ) + p * post (µ mh )<label>(25)</label></formula><p>is computed, based on which the model decides whether or not to keep sampling. The model considers that r sat = 0.5 if both hypothetical beliefs are equal and therefore computes the difference between this point and the relative probability of the new sample mean:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">δ sat = |0.5 − r sat |.<label>(26)</label></formula><p>With unlimited computational resources, a stopping criterion could be δ sat ≈ 0. However, since our model assumes limited resources and aims to reduce the sampling costs, it also considers a criterion value c and stops sampling when δ sat ≤ c. Note that since δ sat takes into account the absolute difference, the model keeps sampling when the hypothetical belief based on the new chunk of samples µ mh is both considerably better and considerably worse than µ sat .</p><p>Finally, if the model stops sampling, it commits to the belief conditional on the last chunk µ sat <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6a</ref>). Note that if the first chunk of samples is rejected, µ sat is equal to the starting point of belief updating. In the absence of an external anchor, this consequently yields perseveration. If the model continues the sampling process, it first sets µ sat = µ mh , generates a new chunk of n samples, and sets µ mh to the new sample mean under consideration of the most recent samples.</p><p>At the end of a trial, the model updates estimation uncertainty σ 2 t (eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">9</ref>) under consideration of relative uncertainty τ t (eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">10</ref>) and change-point probability ω t (eq. (8)). In contrast to the reduced Bayesian model, where change-point probability is based on the prediction error, the sampling model approximates change-point probability based on the samples. That is, it first computes ω t for each sample (i.e., the differences between the samples and the prior belief (x − µ t )) and then computes the average across these values.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task design and model predictions</head><p>To examine age differences in adaptive learning across the lifespan, we analyzed behavioral data of 33 children (8 to 10 years, median age 9.0 years), 29 adolescents (13 to 17 years, median age 15.0 years), 32 younger adults (20 to 28 years, median age 24.0 years), and 35 older adults (62 to 80 years, median age 71.0 years). The participants' processing speed and verbal knowledge were assessed using the Identical Picture and Spot-a-Word test, and both of these measures were comparable to scores in previous work (see SM Identical Picture and Spot-a-Word tests; ). In the experimental task, participants were instructed to maximize the collection of coins in bags dropped off by an invisible helicopter ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2a</ref>; . Participants tried to catch the dropped bags by placing a virtual bucket at the next expected bag location. However, because clouds covered the sky, participants could not directly observe the helicopter and thus had to learn its location based on the history of observed bags. The windy environment distorted the dropped bags' position and induced variability in the outcomes. Hence, participants could utilize the previous bags to estimate the hidden location of the helicopter, but estimates were uncertain. Technically, we generated these outcomes using a Gaussian distribution, where the mean was equal to the position of the hidden helicopter, and the standard deviation led to variability across outcomes. The helicopter occasionally changed its position at "change points", after which previously learned predictions became inaccurate, and . Experimental task and reduced Bayesian model. a In the experimental task, participants tried to catch bags containing gold or stones that were dropped by a hidden helicopter. Participants caught the bags by placing a bucket at the expected position of the bag on the screen (Prediction). The helicopter then dropped the bag (Outcome), a red line marked the prediction error (Prediction error), and participants could adjust their prediction of the bag location for the next trial (Update). This task schematic shows the transition from the first to the second trial. b The helicopter position (dashed line, first panel) was stable on most trials and only changed occasionally (change point). Outcomes (black dots, first panel) were noisy because they were randomly displaced with respect to the helicopter position. The black line in the first panel shows the prediction of the reduced Bayesian model that inferred the position of the hidden helicopter based on the position of the dropped bags. The model computed prediction errors (second panel) to update its predictions. The learning rate (LR; third panel) controls the influence of prediction errors on the model's belief update. In the reduced Bayesian model, the magnitude of the learning rate depends on change-point probability (CPP) and relative uncertainty (RU).</p><p>the best strategy was to re-learn the hidden helicopter location. Notably, because the helicopter was not directly observable, the change points were difficult to distinguish from the variability due to the wind in the environment. Participants received rewards for catching gold coins that emerged from dropped bags on a random subset of trials. The task was designed to minimize the contribution of differences in working memory to age-related differences in adaptive learning behavior. In particular, we showed participants their trial-by-trial prediction errors with a red line and, therefore, participants were not required to remember their previous prediction or the most recent outcome (see Experimental task). We confirmed that the different age groups had similar levels of performance on "catch trials" in which we showed the helicopter explicitly, suggesting a comparable understanding of the task instructions and necessary visual and motor capabilities (see SM Catch-trial control analysis). Normative trends in learning behavior can be formally captured by a near-optimal reduced Bayesian model that adjusts the rate of learning on each trial <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 2b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McGuire et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Nassar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Vaghi et al., 2017)</ref>.

To revise beliefs appropriately, the model scales prediction errors according to a learning rate to produce an update in the expected helicopter location. The Bayesian model dynamically adjusts the learning rate from trial to trial, reflecting attributions of prediction errors to variability across outcomes versus change points in the helicopter location. After smaller prediction errors that are more likely due to outcome variability, the model subtly regulates the learning rate according to its relative uncertainty about the hidden helicopter location. In contrast, prediction errors that are more likely due to a change point, as indicated by change-point probability, lead to higher learning rates and more substantial belief updates (see Reduced Bayesian model).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-related learning differences are driven by perseveration</head><p>Performance in the task differed between age groups. To examine task performance, we compared the estimation errors across age groups, which reflect the absolute difference between the true but unknown location of the helicopter and the participants' prediction of the next outcome ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3a)</ref>. Lower values indicate a more accurate estimate of the helicopter location (see Data preprocessing). According to a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks (hereafter referred to as ANOVA), estimation errors were significantly different between the age groups (H = 32.069, p &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc two-sided Mann-Whitney U tests indicated that children (median = 12.711, IQR 11.594 to 14.445) showed significantly higher estimation errors compared to adolescents (median = 10.791, IQR 9.794 to 12.304; u = 724.0, p = 0.001, R 2 = 0.193) and younger adults (median = 10.311, IQR 9.176 to 12.075; u = 862.0, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.295).</p><p>Older adults (median = 12.433, IQR 11.658 to 13.704) had significantly higher estimation errors compared with adolescents (u = 258.0, p = 0.001, R 2 = 0.176) and younger adults (u = 205.0, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.296). The test did not yield significant differences between children and older adults (u = 625.0, p = 0.564, R 2 = 0.005) and between adolescents and younger adults (u = 523.0, p = 0.398, R 2 = 0.012). An analysis of the average learning rates showed that, on average, children and older adults updated their predictions to a lesser degree compared to the other two age groups ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3b</ref> and Average learning-rate analysis). The average learning rate provides a model-agnostic measure of the extent to which participants update their prediction in response to the prediction error across all trials, where lower learning rates would reflect that prediction errors are, on average, considered to a lesser extent. An ANOVA indicated that learning rates were significantly different between the age groups (H = 32.001, p &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc tests showed significantly lower average learning rates in children (median = 0.734, IQR 0.626 to 0.798) compared with adolescents (median = 0.845, IQR 0.8 to 0.887; u = 137.0, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.373) and younger adults (median = 0.838, IQR 0.793 to 0.887; u = 188.0, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.305). Post-hoc tests also yielded significantly lower learning rates in older adults (median = 0.788, IQR 0.711 to 0.842) compared to adolescents (u = 738.0, p = 0.002, R 2 = 0.15) and young adults (u = 779.0, p = 0.006, R 2 = 0.112). The test did not yield significant differences between children and older adults (u = 431.0, p = 0.073, R 2 = 0.047) and between adolescents and younger adults (u = 503.0, p = 0.578, R 2 = 0.005). Thus, children and older adults use lower learning rates than adolescents and younger adults, suggesting that, on average, children and older adults consider prediction errors weaker for belief updating. While the previous analysis indicates that children and older adults use lower learning rates on average, it leaves open why these differences originate. Therefore, to better understand the computational underpinnings of age-related learning differences, we next analyzed the trial-bytrial dynamics of learning-rate adjustments in the different age groups using the reduced Bayesian model. To do so, we equipped the model with several free parameters derived from previous work  that we estimated using a maximum-likelihood approach (see Evaluation and estimation). These parameters could be successfully recovered in our parameter-recovery analysis (see SM Parameter-recovery analysis). In line with our previous study comparing younger and older adults in the helicopter task, we found evidence for a reduced consideration of relative uncertainty in older compared to younger adults. However, these differences did not explain our observed performance differences between the age groups, nor did we observe any meaningful lifespan differences in subjective assumption about the frequency of change points (hazard rate). Thus, while the Bayesian model could explain many aspects of behavior, it could not account for our observed lifespan differences in performance (see SM Supplementary modeling results first experiment).</p><p>In addition to considering differences in such costly computations involved in selecting a learning rate, we also considered the possibility that individuals might employ frugal policies for implementing it. In particular, our motivating sampling framework suggests that participants should often perseverate on their previous prediction <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. In line with this prediction, all four age groups showed perseveration in the task, that is, they repeated the same prediction across two or more consecutive trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3c</ref>). An ANOVA yielded significantly different estimated perseveration probabilities across the age groups (H = 27.229, p &lt; 0.001). The estimated perseveration probability in children (median = 0.565, IQR 0.428 to 0.748) was significantly higher compared to adolescents (median = 0.238, IQR 0.13 to 0.465; u = 752.5, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.24), younger adults (median = 0.23, IQR 0.113 to 0.43; u = 859.0, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.289), and older adults (median = 0.495, IQR 0.312 to 0.586; u = 739.5, p = 0.047, R 2 = 0.058). We also found significantly higher perseveration probabilities in older adults than in adolescents (u = 307.0, p = 0.007, R 2 = 0.114) and in older compared to younger adults (u = 320.0, p = 0.003, R 2 = 0.135). The test did not show a significant difference between adolescents and younger adults (u = 478.0, p = 0.845, R 2 = 0.001). These results show that all age groups perseverated on their predictions, but such perseveration was more pronounced in children and older adults compared to adolescents and younger adults.</p><p>In our computational approach, we captured age-related differences in perseveration by extending our optimal Bayesian model (see SM Computational modeling), allowing for a better explanation of participant data than the original Bayesian model (see SM Model comparison). A key observation from this modeling is that perseveration did not occur randomly and instead was most common in trials where participants made the smallest prediction errors. Model-based analyses using the extended version of the reduced Bayesian model capturing perseveration revealed that age-related differences in perseveration probability were particularly pronounced for trials where the model predicted small to intermediate updates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3d</ref> and SM Supplementary modeling results first experiment for parameter estimates).</p><p>Our results raise the question of whether perseveration reflects an adaptive strategy for more efficient learning in children and older adults or whether it should be interpreted in terms of a learning deficit. The sampling perspective sketched above would suggest that perseveration might be employed to strategically trade accuracy for savings in computational cost. In line with this perspective, perseveration primarily occurred for smaller prediction errors, where no updating would have a minimal impact on belief accuracy. However, the results so far would also align with the hypothesis that perseveration reflects a learning deficit that is the primary source of lower performance in children and older adults. Mainly because in a simulation study, we found that model-predicted learning performance across the lifespan is quite similar when perseveration is absent (see SM Model validation). Therefore, to resolve whether perseveration reflects an adaptive strategy or a learning deficit, we conducted a second experiment that included an anchoring manipulation suppressing perseveration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reducing perseveration leads to the anchoring bias</head><p>To better understand the computational mechanisms underlying lifespan differences in belief updating, we conducted a second experiment examining the effect of external anchors on task performance. Such anchors were implemented by randomly perturbing the bucket position at the beginning of each trial in a manner that would make it more challenging to repeat the previous trial's prediction exactly. As described above, from the perspective of a resource-rational sampling model, the anchoring manipulation would be expected to lead to impaired performance due to anchoring biases, which would be even more pronounced in children and older adults. In particular, drawing fewer samples due to lower cognitive resources would not completely overwrite the effect of external anchors, and it might be more efficient to trade accuracy for fewer invested cognitive resources. In contrast, the perseverative reduced Bayesian model would predict that the anchoring manipulation should, if anything, improve task performance, particularly in children and older adults who are more prone to perseverative responses.</p><p>To test these ideas, we conducted a follow-up experiment with an effective participant sample of 31 children (7 to 11 years, median age 9.0 years), 25 younger adults (20 to 28 years, median age 24.0 years), and 34 older adults (61 to 76 years, median age 67.0 years). Out of efficiency considerations, we did not test adolescents as they showed similar levels of perseveration as younger adults in the first experiment. The psychometric profile of the participants was similar to the first experiment (see SM Identical Picture and Spot-a-Word tests). We used a modified version of the helicopter task that included two task conditions intended to reduce the frequency of perseverative responses. In the anchoring condition, we randomly perturbed the bucket's initial location at the onset of each trial <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4a</ref>). The consequence of the bucket randomization was that participants could not repeat the previous trial's prediction using a single key press, as this would now require them to adjust their bucket back to its previous position. We presented this anchoring condition in two out of four task blocks. The other two blocks were similar to the In the anchoring condition, we randomly relocated the location of the bucket that participants used to catch bags according to a normal distribution centered on the previous bucket location (anchor). In the standard condition, the bucket stayed at the participants' previous predictions as in the first experiment. This task schematic shows the transition from the first to the second trial. b The upper plot shows the outcomes in the task (black dots), an example of the predicted outcomes according to a simulation using the reduced Bayesian model (black line) and the anchor location (blue dots). To capture the anchoring bias, we added a parameter to the model, such that the predictions of the reduced Bayesian model were biased towards the anchor. The lower panel shows the shift in the initial bucket location (the difference between the previous and current bucket location).</p><p>standard helicopter task as in the first experiment. Second, we included a reward-magnitude manipulation in which we subdivided trials into high-and low-reward trials, thereby incentivizing participants to reduce perseverative behaviors on the high-reward trials. Reward-magnitude manipulations did not significantly affect the perseverative response frequency (see SM Supplementary results follow-up experiment), and thus, we focus our analyses on the anchoring condition. As in the first experiment, the task featured catch trials, on which the helicopter was visible. All age groups performed similarly, indicating that they understood the task instructions and had similar visual and motor capabilities (see SM Catch-trial control analysis).</p><p>We found that randomizing the start location of the bucket strongly reduced perseveration in all age groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5a</ref>). An ANOVA indicated that in the anchoring condition, the absolute perseveration frequency was not significantly different between the groups (H = 0.381, p = 0.827). This result suggests that in the new anchoring condition, all age groups perseverated at a similar level. In line with this finding, an ANOVA comparing the perseveration difference between the standard helicopter and anchoring conditions showed that the condition difference was significantly differed across age groups (H = 20.697, p &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc tests showed a significantly stronger reduction in children compared to younger adults (u = 186.0, p = 0.001, R 2 = 0.196). Compared to older adults, younger adults showed significantly lower perseveration differences between the conditions (u = 724.5, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.357). The test did not In the standard condition, perseveration was comparable to the results in the first experiment. b Despite perseveration being absent, in the anchoring condition, children and older adults showed significantly lower performance (larger estimation errors) compared to the standard condition. We did not find a significant performance difference between the two conditions in younger adults. In line with this, the performance difference between the standard and anchoring condition was significantly larger in children and older adults than in younger adults. c Children and older adults showed a stronger anchoring bias than younger adults. d The estimated anchoring bias and perseveration probability were systematically related to each other in that a higher perseveration probability statistically predicted a stronger anchoring bias, suggesting that both biases emerge from a common underlying cause.</p><p>yield a significant difference between children and older adults (u = 549.5, p = 0.773; R 2 = 0.001). We additionally refer to the supplemental material for within-subject comparison of the conditions (SM Supplementary results follow-up experiment). Finally, this reduction in perseveration was not simply due to a substitution effect. Participants almost never left their bucket in exactly the externally determined location, but they actively updated their reported beliefs (SM Supplementary results follow-up experiment "motor" perseveration results). Thus, our task manipulation successfully normalized the primary factor contributing to age-related performance differences in our previous experiment. If perseveration were truly the primary computational deficit driving age-related performance differences as suggested by the perseverative reduced Bayesian model, then suppressing it should rescue learning behavior in children in older adults (see SM Model validation). However, alternatively, if perseveration reflects a more liberal sampling policy in our sampling framework, then the performance of children and older adults would be even more impaired due to the emergence of the anchoring bias when the initial bucket position is randomized <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. This prediction follows because perseveration mostly occurs on smaller prediction errors, and external anchors can be far away from previous predictions, which could only be compensated by drawing more samples. In line with the sampling perspective, the anchoring manipulation did not rescue performance in our target age groups but instead led to additional impairments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig.  5b</ref>). An ANOVA on the within-participant differences in estimation errors between the two task conditions showed a significant difference between the age groups (H = 15.705, p &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc tests revealed significantly higher estimation-error differences between the anchoring and standard conditions in children compared to younger adults (u = 576.0, p = 0.002, R 2 = 0.171) and younger adults compared to older adults (u = 186.0, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.227) but not between children and older adults (u = 444.0, p = 0.279, R 2 = 0.018). That is, in line with the prediction of the sampling framework, the anchoring manipulation led to additional performance impairments in children and older adults.</p><p>Consistent with our sampling account, age-related performance differences in the anchoring condition were driven by anchoring biases. The anchoring bias was significantly different between the age groups ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5c</ref>; H = 27.356, p &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc tests showed a significantly stronger bias in children (median = 0.14, IQR 0.098 to 0.258) compared to younger adults (median = 0.057, IQR 0.017 to 0.106; u = 615.0, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.25), and in older adults (median = 0.268, IQR 0.136 to 0.392) compared with younger adults (u = 116.0, p &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.38). In children, the anchoring bias was significantly lower compared to older adults (u = 345.0, p = 0.017, R 2 = 0.087). We confirmed that learning in these age groups was more substantially affected by the anchoring bias in a model-based analysis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. S10i</ref> and SM Supplementary modeling results follow-up experiment). Here, the anchoring bias was governed by an additional free parameter, where higher parameter values indicate a stronger bias that showed similar agerelated differences in the effect of the anchor on learning. Finally, in a control analysis, we found no convincing evidence that performance differences across groups were explained by differences in average learning rates (SM Average learning rate follow-up experiment).</p><p>In summary, the results suggest a relationship between perseverative responses characterizing the behavior of children and older adults in our first experiment and anchoring biases on learning that characterize their behavior in the second experiment. To test whether these two effects might emerge from a common underlying cause, we examined the relationship between them (see Robust regression). As would be expected if the two effects emerged from a common cause, participants who tended to perseverate more often in the standard condition were also more strongly biased by the initial prediction location in the anchoring condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5d)</ref>. A robust regression indicated a strong effect size (R 2 = 0.281; intercept β 0 = -0.004, z = -0.111, p = 0.911; regression slope β 1 = 0.407, z = 5.294, p &lt; 0.001). Thus, in line with our sampling perspective, perseveration in children and older adults did not reflect a strong adherence to prior beliefs per se but rather a sensitivity to the starting value of the belief update, be it internally or externally generated (see also SM Robust regression with age group for an analysis that additionally models group differences in this relationship).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-related learning differences are driven by resource-rational sampling</head><p>The results of the two experiments are in line with the key predictions of our motivating sampling framework. As such, they suggest that age-related learning biases emerge from efficient belief-updating computations that reduce the amount of cognitive resources invested in learning. However, previous learning models, including the perseverative reduced Bayesian model, cannot capture this idea, particularly the relationship between perseveration and anchoring. Therefore, we propose a new sampling model that formalizes and qualitatively supports this perspective.</p><p>The sampling model embeds the computations of the reduced Bayesian model in a resourcerational or computationally rational framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gershman, Horvitz, &amp; Tenenbaum, 2015)</ref>. The key assumption is that belief updating resembles sampling algorithms from statistics and machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lieder et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vul et al., 2014)</ref>, combined with a criterion value determining when the updating process stops and the belief is reported <ref type="figure">(Fig.  1)</ref>. Accordingly, the brain sequentially adjusts its belief within a trial by generating samples stochastically, which approximates optimal inference if sufficient samples are drawn ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 6b</ref> and SM Sampling model for a systematic comparison to the reduced Bayesian model, a trialby-trial illustration, and a model-validation analysis). However, because the brain has limited computational resources, it terminates the sampling process before completely approximating the optimal belief to ensure that the computational costs of sampling do not exceed the benefits.</p><p>We first briefly explain how sampling can approximate optimal learning in our task (for more details, see Sampling model). Then, we explain how our sampling model dynamically adjusts how much to sample from trial to trial. One challenge in Bayesian inference is to compute the posterior distribution analytically, and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling allows The model first generates a chunk of samples and compares the sample mean to the initial belief (the starting point of the sampling process) in terms of their accuracy. In particular, this comparison is based on a criterion value: when the relative posterior probability of the initial belief compared to the sample mean is below the stopping criterion, the model rejects the new samples in favor of the prior, as the new samples did not sufficiently improve the belief. If the starting location of belief updating is the prior belief, this yields perseveration. If the relative posterior probability of the two potential beliefs is above the criterion value, the model keeps sampling. This cycle would then be repeated until the relative posterior probability of sample chunk n and n − 1 is below the criterion, and the model updates the belief. b Illustration of the sampling model with a large number of samples that closely approximate the optimal belief distribution. c Example of a trial on which the model perseverates. Perseveration takes place when (i) sampling starts from the prior belief, (ii) a limited amount of samples is drawn, and (iii) the sample mean is not sufficiently better than the prior. d Example of the anchoring bias. The new belief is biased when (i) sampling starts from an external anchor and (ii) a limited number of samples is accepted that cannot override the effect of the external anchor. Model simulations reproduce the major empirical findings. e Perseveration probability across the age groups, showing that perseveration is more frequent in the standard condition (darker colors, boxplots for simulated CH, YA, OA on the left) than in the anchoring condition (lighter colors, boxplots on the right). Median perseveration probabilities are plotted with blue diamonds to compare simulations to the empirical data. f Estimation errors were greater in the anchoring condition, and g the magnitude of the simulated anchoring biases was comparable to our empirical data. In these simulations, we assumed that the stopping criterion values of children and older adults are more liberal compared to younger adults, which could correspond to the willingness to exert cognitive effort, thereby leading to faster rejection of new samples. Moreover, we assumed that the sample-chunk size is smaller in children and older adults compared to younger adults, which could correspond to an individual's amount of cognitive resources.</p><p>us to approximate the posterior based on sampling. For example, to compute the belief about the helicopter location, MCMC algorithms would sequentially draw random samples from the distribution of possible helicopter locations, which only requires that we can compute the unnormalized probability density of each drawn sample with respect to the "target" distribution about possible helicopter locations. When drawing a large number of samples, we could approx-imate the mean (most likely helicopter location) and variance (uncertainty about the location) without using analytical equations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6b)</ref>.</p><p>Assuming the brain relies on sampling to approximate Bayesian inference, it needs a mechanism to decide when to stop sampling. Our model stops sampling after drawing a new set of samples that do not sufficiently improve the belief <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6a)</ref>. Specifically, the model iteratively (i) draws a set of samples and (ii) evaluates whether more samples are necessary. Samples are drawn from a proposal distribution that is normal and centered on the previous sample and accepted according to their un-normalized posterior probability (see eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">25</ref>and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_36">26)</ref>, thereby allowing samples to evolve over time to match the true posterior probability distribution over helicopter locations. Stopping is achieved by comparing the un-normalized posterior probability of the mean of the sample distribution with and without the new chunk of samples; when new samples do not sufficiently increase the posterior probability, the model discards them, stops sampling, and reports the mean of the sample chain as its estimate of the helicopter location.</p><p>These sampling dynamics are controlled by two parameters. The chunk-size parameter determines the number of samples per chunk and might reflect the amount of invested cognitive resources per unit of time. The stopping criterion governs the evaluation process after generating each chunk of samples. When the criterion parameter is more conservative (≈ 0), the model only stops sampling when more samples clearly do not improve belief accuracy anymore and generally tends to generate more sampling chunks. In contrast, when the criterion parameter is more liberal (&gt; 0), the model would also stop sampling when the probability of the un-normalized posterior probability of the mean of the sample distribution with and without the new chunk is similar but not necessarily equal. Therefore, the criterion parameter can be interpreted as the willingness to invest cognitive resources.</p><p>We next illustrate how sampling can yield perseveration and anchoring. Perseveration occurs when the belief update starts from the prior belief and the first chunk of samples gets rejected <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6c</ref>). In line with our experimental data, the model predicts that perseveration primarily takes place after smaller prediction errors, where the prior belief and the potentially updated belief based on new samples would be quite similar (compare <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3d and Fig. S18a</ref>). In contrast, anchoring takes place when belief updating starts from an externally determined value and the criterion is reached before the new samples have completely compensated for the effect of the anchor <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6d</ref>). In particular, when the starting point of belief updating is far away from the optimal (but unknown) belief, and the model only considers a small number of samples. Consequently, the model predicts a more substantial anchoring bias when an externally generated anchor is far from the optimal belief <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">(Fig. S18b)</ref>.</p><p>We performed a simulation study in which the simulated perseveration and anchoring effects resembled our empirical results. We assumed that due to smaller chunk sizes and more liberal criterion values, children and older adults (average chunk size ≈ 4 and 3.5, respectively; average criterion ≈ 0.012 and 0.017; see Sampling model) draw a lower number of samples compared to younger adults (average chunk size ≈ 20, average criterion ≈ 0.01). The simulated participants showed a pattern of perseveration comparable to the experimental data, with heightened perseveration in children and older adults <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6e)</ref>. Similarly, compared to younger adults, simulated children and older adults showed larger estimation errors in the anchoring task condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig.  6g)</ref>. Moreover, the anchoring bias was stronger in children and older adults when compared to younger adults <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6h)</ref>. Lastly, the model also captured the relationship between perseveration and anchoring within each age group <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S15b)</ref>. Thus, our simulations could reproduce the pattern of age-related differences by assuming that belief updating occurs through an iterative sampling process and that children and older adults have more limited cognitive resources and are less willing to deploy them in the service of belief updating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resource-only and motor models do not capture learning biases</head><p>Finally, we found that neither a resource-only model nor a motor model that we included as alternative control models successfully explained the observed age-related learning differences. The first control model was a resource-only model that lacked the dynamic stopping criterion of our resource-rational model. The second control model was a motor-control model, which assumed that motor costs lead to the observed biases.</p><p>The resource-only model resembled the sampling model but did not use the dynamic stopping criterion. Instead, the resource-only model sampled a fixed number of samples that differed between the age groups. As such, instead of adjusting the amount of resources dynamically, the model invested a fixed amount on each trial, and the simulated age groups only differed with respect to their cognitive resources. However, this model did not convincingly explain the observed age-related biases (see SM Resource-only model). Specifically, when the fixed number of samples successfully captured perseveration, it strongly overestimated estimation errors and anchoring biases (children and older adults, 2 samples; younger adults, 10 samples). In contrast, when the simulations reproduced the estimation errors and anchoring, the model strongly underestimated perseveration (20 vs. 50 samples).</p><p>Moreover, the motor-control model added a parameterized motor penalty to the reduced Bayesian model as commonly used in motor-control frameworks (see Motor model for more details). The critical parameter of this model determined the relative cost associated with small versus large movements. As such, the model assumed that participants would navigate a trade-off between maximizing prediction accuracy (favoring larger updates) and minimizing motor costs (favoring smaller updates). However, the motor model failed to explain our findings comprehensively (see SM Motor model). Specifically, when we assumed high movement costs that accurately described the perseveration results, it strongly overestimated the anchoring bias. Similarly, when we attempted to realistically capture the anchoring bias by setting the motor-cost parameters to lower values, we underestimated perseveration in the standard task condition.</p><p>In summary, the new sampling model qualitatively captures the age-related differences in perseveration and anchoring and shows that the findings across the two experiments could be produced by a resource-rational sampling mechanism that adjusts the computational expenditure according to the available cognitive resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Learning is essential for adaptive behavior. However, children and older adults often show reduced performance than younger adults across a wide array of tasks. In canonical decisionmaking and cognitive control tasks, these impairments are often due to perseverative behavior. However, when additional task-related cues are presented, children and older adults are more strongly influenced (biased) by environmental information. Currently, we lack a satisfactory computational explanation for when and why individuals exhibit these biases at different stages of their lifespan. Here, we developed a computational model that explains the emergence of perseveration and anchoring in terms of a trade-off between belief accuracy and computational cost during learning. We showed that, in this model, computational costs could be reduced by drawing only limited samples from the optimal Bayesian belief distribution for reasonably small reductions in accuracy. Crucially, when the model is parameterized in a computationally frugal manner, it can explain both perseveration and anchoring. Across studies, we show that belief updating behavior was primarily characterized by performance deficits due to persevera-tion (when updating from a previous belief) and anchoring (when updating from an externally determined location), in line with the predictions of our model. Importantly, perseveration was correlated with anchoring, suggesting that both biases share a common cause related to the costs of mental computation. Therefore, we suggest that learning impairments in children and older adults may reflect biases that reduce computational costs while ensuring satisfactory cognitive task performance.</p><p>Sampling has been suggested as a cognitively plausible mechanism for approximate inference. One argument for this perspective is that optimal Bayesian inference is costly and often intractable in real-life scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Vul et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gershman &amp; Beck, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sanborn &amp; Chater, 2016)</ref>. Moreover, sampling is an approach to quantifying the required cognitive resources for computations in terms of the number of samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lieder et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dasgupta et al., 2017)</ref>. Accordingly, each sample that is drawn represents a limited resource, and drawing more samples leads to more accurate beliefs but also takes more time and effort. Therefore, people would be expected to rely on fewer samples, compared to what would be required to closely approximate Bayesian inference, which has been shown to give rise to behavioral biases such as anchoring and generally higher response variability than predicted by exact Bayesian inference models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dasgupta et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vul et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lieder et al., 2018)</ref>. Our results are in line with these studies but extend them to a more complex task with dynamic changes to reveal that perseverative and anchoring biases can both emerge from a sampling process depending on how beliefs are probed and that limited sampling provides a parsimonious account of age differences in adaptive learning behavior.</p><p>Importantly, our results support the hypothesis that learning differences across the lifespan could be linked to the amount of cognitive resources . In particular, our model simulations suggest that children and older adults are best described as learners who draw fewer samples, yielding stronger perseveration ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 6e</ref>) and anchoring biases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6g</ref>) when compared to their young adult counterparts. In what follows, we provide a unifying framework proposing that the reliance on sampling might be a common cause underlying perseverative behavior and greater anchoring biases in children and older adults across different task domains.</p><p>Perseverative behavior is common in children and older adults, and it often leads to substantial performance deficits in these age groups compared to younger adults. It has been observed in various experimental tasks where performance relies on the flexible updating of task representations such as reversal learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Crone, Jennings, &amp; Van der Molen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Head et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ridderinkhof et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rutledge et al., 2009)</ref> or task switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carroll et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cepeda &amp; Munakata, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Crone, Ridderinkhof, et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Munakata et al., 2012)</ref>. Children's reduced performance in these tasks is often interpreted in terms of executive control deficits, particularly working memory limitations. Our modeling approach offers a partially alternative mechanistic interpretation of these limitations in adaptive behavior. We suggest that due to lower cognitive resources and willingness to expend them, children and older adults might rely on fewer samples when making judgments about new stimuli. As a consequence of reduced sampling, they more frequently perseverate on previous responses in reversal-learning or task-switching paradigms (as they do in the current task). Importantly, in our experiments, perseveration was particularly frequent on trials with smaller prediction errors, where our sampling model predicts the rejection of new samples. This finding aligns with a previous developmental study that used a sampling model in a hypothesis-testing task . The results indicated that children tended to stick to their choices when confirmed. In contrast, they were more likely to sample alternative hypotheses when choices were disconfirmed, similar to our model, where larger prediction errors are associated with more sampling and less perseveration.</p><p>Our finding of increased anchoring biases on learning in older adults is consistent with theoretical ideas that propose a shift from internal to environmental control with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Craik &amp; Bialystok, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lindenberger &amp; Mayr, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lindenberger and Mayr (2014)</ref> suggest that across a range of psychological domains and experimental tasks, for example, task switching, inhibitory working memory, or attentional control, less differentiated internal representations in older adults are associated with an increased reliance on environmental information. Our model formalizes this idea by assuming that external cues act as anchors determining the starting point from which beliefs are updated. In effect, when the number of considered samples does not offset the anchor, beliefs are biased toward the externally provided information. This environmental control bias should be more pronounced in individuals with lower cognitive resources (such as older adults) because the sampling process would stop after fewer samples. So far, the environmental control framework has been primarily applied to the upper end of the lifespan. However, several findings from the developmental literature can be interpreted along the lines of this theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alarcón &amp; Bonardi, 2020)</ref>. For example, younger children tend to rely more on what has been referred to as reactive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chatham et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gonthier et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Troller-Renfree et al., 2020)</ref>. That is, they retrieve task-relevant information when needed (in response to an external cue) instead of maintaining the relevant information proactively <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Munakata et al., 2012)</ref>. From a sampling perspective, reactive control could emerge from the reliance on only a few samples, while proactive control could be the consequence of a longer sampling process, which requires more cognitive resources.</p><p>The results of the current study extend our previous work, which suggested that age differences in learning were due to an underestimation of uncertainty in older adults . In our prior publication, we used the same task as in the first experiment of the current study. The analyses suggested that older adults underestimated uncertainty more strongly than younger adults, which led to reduced learning rates for smaller prediction errors. While we replicate this effect here, we also found evidence indicating that a portion of what had initially appeared as an underestimation of uncertainty in  can be attributed to perseveration (see SM Control model). Both effects largely concern small to medium prediction errors and lead to under-adjustments in response to such errors. However, the effects differ in so far as perseveration corresponds to a learning rate of exactly zero, while uncertainty underestimation leads to reduced learning rates, usually still larger than zero. Therefore, the two effects go in the same direction, and the current study suggests that perseveration is the major source of reduced learning rates in children and older adults compared to their young adult counterparts.</p><p>Notably, we have not found any systematic differences in performance between adolescents and younger adults. A popular perspective holds that adolescents are particularly susceptible to rewards, leading to increased risk-taking and more behavioral flexibility compared to younger adults (Van Duijvenvoorde, Peters, Braams, &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Crone, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Somerville &amp; Casey, 2010)</ref>. From this point of view, one might have expected reward-related effects (e.g., related to rewarding gold bags vs. neutral bags containing stones) in adolescents compared to adults in our study. However, more recent perspectives emphasize that the environment (or the task in lab studies), and not only the adolescent brain, sculpts risk preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ciranka &amp; van den Bos, 2021)</ref>. For example, in the real world, adolescents have more opportunities to take risks, and these opportunities are novel and, therefore, more uncertain for adolescents than for adults. From this perspective, our findings might be explained by the fact that our task environment did not provide sufficient room for the emergence of reward-driven biases. A related reason for the absence of these effects could be that in our task (in the first experiment that included adolescents), rewards could not be predicted, and the optimal learning strategy is to ignore the rewards. The idea that reward-related biases in adolescents might be context-and task-dependent is also consistent with results from a recent lifespan developmental study on effort-reward trade-offs in cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Devine et al., 2021)</ref>. Consistent with the current results, the findings of this study indicate that the sensitivity to these trade-offs depends on the cognitive resources of the individuals, which are more similar in adolescents and younger adults than they are in children and older adults compared to younger adults.</p><p>Moreover, one might have expected that adolescents would overestimate environmental changes. A recent study by Jepma, Schaaf, Visser, and Huizenga (2020) used a similar task as we applied in our study, and the authors suggested that adolescents rely on higher learning rates due to an overestimation of environmental changes compared to younger adults. We did not find such an effect in the current experiment. However, it is important to note that there is one major difference between the two studies: In contrast to our study, the task by Jepma et al. (2020) did not involve any change points (but modeled individual assumptions about changes). Therefore, our changing environment potentially better matched the adolescents' assumptions about changes. In order to shed more light on these differences, future studies should systematically compare learning in adolescents in stable and changing environments.</p><p>Next, we discuss our null result of the incentive manipulation that we used to test whether reward magnitudes modulate perseveration. In the follow-up experiment, we applied high-and low-reward conditions but did not find significant differences in perseveration between these conditions. In contrast to our expectations, performance was even slightly better on low-reward trials (see SM Results follow-up experiment). One potential explanation for this result is that higher expected rewards biased learning and thereby diminished performance to some extent. Previous fMRI work with the same task has found a reward-related effect of prior rewards (previous trial) on learning rates and brain activity in the ventral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(McGuire et al., 2014)</ref>. However, in the current study, we did not find systematic evidence that average learning rates differed between the high-and low-reward conditions, suggesting that the observed performance differences might be related to how dynamically subjects adjust learning. Therefore, the effects of the incentive manipulation could be interpreted as evidence against a rational use of cognitive resources (since higher reward prospects should motivate subjects to invest more resources and reduce perseveration). However, it is also possible that the manipulation was not strong enough to systematically affect perseveration rates. We do not interpret the absence of evidence of the effect as evidence for the absence of an effect of rewards on perseveration and, more generally, the motivation to invest more cognitive effort. An alternative approach to our trial-by-trial reward manipulation could be to manipulate rewards block-wise, in line with the typical approach in cognitive control studies providing convincing evidence for effects of rewards on the motivation to exert mental effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Shenhav, Prater Fahey, &amp; Grahek, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The sampling perspective on learning might remind readers of common sequential sampling models in decision-making, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM; Forstmann, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ratcliff, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998)</ref>. Indeed, both perspectives share the idea that evidence is sampled sequentially until a criterion is reached. As such, the two parameters of the sampling model (stopping criterion and chunk-size parameter) could be interpreted along the lines of the DDM. The criterion parameter of the sampling model is related to the decision boundaries in the DDM. The chunk-size parameter that influences the amount of sampling has some conceptual similarity to the drift rate of the DDM that determines the speed of evidence accumulation. However, there are also significant differences between the models. Our sampling model is a learning model that relies on active, internal sampling to approximate Bayesian updates. This property allows the model to update internal beliefs across trials based on feedback to improve future decision-making. In contrast, the canonical DDM samples external evidence, often by passively observing a stimulus, until reaching a threshold level of certainty necessary to commit to a categorical choice. That is, in contrast to our sampling model, the DDM is not designed to capture learning.</p><p>Previous work on aging and decision-making that used the DDM provides evidence that older adults adopt a higher decision boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dully, McGovern, &amp; O'Connell, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ratcliff, Thapar, Gomez, &amp; McKoon, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Theisen, Lerche, von Krause, &amp; Voss, 2021)</ref>. This finding might seem at odds with our suggestion that older adults draw fewer samples than younger adults. One potential explanation for these seemingly opposing findings is the difference between active sampling in the service of learning in our task and passive sampling in the case of categorical decisions that have previously been modeled using the DDM. Older adults might be more conservative in their action selection when sampling happens passively and is less cognitively effortful, like in categorical choice tasks. In contrast, older adults might be more liberal when updating beliefs based on active sampling, as in the present study, which might require more cognitive resources.</p><p>Our theory is also related to the study of heuristics, which can be defined as strategies that ignore part of the information to choose more quickly and frugally than more complex methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011)</ref>. Heuristics are sometimes treated as fundamentally different strategies that an individual can select given the current choice problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mata, Josef, &amp; P., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Van den Bos, Bruckner, Nassar, Mata, &amp; Eppinger, 2018)</ref>. For example, under time pressure, humans often resort to a simple lexicographic strategy that selects the best alternative on the most important attribute, such as the best possible outcome independent of its probability in a discrete choice task <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rieskamp &amp; Hoffrage, 2008)</ref>. Regarding lifespan development, research on heuristic decision-making has characterized children's developing ability to rely on more efficient strategies in the service of adaptive decision-making and suggested that older adults select strategies according to the environmental structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mata, von Helversen, &amp; Rieskamp, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Mata, Schooler, &amp; Rieskamp, 2007)</ref>. Our approach can be interpreted along these lines, especially concerning the assumption that heuristics can be efficient under bounded resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Simon, 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Simon, , 1956</ref>). One notable difference in our approach is that the current sampling model treats the shift between different strategies (e.g., Bayes-optimal learning versus anchoring) in a more continuous way governed by a common underlying sampling mechanism. Research on heuristics often distinguishes strategies on a more qualitative level, but ultimately, both perspectives aim to capture cognitive biases, and a resource-rational approach can help explain why heuristics emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>What might be the cognitive correlates of computational resources and age-related sampling differences? Processing speed could be one potential factor correlating with the number of samples drawn on a mental computation. Consistent with our own findings in both experiments, children and older adults score lower on processing-speed tests, which is linked to the development and decline of reasoning abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Nettelbeck &amp; Burns, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kail, Lervåg, &amp; Hulme, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Scheiber, Chen, Kaufman, &amp; Weiss, 2017)</ref>. One interpretation could be that individuals with lower processing speed can draw fewer samples per unit time than faster individuals, as modeled by our chunk-size parameter. Consequently, drawing the same amount of samples as younger adults would require more time for children and older adults. In addition, each sample might be more effortful or costly, so they are less willing to deploy them, an idea that is reflected in the criterion parameter of the sampling model. Indeed, particularly in older adults, there is evidence that cognitive effort is subjectively more costly compared to younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Westbrook, Kester, &amp; Braver, 2013)</ref>. Children also seem to be sensitive to cognitive effort and regulate their choice behavior accordingly <ref type="bibr">(Chevalier, 2018, however</ref>, it is currently unclear if the costs of subjective effort systematically decrease across childhood devel-opment). Therefore, to save effort, it could be resource-rational for children and older adults to rely on fewer samples . Taken together, our findings seem consistent with recent work suggesting that age differences in the engagement in cost-benefit trade-offs reflect an adaptation to internal and external constraints that arise across the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Devine et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Ruel, Devine, &amp; Eppinger, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Given the consideration outlined above, it may seem obvious to test the relationship between processing speed and sampling based on reaction-time data. We decided not to include these analyses because reaction times and spatial updates are inherently confounded within the current task. In our model, more extensive updates are associated with more sampling, which should increase the reaction time. However, the issue is that such updates also take longer when moving the bucket toward the required location on the screen. In general, it seems challenging to completely eliminate this confound when examining perseveration and anchoring, at least when spatial updates are involved. For example, one strategy could be to use a circular task design where predictions start from the center of a circle, and all locations on the circle are equidistant to the center <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Nassar, Bruckner, &amp; Frank, 2019</ref>). Yet, this manipulation would no longer allow participants to perseverate or provoke an anchoring bias. Therefore, future work should develop a task version that de-confounds the time necessary to update beliefs from the time necessary to execute the required actions to report it. Even more generally, when considering reaction times, it should be taken into account that different age groups differ in their processing speed. That is, generating a sample will be faster in younger adults than in children and older adults. Consequently, age-related reaction-time differences would partly reflect differences in how long it takes to generate a sample. One potential way to address this confound could be by estimating a free parameter that reflects the average time per sample.</p><p>Last but not least, next to replicating our results in a confirmatory study, future studies should directly estimate the subjective cognitive costs and gains in accuracy during sampling and test whether individual differences predict the number of samples. Quantifying this tradeoff could lead to refined hypotheses about when people, given their limitations, should show stronger behavioral biases. We leave the development of a more sophisticated resource-rational model to future work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gershman, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lieder et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>To conclude, in this study, we provide a unifying perspective on cognitive resources and learning biases across the human lifespan. Children and older adults frequently perseverate on prior predictions when updating beliefs from previous values. In contrast, when beliefs are updated from externally manipulated values, learning is affected by anchoring biases. We explain this pattern using a model that suggests that belief updating involves a sampling process that stops when a certain level of accuracy is reached. Our results suggest that due to their lower cognitive resources and willingness to expend them, children and older adults terminate the sampling process earlier than younger adults and, therefore, show stronger behavioral biases. The proposed sampling model may offer a parsimonious explanation for a wide array of findings in the developmental and aging literature on learning and executive control and supports a resource-rationality perspective on lifespan development. .

To ensure that participants understood that the helicopter was the best predictor of the outcomes, we used a response criterion that required participants to put their bucket ten times exactly underneath the visible helicopter.

In the second practice phase, clouds covered the helicopter, and participants had to infer its location based on the outcomes. Occasionally, the helicopter was visible during catch trials, and participants could use this information for learning. These blocks consisted of 50 trials and were the same as in the real experiment. After the practice session, we emphasized again that participants would earn money for their collected points. To test whether children and older adults can perform the task well without ambiguity about the helicopter location (catch trials), we compared estimation errors between catch trials and regular trials (with hidden helicopter). In the first experiment, all age groups showed significantly lower estimation errors on catch trials than on regular trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. S2a)</ref>.

Edge trials reflect trials in which the starting position of the bucket was either z t = 0 (left edge of the screen) or z t = 300 (right edge of the screen). On these trials, the anchoring effect could be different from regular trials because the shift in the location could not affect the starting position beyond the edge. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S3e</ref>, perseveration was practically absent in regular trials and thus primarily occurred on edge trials, suggesting that the few cases of perseveration (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S3c, anchoring condition)</ref> were driven by edge trials in which the anchoring effect was truncated. A similar result was observed for motor perseveration trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S3f)</ref>. Motor perseveration refers to the prediction in the initial bucket location (see SM Data preprocessing), which was absent in regular trials but occasionally took place on edge trials. Together, these results support the conclusion that our anchoring manipulation strongly reduced the perseverative behavior of our participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Average learning rate follow-up experiment</head><p>We tested which factors determined participants' belief updates in the follow-up experiment. Similar to the first experiment, we analyzed average learning rates across all trials, indicating to which extent prediction errors influenced the belief update on average. The ANOVA showed that learning rates were significantly different between the age groups (H = 21.951, p &lt; 0.001). The post-hoc tests indicated significantly lower learning rates in children (median = 0.73, IQR 0.65 to 0.838) compared to younger adults (median = 0.884, IQR 0.86 to 0.923; u = 131.0, p &lt; 0.001; R 2 = 0.318) but not compared to older adults (median = 0.772, IQR 0.699 to 0.854; u = 466.0, p = 0.427; R 2 = 0.01). Similarly, younger adults had significantly higher learning rates compared to older adults (u = 683.0, p &lt; 0.001; R 2 = 0.264). As in the first experiment, these results show that children and older adults use lower learning rates than younger adults, i.e., they use prediction errors to a lesser degree for updating their beliefs about the helicopter.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S4</ref>. Mixture model. To account for age-related differences in perseveration within our model, the model contained a perseveration component that allowed for a better explanation of participant data than a control model without perseveration. a In our task, perseveration can computationally be described as a learning rate αt = 0, which leads the model to ignore the prediction error and, consequently, to an exact repetition of the previous prediction. b We modeled the contribution of this perseveration component (perseveration probability) as a function of the predicted update of the reduced Bayesian model. In effect, the model predicted a higher perseveration probability for smaller prediction errors.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S5</ref>. Hypothetical and estimated learning deficits resulting from specific deviations from the reduced Bayesian learning model. a-c The reduced Bayesian model (RBM) uses a high learning rate in response to large prediction errors that are more likely due to change points. In the range of small prediction errors more likely due to variability, it uses a lower learning rate to average out the variability in the outcomes. We hypothesized that learning deficits might stem from specific deviations from the learning-rate computations of the reduced Bayesian model, including an underestimation of uncertainty, lower surprise sensitivity, and a subjectively high hazard rate (Biased). a An underestimation of uncertainty leads to a specific learning deficit in the range of small prediction errors unlikely to be due to change points. That is, the model has a reduced ability to average out the variability in the outcomes. b Insensitivity to surprise leads to a learning deficit in the range of large prediction errors that are likely to be due to change points. Consequently, the model has a reduced ability to respond to change points appropriately. d The hazard rate reflects the model's assumed frequency of change points. A subjectively higher hazard rate, i.e., overestimating how often change points occur, is associated with higher learning rates in the range of small and intermediate prediction errors. d-f Estimated parameters reflecting d uncertainty underestimation, e surprise sensitivity, and f subjective hazard rate for children (CH), adolescents (AD), younger adults (YA), and older adults (OA).</p><p>To better understand the computational underpinnings of differences in learning, we analyzed trial-by-trial dynamics of learning-rate adjustments in the different age groups using the mixture model. The uncertainty-underestimation parameter reflects the extent to which participants underestimate uncertainty during learning. Higher uncertainty-underestimation parameters lead to lower learning rates in the range of small prediction errors, which are most likely due to environmental variability <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S5a)</ref>. The mostly positive parameter estimates reflecting uncertainty underestimation shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S5d</ref> suggest that all age groups tended to underestimate uncertainty because a full consideration of uncertainty is indicated with an uncertainty-underestimation parameter equal to 0. We next used an ANOVA to compare uncertainty underestimation across the four age groups. The test yielded significant parameter differences between the age groups (H = 8.836, p = 0.032). Older adults (median = 3.879, IQR 2.639 to 4.478) showed significantly higher uncertainty underestimation compared to adolescents (median = 2.443, IQR 1.411 to 4.271; u = 358.0, p = 0.044; R 2 = 0.063) and compared to younger adults (median = 2.524, IQR 1.49 to 4.214; u = 348.0, p = 0.008; R 2 = 0.105). That is, in line with our previous work, the results suggest reduced uncertainty-driven learning in older adults compared to their younger counterparts. However, the test did not yield a significant difference between children (median = 3.445, IQR 2.184 to 4.423) compared to adolescents (u = 568.0, p = 0.209; R 2 = 0.025), younger adults (u = 668.0, p = 0.067; R 2 = 0.052), and older adults (u = 503.0, p = 0.364; R 2 = 0.012). The test did not show a significant difference between adolescents and younger adults (u = 506.0, p = 0.549; R 2 = 0.006).</p><p>The surprise-sensitivity parameter indicates the influence of change-point probability on the learning rate.

The surprise-sensitivity estimates shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S5e</ref> suggest that all age groups considered change-point probability, albeit not as much as the reduced Bayesian model, which has a surprise sensitivity of 1. Moreover, the ANOVA indicated significantly different median surprise-sensitivity parameters between the age groups (H = 10.195, p = 0.017). Younger adults (median = 0.312, IQR 0.177 to 0.48) showed significantly higher surprise sensitivity compared to children (median = 0.11, IQR 0.052 to 0.339; u = 324.0, p = 0.008; R 2 = 0.11) and compared to older adults (median = 0.198, IQR 0.081 to 0.294; u = 762.0, p = 0.011; R 2 = 0.095).

The true but unknown hazard rate was approximately 0.1, i.e., the hazard-rate parameter estimates shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S5f</ref> suggest that most participants overestimated the frequency of change points in the task.

In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. S7</ref>, we show the parameter estimates of the control model without perseveration, which fit the data worse compared to the mixture model that captured perseveration (see Model comparison).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control model</head><p>These results suggest that the perseveration component of our best-fitting model partly captures variance that the uncertainty-underestimation parameter captures in the control model without perseveration. Both uncertainty underestimation and perseveration lead to an underadjustment of predictions. Uncertainty underestimation leads to an update that is smaller than prescribed by the normative version of the reduced Bayesian model, while perseveration leads to a no-update altogether. Moreover, both effects occur primarily after small to intermediate prediction errors. To test this idea more directly, we next simulated data based on the model that included the perseveration component. The parameter values of the uncertaintyunderestimation parameter were 0 (indicating no underestimation) for all simulated partici-pants, and all other values corresponded to the model-based estimates obtained from model fitting (including age-related difference in preservation). We then fit the control model without perseveration component to this simulated data set and, in line with our argument, found that uncertainty underestimation was larger in simulated children and older adults compared to the other two groups <ref type="figure">(Fig. S8)</ref>. Uncertainty Underestimation <ref type="figure">Figure S8</ref>. Uncertainty underestimation in simulation-based control analysis. We examined whether perseveration can be attributed to uncertainty underestimation in a control model that does not include the perseveration component. We first performed a simulation study using the reduced Bayesian model with perseveration, where the parameter values were based on the empirical, model-based estimates. Therefore, perseveration probability was comparable between the simulated and empirical data sets (including the age-related differences with more perseveration in children and older adults). Crucially, in all simulations, we set the uncertainty-underestimation parameter to zero. We then fit the control model to the simulated data to examine whether the uncertainty-underestimation parameter picks up variance that is due to perseveration. The uncertainty-underestimation parameters are higher in simulated children and older adults, although the ground-truth parameters were zero, indicating that perseveration (which was higher in simulated children and older adults) can give rise to the appearance of uncertainty underestimation when perseveration is not modeled explicitly. We used the cumulated Bayesian information criterion (BIC;  and the corresponding protected exceedance probabilities  for model comparison (see Model comparison). Here, higher BIC values indicate a better model fit <ref type="figure">(Fig. S9a</ref>). We used protected exceedance probabilities for model comparison on the group level, which indicates the probability that a particular model is more likely than any other model of the model space <ref type="figure">(Fig. S9b)</ref>. Together, this indicated that in each age group, the mixture model fits the data better than the reduced Bayesian model without perseveration. We finally counted the number of participants, in which the mixture model fits the data better than the reduced Bayesian model without perseveration. This indicated that in 121 out of 129 participants, the model comparison favored the mixture model.  To confirm that age-related differences in anchoring capture performance differences beyond the computational factors of our model, we added an anchoring-bias parameter. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4b</ref>, in this extended version, the model's prediction of the next outcome was biased towards the anchor. This bias was governed by an additional free parameter, where higher parameter values indicate a stronger bias <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. S10i</ref>). According to an ANOVA, the parameters were significantly different between the age groups (H = 27.835, p &lt; 0.001).

To test if the parameters of the mixture model between the reduced Bayesian model and the perseveration model can accurately be estimated, we conducted a parameter-recovery study. We used randomly selected parameters during the simulations to examine if a broad range of parameter combinations is recoverable. These parameters were based on the participants' empirical parameter distributions and additionally constrained between the approximate minimum and maximum empirical parameter estimates. The parameter-recovery results for the first <ref type="figure">(Fig.  S11</ref>) and follow-up experiment <ref type="figure">(Fig. S12)</ref> suggest that parameters can sufficiently be estimated except for the catch-trial parameter, which was often estimated at the upper boundary. This result indicates that the empirical results regarding catch trials should be cautiously treated. To test whether the mixture model can capture age differences in perseveration and estimation errors, we simulated learning behavior for each age group. Each dot represents a simulated participant, and the boxplots show the empirical data for comparison. The results suggest that the mixture model qualitatively captures the pattern of a perseveration and b estimation errors across the age groups. c To test whether perseveration might contribute to age-related performance differences, we simulated learning behavior and set the perseveration probabilities to zero in all cases. d The simulation results suggest that, without perseveration, the four age groups would perform at similar levels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First experiment</head><p>One potential concern with using computational models as data-analytic tools is that although they make quantitative predictions of the data, they might fail to reproduce the observed data in simulations qualitatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Palminteri, Wyart, &amp; Koechlin, 2017)</ref>. We used the estimated mixture model to simulate learning behavior to test if our model-based analyses accurately captured participants' behavior. First, to test if the estimated reduced Bayesian model with an additional perseveration component qualitatively reproduces participant behavior, we applied it to the same sequence of data as experienced by our participants. To obtain smoother simulation results, we repeated this procedure across three cycles. The comparison between empirical and simulated data is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S13a</ref> (perseveration probability) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S13b (estimation  errors)</ref>. In addition, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S13c,d</ref>, we also used simulations to explore if the reduced Bayesian model without perseveration would predict similar performance levels between the age groups. Here, we conducted the simulations as described above but adjusted the parameters such that perseveration probability was approximately equal to zero. These results suggested similar performance levels and motivated our follow-up experiment that tested if age-related performance differences can be eliminated with manipulations to reduce perseveration. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-up experiment</head><p>As in our model-validation analyses of the first experiment, we conducted the simulations with the estimated parameters and the same outcomes observed by our participants. These simulations revealed that the simulated perseveration ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S14a</ref>) and estimation-error ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S14b</ref>) differences qualitatively matched our empirically obtained results, which suggests that our computational model accurately captured participants' behavior. We also applied a robust linear regression model with age group</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">d i = β 0 + β 1p (n) i + β ya 2 g i + β ch 2 g i + β ya 3p (n)g i + β ch 3p (n)g i<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where i denotes the subject and g i denotes age group that we coded as dummy variable with older adults as reference category. The model thus contained an additional main effect of age group with regression weight β 2 and an interaction between age group and perseveration probability with regression weight β 3 . This model revealed a significant main effect of perseveration probability β 1 = 0.8617 (z = 4.874, p &lt; 0.001), and a significant interaction between perseveration probability and the level of younger adults of the age group variable β ya 3 = −0.8372 (z = −3.286, p = 0.001) and the level of children β ch 3 = −0.4635 (z = −2.173, p = 0.03). All other parameters were not significant: β 0 = −0.1269 (z = −1.453, p = 0.146), β ya 2 = 0.1769 (z = 1.699, p = 0.089), β ch 2 = 0.1213 (z = 1.146, p = 0.252). The coefficient of determination of the model was R 2 = 0.464. Hence, this robust regression with age group suggests that the anchoring bias is systematically related to perseveration and that this relationship is weaker in younger adults and children compared to older adults. For the predicted values according to this model, see To validate the sampling model, we compared the computational variables between the sampling and the reduced Bayesian model. To approximate optimal inference, we used a large number of samples (2000 samples) without applying the stopping criterion. The comparison shows that the trial-by-trial beliefs, prediction errors, relative uncertainty, and change-point probability variables are similar between the two models. This illustrates that the sampling model can closely approximate near-optimal Bayesian inference if a sufficient number of samples is drawn.    <ref type="figure">Figure S19</ref>. Joint effect of chunk size and criterion parameter on perseveration probability and anchoring bias. We illustrate the effects of varying parameter values to show how different parameter settings impact perseveration and anchoring. In particular, the plot demonstrates how the criterion parameter influences the biases under three different chunk-size settings. These simulation results reveal a general trend where both perseveration and anchoring tend to increase as the criterion values become larger. Moreover, the examples demonstrate that the effects of the parameters interact to some extent. Illustration of a perseveration and b anchoring for lower chunk-size parameters similar to values in children and older adults (chunk size = 1). Here, perseveration and the anchoring bias increase as a function of a larger criterion. When chunk size is larger (chunk size = 3), c perseveration and d anchoring increase as a function of the criterion, but the overall magnitude of the biases is lower. e Finally, when chunk size is more young-adult-like (chunk size = 15), perseveration still increases, f but the anchoring bias almost remains constant. This corresponds to a floor effect, where the larger number of samples overwrites the impact of the anchor. Consequently, these examples suggest a diminishing correlation between perseveration and anchoring as the chunk-size parameter increases.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S20</ref>. Resource-only model. The resource-only model assumed that age groups only differ in their cognitive resources. It allowed us to test if a model without a dynamic stopping criterion captures the behavioral results similar to the resource-rational sampling model. We first simulated data with baseline parameter settings leading to a moderate perseveration, b low estimation errors, and c a small anchoring bias. We then chose "perseveration" parameter values that d yielded age-related differences in perseverative behavior. However, these parameter values led to e strongly overestimated estimation errors and f anchoring biases. In opposition to these parameter settings, the "anchoring" parameters g did not capture perseveration but instead h age-differences in estimation errors and i the anchoring bias. Together, these results suggest that a dynamic stopping criterion, like in the resource-rational sampling model, is necessary to explain our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resource-only model</head><p>We performed a simulation study with the resource-only model to examine whether an alternative sampling model in which age groups only differ in their cognitive resources could explain our results. This model lacked a dynamic stopping criterion and instead invested a fixed amount of resources on each trial. As such, a sampling model without a dynamic stopping criterion does not naturally show perseverative behavior. Still, to test the model under fair conditions (in favor of the resource-only model), we added the logistic function explained above (Evaluation and estimation) with fixed parameters that yielded perseverative behavior for smaller prediction errors (intercept β 0 = 0.85, slope β 1 = −0.25). We first simulated data with a baseline model, which generated a sufficient amount of samples to achieve high task performance (100 samples).</p><p>In particular, the model showed moderate perseveration due to the logistic function ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S20a</ref>), low estimation errors in both the standard and anchoring condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. S20b)</ref>, as well as a minor anchoring bias <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. S20c)</ref>.</p><p>We next tried to model age-related differences in perseveration and anchoring based on common parameter settings. When we assumed a very low number of samples in children and older adults (2 samples) and more samples in younger adults (10 samples), the simulations suggested perseveration differences between the groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. S20d)</ref>. However, these parameter settings clearly overestimated estimation errors and the anchoring bias. Conversely, assuming more samples (children and older adults 20 samples, younger adults 50 samples) led to more realistic estimation errors and anchoring biases but underestimated age-related perseveration differences. Therefore, the resource-only control model did not offer a unifying explanation for the observed biases across the lifespan. As such, it suggests that a resource-rational stopping criterion, as proposed by our main sampling model, is necessary to capture age-related differences in perseveration and anchoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motor model</head><p>To explore whether motor costs provide an alternative account of perseveration and anchoring, we developed a motor-control model. The motor model was based on the reduced Bayesian model and had additional motor costs associated with bucket adjustments. Larger updates of the bucket position were associated with higher motor costs. At the same time, the model considered "error" costs due to an under-adjustment of the bucket. Therefore, the model was confronted with a trade-off between motor and error costs. Not adjusting the bucket at all would minimize motor costs but would also be associated with high error costs. In contrast, updating the bucket optimally according to the reduced Bayesian model would minimize error costs but would be associated with higher motor cots. The model solved this trade-off by minimizing the combined costs (motor and error costs).</p><p>We first simulated data using a baseline model with parameter settings resembling the reduced Bayesian model ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S21a-d)</ref>. This version of the model only considered error costs. Error costs were minimal in the location of the optimal belief (v l = 0.5, e v = 1.1, v m = 0.0, e m = 1.0, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.  S21a)</ref>. Therefore, the model showed approximately optimal belief updating. We ensured that perseveration did only rarely occur (logistic function parameters modeling perseveration were b 0 = 0.5 and b 1 = −5.0) and found that estimation errors were low and anchoring biases absent.</p><p>The next simulations included additional motor costs and indicated that the motor model did not provide a unifying explanation for perseveration and anchoring. Assuming extremely high motor costs, the model showed perseveration probabilities that differed between younger adults and children and older adults (children and older adults: v m = 0.75, e m = 1.2; younger adults v m = 0.5, e m = 1.0; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S21e</ref>). However, the resulting estimation errors and anchoring biases were unrealistically high. Assuming lower motor costs allowed us to successfully capture differences in anchoring and estimation errors (children and older adults: v m = 0.1, e m = 1.4; younger adults v m = 0.1, e m = 1.0; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S21i</ref>). However, these parameter settings strongly underestimated perseveration in all age groups. Taken together, while the motor model can separately account for perseveration or anchoring, it cannot recover the two biases based on common parameter settings. Therefore, our control analyses do not support the idea that adding motor costs to the reduced Bayesian model provides an alternative explanation for perseveration and anchoring.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S21</ref>. Motor model. The motor model allowed us to test whether adding motor costs to the reduced Bayesian model could explain perseveration and anchoring from a perspective different from our sampling model. a A baseline model only considered error costs. Error costs were higher when the bucket was placed further away from the optimal location. This version resembled the reduced Bayesian model. b The baseline model perseverated only rarely, c estimation errors were low, and d the model did not show systematic anchoring biases. e The "perseveration" version of the motor model had extremely high motor costs (and the same error costs as the baseline model). The three lines only reflect the parameters of simulated children and older adults. f Due to the high motor costs, particularly simulated children and older adults perseverated more frequently than younger adults. g However, estimation errors were strongly overestimated, and h anchoring biases showed a ceiling effect. i In contrast, the "anchoring" version had lower motor costs (and the same error costs as before). The three lines only reflect the parameters of simulated children and older adults. j Due to the lower motor costs, perseveration was underestimated. k,l However, in this case, estimation errors and anchoring biases were closer to the empirical data. Taken together, the results show that our motor model does not explain our results convincingly.</p></div>

The results suggest that the mixture model qualitatively captures the pattern of a perseveration and b estimation errors across the age groups. c To test whether perseveration might contribute to age-related performance differences, we simulated learning behavior and set the perseveration probabilities to zero in all cases. d The simulation results suggest that, without perseveration, the four age groups would perform at similar levels.</figDesc></figure>
