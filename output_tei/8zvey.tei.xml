			<abstract>
				<p>The decisions we make in our everyday lives often require us to navigate through a barrage of information, so that we can base our decisions only on information that is relevant to our goals. Selectively attending only to goal-relevant dimensions of information can help us efficiently navigate this barrage of information, but can also lead us into &quot;traps&quot; where we fail to learn which information is most relevant, or fail to notice information that becomes relevant later in time. Here, we investigate the dynamic interactions between attention, learning, and memory that unfold as learners seek to identify dimensions of information that will help them make consistently accurate decisions. Using a multi-pronged approach, we identify the cyclical links between decision making, attention, and representation that best explain human category learning. We then show how the structure of these relationships paradoxically causes both accelerated learning and leads learners into different types of learning traps.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The Hound of the Baskervilles</head><p>In our everyday lives, we are constantly bombarded with information that we must navigate to make decisions consistent with our goals. Typically, information comes from multiple sources, or dimensions, which can be prioritized according to their relevance in the decision process. The challenge of making choices based on many dimensions can be vastly simplified by selective attention. Ideally, selective attention allows us to focus on dimensions of information that are most relevant to our current goals, while ignoring those that are irrelevant. The benefits of selective attention are clear: By selectively attending to relevant dimensions, we can avoid expending the time and energy involved in considering less relevant dimensions, and therefore make decisions more quickly and efficiently.</p><p>The efficient deployment of selective attention is complicated by the fact that we are often initially ignorant about which dimensions are relevant to our goals.</p><p>For example, if we take up a new hobby such as painting, we may initially know little about what information can help us choose good quality paint brushes. In these cases, we must instead learn relevance through our experiences, summaries of which are stored in memory. For example, we may acquire experiences with brushes that possess many dimensions (e.g., material, brush shape, price, and manufacturer), observe their quality, and retain associations between dimensions and quality in memory.</p><p>How do selective attention, learning, and memory come together to support decisions? The answer to this question is far from straightforward. In one direction, selective attention may be oriented towards dimensions that we have observed to be associated with goal-relevant outcomes. In the other direction, selective attention may guide the dimensions that we encode in memory and learn about. Over the course of experience, influences in both directions may unfold, producing cyclical, dynamic interactions among selective attention, learning, memory, and decision making.</p><p>Here, we investigate how dynamic interactions among selective attention, learning, memory, and decision making may not simply bestow benefits of efficiency and consistency. Instead, these same efficiency-promoting dynamics may also impede our ability to detect and use information that is potentially relevant to our goals. One key cost may be incurred when our initial experiences, by chance, convey a spurious association between less relevant dimensions and goal-relevant outcomes. For example, we may initially observe and encode an association between paint brush manufacturer and quality because we happened to try a high-end brush from one manufacturer and a budget brush from another.</p><p>By selectively attending to the spuriously relevant dimension (manufacturer), we may never learn the most relevant dimension (cost). We therefore refer to this cost as an "attention" trap. A second key cost may be incurred when the information most relevant to our goals changes over time. For example, high-end brushes may initially be of better quality than budget brushes, but if a cheap, high-quality brush material is invented, price may become irrelevant or even counterproductive for determining quality. However, by learning to selectively attend to price, we may subsequently fail to consider material as a determinant of quality, and therefore never learn this new association between material and quality. Such behavior is similar to an attention trap. However, because the neglected information was once learned to be irrelevant, we will refer to this cost as a "representation" trap because the trap is produced from our learned experiences.</p><p>The dynamic, cyclical nature of these interactions and their outcomeswhich we refer to as "cognitive inertia" -poses a tall hurdle in studying how they unfold. The potential difficulty is that the three components of attention, The central thesis of our study is to establish that attention, learning and memory are intertwined, and it is the nature of this dependency that produces both efficient learning and the pitfalls of attention and representation traps <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>To examine the extent to which these constructs are intertwined, we develop a computational model, which we refer to as the "Fully Constrained by Representation" model, that assumes each of these constructs are constrained by one another, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1A</ref>, and their interaction can be used to make explicit predictions for observable measures. As we will discuss below, the observable measures from our study for decision making (blue node) -as informed by choice response time data -and attention (red node) -as informed by eye fixation data -will constrain the set of possible changes that can occur within the representation node (yellow), which is the only unobservable element in the diagram of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1A</ref>. The unobservable constructs of encoding dimensions and their associations with outcomes in memory during the course of learning are encapsulated in the representational component of the model. We will use latent variable modeling to infer the most likely representation that explains the simultaneous changes that occur in the attention and decision making data across time.</p><p>To examine the extent to which representation, attention, and decision making are intertwined, we used a three-pronged approach: (1) Experimental design,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To investigate representation traps, we introduced an unannounced switch half-way through the category learning task where the most relevant dimension became irrelevant, and an irrelevant dimension became relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This manipulation can cause learners to fall into representation traps:</p><p>if participants learn and remember that a dimension is irrelevant, they may have difficulty adapting to the change in relevance.</p><p>The second prong of our approach was to collect observable measures that would allow us to mathematically identify dynamic relationships between decision making, representation, and selective attention. In addition to the traditionally observed choice and response time aspects of decision making, we also used eye tracking to acquire a gaze-based measure of selective attention to dimensions <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The gaze measure allowed us to specify which dimensions would be encoded in memory and associated with category membership in the representation. The pattern of associations stored in the representation would then contribute to the model's impression of dimension relevance, which in turn would influence how dimensions were weighted when making decisions and allocated during selective attention.</p><p>The final, critical prong of our approach was to use a suite of computational models to systematically characterize the dynamic processes that gave rise to the measured categorization decision and selective attention behavior.</p><p>The foundation for this set of models was the Fully Constrained by Representation model ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1A</ref>) in which selective attention, representation, and decision making dynamically interact to mutually constrain one another. To test whether these constraints are necessary to account for participants' behavior, we compared how well the Fully Constrained by Representation model predicted behavior against a set of subordinate models, in which each of the constraints were systematically relaxed. To anticipate our results, the Fully Constrained by Representation model provided the best predictions for the majority of participants. By contrast, subordinate models failed to predict patterns of fixations and behavior we observed in the data, such as attention and representation traps.</p><p>After establishing that the best description of our data included all constraints among attention, representation, and decision making, we examined the extent to which different constraints gave rise to attention and representation traps. After first confirming the generality of traps, we suggest a prescriptive strategy for avoiding these traps, while simultaneously maintaining accurate and efficient decision-making processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Results</head><p>The data came from a two-phase category learning task. Participants categorized items with binary-valued dimensions that varied in relevance to category membership: <ref type="bibr">(</ref> between stimulus features and category membership, and (3) our evolving representation maintains a sense of dimension relevance, which ultimately guides how attention will be allocated to dimensions when making decisions. In the results below, we show how disconnecting any of the nodes leads to predictions that mismatch human data, in both qualitative and quantitative ways. However, we also will show how the presence of these connections consistently produces learning traps, and as such, we suggest a prescriptive strategy for avoiding traps despite the default architecture of human learning.</p><p>We present the results in five sections.

Fourth, we compare the model fits to fixation and choice response time data to ensure that the representation inferred by the model is an accurate description of the key patterns of selective attention and learning in our data. Finally, we show how representations used in our study are susceptible to learning traps, and provide three prescriptive strategies for everyday people who wish to avoid such traps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Summary of Empirical Results</head><p>Data were analyzed to assess the benefits and costs of selective attention to a decision-making task in which the relevance of dimensions to correct decisions had to be learned. Specifically, we first tested whether participants initially experienced benefits of selective attention as characterized by (1) increased attention to the deterministic dimension, and (2) corresponding improvements in decision accuracy and speed during Phase 1. We then tested whether participants incurred costs of selective attention in Phase 2 as characterized by</p><p>(1) a failure to identify the newly deterministic dimension that was previously irrelevant, and (2) a failure to achieve previous levels of decision speed and accuracy. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 4</ref> provides the most important summaries of the data alongside the model fits (which we discuss below), and Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> shows a more in-depth analysis of the data alone.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 4C</ref>; left panel of Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1C</ref>). Performance on test trials revealed effects of selective attention that were similar to the training trials (Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1B</ref>). Hence, over Phase 1, fewer dimensions were attended through time, and the attended dimensions were more relevant, resulting in both increases in accuracy and decreases in response time. The data confirmed this pattern. Based on the fixation data, upon entering Phase 2, it appeared that participants quickly realized the deterministic dimension had become less relevant, resulting in a reorientation of attention. However, in this phase, attention tended toward probabilistic dimensions rather than the newly deterministic dimension. As the right panel of Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1E</ref> shows, the newly deterministic dimension was attended approximately equally to the newly irrelevant dimension, and attention to these dimensions was lower than that of the probabilistic dimensions (62.9% of time looking at probabilistic dimensions versus 20.3% and 16.8% for deterministic and irrelevant dimensions, respectively). This failure to reorient attention to the newly deterministic dimension was accompanied by corresponding costs to categorization accuracy and speed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 4D</ref> shows that an immediate drop in accuracy occurred upon entering Phase 2 (also see right panel of Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1A</ref>). Although this accuracy did rise to a value of 0.805 by the end of the Phase 2 category learning trials, this accuracy level was substantially lower than the accuracy level attained at the same point in Phase 1 (0.957). The costs in response time showed a similar pattern, where response times sharply rose at the beginning of Phase 2 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 4C</ref>; right panel of Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1C</ref>), and steadily declined but never reached the speed at the end of Phase 1 (note that longer response times are typically related to greater decision uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>).</p><p>Performance on test trials revealed similar costs of selective attention (Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Links Among Representation, Attention, and Decision Making: Theoretical Predictions</head><p>In the introduction, we suggested that dynamic, cyclical processes between attention, representation, and decision making may unfold when the relevance of dimensions to decisions must be learned. First, attention may constrain the representation that learners form about the relevance of different dimensions to decisions. In other words, the relevance of a dimension to decisions may only be represented when the learner has attended to the dimension. Second, this learned representation may constrain attention and decision making. Specifically, learners may attend primarily to dimensions that they have learned are relevant, and the contribution of these dimensions to decisions may depend on their learned relevance. Whereas the results of the experiment suggest that these cyclical processes unfold, they do not shed light on the processes themselves. Specifically, they do not tell us: (1) How the information participants  There are three components of the model: attention, representation, and decision making; as well as two modes of operation: a decision process mode, and an updating mode. In decision mode, the model uses the information contained in the representation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1B)</ref> to selectively attend to particular stimulus dimensions. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1B</ref>, the representation is illustrated by a system of nodes corresponding to each feature (x-axis) within a dimension (partitions) and each possible choice response (orange versus blue nodes). These nodes carry weights that describe the relative likelihood that each feature is associated with each choice response (y-axis values). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1C</ref>, eye tracking data overlay an example stimulus where different features (i.e., color/shapes) appear in different dimensions (i.e., body locations) on each trial. On this trial, the participant first prioritized the neck button, then the foot, hand, and head dimensions through time (color coded in Panels C and D). Through the learning process, each stimulus feature becomes associated with the two categories (i.e., a Flurp or Jalet in our experiment), and this information is adjusted and maintained within the representation.</p><p>The representation is used in two ways. First, it is used to selectively attend to the specific dimensions on a given trial, and second, it is used to guide the category choice based on the set of features that are attended within a given trial. When fixating on a feature, the past associations of that feature with each category response are remembered, and information is additively accumulated as the observer fixates on different dimensions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1D</ref> shows many simulations of this accumulation process through time, where the particular fixation pattern in this example initially accumulates more evidence for the Jalet category based on the button, foot, and hand features, but then accumulates rapid information for the opposing Flurp category later in the trial when looking at the head. Eventually a sufficient amount of evidence is collected to trigger a response, and feedback from the experiment provides the correct category label. At this point, the model switches to update mode, where the information that was attended during the decision mode, along with the information about the true category label, is used to update the information in the representation. Updating the representation simply involves increasing the likelihood that the encoded features are associated with the choice corresponding to the feedback, and decreasing the likelihoods for features that were either unattended or inconsistent with the feedback. If, as in this example, feedback informed the participant that the stimulus was a Flurp, the representation values corresponding only to the attended features and the Flurp category would be increased.</p><p>Completing the cycle, the newly updated representation would subsequently guide which dimensions will be attended on the next trial.  used in the model is based on reinforcement learning principles, where the likelihood of each category is maintained as a function of each feature value, with adjustments being made on each trial depending on what information was attended in (C). (C) Illustrative stimulus and associated fixation time series (overlaid dots) for the eye tracking data which serves as a proxy for attention in the model. The color gradient reflects time in both Panels C and D. (D) The decision making process on each trial is driven by the evolving representation in (B), and the proportion of fixations during the decision period, shown in (C). Two accumulators representing the choice options race to a threshold amount of evidence (not shown), at which time a choice is made corresponding to the winning accumulator (i.e., a "Flurp" response). In Panels B and D, the Flurp category is represented in blue, and the Jalet category is represented in orange. After a choice is made, feedback about the choice, and the attended features, are used to update the representation, which is used in subsequent trials.</p></div>

In this section, we introduce a set of model variants, all of which are systematically derived from the core Fully Constrained by Representation model. Specifically, each model was created by removing one or more connections between the nodes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1A</ref>, which relaxes a set of constraints. We begin by providing the reader with some qualitative intuition about the effects that relaxing each constraint has on the model's predictions for observable data (i.e., either eye tracking, choice, or response time) from our experiment. In later sections, we will provide full quantitative analyses by fitting the set of models to data.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1">Description of Model Variants</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2">Theoretical Predictions</head><p>To simulate each model, we provided each model variant with the same stimuli used in our experiment, and assumed two phases with training periods only (i.e., no testing, because test trials did not allow participants to revise or update their representations). For each simulation, we randomly chose a stimulus set from the actual experimental design used in our experiment, simulated the model under a specific set of constraints (i.e., a model variant), and recorded key predictions for observed variables. We repeated this process 1000 times for each model variant. To simulate fixations, we assumed that five dimensions were sampled with replacement according to a probability vector that may be informed by the representation, depending on the model variant. To keep the simulation simple, if a dimension were sampled, we assumed it was also encoded and would be used to update the representation. All parameters in the model were held constant across model variants so that the effects of each constraint could be isolated.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">Switchboard Analysis</head><p>One approach to validating the Fully Constrained by Representation model would be to simply fit the model to data and visually inspect how well the model captures important trends in the data. However, in our view, it is not enough to develop only one computational model with one specific set of assumptions because such a procedure does not facilitate a systematic evaluation of model mechanisms [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Instead, we constructed a suite of models to factorially test the plausibility of each constraint under consideration, a type of modeling we refer to as "switchboard" modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 3B</ref> illustrates the lattice structure that specifies how constraints in the Fully Constrained by Representation models are systematically relaxed to produce the model variants. Systematically relaxing these constraints allows us to evaluate the degree to which each constraint in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 3A</ref> is necessary to account for human data. Each node in the lattice represents a specific model variant, and the dimensions of the lattice correspond to dimensions of constraints that were relaxed. In conjunction with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 3A</ref>, there are two ways in which Link 1 can be applied, two ways in which Link can be applied, and three ways in which Links 2 and 5 can be combined, creating a total of 12 model After fitting each model independently across participants, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion [BIC; 36, 37] to assess how well each model captured each participant's data, while penalizing for complexity. In the BIC, lower scores indicate better model performance. One advantage of these types of switchboard analyses is that they enable one to assess how much a particular mechanism or link contributes to model performance, aggregated across the model variants under consideration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 3C</ref> shows the aggregated performance metrics associated with each link in Panels A and B. Here, we simply averaged the performance score for models with and without a specific constraint, and then calculated the difference in performance between those sets of models, giving us an impression of whether a particular constraint enhanced or harmed model performance. Here, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 3C</ref>      whereas the translucent squares show participant-level predictions. Here, we generated predictions from the model for all trials, and then determined how often the model predicted when participants would make a specific category response (i.e., "Jalet"). Given these counts, we used the actual responses from the data to bin the predictions. Specifically, we averaged the model predictions for trials in which participants actually made either the "Jalet" response (orange) or the "Flurp" response (blue). Ideally, the orange dots would sit at 1.0 and the blue dots would sit at 0.0 if the model were making perfectly accurate predictions. The model generally performs well at the aggregate level, although it does struggle to predict a few participants' response data from within-trial attentional (i.e., eye-tracking) dynamics (e.g., transparent points near 0.5). Triallevel model predictions for the probability of making a "Jalet" response on trials in which either a "Jalet" response was made (orange; top) or a "Flurp" response was made (blue; bottom). Larger dots reflect across-subject averages, whereas transparent squares are individual trials. Dashed vertical lines represent block transitions, and the dashed horizontal line reflects chance prediction accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">The Effects of Representation on Cognitive Inertia Traps</head><p>Having identified the most plausible representation used by the participants in our experiment, we next examine the potential impact that those representations have when learning in our task. Of particular interest are the cognitive inertia traps described in the introduction, which are produced by the dynamic constraints between attention, representation and decision making during the course of learning. Specifically, these constraints confer some advantages, when narrowing attention to only dimensions that have been learned to be relevant improves the efficiency of decision making (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). However, these constraints can also incur costs. In "attention traps", when In this section, we investigate how generalizable trapping behavior is. To do so, we used each participant's best-fitting representation to simulate additional realizations of that participant's behavior had they experienced a different set of stimulus sequences (i.e., labeled "Experimental Design" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 5</ref>). This analysis creates a 38 (participant) by 38 (design) simulation study, which we then replicated 10 times to better ascertain the variance of our results (i.e., 14,440 simulated experiments). We simulated gaze fixations by assuming participants sampled dimensions to attend when making their decisions, and then used the sequence of samples to identify how often each simulation fell into traps. To identify traps, we specified that a dimension must have the highest perceived relevance for all five of the last trials for a given phase. If a single dimension was not prioritized in these final trials, the representation was not considered to be consistently "trapped", and so we did not include it in the analysis below.</p><p>If a single dimension was prioritized, we then calculated the probability that the prioritized dimension either was the most diagnostic dimension (i.e., the deterministic dimension) or was not (i.e., either a probabilistic dimension or an irrelevant one).   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 5D</ref>, is consistent with the Attention Unconstrained by Representation model from the first simulation study (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). Due to the random sampling policy, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 5E</ref> shows that the Attention Unconstrained by Representation model rarely prioritizes a dimension consistently enough to fall into traps in either Phase 1 or Phase 2, avoiding both attention and representation traps.</p><p>However, this failure to use the representation to inform dimension sampling has drastic implications for the overall accuracy level. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 5F</ref> shows that the grand average accuracy barely reaches 60% correct. Hence, although the Attention Unconstrained by Representation model is good for avoiding traps, its performance is too inaccurate to be considered a good decision policy.  where the model is forced to randomly sample dimensions that it may not consider relevant throughout the learning process. Learning about these dimensions enables the possibility that another dimension will emerge as the most relevant dimension, thereby avoiding any learning traps. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 5L</ref> shows that unlike the random sampling policy in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 5F</ref>  The results of the present study reveal that fast and frugal heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> that ignore dimensions or prioritize particular dimensions in order to obtain more efficient decision-making can sometimes go awry, trapping learners into suboptimal patterns of selective attention that lead to poor decisions from which they seem incapable of recovering (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 5)</ref>. </p></div>

The dimension-fixation probabilities are normalized such that they sum to one, and each moment in time has been color coded with alpha transparency to reflect the probability magnitudes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_34">Figure 7F</ref> shows that at some points in time, the fixation probabilities are clearly on a particular dimension, but at other points in time (e.g., 400-500 milliseconds), the model cannot distinguish clearly between fixations at any particular dimension value. Such ambiguity occurs because these two regions overlap in terms of their uncertainty and spatial proximity. The consequence of this overlap is that the model will weigh both of these dimensions when generating predictions for choice and response time in the Fully Constrained by Representation model, and these moments of attention contribute to the probability that a dimension will be encoded in any of the models that assume attentional encoding. 0 200 400 600 800 1000  The model assumes a variance term to capture the fixation, corresponding to targeting ability.

Upon the presentation of a stimulus probe, the representation is queued along the relevant dimensions to retrieve information consistent with task demands.

According to the axiom, when faced with a choice among several alternatives, a decision-maker will exhibit "matching behavior", meaning they will select options with probability in proportion to their utility in the task context, such as in the original applications where utility was defined as the expected reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. Here, we define a measure of utility as the degree to which a given dimension discriminates between the (two)</p><p>categories. There are two steps to computing the dimension disparity. The first simply calculates the absolute difference in the evidence values in P i across categories. Given the partition within P i , we can calculate differences between the representations for each category by multiplying P i by a contrast matrix.</p><p>For example, if we only have two categories, the absolute difference can be calculated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">V * i = |DP i | , where D = [1 − 1]</formula><p>and |x| is the element-wise absolute value of the matrix x.</p><p>For the first trial, the difference vector would be V * 1 = 0.10 0.10 0.00 0.10 0.10 0.00 0.00 0.00 .</p><p>The second step simply combines the elements of V * i so that they reflect aspects of the dimension, rather than the features.

Assuming judicious attention to dimensions, the absolute difference values would be V * 51 = 0.70 0.67 0.00 0.44 0.53 0.02 0.00 0.00 . In this transition, the participant has yet to see the gold hexagon tail, and so there is no information about this stimulus, making the disparity for this feature zero. Similarly, there is no information about purple triangle or red heart buttons, and so the corresponding disparity values are both zero. To get disparity, we sum these absolute differences up within a dimension such that V 51 = 1.37 0.97 0.02 , which indicates that the disparity value will be high for the deterministic dimension, low for the irrelevant dimension, and somewhere in between for the probabilistic dimensions, reflecting knowledge that is consistent with the relevancy of each dimension.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">W =             1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1             .</formula></div>

For this, we relied on a standard softmax transformation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">DD i = exp(κV i ) d exp(κV i ) ,</formula><p>where DD i is a probability vector on Trial i of length D, where each element is the probability of fixating on each dimension of the stimulus. This allows us to prospectively predict the likelihood of fixating on a particular stimulus dimension on a new trial based on the past history of stimuli, fixations, and feedback. Hence, the model makes predictions for what a person will choose to look at on a new trial based on their particular history of experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.3">Attentional Encoding</head><p>One of the central questions we wish to investigate here is whether using a To incorporate eye-tracking data, we assumed that the time spent looking at a feature would be monotonically related to the probability of encoding it, and assumed the following generic logistic function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">p(x|k, b) = 1 1 + exp [−k(x − b)] ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where x is the amount of time spent fixating on a particular feature value, k is a slope parameter, and b is an intercept parameter. We recorded eye-tracking data during both the decision period and during the feedback period where participants were allowed to look at the stimulus again while being told the correct category membership. Because we wanted to avoid biasing the parameters of the feature encoding function, we simply calculated the probability of encoding based on fixation data for both the decision and feedback periods, and set the encoding probabilities to the maximum of these two values. This avoided the possibility of adding two subliminal fixations on a feature to a supraliminal fixation, resulting in encoding that is unlikely given a break in the two fixation segments. Formally, letting g q i,d and g r i,d denote the amount of time fixating on the dth dimension of the ith stimulus during the decision (q) and feedback (r) periods, respectively, we set</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">e i,d = max p(g q i,d |k, d), p(g r i,d |k, b) .</formula><p>As an example, the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">Figure 8C</ref> shows some fixation data for the stimulus in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">Figure 8A</ref>. Here, the blue tail was fixated for a long time, followed by the black "x" shaped button, followed by the red crescent hands. If we assume that the fixations are thresholded, as could be done by setting k to a very large value (e.g., k = 20) in Equation 4 and set b to some value reflected by the dashed vertical line, then only the blue tail and black button would be fully encoded. In general, the parameter k can be fully estimated which would allow the representation to do "partial" updates for feature dimensions that were fixated upon for some nonzero amount of time. However, to keep the model simple, we have instead assumed k = 20 for all model fits, and instead freely estimated the threshold parameter b.</p><p>Although e i,d specifies the probability of encoding a feature, to make our updating equation more compact, we need to represent this information in a way that is consistent with the other elements of the representation, such as the stimulus S * i and evidence weights P i .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1">Evidence Accumulation Dynamics</head><p>To make a prediction for choice response times on each trial, we need only map the category activation matrix A i into a variable representing the strength of evidence for each choice alternative, which we will henceforth refer to as a drift rate. To test various counterfactuals (see main text), we allowed for three types of maps: (1) the activation matrix plays no role, (2) all features in the activation matrix contribute equally, and (3) features contribute to activation in proportion to how long they were attended. Ultimately, the map must produce a vector of length C, where each element corresponds to how active each category choice is.</p><p>Working deductively, we can start by specifying the general function that defines the rate of evidence accumulation on Trial i as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">ν i = A i z + V T T i + I 0 1 (C×1) ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where settings of each component allows us to complete the three types of maps.</p><p>The term I 0 is a baseline level of activation that ensures that both drift rates are always at least as large as I 0 . Although I 0 is estimable, we did not find that freely estimating it dramatically improved the model fits to data, and so we set I 0 = 0.1 for all model variants.</p><p>Decision Unconstrained by Representation To complete the first map, we assume that the representation plays no role, and instead, there are two drift rate parameters freely estimated from data, one corresponding to the correct response v + and one corresponding to the incorrect response v − . It is not the case that we presuppose that observers know which choice is correct once the trial begins -this simply allows us to represent the drift rate in a way that is consistent with the category choice. For example, when the stimulus is truly a Flurp, we want the drift rates to take the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">ν i = [v + v − ] T</formula><p>, and when it is truly a Jalet, we want  </p><formula xml:id="formula_28">ν i = [v − v + ] T ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">V = v + v − v − v + .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">G i = g i,1 g i,2 • • • g i,D .</formula><p>To convert the fixation durations into fixation proportions, we need only normalize this vector. Following normalization, we can then expand G i with a Kronecker product (see Equation 3) to make G i compatible with A i . Following both of these adjustments, we can set</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">z = G i ||G i || ⊗ 1 (1×F d ) .</formula><p>Because A i contains zeros for features that are not relevant to the stimulus, multiplying A i and z in Equation 7 eliminates the irrelevant terms created by the expansion.</p><p>With the vector ν specified, we can feed these values into a racing diffusion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>, where ν specifies the drift rates. Similar to the expanded Poisson race model <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref> and the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the racing diffusion model assumes that each possible choice is represented as a separate accumulator, and each accumulator races toward a common threshold amount of evidence, represented as a parameter θ. To derive a joint probability density function (PDF) for choice response times, we must first consider the diffusion process for a single response alternative. When only one alternative exists, the probability that the accumulator arrives at a level of evidence equal to θ is described by the Wald distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65]</ref>, which can be parameterized as</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">f (RT i | θ, ν (1) i , τ ) = θ 2π(RT i − τ ) 3 exp   − ν (1) i (RT i − τ ) − θ 2 2(RT i − τ )    ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">ν i = [ν (1) i ν (2) i ]</formula><p>T , RT i denotes the response time on the ith trial, and τ represents the effects of nondecision processes, such as motor execution or visual encoding. Equation 8 is the response time density when only considering a "Flurp" response. When choosing among more than one response option, we must take into account the activations of the other response options, by evaluating the joint PDF of choice and response time <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>. For computational convenience, we assume that the race process is independent across the accumulators. The independence assumption greatly simplifies the joint PDF such that an analytic expression can be derived. Denoting RC i as the response choice on</p><p>Trial i, the joint PDF of a racing diffusion process is</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">f (RC i , RT i |θ, ν i , τ ) = p(RT i |RC i )p(RC i ) = f (RT i |θ, ν (RCi) i , τ ) j =RCi 1 − F (RT i |θ, ν (j) i , τ ) ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">F (RT i | θ, ν<label>(j)</label></formula><p>i , τ ) is the cumulative density function of the jth accumulator:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">F (RT i |θ, ν (j) i , τ ) = Φ θ 2 (RT i − τ ) ν (j) i (RT i − τ ) θ − 1 + exp 2ν (j) i θ Φ − θ 2 (RT i − τ ) ν (j) i (RT i − τ ) θ + 1 ,</formula><p>and Φ(x) is the cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution at the location x. To avoid mathematical scaling issues, we set the moment-tomoment variability in the racing diffusion process σ w = 1 for all models. For this reason, σ w does not appear in the equations above describing the racing diffusion process.</p><p>The use of a racing diffusion process is clearly a simplification; there are likely to be complex interactions among the two response options that are subject to encoding dynamics within a trial. There are also likely to be effects such as trial-to-trial variability in the starting point of the accumulation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> and potentially mechanisms like collapsing bounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67]</ref> that provide superior fits to data. Indeed, we experimented with a timing mechanism running alongside the racing diffusion process such that if the timer hit a threshold prior to either choice, a random guess was given. Although this did enhance the model's fits to data considerably, we chose not to show those results here because they were not central to our main questions about the cyclical links between representation, attention, and decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2">Modifications Specific to Our Task</head><p>In addition to the model specifications above, we made a few slight adjustments when fitting the model to data to account for experiences that were not so easily cast within the general framework. First, to model the effects of the instruction period, we assumed traces were presented that were empty with the exception of a single feature element in the trace. We then supplied feedback about that feature, analogous to the instructions in the experiment. This process involved some initial information for the deterministic and probabilistic features, but because participants were not told about the irrelevant dimension, we supplied no information about it to the model. When learning about the instructions, we assumed that only learning occurred during this period, and that the updating equations were not subject to either leakage or inhibition by setting λ = 1 and β = 0. We also assumed that all instruction information was perfectly encoded for all models.</p><p>During test, because participants did not receive feedback, we assumed that no updating process could occur, which means that nothing could be learned during the testing period. During this time, the representations were not subject to any decay or inhibitory effects. However, to account for the shift in context that separated the training period of Phase 1 from the testing period of Phase 1 and the training period of Phase 2, we performed one update of the representation that involved only decay. In other words, after the last trial of the training period of Phase 1, we updated the representation by simply multiplying P i by R with λ in the diagonals and β = 0. This allowed the model's representation weights to lose some strength, which caused an overall slowing of response time and decrease in accuracy when going into Phase 2. However, we note that decay is not the only mechanism for the increase in response time -the dimensions that are attended on the first trial of Phase 1 also impact the rate of accumulation. Although we could have modeled the decay from one context to another as a free parameter, this simple "single-decay" update strategy was sufficient for our purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.3">Likelihood Function</head><p>Our goal was to jointly fit response choice RC i , response time RT i , and fixation durations G i on each trial. We considered these variables to be tied to a single representation (i.e., the model), but that they could be separated into a product of a joint distribution for choice and response time, and a distribution for fixation duration. To this end, the likelihood function for all variables is</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">p(RC i , RT i , G i ) = i f (RC i , RT i | θ, ν i , τ ) × Multinom G i SE DD i , n ,</formula><p>where we specified a saccade encoding time of SE = 100 to scale the fixation durations appropriately, n = d G i /SE, and Multinom(x|p, n) is the Multinomial distribution with draws x and probability vector p for the D dimensions of the stimulus:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">Multinom(x|p, n) = n! x 1 !x 2 ! . . . x D ! p x1 1 p x2 2 . . . p x D D .</formula><p>This is a joint likelihood function, which means that fitting the model to data secures the parameter values that lead the best joint explanation of all the data.</p><p>This means that the model can prioritize fits to behavior or fixation information, depending on which is more numerous. In our case, the gaze information played a larger role in the model fits, which helps explain why the model provides a compelling match to fixation data, and is relatively worse in explaining the choice response time data.</p></div>

With no observable data, any number of assumptions can be used to explain how changes in one component causes changes in another. Observable measures from experimental data constrain the possible ways in which these changes occur. For example, having observable measures of how individuals make choices, such as their response and the amount of time taken to make that response, might provide constraints on what information was learned in the past and remembered on specific trials [1, 2, 3]. Going one step further, having observable measures of attention would provide direct information about how people seek out information during a deliberation period, given what they have learned about the relevancy of each dimension when making similar decisions.</figDesc></figure>

First, we conducted an experiment in which participants could fall into different types of information traps while learning the relevance of different dimensions for categorization decisions. Specifically, participants pursued a goal of accurately categorizing stimuli with multiple dimensions that varied in relevance to category membership (from perfectly diagnostic, to moderately relevant, to irrelevant), and received corrective feedback for each categorization decision. If selective attention operates too quickly, learners can fall into attention traps in which their initial experiences lead them to mistakenly overestimate the relevance of only moderately relevant dimensions</figDesc></figure>

The first phase started with 30 category learning trials (i.e., categorization decision followed by corrective feedback) and ended with 20 test trials (with no corrective feedback). At the end of the first phase, an unannounced switch occurred in which the formerly deterministic dimension became irrelevant, and vice versa. This reversed set of dimensions constituted the second phase of the experiment (Phase 2), where participants had to adapt to a new choice environment [26, 14]. Similar to Phase 1, Phase 2 consisted of 30 training trials and 20 test trials under this new dimension relevance configuration. Categorization decisions, response times, and gaze to each dimension were recorded throughout, and all data were used when fitting the model. The core model, shown in Figure 1A, assumes that attention, representation, and decision making are all connected, and that observables such as eye fixation, choice and response time are best explained by using a single underlying representation of learned dimension relevance. The interconnectedness of our core model makes three clear predictions: (1) information that we attend drives our decision making processes, (2) feedback about our decisions and features that we encode are used to update our representation of the relationship</figDesc></figure>

In the center is the Fully Constrained by Representation (blue) model, where bidirectional links connect representation and attention, representation and decision making, and a one-directional link allowing attention to guide decision making. In this model, the representation of the learned relevance of dimensions to category decisions is constrained by attention: that is, in a trial, feedback about the association between a dimension and correct category membership is only encoded if the learner attended a dimension for enough time. At the same time, the representation guides what dimensions are attended on each trial, and how the observed dimensions guide the decision response.</figDesc></figure>

(A) Various types of models are produced by specifying links between representation (R), attention (A), and decision making (D). Each model structure is color coded for reference in Panels B and D. (B, D) The mean accuracy (B) and response time (D) values are shown from each of the five models across trials, separated into the two phases of the experiment (panels). (C, E) The mean fixation proportion for the deterministic (D; blue), probabilistic (P; gray), and irrelevant (I; red) dimension for the Representation Unconstrained by Attention model (C) and the Fully Constrained by Representation model (E), split into the two phases of the experiment (panels). In Panel E, only the predictions from the Fully Constrained by Representation model are shown due to the similarities between the Fully Constrained by Representation, Decision Unconstrained by Representation, and Decision Unconstrained by Attention models. The reference line marks the point of equal dimension sampling probability (1/7). Fixation proportion information for the Attention Unconstrained by Representation model is not shown because the proportions are invariant with respect to the learning sequence, and they would always sample each dimension equally (1/7). Simpler models are derived by relaxing constraints between representation, attention, and/or decision making. First, going rightward from the Fully Constrained by Representation model in Figure 2A, we can test whether decision making is constrained by attention and representation. When decision making is unconstrained by attention, all dimensions will be used equally when making a decision, a model we refer to as the Decision Unconstrained by Attention (green) model. Although we could have modeled attention to dimensions atheoretically as well [e.g., 18, 19, 20, 21], we avoided this because it adds many additional parameters and does not help identify a link between attention and decision making. When decision making is unconstrained by either attention or representation, the Decision Unconstrained by Representation (yellow) model is produced, which assumes that two free parameters (i.e., "drift rate" parameters for the correct and incorrect choice) specify the likelihood of each choice about the two categories. Because of this lack of dependence on representation, the Decision Unconstrained by Representation model is related to standard models of choice response time [22, 23, 24]. Both of these unconstrained models allow us to test whether decisions about stimuli are constrained by an evolving representation of the association between their dimensions and goal-relevant outcomes [i.e., category decisions; 25, 2, 26, 27, 28]. Second, going leftward from the Fully Constrained by Representation model in Figure 2A, we can test whether attention and representation mutually constrain each other. First, we can test whether the representation guides the allocation of attention to dimensions by generating the Attention Unconstrained by Representation (red) model. According to this model, attention to dimensions is constant across time, and not influenced by learning the relevance of dimensions. Second, we can test whether the representation is constrained by attention by generating the Representation Unconstrained by Attention (orange) model. According to this model, attention does not influence the information that is used to update the representation. The Representation Unconstrained by Attention assumption is the standard in modeling category learning [1, 29, 2, 25, 3, 30, 27]. In this model, all dimensions and their association with category membership are encoded in the representation on each trial, regardless of what dimensions were attended.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_11"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>2B and Figure 2D shows the models' accuracy and response time as a function of time, separated into the two phases of the experiment. Initially, the Decision Unconstrained by Representation model provides the best accuracy but worst response time. However, we note that the particular value of accuracy and response time is purely a consequence of the parameter values used when simulating the model; the important pattern in these simulated variables is that they cannot change across time. Because there is no connection from the representation to the decision, there cannot be changes in the observed variables as a product of learning. Next, the Representation Unconstrained by Attention model leads in accuracy and response time, because all information is being encoded, resulting in better diagnostics when that information is used during the choice. However, by the end of Phase 1, the Fully Constrained by Representation model overtakes the Representation Unconstrained by Attention model in both performance metrics of accuracy and response time. This pattern occurs once the Fully Constrained by Representation model learns to prioritize the deterministic dimension, meaning that it will only sample this dimension when making a choice. It follows then, that after the switch when the deterministic dimension becomes irrelevant, the performance of the Fully Constrained by Representation model is severely compromised because information about other dimensions cannot be meaningfully used (i.e., it was either not encoded toward the later stages of Phase 1, or the earlier experiences in the beginning stages of Phase 1 have decayed away). The other models perform somewhere in between these two extremes, where the Decision Unconstrained by Attention model learns more quickly in Phase 1, but it also incurs more costs during Phase 2 compared to the Attention Unconstrained by Representation model.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_12"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>2C and Figure 2E show the models' fixation proportion as a function of time, separated into the two phases of the experiment. The deterministic, probabilistic, and irrelevant dimensions are shown as the blue, gray, and red lines, respectively, where the gray line is the total probability of attending to any of the five probabilistic dimensions. The key result is that changes in attention to dimensions over time depend on whether representation and attention mutually constrain each other. Figure 2E shows how attention to dimensions changes over time when representation and attention constrain each other, as illustrated by the Fully Constrained by Representation model (which makes identical predictions to the other models with this bidirectional constraint). Figure 2C shows attention to dimensions when the representation is instead unconstrained by attention (i.e., the Representation Unconstrained by Attention model). In both panels, the lines represent the actual probabilities of attending to dimensions based on their learned relevance in the representation. In addition, inFigure 2E</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_13"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>only, attention to dimensions also constrains the set of features encoded in the representation. There are key consequences when the representation not only constrains attention, but attention also constrains representation. In Phase 1, when attention constrains representation (Figure 2E), the representation learns the relevance of the deterministic dimension more rapidly, resulting in faster increases in attention to the deterministic dimension. By contrast, when representation is unconstrained by attention (Figure 2C), the model encodes more information about the relevance of probabilistic dimensions, and thus allocates more attention to them. These differences have important consequences for attention in Phase 2. Specifically, because the relevance of probabilistic dimensions was better encoded in Phase 1 in the Representation Unconstrained by Attention, this model takes longer to learn the relevance of the newly deterministic dimension. (See Supplemental Materials for an in-depth analysis of how these dynamics emerge due to the balance of decay and inhibition between dimensions in the representation.) 1.3 Links Among Representation, Attention, and Decision Making: Model Evaluations Although the simulation study above is useful in foreshadowing the effects that various constraints among representation, attention, and decision making will have on behavioral and eye-tracking measurements, each of the model predictions are derived from a single set of parameter values. We chose these parameter values and kept them constant across model variants to isolate the effects of links across attention, representation, and decisions, but they do not reflect the models' best attempt to characterize individual participants' data. Hence, in this section we move away from the qualitative analyses presented above and perform a complete quantitative evaluation of how well each model structure can capture key patterns in our data.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_14"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>3A illustrates the Fully Constrained by Representation model, where attention, representation and decision making are depicted as separate nodes in a network. Constraints between nodes are color-coded to associate each constraint to the model variant that is produced when it is relaxed in the other panels.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_15"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>variants. For Link 1, either the representation can guide attention to dimensions, or attention can be completely unrelated to the representation, meaning that it is constant across time and not influenced by the learned relevance of dimensions. For Link 3, either the attended information on each trial can be used to update the representation (i.e., the link is intact) or attention does not modulate the associations between features and category membership used to update the representation, and the representation updates all associations indiscriminately. Finally, we assume three different ways in which the representation can be used to predict choice and response time. The first is the Decision Unconstrained by Representation model, in which two parameters are freely estimated, one for the correct response and one for the incorrect response. The second is a Decision Unconstrained by Attention model in which Link 2 is intact, and all stimulus dimensions are used equally when making choices, regardless of whether or not they were encoded. The third model variant is the Fully Constrained by Representation model, in which attention to dimensions modulates their importance in the decision. To do this, we calculate the proportion of fixation duration on each trial and use this proportion to weight the dimensions within the representation. Such a model is analogous to using the eye-tracking data to directly drive the accumulators to a decision threshold so long as the particular sequence of fixations is irrelevant [i.e., the pattern of fixations are exchangeable; see, e.g., 35]. In summary, by having the baseline Decision Unconstrained by Representation model, we can evaluate how well the representation improves the fits to choice response time data (i.e., comparing a model with neither Link 2 nor Link 5 to a model with either Link 2 or Links 2 and 5), and how well having the eye-tracking information on each trial improves the fits further still (i.e., comparing a model with only Link 2 to a model with both Links 2 and 5).</figDesc></figure>

Having Constraint 2 did not substantially contribute to model performance, but applying Constraints 2 and 5 in conjunction contributed greatly to model performance relative to the Decision Unconstrained by Representation model. Figure 3D shows model performance scores separated by model variant (rows) and participants (columns), where the Fully Constrained model better accounted for 18 out of our 38 participants. Figure 3E shows the performance scores for each model, aggregated across subjects. Here, the results at the aggregate level are consistent with the individual rankings, where the Fully Constrained by Representation model obtained the lowest BIC score in the set of models investigated here. Together, these two panels show that the Fully Constrained by Representation model outperformed any other combination of constraints between the nodes in Figure 3A, thereby justifying the need for constraints between attention, representation and decision making in learning dynamics. Finally, we emphasize that our conclusions about constraints are not subject to assumptions about the representation itself. In the Supplementary Materials, we consider four alternative representations, such as models with fixed learning rates and no dimension inhibition. Although the representations we tested fit the data to various degrees, within each representation class, the ordering of model performance was identical with respect to how the representation can be used to constrain attention and decision making.</figDesc></figure>

In this section, we therefore evaluate the absolute performance of the model by comparing its fits to measures of attention, choice, and response time in our data.</figDesc></figure>

In our experiment, conditions only varied in how the stimulus dimensions were assigned relevance. In each panel, blue designates the deterministic dimension, red designates the irrelevant dimension, and gray designates probabilistic dimensions. Across conditions and phases, the model predicts a pattern of attention that is in close agreement with the eye-tracking data. Of particular importance are the probabilistic dimensions, which across panels exhibit appreciably idiosyncratic patterns of dimension attention (i.e., some probabilistic dimensions are attended more than others, even though they are of equal relevance). At a high level, the close match of the model to these idiosyncratic tendencies suggests that the model is capturing underlying representations for individual participants based on their unique experiences.Figure 4Bshows the model's fit to the eye-tracking data differently, where fixation proportion is shown as a function of time and collapsed across conditions. Here, the model predictions are shown as solid lines, whereas the data are shown as dotted lines (i.e., see Extended DataFigure 1E). In general, there is a close agreement between data and model predictions, although the model is slightly slower than participants to adapt to changes that occur in Phase 2.</figDesc></figure>

In "representation traps", when the representation constrains attention and decision making (Links 1 and 2 in the model switchboard), the representation of dimension relevance that is formed during an initial period of learning can prevent learners from adapting to a change in dimension relevance. Specifically, when an initially irrelevant dimension becomes relevant, the representation of the dimension as irrelevant may prevent learners from seeking out this dimension to form category decisions. In summary, Links 1, 2, and 3 generate the cognitive inertia underlying attentional and representational traps.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_23"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>5B shows the trapping analysis for the Fully Constrained by Representation model, schematically illustrated in Figure 5A. Here, the simulation is broken into Phase 1 (left) and Phase 2 (right), where the grid of trapping probabilities are organized into the participant's representation (rows) and the experimental design (columns). As a general rule, the Fully Constrained by Representation model tends to produce a pattern of consistent dimension prioritization, such that if a dimension is perceived to be relevant, the model will direct attention toward that dimension. However, the dimension that is prioritized is quite often not the most relevant (i.e., deterministic) dimension. First, several participants are predicted to fall into attention traps on 50% of the experimental designs, in which initial learning causes them to prioritize a probabilistic dimension in Phase 1. Notably, many more participants are predicted to fall into representation traps, in which the representation of the dimension that is irrelevant in Phase 1 prevents the prioritization of this dimension in Phase 2 when it becomes deterministic. This trap is also reflected in the grand average (black line) in Figure 5C, where accuracy climbs quickly in Phase 1, but suffers from a dramatic drop back down to chance (i.e., 50% accuracy) following the transition to Phase 2. Together, the results suggest that the most plausible model of human decision making is susceptible to both attention and representation traps.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_24"><head>1. 4 . 1</head><label>41</label><figDesc>How Can Humans Avoid Traps? We next evaluated how consequential traps are to decision making. Specifically, we evaluated whether it was possible to alter the Fully Constrained by Representation model to avoid traps while still producing high decision accuracy. To this end, we evaluated modifications to the Fully Constrained by Representation model designed to avoid traps. The first alteration to the Fully Constrained by Representation model allowed attention to be unconstrained by representation. Instead, we simply adjusted the Fully Constrained by Representation model to enforce a completely random dimension sampling process that was invariant to the evolving representation-based levels of dimension relevance. This model, illustrated in</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_25"><head>Second, we adjusted</head><label></label><figDesc>the Fully Constrained by Representation model by assuming that all dimensions were encoded on each trial, regardless of whether or not those dimensions were sampled within that trial. Because of this Representation Unconstrained by Attention assumption, this model will automatically learn to prioritize dimensions that are more relevant because the model has full information about the association between dimensions and category membership. The model, illustrated inFigure 5G, is consistent with the Representation Unconstrained by Attention model from the first simulation study.Figure 5Hshows that in general, the Representation Unconstrained by Attention assumption enables the model to consistently identify the deterministic dimension in both phases.Figure 5Ishows that the accuracy levels are often quite high, with some subjects reaching over 90% in the first phase. Additionally, there is only a small dip in accuracy during the transition into Phase 2, indicating that the model can temporarily rely on probabilistic dimensions until it learns to prioritize the newly deterministic dimension (seeFigure 5H,right panel). This model can therefore avoid attention and representation traps, while still achieving a high level of accuracy. However, this outcome is achieved by encoding all associations between dimensions and category membership, regardless of whether dimensions are even observed. As our analyses above suggest, this assumption is implausible for humans. At this point, all three models discussed so far have some type of deficiency. Either the representation (1) has a tendency to prioritize the wrong dimension, (2) exhibits unreasonably poor accuracy, or (3) incorporates an information search policy to which capacity-limited humans simply cannot adhere (i.e., Representation Unconstrained by Attention of all available information). In an effort to provide a prescriptive model for a good human learning policy [38], we investigated a hybrid of the Fully Constrained by Representation model and the Attention Unconstrained by Representation model policies, which we call the "Partially Constrained by Representation" model, illustrated inFigure 5J. The intuition behind this variant is simple: (1) we allow the model to sample one dimension that it perceives to be relevant, (2) we force the model to sample four other dimensions at random (to resemble the sampling frequency of participants in our experiment), and (3) we allow the model to use its perceived relevance to weight the incoming information appropriately. Such a policy is similar to doing research about a topic where 1/5 of your time is spent in a confirmatory search (i.e., searching for information you think is relevant), and 4/5 of your time is spent exploring new information (e.g., consulting sources that are related but not a priori believed to be relevant). Once all the information is collected, you weigh the information based on its post-collection relevance to the topic.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_26"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>5K shows that, like the Fully Constrained by Representation model, this Partially Constrained by Representation variant learns to prioritize dimensions consistently, but does so with great accuracy, with some exceptional participant/design combinations. The model avoids both attention and representation traps, where representation traps occurred slightly more than attention traps. The trap-avoidance behavior stems from the hybrid sampling policy,</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_27"><head>Figure 5 :</head><label>5</label><figDesc>, the Partially Constrained by Representation model exhibits exceptional accuracy, rising higher than either the Representation Unconstrained by Attention model or the Fully Constrained by Representation model. A final important characteristic is that the Partially Constrained by Representation model does not suffer from the dramatic dip in accuracy during the transition into Phase 2 like its counterpart, the Fully Constrained by Representation model. This pattern occurs because, like the Representation Unconstrained by Attention model, other (probabilistic) dimensions are temporarily used at the beginning of Phase 2 until the model can learn about the newly deterministic dimensions contained in the previously irrelevant dimension. The Effects of Representation on Information Traps. Different model structures (A,D,G,J; first column) have direct impacts on the probability of consistently prioritizing a dimension (B,E,H,K; second column) and choice accuracy (C,F,I,L; third column).

The second column (B,E,H,K) shows the probability of falling into an information trap in Phase 1 (left) and Phase 2 (right), where blue colors indicate the deterministic dimension was consistently prioritized, and red colors indicate that a non-deterministic dimension was prioritized, a situation we refer to as a trap. White cells represent simulations where no dimension was consistently prioritized. Each subject's best fitting parameter values (rows) were used in every other subject's experimental design (columns) to better assess generalizability.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_28"><head>2 Discussion</head><label>2</label><figDesc>When making decisions, we must often base our choices on only a fraction of the copious information available to us. Although only selectively attending to information relevant to our goals can substantially simplify the challenge of navigating this overabundance of information, it presents its own challenges, as we must often learn what information is most relevant. Here, we investigated this vital aspect of decision making using a combined behavioral, eye-tracking and computational modeling approach.Importantly, our combined approach illuminates how cognitive inertia traps emerge from dynamic interactions between selective attention, learning, and memory. In this multi-pronged approach, we measured gaze and performance as participants pursued a goal to categorize stimuli that possessed multiple dimensions of varying relevance to category membership. We then developed a computational model that uses an individual's gaze to infer the dimensions that they encoded in memory, and therefore the associations between dimen-sions and category membership that they learned. This inferred representation therefore captured the individual's subjective perception of the relevance of the dimensions in making correct categorization decisions. Finally, we used these inferred representations of subjective relevance to predict: (1) How participants oriented selective attention to the different dimensions, and (2) How looking at dimensions contributed to the accumulation of evidence for decision making. This approach therefore gave us key insights into the dynamic interactions between selective attention, memory, and learning in decision making that led to cognitive inertia traps. This study revealed dynamic interactions between selective attention, learning, and memory in which selective attention facilitated efficient decision making, but at the cost of cognitive inertia that caused learners to miss goal-relevant dimensions of information. First, learners fell into representation traps, in which learning the relevance of different dimensions subsequently hindered their abilityto adapt when this relevance changed [also see<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Second, some learners also fell into attention traps, in which they rapidly learned to selectively attend to only moderately goal-relevant dimensions, even though a dimension that could have supported perfectly accurate decisions was readily available.</figDesc></figure>

In Phase 1, participants learned to classify two categories of alien creatures, and then in Phase 2 an unannounced switch occurred wherein the previously deterministic dimension and the previously irrelevant dimension swapped roles. The formerly deterministic dimension took on a new, previously unseen, value that was fixed across all stimuli of both categories, while the formerly irrelevant dimension now had two new potential values that perfectly predicted category membership (See</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_30"><head>"</head><label></label><figDesc>Correct this is a Flurp."). While this change in feedback may have given participants some indication that a change had occurred, it was necessary so that participants would need to figure out on their own the new contingencies between dimensions and categories. Testing in each phase consisted of 20 trials consisting of Match and Conflict items. Match items consisted of the same category structure as items presented during category learning trials, and (2) Conflict items consisted of the deterministic dimension value of one category, and all five probabilistic dimension values of the opposite category. Again, participants saw the stimuli one at a time and were instructed to indicate whether they thought each creature was a Flurp or Jalet, but no feedback was provided during the test. The 10 items seen during training (i.e., the Match items) and 10 Conflict items were each presented once, in random order. Responses to the Conflict items provided the cornerstone of our analyses related to learned inattention. Prior to the switch, they provided the baseline level that each participant tended to categorize based on the single deterministic dimension. After the switch, responses to the Conflict items told us whether participants learned and used the rule on the new deterministic (formerly irrelevant) dimension.</figDesc></figure>

Panels A, C, and E are associated with an early trial where the representation is not fully developed, whereas Panels B, D, and F are associated with a later trial in which the representation has had time to learn the relevance of stimulus dimensions. At its core, the models maintain a representation of the likelihood that each feature in each dimension is associated with each of the (two) decisions -in this case, categories. Figure 8A represents these likelihoods (y-axis) as a function of each feature value (x-axis), where categories are designated by blue and orange circles. The likelihoods of each category across features is how the model executes actions, such as orienting attention toward relevant dimensions and making categorization decisions. Two separate functions operate over the representation to make explicit predictions about observable variables, and these predictions can be optimized by adjusting a set of seven parameters. An important constraint is that the representation is the only component of the model that is evolving through time -the mathematical structure linking the representation to attention and decision making is invariant to new learning experiences.</figDesc></figure>

Here, the dark green bars correspond to the disparity-by-dimension values V 1 , because they aggregate (i.e., sum) disparity values across all features within a dimension.

In the absence of direct measures of attention to guide encoding, any number of episodic memory models may be used here, such as those employing buffer style encoding systems [50, 51, 52]. In our case, we used eye-tracking data as a proxy for attention. This approach departs from other computational learning models where attention is either freely estimated and assumed fixed across time [1], or follows a particular assumption about the direction of attention orientation [e.g., reducing errors; 2, 3, 4]. Instead, eye tracking allows us to directly infer how attention orients in response to a variety of person-specific goals and incentives that are difficult to specify theoretically.Hence, our approach allows us to investigate an interesting question of whether or not participants adapt their attention in a useful way given their representation, rather than adapting attention in an optimal way, based the properties of the stimulus.</figDesc></figure>

Because this was not found to be particularly useful when fitting the model to data, we have set ζ = 0 in the model variants presented here. To build in the concept of inhibition across dimensions, we need another matrix R to inhibit information across dimensions. The basic notion of dimension inhibition is that once the evidence values for a particular feature dimension become large enough, as they would from learning about the relevancy of a dimension, the amount of evidence itself can suppress changes in evidence learned about in other dimensions. So, even if another dimension becomes diagnostic and more relevant to the task, it may take considerable time for the model's representation to reflect this relevancy if another dimension was already determined to be relevant. Similarly, if two dimensions are considered relevant, inhibition would tend to suppress the need to consult both dimensions if one dimension</figDesc></figure>

Setting α = 1 creates a mathematical equivalence between a strength representation and an instance representation, where episodic traces form the basis of category knowledge in the model. As we discuss in the Supplementary Materials, such a constraint performs well if inhibition is present in the model, but because learning rate effects are classic in the field of reinforcement learning, we freely estimated α in results presented in the main text. Equation 6 expresses the updating process in terms of information pertaining to encoding and the stimulus properties (i.e., right hand term) and dynamics that are not information specific (i.e., left hand term). Whereas the right hand</figDesc></figure>

Decision Unconstrained by Attention To implement an Decision Unconstrained by Attention variant, we eliminate the right hand term of Equation by settingv + = v − = 0. Recall that A i is a (C × d F d ) matrix,where only the columns relevant to the stimulus are nonzero. To impose equal attention along all relevant dimensions of A i , we simply set z = 1, where z is a vector of length d F d , filled with ones. Fully Constrained by Representation Similar to the Decision Unconstrained by Attention model, the Fully Constrained by Representation model commits a theoretical constraint by tying the drift rates to the representation by setting v + = v − = 0. As above, we let g i,d denote the amount of time spent fixating on the dth dimension on Trial i. For convenience, we can define a vector containing all of these fixation durations on Trial i, organized by dimension, such that</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_45"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>are a total of seven parameters in the Fully Constrained by Representation model: a learning rate parameter α, a leakage or decay parameter λ, an across-category inhibition parameter β, a softmax temperature parameter κ to convert the dimension disparity values into fixation proportions, a threshold parameter θ for the evidence accumulation process, a nondecision term τ that shifts the predicted choice response time distributions due to motor response times and visual encoding, and a threshold parameter b on absolute time that determines how much fixation is needed to encode a stimulus feature. When the perfect encoding mechanism is used, the parameter b is set to zero and not estimated (e.g., the Representation Unconstrained by Attention model). When the representation is completely disconnected from the decision making component (e.g., the Decision Unconstrained by Representation model), we add two parameters, v + and v − . When dimension disparity is not used (e.g., the Attention Unconstrained by Attention model), the parameter κ is removed and DD i is set to 1/D, where D is the number of dimensions.Because we estimate the model parameters in a Bayesian framework, we must specify priors for each of the parameters. We settled on the following informative priors:α ∼ Beta(3, 2) λ ∼ Beta(5, 1) β ∼ Gamma(1, 5)κ ∼ Gamma<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref> θ ∼ Gamma<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1)</ref> τ ∼ Gamma(5, 0.01) b ∼ Gamma(8, 0.1), andv + , v − ∼ Gamma(4, 1)</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The notion that the most plausible representation of human learning we investigated is susceptible to traps is indeed quite alarming. Are traps actually unavoidable for most humans? Our final analysis revealed a prescriptive strategy that enabled the same underlying representation to largely avoid traps, while maintaining high levels of accuracy. The key modification was to only allow the representation to partially guide selective attention. By forcing the model to sample more information than it thought was necessary, the model was able to avoid both types of traps because it remained open to learning more about the stimuli than would otherwise naturally occur. These results suggest that caution must be taken when a learner is allowed to sample information, as selective attention narrows the diversity of knowledge that may be required to navigate an ever changing world.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Selective attention keeps us from wasting cognitive resources on elements of</cell></row><row><cell>our environment that do not facilitate positive behavior, allowing us to instead</cell></row><row><cell>focus on the factors most relevant to our goals.

In addition, the finite mixture model in Equation 1 considers the possibility of contaminants, which allow us to separate fixations to ROIs from non-fixations, such as saccades between ROIs, blinks, or looks that happen to be off-screen. The relative proportions of fixations to all sources -ROIs and contaminants -are then modeled by coefficients π k , which allows the generative model to capture particularly complex situations where not all dimensions are attended, or a single dimension is split into two different locations (e.g., the hands on opposite sides of the body).</figDesc><table><row><cell>(k) y ) terms in Equation 1.

We assumed that targeting variance was isotropic, meaning that it was of equal width in both x and y directions. Fig- ure 7D considers variance that may come about simply because the ROIs have different sizes. In some cases, such as the body, the variance associated with fixations to an ROI (e.g., along the y dimension) should be much larger than for other ROIs. In our analyses, we assumed a single variance term that was scaled based on the size of each ROI along each dimension. 1</note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>With appropriate representations of the stimulus and attention in place, we can now specify how updates in the model should occur. The update equation is similar to the Adaptive Representation Model [ARM; 27], with some slight adjustments for the specifics of our experiment. First, we assume that within a dimension, the similarity kernel is a simple pattern matcher so that features within a dimension are either matching the stimulus or not. For example, although a blue tail and an orange tail are similar in their dimension location, they are not similar to one another in terms of feature properties. This occurs naturally in the model based on the manner in which the stimuli are coded into discrete labels. Of course, one could recode the stimuli to exhibit primitive properties, such as edges, size dimensions, or color values (e.g., RGB), but this</figDesc><table><row><cell>seemed to be an unnecessary complication for our application. Second, because</cell></row><row><cell>we are extending ARM to multiple dimensions, we must consider how these di-</cell></row><row><cell>mensions interact on the basis of a set of experiences. Indeed, one of the central</cell></row><row><cell>problems we wish to address here is how learning about relevancy of a dimen-</cell></row><row><cell>sion can prohibit adaptations in later experiences. For example, if one learns</cell></row><row><cell>early on that a dimension is highly predictive of category label, how much will</cell></row><row><cell>this information inhibit the search for new information when that dimension</cell></row><row><cell>changes in relevancy or is hidden from view?</cell></row><row><cell>In the context of a single dimension, Turner [27] used a feedback matrix Q</cell></row><row><cell>of dimension (C × C) to incorporate inhibition.
