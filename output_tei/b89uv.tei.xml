			<abstract>
				<p>Operational C2 systems, as realised in military headquarters, will involve in the future a far greater diversity of knowledge domain specialists than the traditional paradigm, expanding to encompass experts in warfare and manoeuvre across non-traditional domains, emerging digital technologies, and multi-agency linkages as demanded by the increasing complexity of the cooperation-competitionconflict environment. The integration of these elements will be critical to enable timely and accurate awareness and decision making to meet the challenges and threats of an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape in which military force is but one element of national power. The integration of these specialists is not without its challenges, including problems with crossdomain communication, role ambiguity and team orientation. Generalists, individuals with a broader gambit of knowledge but less depth than specialists, are frequently touted as the solution to multidisciplinary teams. Generalists alone however lack the domain expertise to complete the same depth of tasks as specialists. Organisational theory provides a plethora of literature examining the specialist/generalist composition of an organisation, which is known as the specialist vs generalist dilemma. This paper will draw upon this body of research to build on the design of a 5th Generation Headquarters, a concept previously presented in ICCRTS. Included will be a model that enriches the binary conceptualisation of generalism v specialism, to explore the broad spectrum of knowledge heterogeneity and depth. Changes in structure, staff training, and automation/autonomous technologies are discussed as possible parameters that may be modified to enhance organisational effectiveness and agility. Introduction. The Generalist versus Specialist dilemma, or tension, is a long standing problem in the field of Public Administration. In this paper, we shall show how this problem manifests in military decision making processes, and therefore in Command and Control (C2). Indeed, it shall become clear that the dilemma maps almost entirely onto the problem space that Agile C2 concepts seek to resolve. Specifically, we shall show how the dilemma manifests in headquarters structure, where the most diverse range of specialisations are often collocated, how its resolution is critical in the contemporary and future operational environment, and how the future headquarters design, described elsewhere in this forum as the Fifth Generation Headquarters, provides a richer environment for the resolution of the Generalist versus Specialist dilemma. The dilemma is expressed through a variety of cultural truisms, often with a bias against the Generalist: &quot;Jack of All Trades and Master of None&quot; in English, &quot;Equipped with knives all over, yet none is sharp&quot; in China, while in Estonia is said, &quot;Nine trades, the tenth one-hunger.&quot; All these appear to portray almost a fraudulence in the role of the Generalist. Contrastingly, as we shall detail further below, the military deliberately builds for Generalists-in a sense, it&apos;s in the name of the senior land-based military rank. Nevertheless, an increasing spectrum of specialists are important in the work of any military headquarters, particularly at the joint or inter-agency level. How do the two</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>types of staff officer co-exist traditionally in military structures, and to what extent does this reflect relationships seen in civilian contexts? More significantly, is there a better way to enhance this coexistence in future organisational structures, particularly as autonomous technologies are integrated into the socio-technical fabric of headquarters? We answer these in the present paper.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. We first review the way Administration Theory has analysed this dilemma across a variety of application areas: government, health, and education. We then elucidate how the two categories occur in the military headquarters context, and how the dilemma itself is manifested. We show how the proposed Fifth Generation Headquarters concept provides for a new relationship between the two complementary roles. We expand on the binary Generalist-Specialist model to include new gradations of multi-specialist roles that can fulfil critical functions in a future headquarters design. Given that the Fifth Generation Headquarters concept is heavily socio-technical in nature, we explain how technology can enhance the types of multiple roles within our graded model. The paper concludes by providing direction for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administration Theory on the Dilemma</head><p>Within Classical Forms of Organisation. The Generalist-Specialist dilemma surfaces in many areas of human organised endeavours. It is therefore the focus of attention in much of Administration Theory, in both the public and private sectors. Rather than take a chronological view, we shall review some of the key literature in a more thematic way through a sequence of means of distinguishing the two roles: educational, role-based, and finally structurally based. The works we cite here are themselves a tip of the iceberg in the literature on this subject.</p><p>The word 'specialist' initially betrays an emphasis on education. In this respect the definition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rathore and Fadia (2008)</ref> is useful. They define Generalists as those "whose education and training were broad-based and so have no special skill in a particular area of human endeavour", with Specialists as those "skilled in a particular area of human endeavour as a result of long training". In this body of literature the term Generalist is often used interchangeably with "administrator", while Specialist as "professional". It is worth noting these authors review a range of work focused on the establishment of the Indian civil service, in the post-colonial period but with its inheritance of aspects of British administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Paracer 1975)</ref>. As a 'third world' nation at the time, education was a critical emphasisand thus much of this literature reviews the challenged capacity of Generalists to manage the increasing diversification of the Indian civil service workforce. The Generalist administrator, then, is characterised as one who moves from one department to the other, an 'all-rounder', or even in and out of the public sector. Functionally, their role is summarised in the acronym 'POSDCORB': Planning, Organising, Staffing, Directing, Coordinating, Reporting and Budgeting. The heart of the dilemma is expressed as follows. The Specialist is intrinsically subordinate to the Generalist, and yet the latter in making final decisions is in the position of "greater ignorance about the subject … than the specialists in that subject." However, it is the breadth of alternative perspectives that the Generalist brings to bear on the decision: financial, legal, and political implications of the decision. In particular, the authors emphasise the skill of human-management as the domain of the Generalist, as a mediator to link across the system and "persuade" its narrowly focused Specialist elements to work with the Generalist. This skill, to draw the best from the Specialist advisors, is not learned by education but experience.</p><p>In contrast to the significance of education, Jann and Wegrich (2019) distinguish Generalists (who themselves may have a deep educational background that has ceased to be relevant to their daily work) and Specialists through the specific role they play in decision making. Generalists are "those responsible for cross-cutting policies" while Specialists are "responsible for a particular policy field". These authors describe the manifestation of the dilemma in the drive for "meta-policy" approaches in the bureaucracy of the European Union. These authors provide further insight into why Generalists are so challenged in their role of coordinating across specialist fields to achieve measurable efficiency and effectiveness in decision making outputs. Specialists are able to exploit their networks to "activate internal and external resources to deploy expertise and defend their autonomy." Generalists have access to "hierarchical powers", but can only use it "selectively and with care due to the limited conflict resolution and information processing capacity" they have available, particularly in the face of the complexity of modern government. Complexity is manifested here, despite attempts at classical organisation using <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Simon's (1962)</ref> principle of 'near decomposability' where highly interdependent tasks are clustered organisationally lowering decision making around coordination as low as possible. The multiplicity of 'meta-policies' under various Generalist administrators, cutting across so many specialist units, creates challenges in prioritisation and provokes specialists to defend their autonomy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wildavsky's (1979)</ref> classic work on Public Policy is cited both by these and other authors on this dilemma, "Without specialization there is no knowledge, and without knowledge there is no power," in addition to his metaphor for the dilemma facing Generalists, that they are not unlike "a dinosaur with a huge body and a small brain". This is not a statement belittling the capacities of any individual in a leadership position, but describing in extremis the challenge they face in processing information across large numbers of deep expertise.</p><p>The heart of the dilemma then is one of a clash of sources of power: the positional power of the Generalist by virtue of their place in a hierarchy, and the informational power of the Specialist through their 'arcane' knowledge. It is no surprise then that the dilemma is reflected in another of the long-standing issues in Administrative Theory, the tension between centralisation and decentralisation. This is explored in the health sector context by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Thomas and Hilleboe (1968)</ref>, who (again) reflect on classical organisational structures using the principle of division of labour, which ultimately defines the Specialist. The Generalist is then the "coordinator or integrator" (our emphasis). In the absence of consensus about choices for prioritisation, "the Generalist resorts to authority … but the authority stultifies the performance of those upon whom it is imposed … especially if it requires imagination and judgement … so often true of specialists." These authors raise the significance of legal accountability which makes it incumbent on the Generalist to centralise prioritisation of resource sharing, in other words coordination. They cite Dwight Waldo (1948) "the expert should be on tap not on top". It is no surprise then that these authors support, as a general principle the concentration of decision-making power in the Generalist, with another 'law' ascribed to one of the authors as Hilleboe's iron law: "coordinates cannot coordinate each other" or "equals cannot coordinate equals". In their words, "In the real world of administration, the exercise of authority often becomes the only way to get things done." Nevertheless, with Thomas and Hilleboe writing in the early stages of Contingency Theoretic approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burns and Stalker 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Donaldson 2001)</ref>, the authors suggest there can be flexibility: "successful leadership requires sense of when to emphasise one set of ideas [encouraging consensus amongst Specialists, decentralisation] and when another [concentrating decision-making, centralisation]". One might see here an early echo of Agile C2, to which we shall return later.</p><p>Beyond the Classical Form. All the above has defined the Generalist-Specialist dilemma through the lens, indeed as a consequence of the classical hierarchical form of organisation. One of the earliest to detect the opportunity for resolution of the dilemma in "unorthodox" structures is <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Golembiewski (1965)</ref>. First he repeats the above analysis of the dilemma using the principle of division of labour. He is particularly eloquent in articulating the negative consequences of the Generalist-Specialist divide: that the bias (through informational power) to the Specialist renders the Generalist cynical, and that this sees an organisation "devouring its young … that could use the generalist inclinations of its employees to advantage in later years." He also emphasises the role of the Generalist in integration of the work of subordinates but that the former do not control enough work-elements (the detail of the information) to make reasonable decisions, such that "only trivial decisions [are] relegated to the supervisor". This in turn, and with the principle of finite span of control (three to ten subordinates), leads to tall organisations, where decisions overall are made at some distance from the "action level". Golembiewski's "unorthodox" form sees, on the one-hand, a hierarchy, with division of labour, but where "complete work flows" rather than break up of individual functions or processes are kept together in one unit. In contrast to the principle of a subordinate having a single supervisor, now "multiple supervision [of a subordinate] is standard", across those who are responsible for the complete work flows, and those for maintaining standards and training of specialisation. Golembiewski does not use the word, but it is clear he is describing an early form of the principles of matrix management. The advantage of this form is to provide the Generalist supervisor increased access to whole work flows without intervening layers of management, enabling decisions at lower "action" levels. Golembiewski highlights the "social and psychological forces" which encourage integration of a team, and individuals identify with the work unit, "a most human and convenient thing to do". In many respects, the "unorthodox" model resolves the imbalance of Generalist-to-Specialist workforce members that the previous authors, rooted within the classical hierarchy, propose as solutionswithout them identifying any structural means to do so.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Galbraith (1971)</ref>, the matrix nature of this management approach is explicit, with the contrast between "functional" and "project" management lines, the two axes of the structure; "functional" here means a Specialist role. Amplifying Golembiewski's list of the advantages to the Generalist manager --of the product lines, in Galbraith's terminologyhere the Specialist gains through better opportunities for career paths, while overall the pooling of Specialists and "time-sharing them across products or processes" allows efficiencies in what is an otherwise expensive resource. The origins of matrix forms of management is identified in the aerospace industries of the 1960s, including NASA, but permeated across to private sector firms in the 1970s. We illustrate the structural contrast between classical and matrix forms in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. And yet, matrix management is rarely successfully implemented, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Galbraith (2009)</ref> himself reporting a failure rate of 75%. The warnings are already clear in Galbraith's 1971 work. A pure matrix consists of a "dual authority relationship", with "a power balance between the product … and functional sides." The key is that … equal power is an unachievable razor's edge <ref type="bibr">[requiring]</ref> enforced collaboration on budgets, salaries,… information and reporting systems. Such a balance is required because the problems that the organization faces are uncertain and must be solved on their own merits not on any predetermined power structure. <ref type="bibr">(Galbraith 1971, p. 35-36)</ref> The collaboration required here for success is difficult because of the demands on Emotional Intelligence, willingness to surrender control, and the time-cost in nominal collaborators getting to know each other. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Galbraith already leans towards a Contingency Theoretic view in providing some further principles to determine the circumstances (contingencies) where "function" or "product" should have stronger influence in decision-making. Where the "diversity of product lines", "rate of change of products" or "tightness of schedule" is greater, then seniority in product decision-makers is required. Contrastingly, if the competitive edge (in the language of business) is gained through the requirement of maintaining a technology (or technique, to generalise from the narrow view of the term) advantage, then functional managers need greater influence in decision-making. The failure of matrix management traditionally is where leaders on one side or the other fail to appreciate these distinctions or miss the changes in these priorities over time, creating power struggles, souring the landscape for collaboration, excessively constraining of the autonomy of creative Specialists, or failure to deliver projects on schedule and to requirements.</p><p>Having spent so much time reviewing the form of the Generalist-Specialist tension in administration and business, and the potential solutions, let us address how the dilemma manifests in the military C2 context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Dilemma in military headquarters</head><p>Headquarters and the Classical Form. How do the categories and tensions discussed above map to the military context? Firstly, as already alluded, the Generalists are those who, under most training systems employed around the world, have the chance to attain the equivalent in rank to that of General in land forces. These are invariably combat operations 'specialised', for example Principle Warfare Officers in the naval service. It is rare that an Intelligence or Logistics trained military member would attain to such a senior rank in their respective environmental service. Military specialists are therefore everything else: intelligence, communications, logistics, engineering, health, legal, personnel, and more recently public communications. Some of this is reflected in the classical organisation of headquarters functions, with Common Joint Staff System (CJSS) numbers J1-J2, J4, J6 and (lately) J9 allocated across such specialist functions. A J5 Plans or J3 Operations officer will, invariably, be combat operations trainedand naturally the staff officer with the opportunity to assume higher levels: Chief of Staff, Commander, or Chief of Service.</p><p>In many countries, and reflecting the trend for Generalists observed in Administration Theory for civilian roles, it is the traditional practice for military officers to rotate through roles every two to three years across the varying parts of the organisation as they, if continuing to demonstrate success, achieve higher promotion. As they move they oversee different types of Specialists in different application areas. They thus build diversity in their understanding of different areas of expertise; at a more junior rank they will be exposed to more of the detail and become familiar with deep concepts, even if they are not able themselves to manipulate them, but this becomes shallower as they rise. It is clear that this deliberate posting cycle is to build Generalists with an expanding range of experience to variety of specialist problem areas, and to build experienceand select for successin managing the types of human tensions around coordination that Administration Theory describes. The charismatic dimension of military leadershipmost often the basis for promotionaddresses precisely this requirement for overcoming coordination challenges. However there is a nuance in the nature of postings across military forces. The United States, with its significant scale, is able to build large corps of specialists to higher ranks than smaller forces, such as that of Canada which place more emphasis on breadth, and therefore "generalised specialists". 2</p><p>The Generalist-Specialist dilemma, while less fraught a debate in military forces for reasons to be given shortly, is manifest in much professional military fora, with some speaking for the value of the 'polymath' (a concept we shall employ below) as a description of the value that the Generalist brings 3 . Others critique the criterion of 'generalism' for promotion in building up and retaining a skilled cyber force. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Of course, military organisations use the classical organisational form, the rank-based hierarchy. The dilemma of why the Generalist should assume central authority in coordination is resolved by the emphasis on warfighting skills for those aspiring for 'command roles'. Military discipline trains Specialists to respect that prioritisation 5 , thus resolving some of the tensions evident in civilian workforces. This explains the way headquarters works with its top-down structure (J0 Commander to the J1-J9 subordinates): in planning, the warfighting trained but Generalist J5 member coordinates the specialists (J1, J2, etc) through a planning process; the plan is handed over, and the similarly warfighting trained but Generalist J3 coordinates staff Specialists in execution of an operation.</p><p>How is the dilemma manifested then in headquarters? Firstly, with priority given distinctly to the Generalist staff, under time-pressure, there can be a temptation to make judgement calls whether or not the informationtypically from an expert --is available. Indeed, warfare specialists are trained in Patton's adage "A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week." Alternately, there is the application of Pareto's Principle, to, in our language, "80% solutionise" in situations with no means of determining what may constitute 100%. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Knighton (2004)</ref> points out, faced by complexity and ambiguity, "military decision-makers do violate the principles of rational decision-making, and do use cognitive shortcuts that introduce biases", which may be mitigated through incorporation of Specialist advice. Standard doctrine discourages "wilful ignorance" of relevant facts or "hasty and superficial considerations" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Vego 2018)</ref>. This means there exists a temptation to drive through a planning process into execution, with the potential for Specialists to be called in only once Generalists have built a core plan, complete with implicit biases. Specialists often need to reverse engineer subject matter expertise into the plan, or a planning process may be derailed late for lack of Specialist advice earlywith loss of time in replanning, or excessive staff effort in correcting a faulty plan in execution through multiple Fragmentary Orders (FRAGOs). Fundamentally, the implicit priority of the Generalist undermines the scope for co-design in military planning across warfare Generalist officers and Specialists.</p><p>There are more profound flaws in the traditional military model of managing the Generalist-Specialist career path. Firstly, there is the hidden assumption in the historical constancy of the time-period of the two-three year posting cycle: that the rate of change, or increase in variety of novel challenges that may confront a military force, is also constant. Fundamentally, this is an assumption of ergodicity of the operational environment: past (rate of) sampling of it by a rising officer informs them for dealing with the uncertainty of the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Reid 2018)</ref>. The pace of technological change, among other factors, challenges this assumption. Secondly, within a headquarters we recognise the inadequacy of the mechanism for managing this increase in variety in the way CJSS numbers are ad hoc conjured to allocate to new unanticipated military staff functions, such as J07 for Health (in Australia, at least), or J39 for US labelling of Joint Effects (Joint Staff 2018). These assignations challenge the argument for adherence to the CJSS across partner nations for the purposes of interoperability. Quite simply, the capacity for, what we call the Fourth Headquarters design with a fixed numerical labelling system, to anticipate seventy years ago the expansion of Specialist roles was naturally limited. This is exacerbated with the contemporary reality of hybrid or grey-zone activities by other actors, where the boundary between policy and operations (as the modes of activity in peace-time, respectively, war-time) is blurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stoker and Whiteside 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Morris et al. 2019)</ref>. A policy advisor or liaison officer to a Commander may be standard in most modern headquarters. However, it is argued that response to external grey-zone actors requires a form of integrated staff work across policy and military Specialist professionals, for example in the context of US Special Forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lehman 2017)</ref>: "SOC FWDs must be and are integrated into the U.S. Country Team and a whole-ofgovernment interagency approach". Subordinating this to a military Generalist prime decision-maker (at the very least) may be culturally challenging for civilian policy teams; Lehman reflects on the significance here of the Human Domain of interagency relationships. Indeed, the irony is that at senior levels of national strategic decision making, the leading military Generalist may be seen in fact as a naïve (or dangerous) Specialist within a broader Generalist Whole-of-Government policy apparatus. And yet, within a concept of Whole-of-Nation effects-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Duczynski 2004)</ref>, military decision-making cannot stand alone.</p><p>All of the above considerations are contextualised within the standard hierarchical form of military headquarters structure. Outside of headquarters, a quite standard method of striving for balance between Generalist and Specialist deployed capabilities is through the 'opcon-techcon' construct: joint Generalist warfighters exercise operational control of single-service capabilities (such as ships and aircraft) with the native service providing advice on efficient use of those capabilities if they are ever assigned to another commander (Department of Defence 2019).</p><p>The closest military headquarters have pushed against the "one-supervisor" model is in the crossfunctional teams construct of the Boards-Bureaus-Centers-Cells-Working-Group (B2C2WG) structure of US joint staff battle-rhythm (Joint Staff 2019). Integration is achieved through Operational Planning Teams (OPTs), where coordination is programmed in through a dense schedule of daily meetings for extended operations that can be consuming in human energy.</p><p>Beyond the Classical Form. Astute C2 researchers will recognise the response from Network Centric Warfare (NCW) to Hilleboe's 'iron law', the contention that "equals cannot coordinate equals". The logic of the tenets of NCW <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alberts, Garstka and Stein 1999)</ref> that robust networking enhances information sharing, which enhances situation awareness, which enables self-synchronisation, which increases mission effectivenessseeks to refute Hilleboe through the inexorable truth of ubiquitously available information. Thus NCW deduces Power to the Edge, the ultimate decentralisation, where equal-in-rank Specialists cannot but fail to coordinate effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alberts and Hayes 2003)</ref>. Opponents here cite the time-cost for sufficient self-synchronisation to an "objectively correct" solution under the time-pressure of warfighting, the ambiguity of information, the cyber vulnerability networking creates, and that in many complex social contexts where modern military forces has been applied, perception is everythingthere may be no objective truth in War amongst the People <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Smith 2007)</ref>. Agile C2, with the proposition that an organisation be able to move between hierarchical (where accountabilities have primacy under high uncertainty) and Edge forms (when information can be ubiquitous) addresses many of these criticisms (NATO SAS 085).</p><p>A more recent variation of the networked approach is the 'Team of Teams' of retired <ref type="bibr">General Stanley McChrystal (2015)</ref>. This work is a powerful illustration of networks at work in vivid military and civilian examples (successes when present, catastrophes when absent). McChrystal contrasts MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive) and non-MECE forms of organisation: the former in cleanly delineated stovepipes focused on efficiency, the latter in terms of messy overlap areas as "team members track and travel through not only their specialized territory but often the entire playing field". The relevance here to the Generalist-Specialist tension is evident. McChrystal is unambiguous in his recommendation of non-MECE for complex ambiguous environments with lived experiences of its implementation in the civil-military operational environments of Iraq and Afghanistan. A further illustration lies in his discussion of General Motors (GM) 1920s implementation of Sloan's "decentralised operations with coordinated control", an echo of standard Air Force C2 doctrine ("centralised control -decentralised execution"). While a manifest success for GM in the era of US dominance of the automobile industry, it began to fail with the rise of Asian competitors (Japan in the 1970s), and has since been abandoned with aspirations for "coordinated operations" through adaptive mechanisms (self-synchronising, in NCW language) and "decentralised control".</p><p>McChrystal's visualisation of the Team of Teams as a loosely coupled set of internally completely coupled networks is a powerful metaphor for the organisational qualities he describes. However it does not offer a concrete representation of a staff headquarters that may be reproduced across military partners and command echelons (if such are needed). The Fifth Generation Headquarters design seeks to provide just that.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generalists and Specialists in the Fifth Generation Headquarters concept</head><p>The concept has been developed over a number of years in this forum (Yue, Kalloniatis and Kohn 2016; Kalloniatis 2018; Kalloniatis, Kwok, Oxenham and Unewisse 2020) and has been given an explicit, if still coarse, organisational form in a separate paper here <ref type="bibr">(Kalloniatis et al. 2021)</ref>. We shall avoid the usual explanation of the previous four generations, but simply emphasise the key characteristic of the concept: this is a headquarters as an enhanced sociotechnical system, able to incorporate current and future decision support technologies (including Artificial Intelligence), a mastery of data transformation, and with Agile C2 'baked into' its organisational structure. We should emphasise, and this resonates with the concerns raised in the health field in our review of Administrative Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Thomas and Hilleboe 1968)</ref>, where also life-and-death circumstances prevail, that there are limits in how far agility can be extended across all the dimensions of C2 because of prevailing constitutional arrangements for civilian objective control of the military <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Huntington 1957)</ref>. This drives a model of hierarchical accountability, with a linear flow of delegations down through a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kohn, Kalloniatis and Ali 2012)</ref>. The aim of the Fifth Generation Headquarters design is to build as much agility into the control aspects of the headquarters while retaining hierarchical command, also consistent with the Australian Defence Force C2 Concept for the Future Joint Force (Vice-Chief of the Defence Force 2018).</p><p>The Fifth Generation Headquarters is constructed around a triple of units: Theatre Fusion and Orchestration element (TFOE) which brings together the data-driven systems for building fused awareness with those who take a long-term campaign view using the same data systems; the Integrated Operations Teams (IOTs), focused on localised geographic or thematic areas, which integrate planning-execution-assessments (or lessons) cycle in a Team of Teams that moves through the cycle rather than handing over artefacts; and Centres of Expertise (CoE) that embody the breadth of specialists that need to inform work across the TFOE and IOTs, particularly where such skills do not exist in large numbers through the defence enterprise. We illustrate this design in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Note that IOTs generalise the notion from US B2C2WG doctrine of OPTsthe cross-functional integration here is not just within planning but across the entire planning-execution-assessment lifecycle of an operation. In the Fifth Generation Concept, the IOTs, above all, are the engine room of agility insofar as they may adjust non-monotonically back and forth across the core staff functions in the operational life-cycle according to circumstances. They may grow and shrink in size as more or less expertise is required. They may also be pushed down into lower echelons to build Joint Task Force headquarters, if required, or be withdrawn into the higher headquarters.</p><p>The dimensions of the Generalist-Specialist roles should be evident, at least in the latter case. CoEs embody the Specialists, whose effort needs to be apportioned and prioritised across the other two elements. Health and Legal professionals are two examples. However, both TFOE and IOTs may contain Specialists in their own right where the 'scarcity' criterion does not apply: intelligence and logistics are two traditional areas of military specialisation where many military forces are able to build capacity. These skills may be integral in the team processes through the planning-executionassessment cycle at local geographic and theatre level. CoEs have an additional role in relation to this in providing quality assurance and mentoring of the skill sets integrated into IOTs.</p><p>It is evident that this is a matrix structure; the language of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Galbraith (1971)</ref> in describing the CoEs certainly betrays this. In fact it is a triple matrix structure with layers of criss-crossing interaction required from TFOE to IOTs, IOTs to CoEs, and CoEs to TFOE. In particular, the function-product symmetry is deliberately broken, through the TFOE-IOT-CoE hierarchy. However, the degree of asymmetry may vary according to the states of variables outlined by Galbraith, implying a requirement for Agility across the degree of priority (not the fact of it) given to 'product' (namely operational) lines, such that greater scope for Specialist innovation within operational priorities may be provided for. In particular, the expansion and contraction in size of the IOTs is according to the range of Specialist expertise they require from the CoEs.</p><p>Critically the Fifth Generation Headquarters design is a layered structuring of Generalists and Specialists. Generalists, in the traditional military sense of warfare trained officers, are at the core of the Fusion/Orchestration and IOTs; these would traditionally be appointed to J5 and J3 roles. However they are integrated with the more abundant forms of Specialists within IOTs and TFOE. Finally, the CoE adds the layer of Specialists. This layering now invites a shift from the binary Generalist-Specialist typology, to which we turn.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beyond the binary model</head><p>The Generalist-Specialist spectrum. Up until now we have focused on conventional representation of skill generalisation and specialisation that is binary, and restricted to discussion in terms of leadership qualities. In our review however, we have encountered numerous characterisations of non-specialists, from superficial across all areas that feed into decisions, integrative roles, and uniquely skilled in connecting different parts of the system. Below we attempt to distinguish and organise this myriad of characterisations, and adopt a two-dimensional array grid construct <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>) that visualises the nuances of these skill profiles along skill depth and domain axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3 Skill Domain and depth Matrix</head><p>This discussion is not indigenous to any particular field of research or practice. As already reviewed, and further elucidated below, the generalist-specialist dilemma spans many academic and industrial fields. Although there exists a plethora of non-academic articles discussing the generalist v specialist dilemma, empirical research is sparse in exploring these constructs. Below, we summarise these profiles and consider the available research that supports or repudiates their efficacy within teams:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Jack-of-all-trades (and master of none)</head><p>The Jack-of-all-trades is the progenitor archetype of the generalist, and is the most linear portrayal of the form. The term was reportedly coined by Renaissance author Robert Greene to disparagingly refer to William Shakespeare's transition from actor to playwright. The phrase has since colloquially evolved to refer to persons with skills across a range of occupational roles within a field, such as a handyman who can perform minor repairs, basic carpentry and painting. The term has been used flexibly both as a positive label, or pejorative (as inferred in the introduction) when followed by the additional adage 'and master of none'. We therefore use this shallowness of skills as the defining characteristic in our typology, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>Lerner and Lomi (2018) explore the benefits of team diversity in Wikipedia contributors, finding diverse article authorship results in higher quality articles, but teams with jack-of-all-trades authors (defined as numerous article edits with less reoccurring co-authors) resulted in poorer quality articles. That is to say team diversity of skills, not individual diversity of skills, resulted in better articles. The authors hypothesize that this occurs due to a lack of deeper domain knowledge by jack-of-all-trade article editors. Lerner and Lomi's paper contradicts previous similar research on generalist editors of Wikipedia articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baraniak, Sydow, Szejda and Czerniawska, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teisseyre 2017, Szejda, Sydow and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Czerniawska, 2014)</ref>, who operationalised generalisation through contribution to a breadth of categories, as opposed to breadth of co-editors.</p><p>Perhaps then there are conditions in which generalists and specialists thrive within teams? Melero and Palomeras (2015) examine the composition of generalists and specialists in teams submitting patents, and found that patents produced by teams with one or more generalist were more economically relevant in settings of high domain uncertainty, but less in settings of low domain uncertainty. This is to say that where a standard solution is not available, generalist inventors can draw from their breadth of knowledge to provide atypical solutions, but have more limited ability to contribute to inventions that use existing domain methods.</p><p>In somewhat contrast to Melero and Palomeras' findings, Teodoridis, Bikard and Vakili (2019) found specialist mathematicians outperformed generalists when their knowledge domain was undergoing rapid change. Teodoridis et al. argue that specialists can draw on their deeper knowledge when the pace of change in a domain is more rapid, but generalists can draw from a wider range when there is less intra-domain flux. We can consolidate the findings of both these papers as follows: generalists as jacks-of-all-trades improve team performance when developing solutions laterally, or at the edge of a domain; and specialists improve team performance when developing solutions vertically, where it requires deeper knowledge expertise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Polymath</head><p>If generalists improve a team laterally, and specialists improve a team vertically, then an individual who is both a generalist and specialist in some sense, is surely the best of both worlds. There are a number of skill profiles that talk to this approach, the first of which we will discuss is the polymath, or otherwise (from the 16 th century) known as a polyhistor or Renaissance man. The term polymath refers to individuals with a deep knowledge across multiple domains. A polymath differs to a jack-ofall-trades in having less emphasis on being able to do everything to a shallow level, and more emphasis on having deep knowledge in two or more areas. A polymath is therefore neither a master of one, or none, but some. In our sense, they are able to perform detailed work in multiple fields.</p><p>There are several challenges in deploying polymaths within teams. First, polymaths in the prolific sense, the Da Vincis and Copernicus's, are inherently scarce. Casting our net more broadly to less exemplary standards, there are still challenges. Cotellessa (2018) conducted interviews with polymaths, who were accomplished in both the sciences and the arts. One challenge is being able to utilise all of the distinct skills of a polymath, as one interviewee comments: "my skillset goes in so many different directions, I couldn't imagine having everything I can do be useful to a job" (p.121). In this regard it may be useful to draw a distinction between a disparately skilled polymath, and a synergistically skilled polymath. A disparately skilled polymath is then not too dissimilar to what is being referred to as a multihyphenate, someone who juggles multiple occupational roles to a lesser mastery to gain flexibility and stability, especially in unstable job markets, for example the gig economy. This can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> in the differing relative depths in the vertical directions of the grid pattern.</p><p>The second challenge which Cotellessa identifies is the financial burden of becoming a polymath. Recruiting polymaths is fundamentally impractical, as very few people have the financial freedom to be able to undertake two separate tertiary education paths to a deep level. An organisation may wish to provide this employee but at considerable financial cost, which may culminate in a substantial loss of investment if the employee changes organisations. Although we can postulate on the benefits of a polymath in contributing to the team environment, their scarcity has resulted in a dearth of empirical research in their contributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T-Generalist</head><p>Where a polymath is a scarce commodity, the T-generalist is the most common. T-generalist is the term used to refer to individuals who have been trained as specialists, but broaden their skilled to progress into managementwhere a shallow breadth of knowledge is beneficial in being able to manage multiple domains. T-generalist managers have the additional benefit of creating some redundancy within the organisation, at least in one particularly function. In reality most managers will reflect this skill profile as early career development requires specialisation for progression, but comes to an abrupt halt as their work becomes managerial and less tactical. Managers make a career decision to disembark from the specialist path, so typically will not have the same depth of specialisation as individuals that stay on the specialist path. Where this jumping off point lies will also vary by occupation, resulting in shallower or deeper T-Generalists.</p><p>There is an abundance of research suggesting generalists outperform specialists in career progression, particularly through managerial echelons. Ferreira and Sah (2012) found those higher in an organisations managerial layer had broader expertise. Similarly, Datta and Iskandar-Datta <ref type="formula">2015</ref>found generalist CFOs were more highly compensated than their specialist peers.</p><p>The T-Generalist thrives in management, as organisational functions traditionally integrate at a high conceptual level. Take for example the manager of medical centre. The centre may provide a myriad of services such general practice, radiology, psychology, vaccinations, physical rehabilitation, and much more. A clinic manager may coordinate a patients care across these servicesbeing able to comprehend and coordinate their functions, but is not required to have the same deep subject matter knowledge of a specialist in any particularly field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interlocutor</head><p>The T-Generalist is useful in connecting functions at the high level particularly in the classical organisational form, but what happens when functions are connected at a deeper level? Matrix organisations stress interconnectivity, which fundamentally requires integration of domains below the managerial level. Beyond this, future challenges are becoming more and more complex, requiring solutions that span multiple domains and interdisciplinary integration <ref type="bibr">(Bark, Kragt &amp; Robson (2016)</ref>.</p><p>The key to interdisciplinary teams, is arguably communication, which has been shown to mitigate conflict <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2020)</ref>, and foster innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Salazar &amp; Lant, 2018)</ref> in interdisciplinary teams.</p><p>Interdisciplinary teams by nature have a greater collective knowledge, but face more frequent communication issues due to differing disciplinary perspectives and terminologies. What is then required is a capability to connect and translate differing domains: an interlocutor.</p><p>An interlocutor requires a sufficient depth of knowledge of two or more connected functions to be able to bridge their divide. In essence, interlocutors are polyglots of the idiosyncratic and syntactic characteristics of multiple domains. Interlocutors develop as specialists, but either through interest or necessity expand their skillset to another domain to produce outputs that lie at the intersection of both. However, their role is not necessarily to conduct the work at depth across multiple fields (which may be the remit of the polymaths), but provide translation at depth between others who perform that work; they are the 'babel fish' <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams 1979)</ref> across an interdisciplinary team. In the civilian context, examples of interlocutors can be seen in frequency with which psychological and cognitive scientists have pivoted into Machine Learning (ML) to create innovations, or artists that have learnt computer science to make ML art. In the military context, nascent interlocutors exist in officers who have undertaken shifts in their core professionwarfare specialists who move to intelligence or logistics. These are infrequent. A cursory examination shows military career development paths do permit change, as well as intersection with civilian roles through reserve duty <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Yardley 2009)</ref>. A more deliberate policy of encouraging such diversity will create a cadre of interlocutors.</p><p>With these descriptions we may now picture the interactions of these types across the Fifth Generation Headquarters construct. True Specialists are maintained in the CoEs. However they may be led by Interlocutors who are able to speedily build their connectivity into the work of the IOTs and TFOE. On the other hand, IOTs will be led by jacks-of-all-trades or T-Generalists while layered with (organic to the IOT) polymaths and multihyphenates and the high density military specialisations. This rich layering of types provides, firstly for an intentional requisite variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ashby 1956</ref>) across the system. Secondly, it permits more rapid reconfigurability within that available variety. The human dimension of polymaths and multihyphenates able to communicate and bring together specialists within the warfighter generalist tempo cannot be underestimated. Beyond Education. Returning to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rathore and Fadia (2008)</ref> characterisation of Specialists through education, we may ask if a formal training continuum is sufficient to achieve the types of variety in our Generalist-Specialist spectrum? In a busy operationally focused Defence enterprise perhaps not. A headquarters may be a victim of the quality of staff officers posted to them and the quality of the professional military education system that shaped them. Communities of Practice (CoPs) 6 as groups of people who "share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lave and Wenger 1991)</ref>, provided a forum for (as the book title suggests) 'situated learning'. Indeed, as legitimate forms of organisation in a workplace, Communities of Practice are distinguished from the other concepts we have encountered, functional and project (or product) teams. While the latter focus on tasks and milestones and the former on formal qualifications and responsibilities, CoPs are defined by the knowledge set of the members and the preservation, reuse and enhancement of skills through informal association. In this respect, CoPs may represent the activities of CoEs qua knowledge beyond the managerial responsibilities of shepherding Specialists across the headquarters. In particular, CoPs may enable Jacks-of-all-Trades to advance toward (shallower, at least) T-Generalists, multi-hyphenate or polymath types. The focus of these activities need not be abstract or artificial problem solving, but actual theatre problems or contingency planshowever, explored outside of the pressures of impending operational imperatives. CoPs thus provide the headquarters with the scope for being master of its destiny in terms of the depth and integration of the skills of the people it has to work with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of technology</head><p>Finally, we explore the means by which technology supports this spectrum of skill depth and variety through the Fifth Generation Headquarters. To do this we use the framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Groth (1999)</ref>, who in turn expands on Mintzberg's (1979) theory for how technology supports coordination of distributed work in organisations. In this respect, we build upon the discussion of Kalloniatis, Kwok, Oxenham and Unewisse 2020 in the examination of the forms of technology (including autonomy) in a Fifth Generation Headquarters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Groth (1999)</ref> uses a five-fold categorisation of technologies that support human labour: 'implicit coordination' (by database), 'system-supported skills', 'system supported supervision', 'programmed routines', and 'hyper-automation'. These terms are quite self-explanatory and we do not provide further elucidation here.</p><p>At the extremes here, database technologies enable scaled up coordination of peer-to-peer Edge-like teams (where data can be standardised and structured to this end, within some constrained domain of application), and hyper-automation removes more and more humans from an increasingly centralised decision process. Thus these technologies enable the two extreme (decentralised to centralised) organisational types in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Groth's (1999)</ref> typology: the Interactive Adhocracy and Joystick Organisation. But the intermediate types of technology support humans in contexts where degrees of ambiguity in the work exist and where corresponding degrees of depth in human expertise is required. Thus deep (T-)Specialists, interlocutors and polymaths may have their work enhanced through technologies that speed up the application of their deep skills, liberating cognitive capacity for their specialist-spanning activity. Deep SMEs in intelligence for example may benefit from technologies that automate the gathering and initial synthesis of intelligence information, allowing them to be more responsive in providing support to planning and execution activities.</p><p>Contrastingly, staff with shallower knowledge (e.g. emerging specialists and multihyphenates) may be supported by system-supported supervision technologies: to the degree they have the skills in some depth that they are able to identify the utility and activation of such systems, but the technology itself provides oversight in the application and interpretation of outputs. In this sense, the technology supports the role of the human supervisor in the function of oversight of technical work. Enterprisewide administrative technologies (for reporting, task management, etc.) may help accomplish this. New staff with shallow knowledge may also benefit from technologies that substitute that deeper domain knowledge. Software that can collate and interrogate business documentation, such as searchbased Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, could enable new staff to retrieve deeper subject knowledge more rapidly and without the aid of a specialist colleague, reducing burden on existing staff and increasing the speed of their own knowledge development.</p><p>An interlocutors' integrator function may in turn be supported by technologies that provide access to pools of expertise in the wider enterprise. In this respect, the deep expertise of the interlocutor is key insofar as standardised Human Services directories may be inadequate in representing the skills that a particular profession may have. We note that in the academic sphere, the Australian Research Council has attempted at various times to categories scientific disciplines ("Fields of Research") to enable navigability and management of national university sector resources 7 . Such systemsdespite their linearity --may appear opaque to the generalist manager, on the one hand, and flawed, on the other, to the expert 8 . The interlocutor is able to successfully navigate such a system and know how to bring the right experts together.</p><p>These technologies in turn support Groth's simplified concepts for organisational types: the Peer, where technology works alongside the expert; the Sage, where the technology guides; and the Boss, where the technology directs. For our purposes in the Generalist-Specialist spectrum, the Peer and Sage concepts are the most applicable in interfacing CoE members across into the operationally focused teams of IOTs and the TFOE in a Fifth Generation Headquarters. The matrix structure we have described, with an appropriate agility between the centralising tendencies of operational imperatives and decentralisation where innovation becomes critical, matches the employment of Groth's organisational types by Kalloniatis, Kwok, Oxenham and Unewisse 2020 for such a future headquarters concept. In relation to technology, we repeat the import of that work on the critical role of microservices architectures and the DevSecOps pipeline for achieving flexibility and evolvability of the socio-technical system. Only such a consistency between technology forms, technology delivery and those human knowledge characteristics we have described in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We have analysed the Generalist-Specialist dilemma across the various contexts of organisational theory in which it has been recognised and for which solutions have been proposed. Contextualising these in the context of military headquarters, we have articulated how a Fifth Generation design allows for a broader spectrum of types within the otherwise binary 'Generalist-Specialist' scheme. In particular, here we have identified hybrid models, with multiple areas of depth in expertise, and roles in teams which they can perform. Over and above 'T', polymath and multihyphenate types of roles that can perform multiple areas of work with varying degrees of mastery, and integration at-depth between these areas, we have also proposed an interlocutor role that is able to connect areas of specialisation through intimate knowledge of deep skill sets providing further models for integration of staff expertise in a headquarters. This provides for a requisite variety in the richness of teams that can be brought together, and the agility to move between more or less centralised decision-making. Similarly, technologiesincluding those incorporating specialist applications of Artificial Intelligencemay be appropriately identified to enhance the degrees of specialisation within our scheme, and therefore enhance their connectivity to support teams confronted by complexity. While it may be too much to expect current military professional education to provide such multi-skilled individuals, through Communities of Practice as activities within a headquarters, there is scope for rounding out such skilled individuals even within the organisation.</p><p>Future work in this direction may include a more systematic classification of military skill sets against our proposed Generalist-Specialist spectrum, and identification through empirical studies the degree to which these types occur in actual staff work under a range of operational circumstances. Moreover, we anticipate the scope for induction programs that may facilitate the activation of Communities of Practice or the sustainment through periodic staff rotations.</p><p>At the close, it may appear disappointing that, for all the discussion about peer-to-peer team-work and agility, the future headquarters we have described retains a distinct 'bureaucratic' shape with superiors and subordinates, albeit with matrix layers. There is no escaping the requirements for accountability within present democratic models of governance and the fact that technology does not fully enable flat Edge forms of organisation at scale. It bears repeating that the factors that enable matrix forms of organisation to succeed, and the frequency with which their absence leads to failure, are precisely the qualities of openness and collaboration that manifest in the flattest of the Flat organisation. At the end, the key objective a decision-making organisation such as a military headquarters is that deft balance between speed and quality. Speed is achieved through the appropriate enablement of automation and autonomy, and the capacity for military decision-makers to draw upon experience to exert their will on an adversary. Quality is achieved through, indeed rapid access to information through technology, but fundamentally the activation and integration of expertise in interpreting that information. The Fifth Generation Headquarters design, within our nuanced model for how expertise is shepherded, accessed and integrated, is a step forward in achieving that form of decision superiority.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Contrasting classical ("bureaucratic") and matrix forms of organisational structure</figDesc></figure>
