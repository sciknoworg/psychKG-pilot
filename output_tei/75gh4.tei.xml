			<abstract>
				<p>Background: Evidence-based tools are necessary for scientifically improving the way cancer multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs) work. Such tools are available but can be difficult to use. We sought to develop a robust observational assessment tool for use by healthcare professionals to improve how MTBs work in everyday practice. Participants and methods: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional observational study in the United Kingdom between September 2015 and July 2016. Three tumor boards from three teaching hospitals were recruited with 44 members overall. Six weekly meetings (146 consecutive cases) were video recorded and scored using the validated MODe tool. Data were subjected to reliability and validity analysis in the current study for the purposes of developing a shorter version of MODe. Results: In phase 1, a reduction in the original items of MODe was achieved through two focus group meetings with expert assessors based on previous research. Twelve original items were reduced to six domains and have received full agreement by the assessors. In Phase 2, the six domains were subjected to item reliability, convergent validation, and internal consistency testing against MODe-Lite global score, MODe global score, and the individual items of MODe. Significant positive correlations were evidenced across the six domains (p&lt;0.01), providing indication of good reliability and validity. In phase 3, feasibility and high interassessor reliability in the use of the tool by two clinical assessors was achieved. A final set of 6 domains, measuring clinical input, holistic input, clinical collaboration, pathology, radiology and management plan were integrated into MODe-Lite. Conclusions: MODe-Lite is an evidence-based tool that can be used by healthcare professionals in everyday practice. It can give cancer MTBs insight into the way they work to facilitate improvements in practice.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MTBs) are the gold standard of cancer care delivery in many countries across the world. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Generally accepted benefits of MTBs include: improved adherence to best clinical practice, reduced geographical variability, timeliness of diagnostics and treatment, and improved outcomes including survival. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> Other indirect benefits have been found, including improved healthcare professional wellbeing, education, and quality assurance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> It is clear from the literature that inefficiencies in existing MTB processes are commonplace. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Factors such as professional hierarchies, lack of open discussion, failure to consider holistic information or patient views, and lack of personal knowledge of the patient being reviewed all have an adverse impact on effective clinical decision-making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Improvement research on cancer MTBs has provided an evidence-based 'tool kit' with which MTB members can identify the factors that promote or hinder teams to review patients holistically within a meeting and make recommendations that are both clinically sound and acceptable to patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> One such intervention is the MODe tool (Metric for the Observation of Decisionmaking in cancer multidisciplinary tumor boards), which has been used to understand, assess, and improve MTB working. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> Development and validation of the tool has previously been reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> MODe has been used to assess decision-making processes across different tumour types in a number of different countries (Box 1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> MODe has been applied to show that the ability of an MTB to reach a clinical decision was positively associated with high-quality comprehensive and necessary information available at the point of decision-making (from case history, radiology, pathology), team contribution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> and cases that are discussed at the beginning of meetings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> However, high-quality information and team contribution were positively correlated with the larger team size and longer case discussions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> Moreover, a complete patient profile and representation by all core disciplines were found necessary to maximize the ability of an MTB to reach management recommendations for all cases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 1 --------------------------------------</head><p>The aim of the current study was to produce a tool that could be used by healthcare staff, who are ultimately the end users of MTB processes. Based on the previous content validation of MODe, which suggested fewer factors were desirable, such a tool must retain the most important elements of MODe, whilst simplifying those retained elements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> We have, therefore, developed a more user-friendly version of MODe, namely, MODE-Lite, which is intended to be used in clinical practice to assist teams in quality improvement and streamlining of processes. Specifically, the objectives of this study were: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>This was a retrospective cross-sectional observational psychometric study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study setting</head><p>The study took place across 3 university hospitals in the Greater London and Derbyshire areas in the UK between September 2015 and July 2016. Availability sampling was used to identify MTBs with a criterion for the study being a tumor board from the UK NHS that represents the commonest types of cancer. Three MTBs were identified and took part, including breast, colorectal and gynaecological.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were 44 tumor boards members: breast=15, colorectal=15, gynaecological=14. Tumor boards had the same composition: surgeons (n=12), oncologists (n=6), cancer nurse specialists (CNS) (n=12), radiologists (n=6), histopathologists (n=5) and coordinators (who play an administrative role; n=3). Groups were at attending level during the study period with on average 9 years of experience (min=2, max=22). Detailed breakdown of team composition has been published previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> Ethical approvals were given by the North West London Research Ethics Committee, and locally by the participating hospitals as part of the original study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> Oral and written consents were given by the team members.</p><p>All case discussions during the study period were video recorded; these included suspected or confirmed cancer. 146 consecutive case discussions from six tumour boards were included. The dataset is available on Zenodo. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> The sample size was determined using G*Power 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> for a priori power analysis with a two tailed test, effect size of 0.6, probability of 0.05, and power of 0.90.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tool development and validation phases</head><p>We developed MODe-Lite from the original MODe instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> and its previous content validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> positing a reduction in the number of the original items. A multi-phased approach was undertaken in developing MODe-Lite.</p><p>In phase 1, two meetings were held with experts (BWL, clinical researcher and consultant surgeon, and TS, clinical researcher and psychologist) with &gt;5 years' experience in the use of MODe and evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> of proficiency with inter-assessor reliability of &gt;0.70. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> The aim was to design a new tool and to assess content validity against MODe's previous content validation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> In phase 2, assessor 1 (BWL) scored a sample of 146 cases, which had previously been assessed with MODe, using the revised shorter version of the tool (MODe-Lite). The aim was to assess convergent validity with the original tool. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> We hypothesized (H1) that MODe-Lite domains will correlate positively with the relevant items of the original MODe in line with the factor model proposed in previous research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> In addition, the aim was also to externally validate MODe-Lite against case complexity as measured by the previously validated Measure of case-Discussion Complexity (MeDiC). We hypothesised (H2) that MODe-Lite will positively correlate with the MeDiC tool, in line with the previous research using the MODe instrument. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> In phase 3, both assessors (BWL and TS) trained a new assessor (SM, consultant surgeon) in the use of the shorter version (MODe-Lite) on video recorded tumor boards over two 2h long sessions. The assessors (BWL and SM) scored a subset of cases blinded to each other scores. Disagreements were subsequently discussed over a single 2hr data-review session in order to understand how the scoring of the shorter tool could be improved. The aim was to determine feasibility and inter-assessor reliability in the use of the MODe-Lite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>We assessed validity of MODe-Lite using a widely used measure, the item-content validity index (I-CVI). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> The criteria for item acceptability depends on the number of experts rating the items. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> If there are fewer than 5 experts, all have to agree for the item to be retained.</p><p>We undertook convergent validity analysis of MODe-Lite using by assessing the correlation between individual domains and the original MODe instrument (the individual items of MODe and the global score). We also used the overall MODe-Lite score for the itemtotal correlation.</p><p>We assessed reliability between the two assessors (BWL and SM) using Kappa for categorical items (i.e. the individual items of MODe-Lite) and interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for continuous items (i.e. the global scores). For ICCs a generally accepted reliability coefficients of 0.70 and above were used, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> while for Kappa coefficients following criteria was followed: 0.21-0.40=fair agreement; 0.41-0.60=moderate agreement; 0.61-0.80=substantial agreement; 0.81-1.00=almost perfect agreement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess internal consistency for each MODe-Lite domain, i.e., how closely related these domains are against their corresponding items in the original MODe tool. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows summary statistics for the individual domains of MODe-Lite across the entire dataset (N=146) comprising three tumor boards, namely, breast, colorectal and gynaecological. It can be seen that holistic input and clinical collaboration domains scored lowest, indicating overall lower quality. In contrast, the pathology and clinical input scored the highest, indicating better quality. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> -</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 1: Item content validation</head><p>Two focus group meetings were held between two expert assessors (BWL and TS) for content validation using all 12 items from the original MODe instrument. Guided by the previous content validation of the MODe tool on a large sample (N=1045) using exploratory factor analysis, 9 the factor model containing clinical and holistic (patient history, oncologists', surgeons' and nurses' inputs, psychosocial information, comorbidities, patient view), radiology (radiology information and radiologists input), and pathology (pathology information and pathologists input) components received full agreement (I-CVI=1) for inclusion into the MODe-Lite.

Pathology and radiology were retained as separate domains (I-CVI=1) in line with the factor analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Management plan, which was an outcome variable in the factor analysis and previous research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> was also retained (I-CVI=1) as a separate item.</p><p>Therefore, a total of six domains received full agreement for the inclusion in MODe-Lite by the expert assessors (I-CVI=1) and were subjected to further validity and reliability testing.</p><p>The tool is represented graphically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">-------------------------------------- Figure 1 --------------------------------------</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 2: Item convergent validity, reliability and external validity</head><p>The six domains of MODe-Lite were next validated against the global scores of MODe-Lite and the original MODe, respectively. It is evident from <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> that all MODe-Lite domains significantly positively correlated with the MODe-Lite global score, indicating good convergent validity across all 6 domains. In addition, significant positive correlation was evident against the global score for the original MODe tool, indicating good external validity and support for the H1. The exception is the pathology where the correlation coefficient, although positive, did not reach statistical significance. Significant positive correlation was also evident against the global score for the MeDiC tool, further indicating good external validity and support for the H2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">-------------------------------------- Table 2 --------------------------------------</formula><p>Further external validation was conducted against the corresponding MODe items in line with the content validation in phase 1 and previous research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows significant positive correlations throughout between the six MODe-Lite domains, and their corresponding twelve MODe items. This finding provides support for our hypothesis. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> -</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>--------------------------------------</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-------------------------------------</head><p>The Cronbach's Alpha, measuring how closely related each set of MODe items is as a domain of MODe-Lite, was good for pathology, radiology, and management plan, and somewhat weaker for the clinical, holistic inputs and clinical collaboration warranting further testing on a larger sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 3: Inter-assessor reliability and feasibility in the use of the tool</head><p>Inter-assessor agreement on MODe-Lite was examined using Kappa for categorical (i.e. the individual items of MODe-Lite) and ICCs for continuous variables (i.e. the global scores) on a subsample of 60 cases (40% of the total). Good reliability between the two raters (BWL and SM) was evident across all six domains with the ICCs for global score higher than the generally accepted 0.70, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> and the Kappa coefficients for individual items ranging from moderate to almost perfect agreement. The tool was reported feasible and straightforward to use by both assessors.</p><p>A post-scoring data-review session was undertaken in order to understand how the scoring of the tool could be improved in the two domains that initially appeared to have lower ICC's: Holistic Input (0.64), and Management Plan (0.68). Disagreement with regards to scoring of holistic information was perceived to be a limitation of data quality, specifically sound quality. Scoring of information on holistic aspects of care in MODe-Lite is not anchored to specific members of the MTB, nor to specific terminology, and therefore was easier for observers to miss when the sound quality of the video recordings was poor. The second was disagreement in scoring of the management plan. The observers noted that the MTBs used abbreviations for follow up plans (e.g., abbreviation for a follow-up pathway) which were specific to that team or organization. Abbreviations or jargon relating to the disease or investigations, however, are more universally understood (e.g. CT scan). Those that are locally specific might not be understood by external assessors.</p><p>Following review and discussion of specific cases of disagreement, the majority were settled in agreement and revised scores for ICC were recorded <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. A minority of cases remained in disagreement between observers, which related to perceived differences in the application of the scoring, in particular for Management Plan. Specifically, the word 'treatment' was felt only to apply when treatment was recommended. Where patients were found not to require treatment, if was felt that the word 'management' was more appropriate, otherwise despite the formation of a good management plan, a top score could not be awarded.</p><p>A slight modification of the anchor behavior for Management Plan was therefore agreed on, with a change in wording from 'treatment options', to 'management options'. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> -</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>--------------------------------------</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">-------------------------------------</formula><p>The change from scoring a Likert scale of 5 to 3-points was felt by observers easier to use. The anchor behaviors of MODe-Lite were of a more categorical nature (with scores being assigned for the accumulation of different types of behaviours) than MDT-MODe, which required users to quantify a given amount of a composite behavior (e.g. contribution of a particular speciality). The assessors found that it was easier, and therefore quicker, to apply a score to MODe-Lite than the original MODe. This increased ease of scoring was felt by the observers to be important when scoring several domains in real time, and made the task more feasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The aim of the current study was to improve the utility of an existing observational assessment tool (MDT-MODe) by designing and validating a shorter version of MODe for use in routine clinical practice i.e. MODe-Lite. We have demonstrated good item-content validity, item reliability and external validity with our H1 and H2 being supported: MODe-Lite domains correlated positively with the relevant items of the original MODe in line with the factor model proposed in previous research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> as well as with the MeDiC tool. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> We also demonstrated good inter-assessor reliability and feasibility in the use of the tool. In terms of internal consistency, this was good across all MODe-Lite domains, however, clinical input, holistic input and clinical collaboration showed weaker consistency, warranting further testing on a larger sample.</p><p>While clinical input, holistic input and clinical collaboration had loaded on to a single factor in previous research, which suggests that they should be grouped into a single domain for scoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> based on the evidence and the needs of the tumor boards, their separation is critical for adequate team assessment and provision of feedback for quality improvements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> For instance, evidence shows that holistic inputs tend to be underrepresented in tumor board's decision-making, yet are essential for their ability to reach 4,9 and subsequently implement a treatment recommendation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> and are encouraged by the relevant guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">36</ref> Hence scoring the holistic input separately and pulling it apart from the other three items can help assess how well a team covers this aspect and how to improve it. Similarly, evidence shows that clinical collaboration in tumor boards can be sub-optimal yet it is critical for effective decision-making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> Hence the importance of scoring this item separately, too.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>MODe has been used in numerous studies across many tumour types, and even applied to different languages in different countries (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Its broader impact on the literature surrounding MTB transformation has been demonstrated by the number of citations the development studies have accrued. MODe has been used by researchers: from use as a standalone assessment method in order to increase the understanding of team behaviours in MTB meetings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> to use in complex interventional studies alongside other performance metrics in order to assess the impact of interventions on aspects of team decision making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> This flexibility has undoubtedly increased the uptake of the tool.</p><p>Most of the utilisation of MODe however, has come from dedicated academics with a specific interest in improving MTB processes. Since its development, there has been a move in the UK away from the implementation of top-down improvement in MTB transformation, towards the adoption of more bespoke solutions to local challenges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref> There is therefore a need to equip healthcare professional to understand their own MTBs, and to identify solutions that work for them in their unique setting. It was clear that MODe required a certain level of training before ratings could be reliably undertaken. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> The present study demonstrates that adequate reliability scores can be achieved by novice raters over a shorter period, offering improvements in feasibility. This suggests that MODe-Lite may offer healthcare professionals a tool with a shorter learning curve whilst maintaining the validity of the original tool.</p><p>The ability of healthcare professionals at the grass roots to take ownership of improving the services they provide for patients is of growing importance. In the UK, MTBs have been urged to change the way they work in order to save a rapidly overburdened service. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> Guidance has been issued recommending that teams use evidence-based tools to understand and improve the way they work, in order to meet local need. In the US (and elsewhere) where health-care policy is less top-down, MODe-Lite offers a good starting point to try to figure out team based cancer care and enable teams to take a scientific approach to MTB development.</p><p>As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> suggests, MODe-Lite could also be used in a variety of ways, from standalone assessment of current working practices to part of a more comprehensive tool kit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">41</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>------------------------------------</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure ------------------------------------</head><p>Streamlining of MTB processes, and MTB meetings specifically, is intended to allow more time for the discussion of complex cases that truly benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. MODE-Lite presents two potential opportunities to professionals seeking to undertake MTB improvement using evidence-based tools. Firstly, concentration on those cases that benefit from a multidisciplinary approach endorses this way of working, and therefore places a requirement on MTBs to ensure that they are functioning as well as possible. Complex cases, by their nature often have comorbidities or psychological or social challenges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> Decision-making in MTB meetings has consistently been found to underutilise this type of information to the detriment of patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Similarly, MTB meetings are generally dominated by a small number of team members, with exclusion of others, in particular specialist cancer nurses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Nurses have a pivotal role in the care of cancer patients, and their input into the decision-making process in MTB meetings is critical to ensure the highest standard of care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In practical terms, deficiencies in information sharing, or under-representation of particular specialities at the MTB would show up as sub-optimal scores for particular categories. MODe-Lite might therefore allow MTBs to quickly gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their MTB meeting processes, and how they can be improved.</p><p>Secondly, streamlining is intended to reduce the time and manpower required for MTB meetings. In addition, regular audit and assessment using evidence-based tools is stipulated in guidance in the UK. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> Streamlining, therefore, becomes both a driver and opportunity to use tools to investigate and improve the way they work. MODe-Lite provides a potential solution for professionals with an interest in quality improvements that gives them a feasible, yet robust means of self-assessment.</p><p>Digitisation of quality improvement tools, along with integration into electronic medical record systems, will be important going forward. This will further improve feasibility, and also facilitate aggregation of data over time, across different tumour types or between</p><p>MTBs. This will allow teams to better appreciate patterns of practice over time or space, perhaps in response to interventions designed to improve performance. It may also help comparison between different MTBs, facilitating bench marking, or for accreditation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future research</head><p>A further step might be the integration of human factor assessment into artificial intelligence (AI) platforms. At present, such platforms exist and are available for healthcare services to obtain. Such systems employ algorithms built on data from case studies and published evidence of disease characteristics. They are less well informed when it comes to integrating human behaviors, particularly in a team setting, such as occurs in MTB meetings.</p><p>Human factors are known to have a significant impact on clinical decision-making and it will, therefore, be critical for AI developers to be cognisant of human factors in order to ensure that their systems are robust for use in real-world settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our findings need to be interpreted within certain limitations. First is the Hawthorne effect. In line with the ethical and regulatory approvals of participating NHS organisations in the UK, informed consent from team members was sought, which meant that they knew that they were going to be filmed (i.e., there was no deception). To counteract this: (1) a long-term approach to filming was adopted with each team being filmed for 3 months, (2) the first two meetings in each team were excluded from the analysis, (3) filming was done discretely using a small GoPro camera, and (4) evaluators were all trained in the used of the tools which they scored in pairs blind to one another's observations. Second, while tumor boards occur and are mandated for accreditation across various countries (e.g., American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer), this study was conducted entirely in the UK. In large part, the domains identified through this rigorous study pertain are fundamental to high quality cancer care regardless of where the care is delivered, though further validation in other cancer care systems is required. Last, the study represents the most common cancers within the English NHS.</p><p>Replication of the study on other cancer, teams and healthcare systems is needed to support further generalizability of the findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>MODe-Lite is a scientifically developed and validated tool for healthcare professionals to use for the assessment and improvement of MTB meetings. The learning curve appears to be shorter than the previous version, whilst maintaining robust psychometric properties. It could be used alone or in conjunction with other quality improvement interventions to improve the care of cancer patients. Further work is needed to digitise this, and other quality improvement tools.      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 . 2 . 3 .</head><label>123</label><figDesc>To improve feasibility by reducing the number of items to be rated and the complexity of the rating scale; To retain validity by involving experts in tumor board improvement in the construction of the tool, building on previous content validation of MODe, 9 and externally validating MODe-Lite against a validated measure of case complexity (MeDiC); To ensure reliability by assessing the use over a number of teams across different tumour types by expert and novice users.
