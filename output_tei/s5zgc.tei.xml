			<abstract>
				<p>Many of life&apos;s important choices require that the decision maker collects evidence to better inform their actions. However, excessive testing can be costly, so the decision maker must carefully choose when to terminate sampling and commit to a final decision. Such deferred decision making problems-where an individual can choose between two or more risky alternatives or defer choice and collect additional information-appear in many domains, from consumer choice to military decision making. We conducted two deferred decision making studies in which participants played the part of a physician diagnosing patients during a disease outbreak. Participants could purchase independent, probabilistic blood tests, at cost. When they were sufficiently confident, participants diagnosed each patient with one of two possible diseases. A monetary reward or punishment was applied for each correct or incorrect diagnosis, respectively. A small deduction was made when participants purchased each test. Our results show sensitivity to sampling costs-participants purchased more tests when sampling costs were low-and risk-participants purchased more tests when rewards and punishments were large. We tested several cognitive models and found that a sequential sampling model with decreasing decision thresholds provided the best account of participants&apos; choices. However, an alternative model focused on minimizing errors best fit the response data of a substantial proportion of individuals. These findings challenge the predictions of prominent normative and heuristic theories, and lay the groundwork for further investigation into the psychological processes underlying deferred decision making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent decades, the application of cognitive modeling techniques to the study of human decision making has greatly advanced our understanding of how people make choices in an uncertain world. By developing and testing formal models of the psychological processes hypothesized to underlie overt choice behavior, we can examine and evaluate theories with greater precision; gaining new insights into the hidden workings of the mind. In the present work we rigorously test cognitive models of deferred decision making. In a deferred decision making scenario people aim to identify the state of the world on the basis of sequentially acquired information. The search for information might end when the decision maker has formed a strong belief about the right choice, otherwise additional information to increase choice accuracy can be gathered. Deferred decision making situations have already received substantial attention in the literature. The goal of the present work is to provide more insight into how people solve this task buy following a rigorous cognitive modeling approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Deferred Decision Making</head><p>Many of life's important choices require that the decision maker collects evidence to better inform their actions. Take the example of a physician who receives a patient suffering from an unknown illness. To effectively treat their patient, it is critical that the doctor correctly identifies the illness. To aid their diagnosis, they can run a series of blood tests that each provide some useful evidence. However, excessive testing is a drain on hospital resources and patient finances, and may pose its own health risk.</p><p>The physician must therefore decide when they have collected sufficient evidence to stop testing and make a diagnosis. This kind of deferred decision making scenario -where an individual makes a choice on the basis of sequentially acquired information, and can defer choice and continues information search -appears in many every-day life scenarios. In this article we test several models of how individuals choose to stop sampling evidence and make a final decision. We begin by formally defining the deferred decision making paradigm. We next review previous research into deferred decision making. Finally, we present results from two behavioral experiments and test several cognitive models in hopes of elucidating the psychological processes underlying participants choices.</p><p>To begin our investigation let us define a deferred decision making problem more formally.</p><p>Returning to the medical diagnosis scenario introduced above, imagine that a sick patient was infected with one of two viruses: Orthorlia and Banasica. The goal of the physician is to correctly diagnose the patient's disease, while minimizing testing. We assume that the diseases represent two mutually exclusive hypotheses, meaning that only one can be true, and any evidence in favor of one is evidence against the other 1 . The physician receives reward, R, if they choose the correct hypothesis and punishment, P, if they are incorrect. In this scenario, they begin with no information favoring either disease (i.e., prior probability is 0.50 for each) and must collect evidence by running tests. Each test result represents an independent observation providing evidence in favor of one disease. However, it also involves a cost to the physician, and therefore introduces a trade-off between costs and accuracy.</p><p>Thus, the physician must choose the most appropriate point to terminate testing and make a final choice.</p><p>Imagine that the result of the first blood test, s(1), has cost c(1) and is more likely to be observed if the patient is infected with Orthorlia than Banasica, such that P(s(1)|O) = 0.6 and P(s(1)|B) = 0.4.</p><p>Assuming equal prior probabilities for each disease (i.e., P(O) = P(B) = .5), the posterior probability of the patient having Orthorlia can be calculated as P(O|s(1)) = P(s(1)|O) × P(O) / P(s(1)) = 0.6 × 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.65.</p><p>The physician must now choose whether to purchase another test, s(2), for c(1) or cut their losses and make a final decision in favor of Orthorlia. To optimize their performance, they should terminate testing if the expected return of doing so is greater than the expected return of purchasing one or more additional tests before making a final choice. Since each test is an independent observation, the likelihood of each disease, d, after observing n samples, can be determined by summing the log-odds produced by each sample to get the cumulative log-odds, Ld(n). However, calculating the expected value of a deferred decision is more difficult as it requires that the physician consider the expected outcome of making a final choice after purchasing x additional tests, for all values of x = {1, 2, …, M}, where M is the maximum number of possible tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1.">Belief Updating</head><p>This deferred decision scenario shares similarities with belief updating tasks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Peterson, Schneider, &amp; Miller, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Phillips, Edwards, &amp; Hays, 1966)</ref> in which individuals collect probabilistic information about two competing hypotheses. In the classic version of this task individuals are told of two urns containing different proportions of red and blue marbles. The experimenter selects one urn at random, and the participant is asked to judge which urn this was. To inform their judgments, the participant draws marbles from the selected urn and updates their belief based on the observed colors.</p><p>The most important finding from belief updating research is that people do not accurately calibrate their judgments to the evidence they observe. In particular, many individuals exhibit conservatism, meaning that they insufficiently update their beliefs after collecting new evidence. This suboptimality has important implications for deferred decision making. For example, if a physician is conservative in dealing with test results, they may hesitate to diagnose a patient despite sufficiently strong evidence, or may order extraneous and costly tests before making a diagnosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2.">Balancing Accuracy and Information Costs</head><p>Using dynamic programming techniques, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rapoport and Burkheimer (1971)</ref> derived a normative deferred decision making policy in terms of the optimal decision thresholds for the cumulative log-odds produced by sampling. According to the optimal policy, an individual should make a final decision in favor of the more likely hypothesis if and only if the current log-odds exceed some critical value, θ; otherwise they should purchase another sample.</p><p>However, several studies have found consistent deviations from this optimal policy. For example, as the number of tests increase, individuals often require less evidence to terminate sampling and make a final choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pitz, Reinhold, &amp; Geller, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sanders &amp; Ter Linden, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Viviani, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wallsten &amp; Sapp, 1977)</ref>. This suggests that θ decreased across samples as people required less and less evidence to make a choice. In a similar vein,  found that late in a sequence of tests participants often terminated when the number of positive and negative tests was equal, i.e. when LA(n) = LB(n) = 0. The fact that people would choose to collect an additional sample but immediately terminate despite equal evidence points to rapidly decreasing decision criteria. Further insight into deferred decision making strategies has been gained through analyses of the patterns of final test results before participants chose to terminate sampling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer and Rapoport (1988)</ref> found that participants sometimes terminated after a non-diagnostic sequence of tests, such as (+,-) or (+,+,-,-), where "+" represents a sample favoring one hypothesis and "-" represents an equally diagnostic sample favoring the complementary hypothesis. These sequences could not have caused the cumulative evidence to exceed a static threshold, again suggesting that decision makers require less evidence over time. People's interpretation of neutral evidence was also noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sanders and Ter Linden (1967)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Viviani (1979)</ref>, who found that the likelihood of stopping after a sequence of strong evidence was much greater if preceded by a non-diagnostic sequence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer and Rapoport (1988)</ref> report a related recency effect, whereby the likelihood of a participant terminating increased across the sequences (+,+,+,-), (+,+,-,+), (+,-,+,+), and (-,+,+,+). Even more surprisingly, participants occasionally made a final decision that conflicted with the last test they observed, despite the fact that this final observation decreased the evidence favoring the chosen alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of Deferred Decision Making 7</head><p>Similar insights can be made from behavior in experience-based decision tasks where participants must balance the competing interests of exploration and exploitation (see <ref type="bibr">Mehlhorn et al.,</ref> 2015 for a review). Some environmental factors -e.g. the presence of a "rare disaster" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Teodorescu &amp; Erev, 2014)</ref> -as well as individual factors -e.g. domain ignorance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011) -</ref>have been shown to produce a bias in favor or exploration. Under these circumstances decision makers waste too many resources (time, actions, money) on exploring the outcomes produced by new alternatives, when it would be optimal to focus on exploiting the currently best alternatives. These results also fit with findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fiedler, McCaughey, Prager, Eichberger, and Schnell (2020)</ref> using a sample-based decision task characterized by a speed-accuracy tradeoff. They found that participants displayed a consistent accuracy bias by sampling too much information on each trial and therefore reducing the number of trials they completed in the experiments. In contrast, other environmental factors -e.g. the presence of a "rare treasure" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Teodorescu &amp; Erev, 2014</ref>) -and individual factors -e.g. poor working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hills &amp; Pachur, 2012)</ref> -have been found to produce the opposite bias: suboptimal under-sampling and exploration. Here, individuals narrowly focus on choosing the option that currently appears to be the best, but fail to sufficiently explore other, ultimately superior options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Cognitive Models of Deferred Decision Making</head><p>Relatively little is known about how people engage in this sort of overt sampling and choice deferral over larger time scales. In the present article, we develop and test several cognitive models with the aim of expanding our understanding of this important behavior. These models are key to formally developing and testing new theories of how people make decisions. This approach allows researchers to go beyond raw data; providing novel insights into how choice behavior can emerge from dynamic processes involving attentional bias, response caution, memory confusion, impatience, response competition, and many other psychological components.</p><p>Here we take a novel approach (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport, 1988)</ref> 2 by obtaining quantitative predictions for each model and comparing these to all response data. We evaluate six models selected for their theoretical significance and previous success. The baseline model (BL) and optimal planning model (OPM), serve as a benchmarks for simplistic and fully rational decision making, respectively. The constant threshold model (CONST) represents a simple heuristic strategy. The error cost stopping rule (ECSR) was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer and Rapoport (1988)</ref>, and shown to account well for the qualitative trends observed in their study. Finally, we test two types of sequential sampling models: one that assumes static decision thresholds (stSSM), and a time-variant version similar to that used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gluth, Rieskamp, and Büchel (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">tvSSM)</ref>. Each model posits a different mechanism for deferred decision making; from planning and optimization, to rule use, to information accumulation and choice inhibition.</p><p>Our goal is to rigorously test the models quantitatively against each other to best explain how people decide when to stop collecting evidence and make a choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1.">Heuristic and Rule-Based Models of Deferred Decision Making</head><p>One possibility is that people rely on simple rules or heuristics for making deferred decisions.</p><p>Simple heuristics have been proposed as cognitive models for various domains (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gigerenzer &amp; Todd, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gilovich, Griffin, &amp; Kahneman, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Payne, Bettman, &amp; Johnson, 1993)</ref>. In the context of deferred decision making, heuristics might focus on reducing effort (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Saad &amp; Russo, 1996)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer and Rapoport (1988)</ref> considered a heuristic whereby an individual always terminates after M tests. They rejected this model on the basis of people's sensitivity to the observed evidence. For instance, participants were more likely to terminate after four tests if the results of those tests were all positive (+,+,+,+) than if the results were mixed (+,+,-,-). <ref type="bibr">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer and Rapoport (1988)</ref> rejected several models on the basis of relatively few qualitative results, which risks unfairly penalizing models with an insufficient error component to explain aberrant results. For this reason, we take a quantitative approach to model comparison, where deterministic rule-based models are made stochastic -through the inclusion of an error component -to reduce the chance of rejecting a model on the basis of a small subset of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rieskamp, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>1.2.1.1. The Constant Threshold Model. Another simple and intuitive strategy for solving a decision problem like the one described above is to select some evidence threshold, τ, and purchase tests until there are τ more results favoring one disease than the other. More formally, according to this constant threshold model (CONST), if the current test difference is less than τ -i.e., the evidence is below threshold -the probability of 'accidentally' terminating is υ. If the test difference is greater than or equal to τ -i.e., the evidence is above threshold -the probability of terminating is 1-υ. Upon termination, the probability of making a correct diagnosis is also 1-υ. Thus, υ represents both the likelihood of terminating too early and of choosing the diagnosis not favored by the evidence. Both τ and υ are free parameters estimated for each individual, allowing for differences in error rates and evidence thresholds across individuals. Such models have been used in the past, with mixed results. On the one hand, they explain why people are more likely to terminate information search after diagnostic sequences than non-diagnostic sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Audley &amp; Pike, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laming, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Link &amp; Heath, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pitz &amp; Barrett, 1969)</ref>, however they cannot explain why individuals sometimes terminate after a non-diagnostic subsequence or when the cumulative evidence in favor of each alternative is equal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer and Rapoport (1988)</ref> proposed a more sophisticated heuristic, the error cost stopping rule 3 (ECSR). The model proposes that individuals narrowly focus on two aspects of a deferred decision making problem: the expected cost of making an incorrect diagnosis, and the cost of purchasing the next observation. When the cost of the next observation exceeds the expected error cost, the decision maker terminates and chooses the hypothesis favored by the cumulative evidence. Intuitively, the ECSR posits that individuals preoccupy themselves with negative outcomes and losses, and focus on the pain they will experience if they make an incorrect diagnosis. In an effort to minimize this, they are thought to collect as much information as possible, until that information is more expensive than the anticipated penalty and foregone reward combined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1.2.">The Error Cost Stopping Rule.</head><p>More formally, the error cost associated with choosing Orthorlia is the reward for correctly choosing Banasica, gB, minus the penalty for incorrectly choosing Orthorlia, lO. The expected error cost, ( ), for choosing Orthorlia after sample s(x) is therefore � � ( )� ⋅ ( − ), where � � ( )� is the probability that Banasica is the correct response, given the evidence produces by all samples up to and including s(x). The expected error cost for choosing Banasica is similarly defined using the complementary reward, penalty, and probabilities. An individual will sample until the expected error cost of terminating is greater than the total cost of the next sample. The total cost is the sum of the objective price paid for a sample and the subjective waiting cost of delaying termination. The latter represents participants' growing desire to terminate sampling and make a final decision (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Osuna, 1985)</ref>. Waiting cost is assumed to increase linearly at a constant rate determined by an impatience parameter, i. The total cost of purchasing the nth test is therefore, ′( ) = ( ) + ( ⋅ ), where c(n) is the objective cost and ⋅ is the waiting cost.</p><p>To account for the probabilistic nature of human behavior, we assume that the likelihood of terminating after sample x is a logistic function of the difference between the cost of the next test and the expected error cost of terminating now, such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) = 1 1 + exp � • � ′ ( ) − [ ( ), ( )]�� ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where min [ ( ), ( )] is the expected error cost of the more attractive diagnosis, and is a free parameter controlling sensitivity to the difference between sampling cost and error cost. As becomes large, the model approaches a deterministic rule, always terminating when the expected error cost drops below ′( ), while small values produce more random behavior. Once an individual decides to stop sampling, the likelihood of choosing a diagnosis, X, is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ℎ | ) = 1 1 + exp � • � � � ( )� 1 − � � ( )� �� ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where is another free parameter controlling sensitivity to the log-odds in favor of disease X. In total, ECSR has three free parameters: the sensitivity parameters, and , and the impatience rate, i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2.">Sequential sampling models of deferred decision making</head><p>Another approach for understanding deferred decision making strategies comes from sequential sampling models (SSMs). These models have been used to understand the psychological process underlying behavior in various domains (for reviews see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ratcliff, Smith, Brown, &amp; McKoon, 2016)</ref>. They have been particularly successfully when applied to decision phenomena, including low-level perceptual judgments <ref type="bibr">(Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001</ref>), higher-level perceptual decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hotaling, Cohen, Shiffrin, &amp; Busemeyer, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Trueblood, Brown, &amp; Heathcote, 2014)</ref>, preferential choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993)</ref>, categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997)</ref>, and planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hotaling, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hotaling &amp; Busemeyer, 2012)</ref>. More recently, in the field of decision neuroscience, sequential sampling models have been used to understand the link between brain activity and evidence accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bogacz, Wagenmakers, Forstmann, &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gluth, Hotaling, &amp; Rieskamp, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>These models conceive of the decision process as one of accumulating information through repeated sampling of information from the environment or from memory, until the accumulated evidence for one alternative is sufficient to produce a choice. However, it is important to recognize that most SSMs involve a relatively narrow conception of sampling. Samples are collected automatically, without deliberate action, to produce a single choice. In the present article, we expand the SSM framework to address the less well understood form of active sampling of information involved in deferred decision making. Rather than accumulating information to make a single choice, the individual makes a series of decisions regarding whether to collect more information or terminate sampling and make a final choice. Upon observing each new sample, they must decide whether or not they have enough evidence to stop sampling and make a choice.</p><p>A race model is one of simplest forms of SSM, and assumes that people independently accumulate evidence for each response <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Audley &amp; Pike, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Geller &amp; Pitz, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pike, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vickers, 1979)</ref>. Using the medical diagnosis scenario introduced earlier, this model posits that the decision maker purchases tests until there are at least α tests favoring Orthorlia or β tests favoring Banasica. This model explains why participants sometimes terminate after a non-diagnostic subsequence, and if α and β are allowed to differ-representing a bias in favor of one option over the other-can also explain stopping when LA(0) = LB(0) = 0. However, simple race models cannot account for situations where participants terminate with a choice contrary to the final test result (e.g.</p><p>Busemeyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">&amp; Rapoport, 1988</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2.1.">The Time-Variant Sequential Sampling Model. Recent work by Gluth and colleagues has</head><p>begun to investigate the use of most sophisticated SSMs to model deferred decision making. Gluth,</p><p>Rieskamp, and Büchel (2012) compared participants' choices in stock buying task to the predictions of several models. They rejected a normative model -based on optimal backward induction -but found that a time-variant SSM -in which individuals reduce the amount of evidence required over time -gave the best fit to human behavior. This finding was supported by functional brain imaging data that showed a relationship between accumulator values in the model and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) measures in the anterior insula, the pre-supplementary motor area, and the caudate nucleus.</p><p>Furthermore, activity in these brain regions at the beginning of a decision predicted trial-by-trial variations in response cautiousness (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Forstmann et al., 2008 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">van Maanen et al., 2011</ref> for similar findings in perceptual decisions). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gluth et al. (2013)</ref> extended their model in an effort to predict the response time distributions obtained in a related stock buying task; this time investigating associated brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). They found that by introducing a third accumulator representing the decision not to make a choice during the current rating period they were able to account for the observed decrease in responding at the end of each rating period. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data also showed evidence that responses were prepared at each rating, only to be inhibited by a decision not to decide.</p><p>In the present study, we adapt the time-variant SSM (TVSSM) for our medical diagnosis scenario.</p><p>According to the model, an individual is assumed to store information in three separate streams, each corresponding to a potential response: diagnose with Orthorlia, diagnose with Banasica, and purchase another test. After observing a new test result, each stream is updated based on the new information.</p><p>Over successive observations, evidence for and against each response accumulates until there is sufficient evidence for one alternative to make a response. Upon observing a new test result, the model calculates the new cumulative odds in favor of each disease. We make the simplifying assumption that during deliberation information accumulates continuously at a constant rate. More formally, the value of the accumulator denoting the evidence in favor of Orthorlia at time t is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= � ln� ( )� � + ) •<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where t is the time elapsed since the most recent test and ε represents random noise drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of σ. ζ is the standard deviation of the expected payoff for choosing Orthorlia, and causes evidence to accumulate more slowly when the resultant outcome is less certain. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The accumulator for Banasica is defined similarly, but uses the odds in favor of Banasica, .</p><p>A key feature of the SSMs we test is that that they also explicitly represent the accumulation of evidence in favor of waiting to make a diagnosis. We assume that the evidence in favor of choice deferral is inversely related to the evidence in favor of terminating. Psychologically this means that the absence of substantial information supporting either diagnosis is treated as evidence in favor of waiting and collecting more test information. More specifically the model compares the log-odds in favor of the more likely disease (i.e. the disease that the test results have tended to favor) with the maximum possible log-odds that would have resulted if all tests had favored that disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gluth et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Formally, the value of the accumulator representing the evidence in favor of purchasing another test at time t, after x tests, is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= �(ln ( ) − ln� ( )� + � •<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where ω(x) is the odds in favor of the more likely disease and ωmax is the maximum odds. </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( ) = (0) − • (5)</formula><p>where x is the number of tests already purchased, and λ is a constant determining the rate of decrease.</p><p>Since a decision threshold represents the amount of evidence required to make a choice, tvSSM treats negative threshold values as a signal to terminate immediately and choose the more likely diagnosis. In the case that ( ) &lt; 0, the model simply chooses the disease favored by the cumulative evidence. If the numbers of tests favoring each disease are equal, the model guesses randomly. We refer to the above model as tvSSM. To test whether or not impatience was a key factor in explaining people's behavior, we created a second version of the model. stSSM was identical to tvSSM, except that was held constant. Both tvSSM and stSSM assume that is constant across tests, and each has the three free parameters: (0), , and σ. tvSSM has the addition free parameter, λ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Goals</head><p>We investigate the psychological processes involved in deferred decision making. In two experiments we examine how people collect evidence and decide when to make a choice. From these we gain new insight into how factors like sampling cost and risk influence people's willingness to defer a choice. To complement and extend our behavioral analyses we develop and test several cognitive models. Our aim here is to probe more deeply into the psychological processes and decision strategies underlying people's decisions about when to wait for more information and when to make a choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experiment 1</head><p>We begin with the first of two experiments based on the medical diagnosis scenario introduced earlier. In the experimental task, each participant saw a series of simulated patients and had to diagnose each with one of two diseases. Participant could purchase error-prone diagnostic information until they were confident in their choice. Our primary goal was to design a flexible and intuitive paradigm where participants were free to pursue their favored decision strategy. We therefore expected to find substantial individual differences in choice behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Participants</head><p>Forty-one students from the University of Basel, Switzerland were recruited via an online portal administrated by the university. They were paid at a rate of 20 Swiss Francs (CHF) per hour, plus a performance based bonus. The mean total payment across all participants was 33.72 CHF, approximately 35.10 USD, including an average bonus of 4.58 CHF. The minimum payment allowed was 5 CHF 5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Stimuli and Procedure</head><p>Upon entering the laboratory, participants were greeted by an experimenter and asked to sign a consent form. The experiment was developed in the Matlab programming environment using The Psychophysical Toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brainard, 1997)</ref>. Participants began the experiment by reading a set of instructions on the computer screen. They were told that they would play the part of a medical doctor in charge of diagnosing patients during a disease outbreak in a large city. They were told that initial testing showed that each sick patient was infected with one of two viruses: Ortholia and Banasica. They were also told that half of the patients were infected with each virus. Participants' task in the experiment was to diagnose a series of patients as accurately as possible. Participants collected information by running blood tests, which gave probabilistic evidence favoring one diagnosis.</p><p>Each trial presented participants with a screen like the one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. A new patient appeared on screen along with the result of an initial blood test. Participants were told that each test would favor one virus or the other, but that errors were possible. The directions stated that if a patient had a disease, the probability of a test favoring that disease was 60%. The probability of an error was 40%. The computer randomly assigned each patient a true disease at the beginning of the trial and generated test results on the fly according to these probabilities. Participants were told that, because of the possibility of errors, they should run multiple tests to be sure which disease a patient has. They were also warned that, "the hospital's laboratory is extremely busy because of the outbreak, so it is important that you order only as many tests as you need to properly diagnose each patient." This was operationalized by charging participant a small fee for each test they ordered. They began the experiment with an endowment of 300 points, which they could use to purchase blood tests.</p><p>Participants were instructed that 750 points was equal to 1 CHF, and that any points they had at the end of the experiment would be converted to cash for them to take home.</p><p>Each trial began by showing the result of one free test. Participants then chose between three alternatives: 1) diagnose with Orthorlia, 2) diagnose with Banasica, or 3) purchase another test. In the low cost condition, each additional test cost 1 point. In the high cost condition, each additional test cost After displaying the result of the first free test, three buttons appeared on screen corresponding to the three choice options. If a participant clicked on the 'buy another test' button a new test was simulated, and they were shown a screen indicating which of the two diseases the test result favored.</p><p>Participants then chose again. If they decided to diagnose the patient, feedback indicated whether or not they chose the correct disease. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the riskiness of diagnoses. In the low risk condition, participants gained 30 points for each correct diagnosis and lost 30 points for each incorrect diagnosis. In the high risk condition, participants gained or lost 100 points for each diagnosis.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, any remaining points were converted to cash and paid to the participant.</p><p>To prevent premature or random clicking there was a 500 ms delay after the buttons appeared on screen before participants were allowed to respond.</p><p>To reduce participants' cognitive load-and therefore increase their sensitivity to experimental manipulations-the complete history of test outcomes as well as reward and punishment values were displayed on screen throughout each trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Design</head><p>High and low levels of sampling cost and riskiness were factorially combined to create four conditions. Each participant completed fifty trials in each condition before beginning the next, for a total of 200 trials. Order of conditions was randomized across participants. Participants received instructions warning them about the new costs and payoffs before beginning each condition.</p><p>2.1.3.1. Predictions of the Optimal Model. For the interpretation of the results it is helpful to specify the optimal responses. To determine the predictions of the OPM, we used backward induction to compute the optimal decision policy (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bertsekas, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">DeGroot, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Keeney &amp; Raiffa, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Raiffa, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Von Winterfeldt &amp; Edwards, 1986)</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows that across individuals there was a consistent positive relationship between additional sampling and accuracy. However, the right panel shows a much weaker (if any) relationship between sampling and earnings due to the cost structure of the task. The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> gives the cumulative proportion of trials that terminated after each test. The pattern is similar across conditions, with proportions increasing rapidly across the first 10 tests.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the curve rises fastest for the low cost, high risk condition -where information is cheap and valuable -and slowest for the high cost, low risk condition. Curves for the low cost, high risk and high cost, low risk conditions are similar and follow an intermediate path.</p><p>The mean test difference across all trials was 2.26 (SD = 0.11). The right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the proportion of trials terminated as a function of test difference. For test differences of 3 or less, which comprised over 93% of choices in the experiment, participants were most careful -i.e., waited for the greatest amount of evidence -when costs were low and risk was high, and they terminated with the least evidence when costs were high and risk was low.  (risk) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed that both cost (F(1,40) = 9.56, p = .004, g = .47) 6 and risk (F(1,40) = 44.18, p &lt; .001, g = .61) had significant main effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of Deferred Decision Making 22</head><p>Comparing behavior to the predictions of the OPM, we see that the observed effects, though qualitatively sensible, deviate notably from the predicted pattern. Overall, participants engaged in too much testing, particularly when risk was low and the model predicted very little testing. For example, the optimal policy in the high cost, low risk condition was to decide after the first free test, but participants still waited for 4.23 tests (SDhigh-low = 2.24). Participants were less sensitive to risk, in general, and ran too few tests when risk was high. For instance, in the low cost, high risk condition the OPM predicted more than 10 tests, but the average participant fell short of this standard (Mlow-high = 7.56, SDlow-high = 2.92).   The striking divergence of observed behavior from that prescribed by the OPM suggests that participant likely pursued different strategies all together. In the Modeling Analysis section, we examine several alternative models that conceptualize the problem differently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Modeling Analysis</head><p>To better understand how our manipulations influenced participants' decision strategies we now examine several cognitive models. Each presents a different view of the psychological processes underlying deferred decision making. By comparing the predictions of these models to the behavior of participants we can better understand how various computational mechanisms might explain behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">The Baseline Model</head><p>Before examining the psychological models described above, we construct a baseline model <ref type="bibr">(BL)</ref> to capture the lower bound of model performance. We began by calculating each individual's termination frequency as a function of test number. From this we calculated the baseline probability that each individual would terminate after observing one, two, three, etc. tests. Thus, the baseline model uses each individual's overall behavioral tendencies to predict their choices on a given trial, without attending to the specific sequence of test results on that trial. Because the baseline model ignores this information, it provides a floor against which other models' performance can be judged. At a minimum, any psychological model should out-perform this baseline.</p><p>The predicted probability that an individual will terminate, conditional on observing at least n tests, is simply ⁄ where is the observed frequency with which that individual terminated after n tests, and is the total number of trials where that individual observed at least n tests. Once a decision is made to terminate, the baseline model uses a simple logistic choice rule to choose a disease as a function of the current odds. We assume that individuals will differ in their awareness of the odds information, so a sensitivity parameter was estimated for each individual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Quantitative Model Comparison</head><p>To evaluate the goodness of fit of a model for a given trial, we calculated the joint probability of making the observed diagnosis after the observed number of tests according to the model. We measured the ability of a model to account for an individual's behavior across an entire experiment by summing the logarithms of these probabilities across all trials. For each individual, we estimated model parameters that maximized this summed log-likelihood using Matlab's ga genetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chipperfield &amp; Fleming, 1995</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.2.">Individual-level model performance.</head><p>Comparing the models at the individual level yielded even stronger support for tvSSM. 20 participants (49%) were best fit by tvSSM, compared to 13 (32%) for BL, 6 (15%) for stSSM, and 1 each for ECSR and CONST. Using AIC values, we computed AIC weights corresponding to the probability of each model according to the observed data <ref type="bibr">(Wagenmakers &amp; Farrell, 2004) 7</ref> . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows tvSSM enjoyed the greatest support, with many individuals producing very strong evidence for the model. Several individuals produced strong evidence for BL, though this was the exception and AIC weights were near 0 for most individuals. The three remaining models received very little support. For instance, the six highest dots for stSSM correspond to the individuals who were best fit by that model, but nearly every other dot is at 0. The same is true for CONST and ECSR, which each showing all but two individuals at this floor level. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Qualitative Model Comparison</head><p>Beyond the overall quantitative performance, we were interested in how well the models accounted for key qualitative data patterns. In particular, we examined the models' predictions regarding how much testing each individual engaged in and how much evidence they required to make a terminal choice 8 . For the sake of simplicity, we focus on results collapsed across cost and risk conditions of Experiment 1. We report more complete results by condition in the Appendix.</p><p>Overall, we find that tvSSM outperformed the other models on all measures. The top row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> show that ECSR and CONST underestimated the number of tests and test difference for many participants whose data fell in the middle of the scale. ECSR also producing some notable overestimations at the high and low extremes of the scale. The bottom row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> shows that tvSSM also provides the best account of participants' termination rates. All other models overestimate early terminations. After Test 10 stSSM also consistently underestimates the likelihood of terminating. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Discussion</head><p>Overall, results from Experiment 1 show that individuals understood something of the interrelations and tradeoffs between sampling cost, accuracy, payoff variability, and expected earnings.</p><p>The positive correlation between number of tests and accuracy implies that participants were sensitive to the sequence of test results they observed, and were able to use additional information to reduce their uncertainty and make better diagnoses. Our experimental manipulations also substantially impacted behavior. Participants reacted adaptively to high testing costs -by being frugal and reducing sampling -and high risk -by increasing accuracy through additional sampling.</p><p>Indeed, the qualitative pattern of behavioral results fits broadly with the prediction of the optimal model. That said, on a quantitative level, the number of tests acquired by participants differed substantial from the exact numbers predicted by the OPM. Sensitivity to risk was particularly reduced. In the low risk condition, when sampling was relatively unimportant, participants sampled too much. In the high risk condition, when sampling was more important, participants sampled too little. This divergence between human behavior and the predictions of the OPM suggests that participants used fundamentally different strategies to solve the deferred decision making problem.</p><p>Our modeling analysis shed light on the ways individuals approached the task. We found strong support for the decision strategy articulated in tvSSM. This model posits that individuals separately accumulate evidence in favor of each response, including the option to defer, until the evidence for one reaches a predetermined threshold. After each test the model reduces its threshold for terminating in order to avoid costly over-sampling. This strategy gave the best account of behavior for roughly half of participants. This model fared much better than the static version, stSSM, which was selected for only six individuals. Since these models differ only with respect to their time-variance, this result provides strong support for the threshold reduction component of tvSSM.</p><p>Our modeling analysis also revealed substantial individual differences in decision strategy. No one model was sufficient to explain the behavior of all individuals. In fact, a sizeable minority of individuals were best fit by a baseline model that ignored the actual test results when deciding to terminate. This could indicate that these participants employed a very simple decision strategy based only on the number of tests they had observed. However, an alternative interpretation of BL's success is that these individuals used a strategy not represented by any of the cognitive models considered here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of Deferred Decision Making 30</head><p>In sum, our behavioral and modeling analyses of Experiment 1 indicate that most individuals learned to solve our deferred decision task in an adaptive, yet suboptimal way. For half of participants, the tvSSM gave the best account of their decision strategy, while a smaller group appeared to use simpler constant evidence (stSSM and CONST) strategies. In Experiment 2, we investigate behavior in the context of a more difficult variant of the medical diagnosis task to see how this affects their deferred decision making strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiment 2</head><p>In Experiment 2, we continue with the same deferred decision making paradigm, but make several design changes. We simplify the experimental design by removing the risk manipulation and focusing on a subtler manipulation of sampling cost. Rather than high and low cost conditions, in Experiment 2 we compare constant vs. increasing sample costs. We expect that the introduction of increasing test costs on some trials will emphasize the importance of frugality in testing. We therefore expect participants to employ decision strategies that incorporate this principle (tvSSM and ESCR) rather than strategies that use a constant evidence criterion (stSSM and CONST) or ignore evidence entirely (BL). Finally, to increase the difficulty of the task, we removed the sample history from the display.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Participants</head><p>Forty-three students from the University of Basel were recruited via an online portal administrated by the university. Each participant received course credit, along with monetary compensation based on their performance. The details of the payment scheme are given in following section. The mean payment across all participants was 9.38 CHF, approximately 10.26 USD. The minimum payment was 5 CHF, though participants were unaware of this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Stimuli and Procedure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of Deferred Decision Making 31</head><p>Experiment 2 used identical methods to Experiment 1, with a few exceptions. First, outcomes were displayed as cash values rather than abstract points. Participants began with an endowment of 10 CHF. Each trial began with one free test, after which participants could purchase up to nineteen additional tests. In the constant cost condition, each additional test cost 0.05 CHF; in the increasing cost conditions the first additional test cost 0.01 CHF and each subsequent test increased in price by 0.01 CHF. In both conditions, participants received 0.65 CHF for each correct diagnosis and lost 1 CHF for each incorrect diagnosis 9 . Any money remaining after the experiment was paid to the participant at the end. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Design</head><p>Sample cost was the only independent variable manipulated in Experiment 2. Each participant completed four blocks of 9 trials within each condition. At the beginning of each constant cost block, participants were told that for next nine patients each blood test would cost 0.05 CHF. A similar message preceded each increasing cost block, and informed participants that the first test would cost 0.01 CHF and each additional blood test would increase in price by 0.01 CHF. Constant and increasing cost blocks alternated. The order of the cost conditions was counterbalanced across participants. However, these modest mean differences hide a more interesting pattern of predictions. 10 It may seem counterintuitive that the OPM would predict more testing in the constant cost condition despite the first four test costing a total of only 0.05 CHF compared to 0.15 CHF in the increasing cost condition. However, the key to understanding the model's predictions lies in the dynamic nature of the deferred decision task. When testing costs increase there are very few scenarios where purchasing four or more test is justified by a significant increase in accuracy. These scenarios are more common with constant testing costs, which explains why the OPM shows a greater variance in its predictions for this condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4.">Predictions of the Optimal Model</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Behavioral Analysis</head><p>Participants correctly diagnosed an average of 70.32% of patients. On average, participants made a diagnosis after observing 5.17 tests <ref type="bibr">(SD = 2.45)</ref>. This combination of testing and accuracy resulted in an average loss of 1.95 CHF over the course of the experiment. Comparing these results to the predictions of the OPM, we see that participants purchased too many tests in both conditions, as reflected in the nonmonotonic relationship between testing and earnings. We do not see the predicted effect of cost condition: OPM predicted more testing, greater variability in number of tests, and greater variability in test difference for the constant cost conditions, but we found similar behavior across conditions. As in Experiment 1, these deviations from optimal behavior suggest that participants employed a fundamentally different decision strategy to that laid out by the OPM.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Modeling Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Quantitative Model Comparison</head><p>In Experiment 2, we used the same procedure for estimating parameters and calculating goodness-of-fit as in Experiment 1. compared to 12 (28%) for ECSR, 9 (21%) for BL, and 0 for stSSM and CONST. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows that tvSSM again produced AIC weights near 1 for many individuals, denoting overwhelming evidence for the model. This was true for only a few individuals who were best fit by ECSR and BL. CONST and stSSM received almost no support, further indicating that growing impatience across tests -which these models lack -was indeed crucial for explaining behavior. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Qualitative Model Comparison</head><p>The top row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> show that ECSR, tvSSM, and stSSM had similar performance when predicting the mean number of tests and the mean test difference across individuals, while CONST consistently underestimates both measures. In the bottom row, we see that tvSSM and ECSR are best able to reproduce the observed termination rates, while stSSM and CONST overestimate early and very late terminations, and underestimate the likelihood of terminating after 4-10 tests. These results provide clear evidence against the stSSM and CONST models, and for the tvSSM and ECSR models. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Discussion</head><p>In Experiment 2 we again found behavior divergent from the predictions of the optimal model. Whereas the OPM predicted greater testing in the increasing cost condition, participants purchased roughly equal numbers of tests in both conditions. More importantly, OPM predicted greater variability in testing for the constant cost condition due to the optimal stopping point in this condition being highly dependent on the particular sequence of test results a participant observed. We found no appreciable difference in the standard deviation in number of tests across conditions. The same is true when comparing OPM predictions to behavior with regard to test difference. The optimal model predicts greater variability in test difference under constant costs, but participants behave similarly conditions.</p><p>These results again suggest that participants did not use an optimal strategy to perform the task in Experiment 2. One potential explanation for the lack of behavioral differences across conditions could be that greater demands on working memory -due to the removal of test histories -diverted attention away from cost information. However, people almost always chose the disease with greater support, suggesting that memory demands did not prevent them from accurately remembering the balance of evidence.</p><p>Our modeling analysis again found that tvSSM was the dominant decision strategy, and gave the best account of behavior for most individuals. Likewise, no individual in Experiment 2 was found to use a constant evidence strategy (stSSM or CONST). In contrast with Experiment 1, ECSR was the best model for a substantial minority of participants (21%), suggesting that some individuals employed an errorfocuses strategy where growing impatience -in the form of increasing subjective waiting costs -limits over-sampling. Some individuals were again best characterized by BL, indicating that they either used a simple strategy based on test number, or a strategy not represented by any models we tested.</p><p>Overall, these results fit with those from Experiment 1, and emphasize that despite individual differences, most people employed decision strategies that incorporated mechanisms to avoid oversampling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">General Discussion</head><p>The present research aims to test several competing theories of deferred decision making. In two experiments participant acted as physicians tasked with diagnosing a series of patients. Using response data from these experiments, we examined how well different cognitive models of deferred decision making accounted for individuals' choices regarding whether to collect more diagnostic Models of Deferred Decision Making 39 information (at cost) or stop testing and make a final choice. Overall, we found that behavior did not match the predictions of an optimal model, but rather that a sequential sampling model with a decreasing threshold for terminating gave the best account of choice behavior for the majority of participants. This model posits that information for or against each response alternative accumulates over time until evidence favoring one reaches a prespecified threshold. Below we consider why this model outperformed the others, and what implications this has on our understanding of the cognitive process underlying deferred decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Sequential Sampling Models of Deferred Decision Making</head><p>Our results indicate that tvSSM gave the best account of choices for the majority of individuals.</p><p>This model posits a deliberation process in which evidence accumulates in three separate stores corresponding to the three response alternatives. Importantly, this includes accumulating evidence in favor of choice deferral, a feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gluth et al. (2013)</ref> found necessary to account for response time distributions. During deliberation, evidence in each store grows according to the current state of the deferred decision making problem. The present success of tvSSM implies that the cognitive mechanism underlying deferred decision making is best characterized as a process of information accumulation where choice alternatives compete against each other in a race to a predetermined evidence threshold.</p><p>According to the model, the process is guided by several factors, most importantly 1) the objective evidence in favor of each diagnosis, 2) the rewards and punishments associated with each response, and</p><p>3) the decreasing evidence thresholds that determine which response is made.</p><p>Notably absent from this list is sensitivity to sampling cost because tvSSM does not incorporate test cost into its calculations. In Experiment 2 -where participants were unaffected by our cost manipulation -this would have been a boon to the model, which predicts a null effect. However, we did observe an effect of cost in Experiment 1, for which tvSSM cannot account. That the model was still selected as best for most individuals -and outperformed the cost-sensitive ECSR model -suggests that, despite this omission, it nonetheless provides the most accurate explanation for participants' behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Decreasing Decision Thresholds</head><p>Previous research challenged the deterministic constant threshold model on the basis of critical tests of its qualitative predictions. Our approach based on quantitative model comparison provides new evidence that people adjust their evidence criteria over time. We examined two models representing constant threshold strategies: 1) a more flexible stochastic version of the constant model (CONST), and</p><p>2) a sequential sampling model with constant thresholds (stSSM). Both models performed poorly and were rarely selected as an individual's best fitting model. tvSSM, which assumes that people reduce their threshold for terminating sampling after each successive test, was the clear winner for most individuals. Because decreasing thresholds are the only difference between tvSSM and stSSM, the models' starkly differential performance provides strong evidence in favor of this time-variant component.</p><p>In neuroscience, several researchers have proposed similar time-variant mechanisms of information accumulation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bowman, Kording, &amp; Gottfried, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ditterich, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Drugowitsch, Moreno-Bote, Churchland, Shadlen, &amp; Pouget, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mormann, Malmaud, Huth, Koch, &amp; Rangel, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cisek, Puskas, and El-Murr (2009)</ref> posit an urgency signal that grows over time and governs when deliberation terminates. Such models have enjoyed much success in accounting for both choices and neural activation. Indeed, the results of our model comparison indicate that some kind of urgencyin the form of decreasing thresholds -is crucial for explaining how people perform deferred decision making. However, it is noteworthy that ECSR, whose subjective waiting cost can be interpreted as an urgency signal, was not well supported, especially in Experiment 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Comparison to Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport (1988)</head><p>Models of Deferred Decision Making 41</p><p>Comparing our findings to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer and Rapoport (1988)</ref>, a few interesting differences emerge. First, they selected ECSR as their best model, while we found that it performed significantly worse than tvSSM. In part, this stems from the different methods we used to test models.</p><p>Unlike Busemeyer and Rapoport, we fit stochastic versions of models to each individual. By introducing a noise component to each model, we avoided rejecting models purely on basis of a small number of aberrant choices, and instead allowed the model to account for these actions as "errors" within a stochastic process.</p><p>Another important explanation for our divergent findings lies in the models we consider. While we found tvSSM to be the best model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer and Rapoport (1988)</ref> did not consider any models with decreasing choice thresholds. Like Busemeyer and Rapoport, we find that a race model with constant thresholds (stSSM) performs poorly, and loses out to ECSR in Experiment 2. However, the addition of a time-variant decreasing threshold to the SSM framework (tvSSM) yields the best model for most individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Individual Differences</head><p>Across both experiments we found large individual differences in behavior. Participants varied widely in the number of tests they purchased and the accuracy of their diagnoses. This was a problem for the optimal model, which could only account for a very narrow range of sampling behavior. In contrast, tvSSM provides a method for representing individual differences in terms of psychological processes. This modeling framework, although strictly constrained in many ways, offers sufficient flexibility to account for a broad range of decisions. Extreme caution is explained with high initial thresholds for terminating; impulsivity can be accounted for via rapid threshold decrease; low accuracy can be represented by high levels of random noise. As a result of these features, tvSSM was selected as the best model for most individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models of Deferred Decision Making 42</head><p>Nonetheless, some were best fit by models that posits an entirely different process. In Experiment 2, a minority of participants focused their attention on the cost of making an incorrect diagnosis and terminated only when their level of impatience was sufficient to justify taking a risk and making a final choice, as described by ECSR. Surprisingly, the baseline model was preferred for several individuals in both experiments. This could suggest that some participants paid little attention to test outcomes when decided when to terminate sampling. However, it could also indicate that participants used a decision strategy not represented by any of the models we considered. Further work is needed to examine the full range of individual differences in decision strategy by considering additional models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Conclusion</head><p>Across two deferred decision making experiments we find that people collect information adaptively, but deviate from the predictions of an optimal model by searching for, on average, too much information. We also observed behavior that sharply conflicted with the predictions of two constant threshold models. Instead, we found large individual differences in behavior, with the majority of participants being best described by a sequential sampling model with decreasing thresholds for terminating. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the psychological factors that give rise to deferred decision making.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>An example choice screen from the low cost, high risk condition of Experiment 1 after purchasing four additional tests.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>Figure 5</head><label>5</label><figDesc>shows a pattern similarFigure 4. Participants terminated with the least evidence when costs were high and risk was low (Mhigh-low = 1.92, SDhigh-low = 0.63), and terminated with the most evidence when costs were low and risk was high (Mlow-high = 2.59, SDlow-high = 0.88). A 2 (cost) x 2 (risk) repeated measures ANOVA showed that again both cost (Mlow = 2.40, SDlow = 0.85, Mhigh = 2.12, SDhigh = 0.66, g = .36, F(1,40) = 7.70, p = .008) and risk (Mlow = 2.06, SDlow = 0.69, Mhigh = 2.46, SDhigh = 0.75, g = .54, F(1,40) = 34.68, p &lt; .001) had a significant main effect. In 4.17% of cases, participants made a diagnosis when the test difference was 0. On the remaining trials, participants chose the more likely disease 96.56% of the time. Comparing these results to the predictions of OPM yields conclusions similar to those made above based on number of tests. Again, participants were less sensitive to risk, collected too much evidence when risk was low, and too little evidence when risk was high.</figDesc></figure>

However, the right panel shows a nonmonotonic relationship between sampling and monetary earnings. Apparently, the structure of sampling costs in Experiment 2 led to widespread over-sampling despite the financial incentive to minimize costly testing. The number of tests purchased was not significantly different across cost conditions (Mconstant = 5.13, SDconstant = 2.42, Mincreasing = 5.21, SDincreasing = 2.51, g = .03, t(42) = 0.91, p = .597). The left panel of Figure 10 shows very little difference across condition in termination rates as a function of test number. The right side ofFigure 10gives the proportion of trials terminated as a function of test difference, and also shows the same pattern across conditions. This is especially true for test differences of 3 or less, which comprised over 96% of choices in the experiment.The mean test difference across all trials was 2.10 (SD = 0.61), and did not differ significantly across cost conditions (Mconstant = 2.08, SDconstant = 0.63, Mincreasing = 2.13, SDincreasing = 0.61, g = .07, t(42) = 1.32, p = .195). On 4.84% of trials, participants made a diagnosis when the test difference was 0. On trials where the terminal test difference was not 0, participants chose the more likely disease 94.97% of the time.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>After observing the result of a blood test, the model accumulates information for each of the three choice alternatives in parallel. The participant is assumed to accumulate information until there is enough evidence favoring one alternative to warrant a choice. The amount of evidence required to make a choice is known as a decision threshold. As soon as one of the accumulator values exceeds its predetermined threshold, that alternative is declared the winner and the corresponding response is made. Since we have no reason to believe that participants would set different decision thresholds for each disease (payoffs, costs, and base rates were the same for both diseases), we assume that θd is the threshold value for both diagnoses. However, individuals may set a different threshold for deferring their diagnosis, represented by θs. If the choice is made to test again, upon observing the new test result the accumulators reset to 0 and t resets to 1. Evidence for each alternative then begins to accumulate based on the new cumulative odds, ω(x + 1).The models posit that decision makers grow increasingly impatient as the number of tests within a trial increases. This growing desire to terminate the current trial is represented as a decrease in across samples, such that:</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

In the high cost, low risk condition participants could terminate on the basis of the first free test, while those in the low cost, low risk condition should wait for a test difference of 2.00. Unsurprisingly, the model predicts the greatest test difference of 3.42 when costs are low and risk is high. For the high cost, low risk condition participant should terminate with an average difference of 2.80 tests.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="4">Table 1.

The left</cell></row><row><cell>panel of</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note>summarizes the model's predictions. We first consider the optimal amount of testing in each condition. In the low cost, low risk condition participants would maximize their expected earnings by terminating after 3.85 tests, while in the high cost, low risk condition participants should never purchase any test, but should instead terminate after the first free test. In the low cost, high risk condition it is optimal to terminate after an average of 10.63 tests, while in the high cost, high risk condition participants should terminate after 7.29 tests. The optimal policy thus states that participants should show starkly different sampling behavior across conditions. When information is cheap (low cost) or the consequences of one's diagnoses are great (high risk), they should exploit testing to increase their accuracy. However, when testing is expensive (high cost) or consequences of one's diagnoses are less (low risk), it is best to be frugal and minimize testing. We also used the OPM to compute the amount of evidence that participants should collect. For each condition we calculated the predicted test difference by taking the mean absolute difference in tests favoring each disease when a diagnosis was made. For example, if the model made a diagnosis after seeing the test sequence O-O-B-O-where O represent a test favoring Orthorlia and B represents a test favoring Banasica-the test difference for that trial would be 2. Terminating after a sequence of O- B-B-O-B-B-B would yield a test difference of 3. Table 1 shows that the OPM's predictions</note></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_4"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>also shows that the OPM predicts greater variability in the constant cost condition, both in terms of number of tests (SDconstant = 2.64 vs. SDincreasing = 1.29) and test differences (SDconstant = 0.04 vs. SDincreasing = 0.42). This reveals an important consequence of our cost function manipulation. When costs are constant, the model meticulously collects information until achieving a test difference of 2. This produces greater variability in number of tests, but little variability in test difference. On the other hand, when testing costs increase, both number of test and test difference depend on the particular set of test results obtained. If early tests produce strong evidence, then the model terminates early with a relatively large test difference. However, if testing is relatively inconclusive the OPM will only purchase a few more tests, and will terminate with a smaller test difference rather than pay for additional tests.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
