				<p>This article proposes a novel approach to understanding the affective structure of human interaction, an aspect often overlooked in classical models. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from information theory (Shannon), complex systems theory (Morin), and affective neuroscience (Damasio), we conceptualize emotions as directional forces. Each force is characterized by its intensity (φ) and its orientation (θ) relative to a contextual goal or telos. Our framework introduces an innovative metric, telotopic negentropy (Ntel), to quantify the directional coherence of these affective forces. This metric specifically distinguishes between approach (conative) and avoidance (inhibitory) dynamics, weighted by an emotional primacy factor (α) that reflects the typical dominance of felt intensity over pure alignment. A complementary scalar measure (φτ) quantifies the net motivational drive towards the &apos;telos&apos;. The model&apos;s internal mechanics are illustrated through a detailed four-phase case study. Here, affective vectors (φ, θ) are interpretively assigned based on contextual cues and informed by a typology of axiological orientations and affective principles. While not empirically calibrated at this stage, this example illustrates the model&apos;s potential to account for emotional asymmetries, ambivalence, and progressive alignment within dyadic interaction. The article concludes by discussing potential empirical extensions, including a formal method for deriving vector orientation (θ) via an axiological alignment coefficient (β) and the future calibration of the primacy factor (α) across diverse affective profiles. This framework offers a novel method for quantifying affective coherence and for theorizing the structural dynamics of shared intentionality in situated interactions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Classical models of social interaction-whether drawn from sociology, cognitive psychology, or game theory-often privilege normative or informational frameworks that overlook the affective dynamics of behavior. Even when emotions are acknowledged, they are typically treated as secondary variables or sources of noise, rather than as central forces structuring interaction. This limitation becomes especially evident when analyzing ordinary social encounters, where affective alignment among participants is not incidental but constitutive of successful coordination.</p><p>From an axiodynamic perspective <ref type="bibr">(Kleden, La Dynamique des valeurs, 2022)</ref>, emotions are not merely reactive states but directional forces-vectors that orient behavior toward affectively desirable or undesirable outcomes. Every interaction, however minimal or routine, mobilizes conative and inhibitory forces aimed at either minimizing negative affect (self-or other-directed) or maximizing positive affect. These affective principles, though rarely explicit, structure the interactional field around what we define as a situational telos: an implicit emotional objective that stabilizes the exchange.</p><p>In this view, social interaction functions as an affectively driven self-organizing system, in which emotional expressions, gestures, and social rituals -as described by Goffman <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Goffman, 1967</ref>) -serve to reduce uncertainty and generate emergent coordination. This organization is not the result of deliberate calculation but emerges from the interplay between affective memory, empathic anticipation, and collective alignment toward emotionally tolerable states.</p><p>Drawing on Edgar Morin's theoretical work on information <ref type="bibr">(Morin, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr">(Morin, -2004</ref>, organization, and negentropy, and on Léon Brillouin's insight that energy is required to convert information into reduced entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brillouin, 1959)</ref>, we propose a model of telotopic 1 coherence. This concept captures the degree of alignment between affective forces and a goal-oriented telos within a given interaction.</p><p>In this framework, social negentropy-understood as a reduction of affective dispersion-becomes a key indicator of the system's internal organization. This approach is rooted in the foundational work of Claude Shannon <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Shannon, 1948)</ref>, for whom entropy quantifies the uncertainty of information systems; by analogy, telotopic entropy expresses the internal disorder of affective fields, and negentropy the emergence of structured emotional coherence. The aim of this article is to formalize this perspective by integrating affect, information, organization, and telos into a unified model. We argue that social interactions can be modeled as telotopically oriented affective fields, in which the probability and structure of behavioral outcomes are modulated by internal coherence. This approach offers a novel theoretical basis for understanding the emotional geometry of interaction, bridging systemic thinking and affective modeling.</p><p>In what follows, we distinguish two complementary forms of systemic organization: structural negentropy, which reflects the internal coherence of an individual's axiotypic configuration (i.e., the consistency of values and mémotions stored in long-term memory); and telotopic negentropy, which measures the degree of directional alignment between affective forces and a shared telos. While structural negentropy concerns the stability of one's cognitive-affective architecture, telotopic negentropy reflects one's emotional readiness to engage with a situation-specific objective.</p><p>The notion of telos is central to the present model. It refers to an emotionally salient goal or attractor that orients affective dynamics during interaction. Far from being a fixed endpoint, the telos emerges within the field of interaction and dynamically shapes how affective forces are projected, inhibited, or recalibrated across time.</p><p>The article first establishes the theoretical foundations of the model, then develops its mathematical formalization, and ultimately illustrates its application through a detailed case study. To illustrate the concept of telotopy with a concrete example: consider a professional meeting where participants aim to reach consensus on a project proposal. This consensus functions as a telos-an affective attractoraround which emotional vectors like enthusiasm, hesitation, trust, or skepticism organize themselves. Some vectors align with the goal (conative forces), propelling the interaction toward agreement, while others diverge from it (inhibitory forces), creating resistance or caution. The telotopic coherence of this system-measured through negentropy-quantifies how structured these emotional forces become relative to the shared objective, determining whether the interaction succeeds or falters.</p><p>This model is grounded in a neurocognitive conception of affective orientation, where axiotypes-longterm structures of emotionally encoded values-are stored in memory and mobilized contextually during interaction. Affective vectors do not emerge automatically from these structures; rather, they are instantiated in response to situational stimuli, especially social or symbolic, that trigger an affectivecognitive process. The resulting orientation reflects a dynamic interplay between internal coherence (anchored in axiotypic memory) and external contextual modulation (anchored in telic salience). While the present formulation is conceptual, its scientific value ultimately depends on future falsifiability. The principles of axiotypic structuration and telotopic organization must be subjected to empirical testing. We encourage research teams in psychology and neuroscience to design experimental settings capable of confirming, refining, or refuting the predictions derived from the axiodynamic approach.</p><p>The following diagram provides a visual summary of the model's core logic. It illustrates how affective vectors are dynamically projected based on the interplay between long-term axiotypic structures, contextual cues, and alignment with a situational telos. This vectorial projection is at the heart of telotopic negentropy and sets the foundation for the computational formulation developed in the next sections. The diagram illustrates how affective vectors emerge from the interaction between axiotypic orientation (θbase), contextual modulation (Δθ), and telic alignment (β). The resulting direction θ reflects a dynamic compromise between internal value structures and external situational influence, forming the basis for the calculation of telotopic negentropy. In the telotopic model, we introduce telotopic negentropy as a measure of the directional alignment of affective forces toward the telos. A high level of telotopic negentropy signifies a well-organized affective system, where emotional energies are channeled to support goal-directed behavior-an idea that echoes Morin's view of organization as an active, emergent process. This measure quantifies the system's capacity to counter affective entropy, aligning with Morin's insight that negentropy reflects a system's ability to create order from complexity.</p><p>Additionally, Morin's concept of auto-eco-organization-where systems self-organize through interactions with their environment-parallels the model's portrayal of social interactions as adaptive affective fields. As individuals adjust their emotional responses during an interaction, the system evolves toward greater telotopic negentropy, producing an emergent, context-specific order tied to the telos. This bridges Morin's qualitative framework with the model's quantitative approach, linking his theories to the negentropy calculations.</p><p>Together, Shannon's entropy provides a precise tool to assess affective dispersion, while Morin's complexity theory enriches the interpretation of how order emerges in social systems. This integration underpins the telotopic model's ability to both measure and conceptualize affective coherence in interactions. P a g e 5 | 83</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Motivational Forces and Telotopic Negentropy: A Comparative Theoretical Perspective</head><p>The present model of telotopic negentropy builds upon the tradition of motivational force theories while offering a significant extension to their formalization. Historically, Kurt Lewin's foundational work [ <ref type="bibr">(Lewin, A dynamic theory of personality, 1935)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(Lewin, Field theory in social science: Selected theoretical papers, 1951)</ref>] conceptualized behavior as the result of a field of psychological forces, with approach and avoidance vectors structuring an individual's life space. This topological framework was later refined by Atkinson and Birch in their Dynamics of Action theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atkinson &amp; Birch, 1970)</ref>, which modeled behavior as a competition between instigating and inhibitory forces.</p><p>The telotopic model departs from these classical approaches on several key dimensions:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information-Theoretic Integration</head><p>Unlike Lewinian and post-Lewinian theories, which remain primarily qualitative, our formalism explicitly incorporates Shannon's information theory by quantifying the structural coherence of the affective field through entropy-based measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Normalized Bidirectional Vector Modeling</head><p>Whereas traditional models such as Elliot's treat approach and avoidance as antagonistic forces on a linear scale <ref type="bibr">(Elliot,</ref> The hierarchical model of approach-avoidance motivation, 2006), our bifurcated formulation ( Fc and Fi ) enables a differential evaluation of their internal coherence, weighted by relative magnitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emotion-Cognition Integration via</head><p>The telotopic model overcomes the classical hot/cold dichotomy by introducing a modulation parameter ( ) that quantifies the interplay between affective intensity and directional alignment-an approach consistent with recent findings in affective neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(LeDoux &amp; Brown, 2017)</ref> showing the inseparability of emotional and cognitive processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explicit Teleological Orientation</head><p>While traditional motivation theories acknowledge the presence of goals, our concept of telos introduces a richer axiological dimension: alignment is not only geometrical, but also value-laden-captured through the axiological alignment coefficient .</p><p>In this respect, telotopic negentropy offers a formal synthesis of Lewinian field theory, contemporary approach-avoidance models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Elliot &amp; Covington, 2001)</ref>, and self-organizing information dynamics <ref type="bibr">(Morin, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr">(Morin, -2004</ref>. This synthesis enables us to go beyond both the mechanistic reductionism of classical vectorial models and the vagueness of purely qualitative theories.</p><p>Comparative This comparative analysis supports the introduction of the telotopic model as a necessary and nonredundant extension of existing motivational theories-one that provides a rigorous mathematical formalization of dynamics previously described only qualitatively or partially.</p><p>The telotopic model also builds upon more recent reformulations of motivational field theory, notably the CTA model (Cues, Tendencies, and Actions) proposed by Revelle <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Revelle, 2008)</ref> as a reparameterization of Atkinson &amp; Birch's Dynamics of Action. The CTA framework formalizes action tendencies and behavioral outputs as dynamically coupled variables, evolving under instigating cues and mutual inhibition. Its differential architecture captures inertial properties and sequence effects across competing activities-dynamics that are also central to telotopic modeling. However, while the CTA model excels in describing temporal fluctuations and mutual exclusivity of actions, it lacks a mechanism for evaluating systemic coherence, affective directionality, or axiological relevance. The telotopic framework extends this line of thinking by introducing informational negentropy (Ntel), directional projection (φτ), and value alignment (β), thereby bridging motivational inertia with cognitive-affective structuring. It maintains the dynamism of CTA but complements it with metrics that quantify alignment toward goals not only over time, but also within an emergent geometry of interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Scope and Focus: The Role of Telos Salience in Interaction Dynamics</head><p>Social interactions exhibit a wide spectrum of goal-directedness. Many encounters, such as collaborative work on a specific project (as illustrated in our case study), are characterized by a relatively strong, explicit, and often singular telos -a shared or individual objective that clearly orients the participants' efforts and affective investments. It is primarily within such high-telos contexts that the formal aspects of the "telotopic model of negentropic organization," particularly the calculation of affective vector alignment and telotopic negentropy, are most clearly demonstrable and analyzable. The salience of the telos provides a crucial reference point against which the directionality of affective forces and the resulting systemic order (negentropy) can be assessed.</p><p>To further clarify the concept of telos within our framework, we propose the following typology:</p><p>1. By explicitness:</p><p>o Explicit telos: Consciously acknowledged and verbally articulated (e.g., "Let's collaborate on this project") o Implicit telos: Unstated but behaviorally manifested (e.g., maintaining face in casual conversation)</p><p>2. By origin:</p><p>o Individual telos: Generated by a single actor and potentially imposed on others This typology helps explain how the model adapts to different interactional contexts. While high-telos interactions with explicit, shared goals offer the clearest demonstration of telotopic dynamics, even diffuse interactions involve at least minimal telic organization, often around face-preservation or social coherence as described by Goffman.</p><p>However, we acknowledge that numerous social interactions lack such a clearly defined, dominant objective. Consider casual conversations in transient settings (e.g., waiting rooms, public transport) or routine social acknowledgements. These low-telos interactions are often governed by more diffuse, implicit, multiple, or emergent goals. Such goals might include simply "passing the time," reducing mild social discomfort, engaging in minimal affiliation, or adhering to basic interactional norms like "saving face" or managing impressions, as famously analyzed by Goffman. While these interactions are certainly structured by affective dynamics, identifying a single, stable telos to serve as the primary anchor for vectorial analysis and negentropy calculation becomes significantly more complex.</p><p>Despite this difference in goal salience and structure, we posit that the fundamental Axiocognitive Principles outlined in Appendix B -namely, the inherent tendencies to minimize one's own negative affect (P1), maximize one's own positive affect (P2), and regulate the other's affect (P3, P4) -operate as universal drivers across all forms of social interaction. These principles guide basic affective regulation and behavioral orientation regardless of the strength or explicitness of a superordinate telos.</p><p>Therefore, while the foundational principles underpinning our model possess broad applicability, this article will concentrate its detailed exposition and illustration on high-telos interactions. This focus allows for a clearer and more rigorous demonstration of how affective forces, conceptualized as vectors, dynamically structure interaction and decision-making through the mechanisms of telotopic alignment and negentropic organization. The insights gained from these clearer cases may subsequently inform the analysis of more complex, low-telos scenarios, though such extensions fall outside the primary scope of the present work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Interaction as Affective Organization</head><p>Social interaction is not merely a sequence of verbal exchanges or norm-governed behaviors. It is, at its core, a dynamic field of emotional forces that continuously modulate the orientation, intensity, and stability of interpersonal conduct. Drawing on insights from Erving Goffman's dramaturgical sociology and integrating them into an axiodynamic framework, we propose that human interaction can be conceptualized as a process of affective organization-a self-regulating system structured around the management of emotional valence.</p><p>We identify four implicit affective-cognitive principles that guide interactional behavior:</p><p>1. Minimization of negative affect in oneself (e.g., preserving face, avoiding embarrassment);</p><p>2. Maximization of positive affect in oneself (e.g., feeling validated, respected);</p><p>3. Minimization of negative affect in the other (e.g., protecting the other's face, avoiding humiliation);</p><p>4. Maximization of positive affect in the other (e.g., offering reassurance, support, or recognition).</p><p>These principles do not operate as explicit decision rules but emerge situationally, according to the individual's personality traits (e.g., empathy, social competence) and the relational context (e.g., kinship, group affiliation, power asymmetries). They represent affectively grounded orientations, shaping not only the emotional tone of the interaction but also its structural configuration.</p><p>As argued by Damasio <ref type="bibr">(Damasio, Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain, 1994)</ref>, emotion plays a constitutive role in decision-making and the construction of meaning, rather than being a mere perturbation of rational thought. This view supports the premise that affective dynamics are not epiphenomenal but foundational to the self-organization of social behavior.</p><p>Goffman's analysis of face-work, deference rituals, and impression management can thus be reframed in axiodynamic terms: the maintenance of interactional order depends on the continuous alignment of affective vectors between participants. Each gesture, utterance, or silence contributes to this alignmentor misalignment-through the modulation of emotional signals and perceived intentions.</p><p>Importantly, these interactional processes exhibit properties of self-organization. Without centralized control or explicit consensus, individuals dynamically adjust their behavior in response to microaffective cues, generating stable patterns of conduct. This aligns with Morin's assertion that organization in complex systems arises not despite but through uncertainty, local fluctuations, and feedback loops.</p><p>Here, emotional cues function as organizing information, orienting the system toward low-entropy configurations-what we define as telotopic coherence.</p><p>In this view, the act of preserving one's own or another's face is not a mere norm-following behavior but a vectorial response to an implicit telos: to maintain a socially and emotionally sustainable interactional state. The rituals of apology, compliment, turn-taking, or disengagement are thus affective operators-mechanisms through which the system steers itself toward or away from conflict, embarrassment, or cohesion.</p><p>Understanding social interaction as an affective organization thus opens the way to a deeper formalization: one that treats emotions not as noise but as vectorial components of a system tending toward localized equilibrium.</p><p>This article adopts the axiodynamic framework to model affective-cognitive decision-making within social interactions. It relies on the assumption that a telos -a directional, affective objective -orients the behavior of the individuals involved.</p><p>In the case study presented here, the telos is not initially shared by all participants. Rather, one actor (A), who initiates the interaction, is motivated by a personal project and aims to bring the other actor (B) to adopt the same telos. This framework reflects asymmetrical real-world dynamics where one party drives the interaction based on a purpose that may or may not be embraced by the other.</p><p>As such, the model tracks how each actor's affective field evolves over time, revealing whether emotional convergence toward the telos takes place -and under what conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Information, Noise, and Negentropy in Interaction</head><p>In the classical theory of information, as developed by Shannon, the quantity of information is mathematically linked to entropy: more uncertainty in a signal means more information when the message is decoded correctly. However, this informational paradigm makes a crucial abstraction-it separates information from meaning, emotion, and organization. In contrast, Edgar Morin reintroduces complexity into the equation by distinguishing between information that is structuring and information that is merely syntactic or noisy. For Morin, the true value of information lies in its capacity to organize.</p><p>Within social interaction, this distinction is critical. Not all signals are equal: a glance may carry more organizational weight than a sentence, depending on context. Affective cues-tone of voice, microexpressions, posture-are not just data; they are meaningful attractors that help steer interaction toward or away from coherence. Here, information becomes functional when it reduces ambiguity, disambiguates intent, or modulates emotional climate.</p><p>But meaningful organization requires more than information alone. As Léon Brillouin emphasized, energy is required to transform information into negentropy-that is, into a reduction of disorder within the system. This insight, originally applied to thermodynamic systems, finds a compelling resonance in affective interaction. Participants in an emotionally complex exchange must often invest cognitive and emotional energy-attention, inhibition, empathy-to transform raw signals into a stable and organized pattern of interaction.</p><p>In this framework, negentropy in interaction refers to a local decrease in affective entropy-a reduction in the dispersion of emotional vectors that enables a coherent social episode to unfold. As individuals interpret and respond to each other's affective cues, they engage in a form of real-time sense-making, which aligns their behaviors and expectations toward a shared situational telos.</p><p>This interpretation enables a crucial reformulation of Brillouin's principle within the social domain:</p><p>Negentropy is the product of informational relevance and emotional investment.</p><p>From this perspective, the quality of an interaction cannot be evaluated solely in terms of task efficiency or message clarity, but also by its affective architecture-its ability to coordinate emotional energies in a meaningful, stable, and adaptive manner. The more coherent the alignment of affective forces toward the telos of the exchange (e.g., mutual respect, conflict resolution, social bonding), the lower the entropy and the higher the interactional negentropy.</p><p>Crucially, this negentropy is not a static trait but a dynamic state, continuously threatened by noise (misunderstanding, emotional ambivalence, asymmetrical expectations) and requiring ongoing effort to be sustained. In this way, social interaction appears not as a pre-structured field but as a self-organizing system, where the interplay of affect, information, and energy creates temporary pockets of order within a noisy and uncertain social environment.</p><p>Building on the dynamic interplay of affect, information, and energy, we now refine the quantification of telotopic negentropy to capture not only the emergence of order but also the directional competition within affective fields. This section clarifies the role of coherence and directionality, addressing the interplay between conative and inhibitory forces in structuring interaction.</p></div>

Social interactions often involve partial motivations, conflicting tendencies, or unstable trajectories of engagement. To better represent this complexity, we introduce a continuous vectorial framework that treats affective forces not as binary events but as gradable projections in a multidimensional emotional space. In the telotopic model, each affective force is represented as a vector 2 , defined by intensity, directional angle, and conative or inhibitory function. This transition allows the model to account for 2 A neurobiological foundation for vector-based modeling can be found in the work of Patricia S. Churchland, who distinguishes between local and distributed (vector) coding in neural systems. In this framework, a value or perceptual category is not represented by a single neuron but by a pattern of activation across a population of neurons, each tuned to different degrees of response. This vectorial representation supports the idea that emotional and axiological forces may likewise be structured as multidimensional response patterns within the brain. Churchland illustrates how "a three-element vector generates a three-dimensional space," and how complex perceptual qualities, such as flavors, occupy specific positions in a neural phase space. By analogy, our model conceives affective states as occupying distinct positions in a vector space, where ambivalence and partial alignments can be precisely represented through graded projections rather than binary activations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>From Angular Coherence to Affective Structure</head><p>The initial formulation of telotopic negentropy modeled affective coherence solely in terms of angular alignment, using the negated normalized Shannon entropy of the angular distribution. While this approach captured the geometric structure of the affective field, it did not adequately account for the motivational weight of emotional forces, particularly in cases where a few low-intensity but well-aligned vectors overshadowed a more intense but less coherent set. To address this limitation, the current model integrates both the intensity and the directional coherence of affective vectors, drawing on insights from affective neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Damasio, 1994)</ref> and behavioral economics <ref type="bibr">(Slovic et al., 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introducing a Dual Parameterization: Intensity and Alignment</head><p>Each affective group (conative or inhibitory) is characterized by two complementary variables.</p><p>Intensity ( ) refers to the normalized proportion of affective amplitude distributed across the two functional categories of vectors: conative ( ) and inhibitory ( ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clarification on the Use of Cosine in the Model</head><p>In our model, the cosine function plays two distinct roles:</p><p>• cos( i ) is used exclusively for the initial classification of affective vectors: a vector is classified as conative (Fc) if cos( i ) ≥ 0, and as inhibitory ( Fi ) if cos( i ) &lt; 0. This binary rule preserves the directional polarity of vectors relative to the telos.</p><p>• cos 2 ( ) is used in all subsequent calculations of alignment, coherence, and negentropy. It provides a continuous, non-negative measure of directional proximity to a reference axis ( 0 ∘ for Fc, 180 ∘ for Fi ), ranging from 0 (maximal deviation) to 1 (perfect alignment).</p><p>This dual usage maintains conceptual clarity: the sign of cos( i ) determines whether a force supports or resists the telos, while cos 2 ( i ) quantifies how coherently it does so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alignment (A):</head><p>The average directional alignment of vectors in each group is computed as the -weighted mean of a squared cosine function that measures the angular deviation from the group's reference pole:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= ∑ ∈ ⋅ cos 2 ( ) ∑ ∈ ; = ∑ ∈ ⋅ cos 2 ( − 180 ∘ ) ∑ ∈</formula><p>Each affective vector -in the conative set or in the inhibitory set -combines a contextual intensity ( ) and a directional angle ( ) relative to its telic reference.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Modeling</head><p>This revised framework offers several advantages:</p><p>• It prevents artificially low negentropy values in situations where emotional intensity is dominant but structurally disorganized, ensuring that the model reflects the motivational realism of affective dynamics.</p><p>• It allows for context-sensitive modulation: can be adjusted depending on the nature of the decision (e.g., deliberative vs. impulsive, individual vs. collective), as discussed in 7.2 -Telotopic Negentropy.</p><p>• It bridges the subjective phenomenology of emotional force with a formalizable vector model, maintaining the rigor of entropy-based computation while aligning with neurocognitive insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formulation: Bifurcated Negentropy</head><p>To disentangle directionality and coherence, we define separate negentropy measures for conative and inhibitory forces, subsequently integrating them into a net telotopic negentropy score. The affective field is partitioned based on the orientation of the vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">• Conative forces (Fc): ∈ [0 ∘ , 90 ∘ ), i.e., cos( ) ≥ 0, • Inhibitory forces (Fi): ∈ [90 ∘ , 180 ∘ ], i.e., cos( ) &lt; 0.</formula><p>For each subset, we compute negentropy as a weighted measure of intensity and alignment, and respectively measure the coherence of conative and inhibitory forces, calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">= + (1 − ) , = + (1 − )</formula><p>Here:</p><p>• and normalize the intensity of each subset, ensuring that + = 1,</p><p>• and range from 0 to 1 , with higher values indicating greater directional coherence relative to each subset's reference pole: 0 ∘ for Fc (aligned with the telos), and 180 ∘ for Fi (aligned against the telos),</p><p>• The resulting and are bounded between 0 and 1, reflecting the degree of affective coherence within each subset.</p><p>The net telotopic negentropy is then defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">tel = −</formula><p>This differential metric ranges from -1 to +1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">• tel = 1 : Perfect conative coherence ( = 1, = 0), • tel = −1 : Perfect inhibitory coherence ( = 0, = 1),</formula><p>• tel = 0 : Either balanced competition between Fc and Fi or affective ambivalence.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">• Since , , , ∈ [0,1] and ∈ [0,1], then , ∈ [0,1], ensuring that tel ∈ [−1, +1].</formula><p>A negative tel value, where tel &lt; 0, indicates a dominance of inhibitory forces over conative ones, reflecting a coherent opposition to the telos. This scenario might arise in situations where fear, resistance, or external constraints overpower motivational drives, such as an actor facing significant social pressure to withdraw from a collaborative goal, or in collective dynamics where a group converges on avoidance behaviors (e.g., risk aversion in decision-making). For instance, if Actor B in Phase 1 (Section 10) had exhibited stronger inhibitory coherence-say, with ≈ 0.9 due to heightened caution and fear of overcommitment-the resulting could exceed , yielding a negative tel . Such a result would signal not mere ambivalence, but a structured resistance to the telos, highlighting the model's capacity to capture the full spectrum of affective dynamics, from mobilization to opposition, within a single metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretive Advantages</head><p>This formulation explicitly encodes the polarity of affective forces, resolving the conceptual tension between mobilization and resistance. A high reflects a structured mobilization toward the telos, while a high indicates coherent opposition-both representing forms of emotional order, yet with opposing functional implications. For example, in the case of Actor B in Phase 1 (Section 10), a balanced = 0.500 and = 0.500 with a modest tel = 0.148 reveals an ambivalent affective field, where collaborative impulses are tempered by cautious restraint.</p><p>Moreover, the use of cos 2 ( ) ensures that vectors with greater alignment exert a disproportionate influence on coherence, aligning the model with phenomenological accounts of emotional salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Damasio, 1994)</ref>. This avoids overemphasizing minor vectors and provides a robust measure of the field's structural organization, particularly in the unidimensional context of the current study.</p></div>

Unlike traditional entropy measures that prioritize disorder, this formulation foregrounds the emergence of coherence, consistent with Brillouin's insight <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brillouin, 1959)</ref> that negentropy reflects the energy invested in structuring a system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operational Considerations</head><p>In practice, tel is computed from empirically derived vectors, as illustrated in the case study (Section 10). Angles are assigned based on the typology in Appendix A, while intensities reflect the emotional strength of each affective component, typically on a scale from 0 to 5 . For configurations with no Fc or Fi vectors, the respective negentropy term is set to zero, ensuring computational stability. While the current unidimensional approach suffices for capturing telotopic alignment in dyadic interactions, future extensions may incorporate multidimensional coherence, as discussed in Section 7.4 and Appendix C , potentially requiring a shift to cos( ) to preserve directional information in higherdimensional spaces.</p><p>In practical applications of the model, vectors are first classified using cos( ) to determine their conative or inhibitory nature. Subsequently, all coherence calculations utilize cos 2 ( ) to focus on structural alignment within each category.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Interactional Analysis</head><p>The revised tel metric enhances the telotopic model's diagnostic power.

This dual focus enables a nuanced analysis of how actors negotiate alignment over time, as demonstrated in the evolving affective fields of Actors and (Section 10). By clarifying the role of directionality and coherence, this formulation lays a foundation for both theoretical refinement and empirical application, aligning mathematical precision with the lived complexity of social telotopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.1">Clarification on Negentropy Formulations</head><p>While the present section has introduced two distinct formulations of telotopic negentropy-the composite measure = + <ref type="bibr">(1 − )</ref> and the bifurcated measure</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">tel = −</formula><p>-it is important to clarify their respective roles within the overall axiodynamic model.</p><p>The composite formula provides a foundational understanding of affective coherence by integrating emotional intensity (I) and directional alignment ( ) into a single scalar metric. It offers a phenomenologically intuitive representation of how emotional salience and angular consistency contribute jointly to the organization of an affective field. This formulation is conceptually valuable for illustrating the dual poles of motivation-urgency and coherence-that underpin affective behavior in telotopically structured contexts.</p><p>However, for empirical analysis and interactional diagnostics, the bifurcated formulation offers significant advantages and will serve as the primary operational measure of telotopic negentropy throughout the remainder of the article. This preference is grounded in the following considerations:</p><p>• Preservation of directionality: By maintaining a strict separation between conative ( Fc ) and inhibitory (Fi) forces, the tel formulation retains the essential polarity of motivated behaviornamely, the distinction between approach and avoidance tendencies. This directional specificity would be flattened in a single aggregate score, potentially obscuring critical asymmetries in emotional orientation.</p><p>• Empirical accuracy: In real-world interactions, the structural coherence of motivational opposition is often as significant as the coherence of alignment. A highly organized resistance to a telos (e.g., coherent refusal, collective avoidance) constitutes a meaningful affective structure. The composite formula would assign similar negentropy values to both approach and avoidance configurations, failing to distinguish between opposed forms of coherence.</p><p>• Dynamic sensitivity: The differential structure of tel enables fine-grained tracking of affective transitions across time. It captures ambivalence, conflict, and convergence by evaluating the shifting balance between Fc and Fi at each phase of interaction. This renders it particularly effective for diachronic modeling of alignment processes, as developed in the case studies of Section 10.</p><p>For these reasons, the tel metric will be systematically employed in all empirical computations and interpretive analyses that follow. Unless otherwise specified, the expression telotopic negentropy in subsequent sections refers explicitly to tel = − as defined in Section 7.2. This formulation supports the central thesis of the model: that affective order is not only a function of emotional coherence, but also of the directional competition between antagonistic motivational forces within a telos-oriented field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Theoretical Foundations and Analytical Implications of the Bifurcated Model</head><p>The adoption of the bifurcated formulation of telotopic negentropy rests on both its theoretical consonance with systemic models of organization and its operational utility for empirical interactional analysis. This section consolidates the underlying conceptual rationale and the pragmatic advantages that support the model's implementation across affective fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a) Systemic Foundations of Bifurcated Negentropy</head><p>The bifurcated approach, which explicitly distinguishes between conative ( Fc ) and inhibitory ( Fi ) coherence, resonates with several foundational insights from systems theory and affective neuroscience.</p><p>• It aligns with Edgar Morin's view that order in complex systems <ref type="bibr">(Morin, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr">(Morin, -2004</ref> arises not from the elimination of contradiction but from its structured modulation. The negentropic organization of affective fields emerges precisely through the dynamic resolution of competing vectors-a dialectical process rather than a unidirectional convergence.</p><p>• It echoes Léon Brillouin's conception of negentropy as the energetic cost of structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brillouin, 1959)</ref>, emphasizing that the organization of an emotional field is not a passive equilibrium but the result of invested effort. Telotopic coherence, in this light, is the trace of emotional energy shaped into a functional orientation.</p><p>• It mirrors the approach/avoidance dichotomy identified in affective neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Singer &amp; Lamm, 2009)</ref>, which shows that opposing motivational systems-linked to distinct neural pathways-operate in tension to regulate behavior. The separation of Fc and Fi preserves this antagonistic structure and enables the model to capture the cognitive-affective dynamics of motivation with greater fidelity.</p><p>By foregrounding the polarity of affective forces, the bifurcated model rejects the assumption that coherence is necessarily unidirectional. Instead, it acknowledges that resistance and alignment may both exhibit internal structure, and that their interplay defines the affective topology of social interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b) Affective Polarity as Diagnostic Principle</head><p>One of the principal merits of the tel formulation is its ability to represent coherence not merely as convergence, but as a functional differentiation between emotionally structured approach and emotionally structured resistance. This makes it possible to detect states of organized ambivalence, in which both Fc and Fi exhibit high internal coherence but remain antagonistic in orientation.</p><p>This feature is critical in modeling real-world interactions, where conflict, hesitation, or conditional engagement are frequent. A single composite index would conceal such configurations, offering a deceptively neutral score that masks the underlying motivational dynamics. The bifurcated metric, by contrast, renders opposition legible without conflating it with disorganization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c) Operational Utility in Dynamic Interaction</head><p>Beyond its theoretical rigor, the bifurcated model provides multiple advantages for the operationalization of affective analysis:</p><p>Edge case robustness: In configurations where only one type of force (Fc or Fi) is active, the model yields a clean representation (with or set to zero), avoiding ambiguous normalizations or residual scores.</p><p>• Comparability across contexts: Since the negentropy of each vector group is normalized within its own functional category, tel remains interpretable across different phases, actors, or emotional intensities. This supports longitudinal analyses as well as comparative interactional diagnostics.</p><p>• Linkage to observable behavior: The Fc/Fi balance often maps directly onto concrete behavioral indices -engagement, hesitation, withdrawal-allowing the model to bridge formal computation and empirical observation without speculative intermediaries.</p><p>These properties make the bifurcated model not only conceptually sound but empirically tractable, offering a framework that accommodates the complexity of interaction without sacrificing analytical precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>d) Conclusion: Coherence through Opposition</head><p>By integrating theoretical insight and operational robustness, the bifurcated formulation reinforces the model's central thesis: that affective order arises not solely from emotional alignment, but from the dynamic interplay of antagonistic motivational forces within a telos-oriented field. In doing so, it enables a more faithful representation of affective decision-making as it unfolds in real time-structured not by consensus alone, but by the tension between attraction and inhibition, commitment and resistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>e) Structural Negentropy and the Latency of Axiotypic 3 Order</head><p>Beyond the interaction-specific coherence captured by telotopic negentropy, the model distinguishes a second form of affective order: structural negentropy ( ). This metric quantifies the internal consistency of an individual's axiotype-the affectively encoded configuration of values and mémotions stored in long-term memory.</p><p>Whereas tel reflects the current alignment of affective forces with a situational telos, measures the degree of internal organization independently of any external objective. It is computed by analyzing the dispersion of vectors within the axiotype itself, relative to its own mean directional axis.</p><p>This latent coherence plays a crucial role in understanding long-term ideological stability, identity resilience, and the predisposition to alignment or resistance in interactional contexts. A high indicates a tightly organized value system, resistant to incoherence or manipulation. Conversely, a low suggests internal ambivalence, ideological fragmentation, or susceptibility to contradictory influences.</p><p>The distinction between tel and thus mirrors the dual architecture of affective systems: one directed toward situational mobilization, the other toward identity-based stability. Together, they provide a comprehensive framework for modeling both the dynamic and the dispositional aspects of affective behavior.</p></div>

Social interaction is not simply governed by rules or scripts; it emerges, stabilizes, and transforms through the dynamic alignment of emotional vectors-often in the absence of conscious intention or explicit coordination. This spontaneous structuring of affective dynamics constitutes what we define as social telotopy.</p><p>This regulatory process echoes findings in social neuroscience, where empathic alignment and shared affective states are shown to foster cooperation and emotional convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Singer &amp; Lamm, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Telotopy as an Emergent Emotional Geometry</head><p>The term telotopy refers to the situational configuration of affective forces in relation to an implicit or explicit goal (telos). Unlike static behavioral models, a telotopic approach assumes that every social episode involves an evolving vector field, with emotional orientations continuously re-adjusted in response to the perceived trajectory of the interaction. This emotional geometry is not arbitrary. It tends toward local minima of affective dispersion-moments of alignment, agreement, or mutual recognition-interspersed with fluctuations caused by ambivalence, misunderstanding, or divergent motivations. The interactional telos may be as simple as maintaining face, preserving harmony, or achieving task-related coordination, but its affective realization depends on the ability of the participants to channel emotional vectors in convergent directions.</p><p>In this sense, telotopic self-organization mirrors the dynamics observed in other complex adaptive systems. Just as molecules align into structures under certain energetic constraints, or neurons synchronize their firing in response to input coherence, human actors in a shared space adjust their expressive and receptive behavior to stabilize the social field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Affect as a Vectorial Operator</head><p>What distinguishes social telotopy from purely mechanical systems is the emotional valence of its organizing forces. Affect is not a passive byproduct-it is the operator that modulates attention, relevance, responsiveness, and mutual orientation. Each emotional cue, from micro-expressions to tone modulation, functions as a vectorial signal: it either amplifies telotopic coherence or introduces entropic drift.</p><p>This framing helps reinterpret traditional social phenomena. Rituals of politeness, apologies, eye contact, and disengagement no longer appear as superficial formalities but as telotopically active mechanisms that serve to (re)align the field. Conversely, conflict, awkward silences, or misread cues are moments of affective decoherence, in which telotopic structure collapses and must be repaired through renewed emotional investment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Social Negentropy and the Temporality of Order</head><p>Importantly, telotopic negentropy is not a fixed trait of a system but a temporally situated condition. Like all forms of organization in open systems, it is transient and requires constant maintenance. Emotional alignment is always threatened by noise-misinterpretations, shifting priorities, external disruptions-and must be actively sustained through affective modulation.</p><p>This temporality implies that telotopic organization is processual, not static. It unfolds moment by moment, with each gesture contributing to or detracting from the system's coherence. The presence of sustained telotopic negentropy over time (e.g., in long-term relationships, cohesive teams, or ritualized encounters) may thus be seen as a marker of emergent affective order-the lived experience of social intelligibility and mutual orientation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Discussion and Future Directions</head><p>The telotopic framework introduced in this paper offers a novel way to conceptualize social interaction-not as a series of discrete acts or norm-driven sequences, but as a dynamic field of emotionally oriented forces. By integrating concepts from affective science, information theory, and complexity theory, we have outlined a model in which emotional alignment serves as the basis for interactional order, and where telotopic negentropy provides a metric for its internal coherence.</p><p>This approach yields several important theoretical implications:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1">Rethinking Emotion in Interaction</head><p>Traditional views often treat emotion as disruptive or secondary to rational or rule-based interaction. In contrast, the telotopic model elevates affect to the status of a structural operator, essential for stabilizing and modulating social behavior. Emotions are no longer residuals of cognitive processes but organizational forces, whose directional coherence determines the viability of interactional sequences.</p><p>This opens new avenues for reinterpreting well-known social phenomena. Face preservation, ritual politeness, and conversational turn-taking are not merely behavioral conventions but affectively loaded strategies for maintaining telotopic integrity. Social breakdowns (e.g., embarrassment, tension, disengagement) correspond to failures of affective alignment, which may be analyzed in terms of rising entropy within the emotional field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2">Empirical Opportunities</head><p>The telotopic model invites empirical exploration, particularly in the realm of micro-interactional analysis. Several methodologies could be mobilized to test and refine the model's predictions:</p><p>• Eye-tracking and micro-expression analysis could help detect vectorial misalignment in realtime interactions.</p><p>• EEG or fMRI data could be used to examine the neurophysiological correlates of affective convergence and decoherence.</p><p>• Conversational analysis could measure fluctuations in emotional synchrony and their effects on interaction outcomes.</p><p>The concept of telotopic negentropy is particularly well-suited to computational modeling and simulation, including agent-based models where artificial agents adjust their behavior based on vectorial affective fields. Such simulations could help explore emergent patterns of group cohesion, conflict, or polarization in response to varying affective parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3">Toward a Thermodynamics of Social Behavior</head><p>More speculatively, this framework suggests the contours of a thermodynamics of social interaction, in which emotional energy, informational structure, and entropic regulation interact to produce temporary pockets of social order. Inspired by Morin's vision of self-organizing systems, such a theory would:</p><p>• Treat interaction as an open system exposed to affective noise and informational flux;</p><p>• Model coherence not as equilibrium but as dynamic alignment toward shifting teloi;</p><p>• Recognize the energy cost of maintaining low-entropy affective states, echoing Brillouin's view that "negentropy is paid for in energy."</p><p>This perspective opens promising intersections with embodied cognition, enactive theories of meaning, and political psychology, particularly in modeling collective affective fields (e.g., crowds, social movements, digital swarms) and their fragility or resilience under stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.4">Falsifiability and Scientific Testability</head><p>In line with Popper's criterion of scientific validity, a model must offer testable predictions that can be refuted by empirical observation. The axiodynamic model of telotopic negentropy satisfies this criterion by positing specific relationships between affective vector coherence and the likelihood of behavioral alignment toward a telos.</p><p>The model predicts that high telotopic negentropy-defined as strong directional alignment of affective vectors-should correlate with increased probability of coordinated action, reduced hesitation, and convergence in verbal and nonverbal behaviors among participants. This prediction is falsifiable in at least three ways:</p><p>1. If individuals exhibit high affective coherence toward a shared telos but consistently fail to act, the model's predictive power is undermined.</p><p>2. If dispersed, incoherent affective fields (high entropy) nonetheless result in coordinated or purposive behavior, the assumption that telotopic coherence is necessary for alignment becomes questionable.</p><p>3. If empirical data reveal that telotopic alignment follows rather than precedes behavioral convergence (i.e., post-hoc rationalization), then the model's causal assumptions require revision.</p><p>These scenarios provide clear avenues for empirical testing. Behavioral experiments, discourse analysis, and psychophysiological monitoring (e.g., galvanic response, EEG, facial coding) can be used to operationalize affective vector alignment and assess whether behavioral convergence emerges under conditions of low or high negentropy. By articulating falsifiable predictions and outlining empirical conditions under which they may fail, the axiodynamic framework aligns with the core principles of scientific modeling.</p></div>

The case study that follows in Section 10 illustrates how the abstract concepts of telotopic negentropy, conative and inhibitory forces, and affective alignment manifest in an everyday professional context.</p><p>This case study was specifically selected for three reasons:</p><p>1. Representational clarity: The professional collaboration scenario features a clearly identifiable telos (a joint project with defined goals), making the directional aspects of affective vectors easier to isolate and analyze.</p><p>2. Interactional complexity: Despite its clearly defined objective, the interaction exhibits rich emotional dynamics-initial asymmetry of commitment, gradual convergence, and residual ambivalence-that showcase the model's capacity to capture nuanced affective trajectories.</p><p>3. Practical relevance: The scenario represents a common class of interactions where affective alignment often determines outcomes more powerfully than logical or informational factors alone.</p><p>Through this case study, abstract variables like NFc, NFi, and τ become grounded in -observable patterns of engagement, hesitation, and relational calibration.

The negentropy values calculated in each phase reflect not only the directional coherence of affective vectors but also their alignment with core axiotypic imperatives: minimizing negative affect (P1, P3) and maximizing positive affect (P2, P4) for self and other. These value-cognitive principles can be understood as fundamental drivers observed across a wide range of cultural contexts.</p><p>These principles provide an interpretive lens through which the meaning of each value of can be assessed -not merely as a numerical index of structural order, but as a reflection of affective congruence with internal and intersubjective motivations.

This coefficient integrates both directional orientation and axiotypic valence, ensuring that each reflects not only geometric convergence but also value-based congruence with the telos.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1">Key Conceptual Distinctions</head><p>The axiodynamic model relies on a distinction between two types of affective magnitudes: VI and , each serving a specific function within the interplay of memory, motivation, and interaction. VI (for "Valence and Intensity") is a scalar value ranging from -5 to +5 , encoding the directional valence (positive or negative) and the memorized intensity of a value or mémotion within an individual's axiotype. A positive VI reflects a favorable orientation toward a class of situations or meanings, while a negative VI denotes a deep-seated aversion. As such, VI is a long-term affective trace -stable, context-independent, and not intrinsically oriented toward any particular telos. It expresses how an individual is predisposed to respond, but not how they are currently acting or feeling.</p><p>In contrast, (phi) refers to the situational intensity of an affective vector-either conative ( Fc ) or inhibitory ( Fi )-mobilized during a specific interaction, or triggered by an introspective idea arising endogenously within the psyche. is always positive by definition, and its role as Fc or Fi depends on its functional classification and angular alignment with the current telos. In essence, is the expression of dynamic, moment-to-moment affective activation, instantiated from the deeper axiotypic layer in response to immediate motivational constraints.</p><p>In short, VI is stable and axiotypic; is contextual and telotopically instantiated. This distinction is critical for understanding how long-term values and momentary emotional dynamics co-structure decision-making and alignment behaviors in social and cognitive systems.</p></div>

Actor B enters the exchange without a pre-aligned telos and must evaluate the relevance, desirability, and emotional valence of the request based on their own axiotype.</p><p>Each phase of interaction is modeled through a vectorial configuration of affective forces, categorized as conative (oriented toward the telos) or inhibitory (oriented away from it). These affective vectors are derived from previously encoded value-memories (mémotions) that are momentarily activated in the interactional context. In what follows, each phase is fully described in narrative, vectorial, and computational terms. The progression illustrates how affective alignment evolves over time, shaping the emergence -or failure of shared directionality.</p><p>Readers seeking a detailed explanation of the variables used in these computations-such as directional weighting, entropy scores, and telotopic dispersion-may refer to Appendix D, which provides a stepby-step overview of an alternative entropy-based telotopic framework-distinct from the bifurcated formulation used in empirical modeling-which illustrates key concepts using Actor A's Phase 1 as a pedagogical example.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation</head><p>Actor A's affective field exhibits a dominantly conative structure, characterized by both high intensity and strong alignment with the telos. The two conative vectors (Trust and Need for Support) yield a combined projection of 8.542 , while inhibitory forces contribute only 1.732 , resulting in a net conative force τ = 6.81. This value reflects a decisive emotional momentum toward engagement, significantly above the minimal thresholds typically observed in ambivalent or neutral interactions.</p><p>The net telotopic negentropy is tel = 0.501 , situated well above the midpoint of the theoretical range [ <ref type="bibr">−1, +1]</ref>. This indicates that, beyond sheer emotional energy, the actor's affective field maintains a coherent orientation with respect to the telos. The system is not only emotionally mobilized, but also structurally convergent.</p><p>From a neurocognitive perspective <ref type="bibr">(Damasio, Haidt)</ref>, this configuration exemplifies a decision state led by affective coherence, rather than by logical deliberation. The high intensity score = 0.811, approaching the maximum of 1.0 , confirms the emotional salience of the situation. Although some angular dispersion is present (with an alignment score = 0.987 ), its influence is modulated by the weighting parameter 5 = 0.7, which explicitly prioritizes affective intensity over directional precision in our model. This weighting is grounded in findings from affective neuroscience: decisions tend to be driven primarily by the force of emotion, with cognitive alignment playing a secondary organizing role. The resulting positive net negentropy thus reflects not only a push toward action, but also a structurally organized emotional field, capable of sustaining engagement. The vector field of Actor A in Phase 1 reveals a dominant conative orientation toward the proposed telos. Two primary vectors-Trust and Need for Support-exhibit both high intensity ( = 5.0 and 3.6) and strong directional alignment (angles of 2 ∘ and 10 ∘ , respectively), producing a field with high directional coherence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1">Temporal Dynamics of Affective Alignment</head><p>The figure below displays the evolution of telotopic negentropy for both actors over the four phases of the interaction (from initiation to resolution). Actor A, who projects the initial telos, maintains relatively high negentropy throughout, with a peak at the final phase. Actor B shows a more gradual trajectory, with lower initial coherence and progressive convergence toward A's emotional alignment. The differentiated curves illustrate the asymmetry of affective commitment and the evolving mutual calibration process, captured quantitatively through the vectorial model. This diachronic analysis highlights how negentropy serves as a dynamic indicator of internal organization and emotional readiness for decision. This article has introduced a vectorial model of affective decision-making grounded in the dynamic interplay between telos, axiotype, and affective forces. By formalizing the concept of telotopic negentropy, the model offers a novel way to quantify the directional coherence of conative and inhibitory vectors within a given interaction. It complements this structural coherence metric with a scalar expression of Net Conative Force ( τ ), defined as the net projection of affective intensities along the telos axis.</p><p>While τ provides a direct measure of motivational balance, N_tel captures the organizational quality of the affective system, enabling fine-grained distinctions between coherent engagement and unstable ambivalence-even when total affective energy remains constant. To further support this analysis, the model integrates an entropy-based coherence metric (N_struc), derived from Shannon's information theory, as a theoretical extension for assessing internal angular dispersion.</p><p>The revised projection method based on the axiological alignment coefficient ( ), modulated by , ensures interpretative consistency across edge cases-from perfect alignment to full opposition. This formulation supports a more robust mapping of affective orientation within the interaction space. Together, these contributions establish the basis for a testable theory of affective structuration in social behavior-one that links value-driven emotion to the geometry of decision fields. Beyond the illustrative case study, the model opens the way for broader applications in conflict resolution, collective alignment analysis, and agent-based simulations.</p><p>The core contribution of this article lies in the formalization of telotopic negentropy (Ntel) as a vectorial measure of affective coherence oriented toward a telos. Among the various metrics introduced (Ntel, , , Nstruc , , Pc ), it is essential to distinguish their operational roles:</p><p>• Ntel and constitute the central tools for modeling situated alignment and motivational force;</p><p>• NH and Nstruc serve as complementary measures of dispersion and long-term axiotype coherence, respectively;</p><p>• and its derived angle projection (Appendix E) outline a future path for empirically deriving affective vectors;</p><p>• Pc , as a coherence ratio, can be used for comparative analysis across agents or contexts.</p><p>The case study presented here illustrates the model's internal logic, based on interpretively assigned parameters. A full empirical validation-deriving values from the coefficient, calibrating across interaction types, and comparing observed vs. predicted shifts in alignment-remains a priority for future research. This theoretical and methodological foundation nonetheless provides a coherent framework for understanding how affective energy is structured and oriented within social interaction.</p><p>12 Appendix A -Angle Assignment Grid: Typology for Affective Vector Orientation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.1">Purpose and Scope</head><p>This section introduces a geometrical method for assigning directional angles ∈ [0 ∘ , 180 ∘ ] to affective forces ( Fc and Fi ) in the context of social interaction. It is part of the telotopic model of affective alignment, in which emotional vectors are evaluated based on their orientation relative to a shared telos (goal).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Important:</head><p>This method addresses only the direction of affective vectors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>On the Geometrical Classification of Fc and Fi Vectors</head><p>In the axiodynamic model, affective forces are projected from emotionally encoded values in relation to a situational telos. While the initial introduction of the model includes a pedagogical expression of directional coherence via scalar product:</p><p>Coh( , ) = val( ) ⋅ cos( ) this is intended as an intuitive formulation linking affective polarity and directional alignment. For all operational purposes, however, a unified geometrical convention is adopted: each vector's classification as conative ( Fc ) or inhibitory ( Fi ) is based solely on the sign of the cosine of its angular deviation i from the telos vector. This corresponds to the following angular rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">{ Fc if ∈ [0 ∘ , 90 ∘ ] ⇒ cos( ) ≥ 0 Fi if ∈ (90 ∘ , 180 ∘ ] ⇒ cos( ) &lt; 0</formula><p>This criterion is both computationally efficient and theoretically robust. It ensures consistency across the various formulations of alignment, net conative force ( Φ − ), and telotopic negentropy. No angular inversion (e.g., using 180 ∘ − i ) is necessary, as all measures of projection and dispersion derive directly from the signed cosine. • A highly aligned but low-intensity force contributes little to the system's negentropy.</p></div>

These variables are derived from the affective vector field and used to compute an entropy-based measure of telotopic coherence. The goal is to capture both the direction and intensity of affective forces as they relate to the telos-the implicit goal structuring the interaction.</p><p>This appendix illustrates how the distribution of affective intensities across directional categories contributes to an information-theoretic representation of emotional organization. The entropy-based formulation presented here (denoted as ) is conceptually distinct from the bifurcated negentropy metric tel = − used in the main empirical analysis (Sections 7.2 and 10).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Force ( )</head><p>Each affective vector is assigned an intensity value i , representing the psychological magnitude of the associated motivational force (conative or inhibitory).

Raw values are typically recorded on a 0-to-5 scale and then normalized by dividing by 5, yielding a final value in the [0,1] range. This ensures consistency in all computations. These normalized values are then used in the computation of telotopic negentropy.</p></div>

It captures the directional congruence between the affective force and the telic axis of the interaction.</p><p>• A small angle (e.g., ≈ 10 ∘ ) indicates that the affective force is strongly aligned with the telos and thus contributes positively to goal-directed motivation (a conative orientation).</p><p>• A large angle (e.g., ≈ 175 ∘ ) signals a strong opposition to the telos, implying inhibition, resistance, or avoidance (an inhibitory orientation).</p><p>• Intermediate angles (around 90 ∘ ) often reflect ambivalence, hesitation, or emotional irrelevance to the goal.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>• Trust: = 10 ∘ → strong telic alignment (motivational drive)</p><p>• Fear of refusal: = 175 ∘ → near-complete opposition (inhibitory block)</p><p>Although the angle is expressed in degrees, its cosine-written as cos( )-is a dimensionless number between -1 and +1 .

The same affect may change its influence over time as contexts evolve 3. Ambivalence in decision-making often arises from misalignment between emotional orientation and axiological values.</p><p>This formalization transforms the theoretical constructs presented in the main article into operationalizable variables, enabling empirical testing of predictions derived from an optional sigmoidbased extension of conative and inhibitory forces (see Section 8.6).</p><p>Affect: A neurocognitive process involving emotional valence, intensity, and orientation, which influences both perception and decision-making. In the telotopic model, affect is vectorial and situationally projected.</p><p>Affective Force: Affective Force: A directional activation of a value or mémotion under the influence of a telos. It may be conative (Fc) when it supports the telos, or inhibitory (Fi) when it opposes it.</p><p>Ideally, such forces should be quantified through rigorous laboratory methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using controlled stimuli (e.g., film excerpts or video games) designed to elicit specific psychological states across multiple participants under standardized conditions.</p><p>In practice, affective forces may also be inferred from behavioral cues (verbal expressions, body language, micro-expressions) or self-reported emotions, although these approaches are more subjective and less replicable.</p><p>For instance, in a collaborative discussion, curiosity could be indexed by increased frontal asymmetry in EEG (a marker of approach motivation), while fear of conflict might be detected through heightened amygdala activity or elevated self-reported anxiety.</p><p>Note: The protocols mentioned (e.g., EEG, fMRI, behavioral coding) are theoretical suggestions for future empirical applications.

It is composed of memorized emotional imprints ( ), each represented as a signed scalar in the interval [−5, +5], encoding both valence and mnemonic intensity. The axiotype serves as a memory-based substrate from which telotopic configurations emerge. It conditions how affective vectors are selected, weighted, and oriented within social interactions. While captures context-sensitive activations, the axiotype defines the enduring motivational architecture that supports emotional projection, resistance, or alignment toward a telos.</p></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">The term "telotopic" derives from "telos" (goal) and "topos" (place or orientation). "Telotopy" refers to the dynamic alignment of affective forces with respect to a goal-oriented telos. It differs from mere structural coherence by emphasizing directional convergence: how affective vectors-motivated by values or mémotions-orient themselves toward a situational objective. Telotopic coherence thus quantifies the degree to which an individual's or a group's emotional energies are organized toward a shared goal, making it a key indicator of readiness for action or collective mobilization.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">. Contextual ambivalence: Some affects oscillate between conative and inhibitory roles depending on circumstances</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">For a formal development of the axiotype as a modeling construct, see(Kleden, Beyond Rational Choice : Modeling Political Behavior  Through Axiological Distance and Emotional Dynamics, 2025).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">This entropy-based formulation is thus notated ent to distinguish it from the primary vectorial formulation tel , though both capture complementary aspects of telotopic coherence.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">We use = 0.7 as an initial approximation, in line with the observations of (Damasio, Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain, 1994) and<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Slovic, Finucane, Peters, &amp; MacGregor, 2007)</ref>. However, experimental calibration is necessary to validate this value.</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">While some affective models, such as those inspired bySlovic et al. (2002), describe emotional evaluations as the combination of valence and intensity, they typically do so in a qualitative or heuristic manner. These models do not propose a validated mathematical formulation in which affect is computed as a strict product of valence × intensity. In contrast, the present framework defines VIᵢ as a scalar mnemonic</note>

Typically defined as cos( ). τ (tau) -Telos as Affective Attractor: The telos ( ) refers to an emotionally salient goal, value, or orientation that functions as an attractor within the affective-cognitive field. It may be endogenously generated by the subject -emerging from memory, desire, or anticipatory processes -or arise from interactional dynamics involving shared intentions, implicit norms, or situational expectations. The telos dynamically organizes affective forces by polarizing conative and inhibitory vectors along a common directional axis. As a context-sensitive structure, it may be implicit or explicit, shared or contested, but always functions as the vectorial reference that guides conative modulation and affective alignment. Crucially, the telos is not a fixed endpoint but an emergent attractor: it shapes the telotopic configuration and activates latent axiotypic tendencies toward or away from engagement. In formulaic terms, the telos is treated as a unit direction vector when used in angular computations (e.g., cos( ) = ⋅ ‖ ‖ ). While standard mathematical notation would use a circumflex accent ( ˆ ) to denote unit vectors, we maintain the simplified notation throughout for readability, with the understanding that its norm is 1 in such contexts.</p><p>Telotopic Configuration: A momentary affective and cognitive structure formed when values stored in long-term memory are projected in response to a telos.

In axiodynamic modeling, it refers to the alignment of affective vectors with a specific telos, distinguishing it from structural coherence (which concerns internal axiotypic stability). Telotopy is thus a dynamic and contextsensitive measure of emotional mobilization potential.</p></div>
