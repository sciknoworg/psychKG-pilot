			<abstract>
				<p>Background: Many decisions involve uncertainty. Consequently, intolerance of uncertainty (IU)-a dispositional aversion to uncertainty-may interfere with decision making and cause indecisiveness-a chronic inability to make decisions. Problematic decision-related safety behaviors may play a role in this. However, previous studies have not conclusively established this link. Therefore, this research tests whether IU is associated with safety behavior, operationalized with a novel measure, and whether indecisiveness mediates this relationship. Methods: Across four studies (total N = 944), participants reported their IU and imagined a decision scenario. They rated the extent to which their response to this decision aligned with features of safety behaviors. Study 1 examined the validity of these safety behavior ratings by comparing ratings of a maladaptive &quot;safety behavior-like&quot; response to a decision vs an adaptive response. In Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, indecisiveness was also assessed. Additionally, decision importance was experimentally varied to evaluate whether more important decisions would amplify the IU-safety behavior association. Results: Study 1 confirmed the validity of the safety behavior measurement, showing that a maladaptive behavior was rated higher than an adaptive behavior. Most importantly, across all studies, higher IU predicted more safety behavior in response to decisions, irrespective of decision importance. Studies 2a-3 additionally showed that this relationship was partially mediated by indecisiveness. Conclusions: Our findings add an important insight to the literature, using an unequivocal safety behavior measure to demonstrate its association with IU across decision-making contexts. The results are consistent with IU as a transdiagnostic mental health risk factor, with significant implications for understanding and intervening in maladaptive decision-making processes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, many people found that previously simple decisions suddenly turned into a significant challenge. Should I visit my grandmother? At what time should I go shopping groceries? The added element of uncertainty-namely, the potential risk of infection-greatly complicated such decisions <ref type="bibr">(American Psychological Association, 2021)</ref>. At the same time, many may also have experienced that attempts to reduce uncertainty, at a certain point, could backfire. For instance, overthinking a decision or seeking too many different opinions can make it even more difficult to decide. The research presented here examines how uncertainty is related to decision problems and uncertainty-reducing behavior, and how such behavior might do more harm than good.</p><p>The example from the pandemic underscores the profound decisional uncertainty that arises when facing novel and threatening stressors, such as COVID-19. However, some people generally react negatively to uncertainty and have difficulty tolerating it, regardless of whether it involves actual danger or not. This disposition is referred to as high intolerance of uncertainty <ref type="bibr">(IU;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Freeston et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Krohne, 1989)</ref>. IU is a personality trait that is normally distributed in the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(McEvoy et al., 2019)</ref>. However, several mental disorders are characterized by elevated IU levels and therefore, IU is considered a transdiagnostic risk factor for mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(McEvoy &amp; Erceg-Hurn, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Rosser, 2019)</ref>, and high IU levels are generally seen as problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carleton et al., 2019)</ref>. One area where IU can have negative effects is decision-making. Since decisions often require commitment despite uncertainty, IU is regarded as an obstacle <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Koerner et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rassin et al., 2007)</ref>. Empirical findings showing a relationship between IU and indecisiveness support this assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Koerner et al., 2017)</ref>. Indecisiveness is a personality trait characterized by a chronic inability to make decisions and is often accompanied by fear of making the wrong decision <ref type="bibr">(Frost &amp; Shows, 1993)</ref>. Noteworthy, IU is considered a causal risk factor for indecisiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Rassin, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>If IU relates to indecisiveness because it conflicts with decisional uncertainty, someone high in IU might attempt to reduce uncertainty during decisions. However, since IU represents an exaggerated sensitivity to uncertainty, these measures to reduce uncertainty could also be excessive.</p><p>In other words, IU-related uncertainty-reducing behaviors could become safety behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carleton et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jacoby, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Safety behaviors have mainly been studied within the context of anxiety disorders. According to <ref type="bibr">Telch and Zaizar (2020, p. 28)</ref>, safety behaviors are "unnecessary actions taken to prevent, escape from, or reduce the severity of a perceived threat", including the anxiety associated with it. Consider how in panic disorder, an exaggerated sensitivity to physical anxiety symptoms can lead to unnecessary reliance on asthma inhalers or unjustified use of emergency services <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Clark, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Naturally, the desire for safety can also be appropriate (e.g., when an individual suffers from severe asthma), so the "unnecessary" aspect of the definition is important and depends on the circumstances and intentions of the person performing the behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Thwaites &amp; Freeston, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>But striving for additional safety even though the situation is not dangerous is costly in terms of time, energy, etc., representing one major drawback of safety behaviors. More importantly, safety behaviors can contribute to maintaining or even increasing intolerance towards anxiety triggers in the long run and there are various explanations why (Abramowitz &amp; Blakey, 2020): For example, safety behaviors prevent a person from learning that a seemingly threatening or overwhelming situation is actually harmless or endurable <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Helbig-Lang &amp; Petermann, 2010)</ref>, and they can in themselves signal danger <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Deacon &amp; Maack, 2008)</ref> or undermine a person's confidence in dealing with a feared object on their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Telch &amp; Zaizar, 2020)</ref>. In the following, we refer to this maladaptive form of safety behaviors rather than appropriate safety measures.</p><p>Similar to pathological anxiety, IU in decision making could lead to disproportionate safety behaviors such as excessive information seeking or incessant rumination <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jacoby, 2020)</ref>. Importantly, decisional safety behaviors might also have more disadvantages than advantages: on the one hand, by requiring time and energy, thus outweighing any decision benefits; on the other hand, by undermining the ability to tolerate the feared state, thereby maintaining intolerance for this state <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jacoby, 2020)</ref>. Especially the latter mechanism might result in a vicious cycle, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: high IU conflicts with the inherent uncertainty in many decisions and causes indecisiveness This indecisiveness then leads to uncertainty reduction attempts in the form of safety behaviors, which in turn further increase IU. The present studies focus on the first part of this proposed cycle, testing the relationship between IU and safety behavior in decision making via indecisiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Illustration of the Assumed Relationships between IU, Indecisiveness, and Safety Behaviors</head><p>Research has already shown that IU and indecisiveness are robustly correlated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Koerner et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rassin et al., 2007)</ref>. However, the connection between IU and safety behavior is less clear, especially in decision making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bottesi et al. (2019)</ref> have shown that IU is correlated with various behaviors aimed at handling uncertainty, for example, resolving uncertainty through information seeking, or avoiding uncertainty through procrastination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rosen and Knäuper (2009)</ref> experimentally increased IU and this led to more information seeking in an uncertain situation. Specifically concerning decision making, a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wake et al. (2022)</ref> found that IU correlated with increased visual checking when deciding if two geometric shapes were identical. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jacoby et al. (2014)</ref> found that IU was associated with gathering more information before deciding which of two colors was represented more frequently in a bag of beads. Reflecting IU-related avoidance behavior, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Luhmann et al. (2011)</ref> made participants choose between two options in a gambling task.</p><p>Participants with higher IU scores more often evaded a variable (thus uncertain) waiting time even though this behavior reduced the value and probability of potential gains. These findings are useful for exploring the relationship between IU and behavior. However, the observed IU correlates cannot be conclusively categorized as safety behaviors. This is because the criteria defining safety behaviors were not ascertained. Consider, for example, the findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wake et al. (2022)</ref>: checking visual input before deciding whether two geometrical shapes are identical aligns with the definition of safety behavior. After all, this checking could have cost participants time and energy simply to reduce uncertainty in what is essentially an inconsequential decision. However, while the paradigm is fascinating due to its use of actual behavior, it does not consider other aspects necessary for confidently classifying a behavior as a safety behavior. For instance, the intention behind the checking could have been a higher approach motivation to get the right answer rather than reducing uncertainty. Similarly, the costs of checking may have been proportionate for some participants if they placed a higher value on the correctness of their decisions. Explicitly capturing the defining features of safety behavior in IU-related behavior would rule out alternative explanations and strengthen the evidence that IU is indeed associated with safety behaviors in decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose of the Present Studies</head><p>This research aims to fill a gap in the existing literature by measuring IU-related safety behaviors defined by explicit criteria. We investigated this within the context of decision-making for several reasons: First, decision-making is a cognitive mechanism essential for psychological functioning, especially in the modern world. Second, due to its obvious connection to uncertainty, decision-making is an area in which problematic IU-related safety behavior can easily manifest <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jacoby, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The association between IU and decision-related safety behaviors is significant because safety behaviors can have problematic long-term effects and may contribute to the maintenance of IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hebert &amp; Dugas, 2019)</ref>. Demonstrating the IU-safety behavior association conclusively could therefore be a step toward alleviating IU, a trans-diagnostic risk factor for mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(McEvoy &amp; Erceg-Hurn, 2016)</ref>. Another important purpose of the studies is testing the utility of the safety behavior measurement. Since it can refer to various specific behaviors, the methodology presented here could potentially be applied in diverse contexts.</p><p>In Study 1, we first aimed to validate our operationalization of safety behaviors and their association with IU in a decision-making context. In Studies 2a-3, we replicated this association across various decision types and tested whether the association is mediated by indecisiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Overview and Hypotheses</head><p>Participants first read a decision scenario and then imagined engaging in either an adaptive behavior or a maladaptive behavior in response to this decision. They then rated to what extent the respective behavior had features of safety behavior. We made two main predictions: First, demonstrating the validity of the safety behavior measurement, we hypothesized that the maladaptive behavior would receive higher safety behavior ratings than the adaptive behavior (H1).</p><p>Second, we predicted that IU would be positively associated with safety behavior ratings (H2). We predicted that people higher on IU would give both the adaptive and maladaptive behavior higher safety behavior ratings. Therefore, we did not expect that the IU-safety behavior depended on (i.e., was moderated by) the adaptivity of the described behavior. We reasoned this way because, for high IU levels, even an apparently normal response to decisional uncertainty (e.g., deliberation) could assume features of safety behavior (e.g., excessive rumination). Additionally, we predicted that participants with higher IU levels would consider the maladaptive behavior more typical of themselves. In contrast, participants with higher IU would consider the adaptive behavior less typical of themselves (H3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>All studies were in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the ethics commission of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of xxx (reference no. xxx [masked for peer-review], including amendments for subsequent studies). Electronic supplemental materials (ESM) are provided in the OSF project website (https://t1p.de/k4i4t). Hypotheses and analysis plans for each study were pre-registered (https://t1p.de/rlmvg). Any deviations from the pre-registration were minor and are listed in ESM 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We aimed for at least 200 usable observations. According to a sensitivity analysis using G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Faul et al., 2009)</ref>, this would suffice to detect a small to medium size effect difference (d = 0.35) between two experimental groups (as in H1), or a small to medium (d = .4) R 2 -increase for testing one predictor in a linear multiple regression with a total of three predictor variables (as in H2 and H3) at 80% power. On the crowdsourcing platform Prolific.co, 215 German native speakers at least 18 years of age finished the study. In line with the pre-registered exclusion criteria, we excluded participants who failed the attention check (n = 1), stated that their data should not be used (n = 3, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Meade &amp; Craig, 2012)</ref>, failed to correctly remember essential parts of the instructions (n = 9), or indicated that they could "not at all" relate to the decision scenario (n = 6) or the behaviors in response to the decision (n = 14) described in the vignette. In total, exclusions resulted in a slightly smaller than anticipated final sample of N = 183 for analyses. Most participants were male (74.3%, 3.3% diverse) and education levels were high, with 84.7% having a university degree or qualification to enter university. The mean age was 25.7 years (SD = 8.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures and Materials</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS)</head><p>IU was assessed using the German version <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gerlach et al., 2008)</ref> of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Freeston et al., 1994)</ref>. The original scale includes 27 statements regarding uncertainty (e.g., "Uncertainty makes life intolerable") rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 = Not at all characteristic of me to 5 = Entirely characteristic of me. Only the 18 items of the final translated version were considered for the current analysis, but all 27 items of the original translation were presented to participants to allow for future investigation. Due to the inconsistency in the scale's factor structure according to previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lin et al., 2024)</ref>, analyses were conducted using the total scale score. Internal consistency has been shown to be excellent <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gerlach et al., 2008)</ref>, and Cronbach's Alpha in the current sample was .91. Items scores were summed to form a total scale score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vignettes of decision scenario and behavioral response</head><p>All participants were asked to imagine a Covid-related decision scenario (ESM 1.1). The scenario described waking up with a sore throat and taking a rapid Covid test that turns out negative, and then having to decide whether or not to cancel a walk outside with a friend later that day (Covid vaccination not yet available). Note, that the study was conducted in September 2021 (i.e., while the COVID pandemic was still ongoing and vaccinations had just recently become broadly available in Germany). The vignette was followed by one item measuring identification ("I could put myself in the decision") and decision uncertainty ("To me, the decision involves uncertainty"), respectively. Next, depending on the condition, participants were asked to imagine one of two responses to this decision (ESM 1.1). In the Adaptive Behavior condition, the response was reconsidering all decisionrelevant aspects and then make a choice. In the Maladaptive Behavior condition, the response was spending several hours searching the internet for false-negative rapid tests and a sore throat as a Covid symptom. Note that the decision itself was left open. Again, the vignette describing the response to the decision situation was followed by two questions, one measuring identification ("I could put myself into dealing with the decision this way") and one measuring typicality ("Dealing with the decision this way is typical of me"). All items were rated using Likert-type scales from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Behavior Ratings</head><p>To assess whether participants rated the presented behavior as a maladaptive safety behavior, eight items were developed. The items represented features of safety behaviors found in the literature on anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Helbig-Lang &amp; Petermann, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Piccirillo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Telch &amp; Lancaster, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Telch &amp; Zaizar, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Thwaites &amp; Freeston, 2005)</ref>. Examples are feeling forced by uncertainty to carry out the behavior (e.g., "I behave like this because I feel uncertain"), or cost and exaggeration of the behavior (e.g., "This behavior restricts me"). Importantly, existing measures were not practical because they list specific behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cuming et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Goodson et al., 2016)</ref>. The items presented here, in contrast, could measure for any given behavior to what extent it qualifies as safety behavior. Thus, participants were first presented with the specific decision-related behavior (e.g., reconsidering all relevant information in the Adaptive Behavior condition). They were then instructed to refer to this behavior when rating the items (e.g., "I behave like this [i.e., I reconsider all relevant information] because I feel uncertain"). Participants rated the items on a Likert-type scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Crucially, even though the behavior referred to may be normal-as shown in the example-it could still receive a high safety behavior score if a participant imagined carrying it out in a maladaptive way (e.g., excessive rumination over the decision information). Items were developed in English and translated to German in a thorough INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR IN DECISION MAKING 10 translation-back translation process <ref type="bibr">(Brislin, 1970)</ref>. Items were averaged to form a single score (Cronbach's αadaptive = .77, αmaladaptive = .66). In each study, the factor structure of the items was tested.</p><p>Detailed results are provided in ESM 4. Based on the results, a total score was computed by averaging all items. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> displays the complete item list.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the procedure. Participants read the study information and gave informed consent. First, they answered the IUS. An attention check question was hidden between the items.</p><p>Next, they were asked to imagine the scenario in the decision vignette and answered the corresponding items (regarding uncertainty and identification). They were then randomly assigned to either the Adaptive Behavior condition, where they imagined the adaptive behavior in response to the decision, or the Maladaptive Behavior condition, where they imagined the maladaptive behavior in response to the decision, and then answered the corresponding items (regarding identification and typicality). After imagining the response to the decision, participants completed the safety behavior ratings referring to this response. To conclude, participants' comprehension and recollection of instructions was probed and they answered demographic questions along with questions about the survey (distraction, data usability, comments). They were thoroughly debriefed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>General Procedure of Study 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>To test H1, we compared safety behavior ratings between conditions using an independent samples t-test. Regarding H2 and H3, we tested two linear regression models, first entering IU (mean-centered) and condition (dummy-coded), and then, in a second step, the interaction term of IU and condition as predictors of safety behavior ratings (H2) and typicality (H3), respectively. More participants than expected were excluded due to insufficient identification with the response to the decision (n = 13), and these exclusions were significantly more frequent in the maladaptive behavior condition, χ 2 (1, N = 196) = 6.87, p = .010. To rule out confounds, all analyses were repeated including these participants. Also, in all studies, we identified multivariate outliers by determining each participant's Mahalanobis distance for all continuous variables and verifying whether it fell below a critical probability threshold (&lt; .001). To assess the robustness of the results, we repeated analyses without multivariate outliers. Unless otherwise noted, conclusions from the results did not change due to these exclusions or inclusions of cases. More details are given in ESM 1.2. For all studies, analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS version 28, unless otherwise noted. Regression assumptions were met unless otherwise specified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY, INDECISIVENESS, AND SAFETY BEHAVIOR IN DECISION MAKING 12</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Sample descriptives are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. As predicted in H1, the maladaptive behavior received higher safety behavior ratings than the adaptive behavior (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). The effect was large (Cohen's d = 1.23). This demonstrates that the safety behavior ratings clearly differentiated between more and less adaptive behavior. In line with H2, safety behavior ratings were positively associated with IU (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). There was no interaction between IU and the experimental condition. Thus, regardless of whether the behavior in response to the decision was described as adaptive or maladaptive, IU predicted safety behavior ratings. The main effect of condition confirmed the effect found for H1. Note. IU = Intolerance of uncertainty As for H3, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows that neither IU nor the experimental condition predicted the extent to which the response to the decision was rated as typical. In the sensitivity analysis, when including participants who could "not at all" identify with the behavior scenario, there was a small effect of condition (β = -0.18, p = 0.013). More importantly, in line with H3, the interaction between IU and condition was significant. As confirmed by simple slopes analyses, higher IU levels predicted rating the adaptive behavior as less typical, β = -.22, p = .035. In contrast, for the maladaptive behavior, higher IU levels did not predict typicality ratings, β = .11, p = .306. Moreover, in the sensitivity analyses, the negative association between IU and typicality in the Adaptive Behavior condition was not significant, βoutliers = -.20, p = .057; βlow identification = -.15, p = .135 (see ESM 1.2 for details).</p><p>In total, Study 1 provided evidence for the validity of the safety behavior ratings: They clearly differentiated between an adaptive behavior with no features of safety behavior on the one hand, and a maladaptive behavior with typical features of safety behavior on the other hand. Participants with higher IU levels attributed more safety behavior characteristics to their (imagined) behavior, in other words, made higher safety behavior ratings. This was true regardless of whether the behavior was described as adaptive or maladaptive. Sensitivity analyses converged with the main analyses, except for some details regarding H3: First, when including participants who could "not at all" identify with the maladaptive scenario, unsurprisingly, the maladaptive scenario was also rated as significantly less typical. This reflects that the maladaptive scenario was less representative for participants. Additionally, unlike in the main analysis sample, there was no negative association between IU and typicality in the Adaptive Behavior condition. This inconsistency adds to the somewhat inconclusive result pattern for H3. Poor reliability due to the one-item measurement of typicality may have caused this.</p><p>Building on the findings from Study 1, several important questions remain to be addressed in the next studies. In particular, because the behavior in response to the decision was determined by the vignette, it may have been difficult to imagine for some participants, as reflected by relatively high numbers of participants who did "not at all" identify with the maladaptive behavior vignette. In the following studies, we therefore let participants choose their typical response to a decision to ensure better relatability.</p><p>Furthermore, although Study 1 was conducted within a decision-making context, it does not yet clarify whether uncertainty in general or decision-related uncertainty in particular plays a critical role in the observed IU-safety behavior relationship. To investigate the relationship between IU, safety behavior, and decision-making difficulties more directly, decision making should be targeted explicitly. In line with the model of indecisiveness by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rassin (2007)</ref>, a plausible pathway is that IU is a predisposing risk factor for indecisiveness, which in turn manifests in decision-related problematic safety behavior. To test this assumption, we included an indecisiveness measure in the following studies.</p><p>Finally, in Study 1, the decision scenario was the same for all participants. However, IU might be more closely connected to safety behavior in some decisions than in others. The following studies investigated this idea looking at decision importance as a potential moderator. We focused on decision importance because, in a preceding study, we found that IU was more strongly associated with decisional problems in important as opposed to less important decisions (xxx [masked for peer review], 2021).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2a &amp; b: Overview and Hypotheses</head><p>In Studies 2a &amp; b, participants imagined an either important or less important decision scenario that involved uncertainty. They chose one out of several uncertainty-reducing strategies in handling this decision. Then, like in Study 1, they rated to what extent their chosen behavior fulfilled the definition of safety behavior. The two studies differed only in the presented decision domain,</p><p>with Study 2a featuring a more social decision concerning a group gift, and Study 2b involving a more professional decision concerning one's work schedule. This allowed us to test the robustness of findings across decision domains. As in Study 1, we predicted that IU would be positively associated with safety behavior ratings (H1). Looking at a potential moderator, we predicted that the association would be particularly strong for important decisions (H2). Furthermore, in Study 2b, we preregistered the hypothesis that higher safety behavior ratings would be observed in the important decision (H2b). This hypothesis was formulated because Study 2a unexpectedly revealed this effect, and we anticipated it would replicate in the subsequent studies. Regarding indecisiveness, we predicted that it would mediate the relationship between IU and safety behavior ratings (H3).</p></div>

In total, exclusions resulted in a sample of N2a = 258 and N2b = 246, respectively, for analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IUS</head><p>As in Study 1, IU was measured with the IUS, the only difference being that we used the original 27-item English version <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Freeston et al., 1994)</ref>. This version has high internal reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Freeston et al., 1994)</ref>, which was also true of the current samples (α2a = .95, α2b = .94).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indecisiveness Scale</head><p>Trait indecisiveness was measured using the 11-item version <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rassin et al., 2007)</ref> of the Indecisiveness Scale <ref type="bibr">(Frost &amp; Shows, 1993)</ref>, the most common measure of indecisiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Rassin, 2007)</ref>. A sample item is "I often worry about making the wrong decision." Answers were collected on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Internal consistency has been shown to be good <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rassin et al., 2007)</ref>, which was replicated in the current samples (α2a = .89, α2b = .94).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Vignette Including Manipulation of Decision Importance</head><p>All vignettes described a decision involving some uncertainty. They can be found in ESM 2.1.</p><p>In Study 2a, participants imagined having to choose a group gift. In the high importance condition, the gift was for a close friend who left the country, whereas in the low importance condition, it was for an easy-going co-worker who left the company after a short employment and was not very close with anybody. Study 2b involved a work schedule-related decision, where participants imagined realizing they had too many appointments for the next day and had to cancel some. While in the high importance condition, the employment was still new and all appointments were important, in the low importance condition, the job was already familiar and none of the appointments were important. Immediately following the vignette, several items were administered measuring perceptions of the described decision: as in Study 1, participants indicated identification with the decision and decision uncertainty. Additionally, they indicated decision difficulty ("I find the decision difficult") and answered five items reflecting decision importance (e.g., "The decision has important consequences", xxx [masked for peer review], 2021, α2a = .77; α2b = .81). Importance ratings were averaged and served as manipulation check. All items were answered using a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) Likert-type scale. Also, an attention check question was hidden among the items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty-Reducing Behaviors and Safety Behavior Ratings</head><p>After reading the decision scenario, participants chose one of 14 potential uncertaintyreducing behaviors that would be most typical of them in this decision. Examples included: "I seek advice from others", "I look for more information about the decision (e.g., internet)", or "I compare myself with others who have been faced with a similar decision". Behaviors were presented in random order. These behaviors were partially adapted from an instrument called Intolerance of Uncertainty Behaviours in Everyday Life <ref type="bibr">(IUBEL, Clifford et al., 2015)</ref>, listing uncertainty-reducing behaviors motivated by IU. Other behaviors were added based on the literature on decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson, 2003)</ref>, IU (e.g., Jacoby, 2020), and safety behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Goodson et al., 2016)</ref>. The complete list is provided in ESM 2.1. After selecting a typical behavior, participants first indicated to what extent the chosen behavior would be typical of them in the decision situation (1 = not at all typical to 5 = extremely typical). Then, participants rated the same safety behavior items as in Study 1 (in English) referring to this behavior (e.g., when they had picked "I seek advice from others", they were asked to think of the safety behavior items as "I seek advice from others because I feel uncertain", etc.). Internal consistency was α = .79 in both samples. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the procedure. Participants read the study information and gave informed consent. First, they answered the IUS and the Indecisiveness Scale. Next, they were randomly assigned to either the High or Low Decision Importance condition and were asked to read and imagine the respective scenario in the vignette. After answering the manipulation check items, participants picked the uncertainty-reducing behavior and then rated this behavior in terms of safety instructions and provided demographic information. They answered questions about the survey (distraction, data usability, comments) and were thoroughly debriefed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Although not planned at the time of preregistration, we accounted for the multilevel structure of the data in regression analyses because the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; ρ2a = .18, ρ2b = .23) suggested dependency of safety behavior ratings within uncertainty-reducing behaviors. Consequently, we ran mixed models to test H1 and H2, with participants (Level 1) nested within uncertainty-reducing behaviors (Level 2) in R (R Core Team, 2020) using the lmerTest package <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref> and Full Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation. Intercepts but not slopes were allowed to vary randomly between Level 2 units because in Study 2a, the random slopes model did not converge, and in Study 2b, the random slopes model did not fit the data significantly better, χ 2 (15) = 20.32, p = .160. Similar to Study 1, IU (group mean-centered), condition (dummy-coded), and the interaction term of IU and condition were included to predict safety behavior ratings. We used the PROCESS (version 4.0) SPSS macro <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hayes, 2017)</ref> to test a non-hierarchical mediation model (Model 4; 5,000 bootstrapping resamples) with IU as independent variable, indecisiveness as mediator, and safety behavior as dependent variable (H3). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> illustrates the mediation model.</p><p>We did not consider the multilevel structure in these mediation analyses because in the previous analyses (pertaining to H1 and H2), the outcomes were nearly identical for multilevel and nonhierarchical models, and because a multilevel mediation model in Study 2a did not converge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Descriptive data of the sample are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. Confirming the successful manipulation of decision importance, the decision in the High Importance condition was rated as more important in both studies. It was also rated higher in terms of uncertainty and difficulty. In Study 2b, the High Importance condition additionally had higher ratings of identification with the decision and typicality of the uncertainty-reducing behavior. As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>, in line with H1, higher IU levels were associated with higher safety behavior ratings in both studies. Contrary to H2, the relationship between IU and safety behavior ratings was not stronger in more important decisions across both studies (i.e., the interaction effect was not significant). In Study 2a, although not predicted, higher safety behavior ratings were observed in the Important Decision condition, although this effect was not significant when excluding n = 6 multivariate outliers, B = 0.13, p = .085. Accordingly, in Study 2b, we did predict higher safety behavior ratings in the Important Decision condition (H2b), but this finding did not replicate.  Note.

Because the relationship between IU and safety behavior ratings did not depend on the experimental condition, the mediation model was estimated using the complete sample regardless of experimental condition.</p><p>Replicating findings from Study 1, Studies 2a and b both showed a strong positive connection between IU and safety behavior ratings. In other words, the higher a person's IU level, the more they responded to decisional uncertainty with problematic safety behaviors. Contrary to predictions, the association between IU and safety behavior ratings was independent of decision importance.</p><p>Indecisiveness accounted for part of the relationship between IU and safety behavior ratings. In Studies 2a and 2b, the real-life relevance of the stimulus materials seemed to be ensured, as indicated by generally high identification with the vignettes and the behaviors in response to them.</p><p>However, the decision scenarios were predetermined, which may have impaired how well participants ultimately could relate to them. This limitation could explain why the decision importance manipulation did not have the expected effect. Therefore, in Study 3, participants described an individual personal decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3: Overview and Hypotheses</head><p>Study 3 had a similar setup to Studies 2a and b. The crucial difference is that in Study 3, participants were not provided with a decision scenario, but described an upcoming personal decision of theirs that was either important or unimportant. As in Studies 2a and b, they then chose one out of several uncertainty-reducing behaviors that would be typical of them in this decision.</p><p>Again, they rated to what extent this behavior fulfilled criteria of safety behavior. Like in the preceding studies, we predicted that IU would be positively associated with safety behavior ratings (H1) and that this association would be stronger for important than unimportant decisions (H2). We further predicted that safety behavior ratings would be higher in the important decision (H2b).</p><p>Finally, we hypothesized that indecisiveness would mediate the relationship between IU and safety behavior ratings (H3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We aimed at more statistical power by slightly increasing the sample size. Using Prolific.co, 302 UK-based adults (≥ 18 years) native English speakers finished the study. Following the preregistered exclusion criteria, data from participants were discarded if they failed the attention check (n = 3), stated that their data should not be used (n = 3), failed to correctly remember essential parts of the instructions (n = 38), or could "not at all" think vividly about the decision they described (n = 1). All exclusions taken together resulted in a final sample of N = 257.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Most materials were identical to Studies 2a and b. Internal consistencies were α = .96 for the IUS, α = .89 for the Indecisiveness Scale, α = .82 for the decision importance items, and α = .83 for the safety behavior ratings. However, instead of a vignette with a decision scenario, decision importance was manipulated by having participants write about an actual personal decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants' Descriptions of Personal Decisions Including Manipulation of Decision Importance</head><p>Participants were asked to think vividly and write about a personal upcoming decision that was either important (High Importance condition) or of low relevance (Low Importance condition).</p><p>To support the instructions, examples were provided (e.g., "Should I change my career?" in the High Importance condition; "At what time should I have dinner?" in the Low Importance condition).</p><p>Participants were required to write for at least 30 seconds before being able to proceed. After the description, they answered the same questions about the described decision as in Studies 2a and b</p><p>(including a hidden attention check question). However, instead of indicating their identification with the decision, they answered the following item: "During writing, I thought vividly about the decision"</p><p>(1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Two independent raters determined whether participants had described an actual decision (99.2% agreement, cases of disagreement were resolved through discussion). Final ratings showed all participants in the final sample had provided a valid decision description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The procedure was similar to Studies 2a and b (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>, with a few modifications: After giving informed consent and completing the IUS and the Indecisiveness Scale, participants did not read a pre-determined decision vignette but provided their own decision description as outlined above. Then, they chose the uncertainty-reducing behavior "that is or will be most typical of you in this decision". Before rating this behavior on the safety behavior ratings, the participant's decision description was displayed again. In addition to questions probing instruction comprehension as in Studies 2a and b, another question tested participants' recognition of the uncertainty-reducing behavior they had chosen. Also, in case participants felt upset by the decision they had described, helplines and other mental health resources were listed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Considering the non-negligible ICC of ρ = . 22, we ran mixed models of IU (group meancentered), condition (dummy-coded), and the interaction between IU and condition predicting safety behavior ratings (H1 and H2) as in Studies 2a and b. The random slopes model did not fit the data significantly better, χ 2 (8) = 1.11, p = .997, so we report results from the random intercept model.</p><p>Again, we used PROCESS to test the mediation of IU predicting safety behavior via indecisiveness (cf. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Descriptive data and group mean difference tests are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref>. Decisions in the High Importance condition were rated higher in importance, indicating that the manipulation was successful. Ratings of decision uncertainty and difficulty were also higher in the High Importance condition, which was also the case for identification with the decision.</p><p>As predicted, higher IU scores predicted higher safety behavior ratings (H1). However, in contrast to the prediction of H2, again, this positive association was not moderated by decision importance. Safety behavior ratings were higher in the High Importance condition (H2b  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref>. As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 9</ref>, H3 was also supported in that the relationship between IU and safety behavior ratings was (partially) mediated by indecisiveness (as in the preceding studies, mediation analysis was conducted using the whole sample because the IUsafety behavior ratings relationship was unaffected by the experimental condition).   <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lüdecke, 2022)</ref>. As in all preceding studies, Study 3 confirmed a strong relationship between higher IU levels and higher safety behavior ratings, extending this finding to a more realistic decision context using participants' personal decisions. Also in line with the previous findings, this relationship was independent of decision importance. As found in Study 2a, but not Study 2b, the important decision resulted in higher safety behavior ratings overall compared to the unimportant decision. The positive association between IU and safety behavior ratings was mediated by indecisiveness, and mediation was partial, as also seen in Studies 2a and b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Across four studies, we sought to demonstrate that more IU is associated with problematic safety behavior in decision making. In Study 1, we first established the validity of items assessing how much a given behavior aligned with the definition of safety behavior. These items reflected defining features of safety behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Helbig-Lang &amp; Petermann, 2010)</ref>, like feeling forced to carry out the behavior due to a feared state or consequence (in this case, uncertainty), and at the same time thinking that the behavior involved high costs (such as being constraining). Indeed, ratings on these items clearly differentiated between a rather adaptive and a rather problematic coping with decisional uncertainty.</p><p>Irrespective of the specific behavior they referred to, these ratings had a strong positive association with IU across all four studies. This finding supports the view that individuals high in IU tend to react to decisional uncertainty by using strategies similar to fear-reducing safety behaviors in pathological anxiety. This was true for a wide range of decision scenarios, ranging from COVIDrelated decisions (Study 1) to social and professional decisions (Studies 2a and b), as well as personal decisions (Study 3), demonstrating the ubiquity of this link between IU and decisional safety behaviors. Interestingly, this relationship between IU and safety behaviors was not affected by decision importance, although indicating that even in less important decisions, high IU individuals resort to safety behaviors to reduce uncertainty. Importantly, this was true even when participants individually selected their most typical response to decisional uncertainty themselves (Studies 2a -3), increasing the real-life applicability of the results. In Studies 2a and 3, important decisions did result in slightly higher safety behavior ratings overall, but this effect was small and unreliable (e.g., it did not emerge in Study 2b) and should thus be interpreted with caution.</p><p>According to the mediation analyses in Studies 2a -3, indecisiveness explained part of the link between IU and safety behavior. This mediation effect demonstrates that the decision-making context is relevant for the IU-safety behavior relationship. The particular importance of decision-making for IU is consistent with previous researchers' suggestions, who have emphasized the inherent uncertainty in decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carleton et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Luhmann et al., 2011)</ref>. The mediation effect also provides some evidence for the theory that IU is a predisposing risk factor for indecisiveness, which in turn manifests in maladaptive decision-related behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Rassin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> cf. <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, the indirect effect of IU on safety behavior via indecisiveness was small and the mediation was only partial. In other words, the decision-specific trait of indecisiveness explained some, but not all of the variance in the connection between IU and safety behaviors. This suggests that IU entails a general tendency to react to uncertainty with safety behaviors, which can become apparent in decision making, but also in other areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Freeston et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jacoby, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>This idea of a more ubiquitous IU-safety behavior link is in line with research showing similar associations for health-related worries <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fergus, 2013)</ref> or everyday situations with uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ranney et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, the results lend support to the idea that IU is linked to uncertainty-reducing behavior much like safety behaviors are linked to anxiety disorders (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dugas et al., 2022)</ref>, and that this relationship unfolds in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007)</ref>. Thanks to the direct measurement of safety behaviors using defining criteria established in the anxiety disorder literature, the current findings add an essential component to the previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bottesi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jacoby, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Luhmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wake et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Some limitations must be considered. Much of the evidence presented here relies on selfreports, especially the safety behavior ratings. On the one hand, this offers unique insight because it directly taps into participants' introspective evaluation of their behavior. On the other hand, it may be prone to bias such as limited self-knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Paulhus &amp; Vazire, 2007)</ref>. In other words, do individuals understand that their behaviors executed to gain safety or certainty can have disproportional costs and disadvantages? Some evidence suggesting that they do was found in Study 1 where participants endorsed the safety behavior items more in the maladaptive safety behavior scenario than the adaptive behavior scenario. To corroborate the validity of these self-report ratings even more, future studies could combine them with behavior-based paradigms that simulate safety behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carleton et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Luhmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wake et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We used hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the decision (Studies 1 -2b) and, in Study 1, the response to the decision. This approach may limit the findings' external validity. However, the fact that the results remained unchanged when participants chose their own personal decisions <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Study 3)</ref> and their own most typical response to the decision (Studies 2a -3) supports the real-life applicability.</p><p>Although the reliability of the safety behavior ratings was mostly good and treating them as a unidimensional scale produced meaningful results, their factor structure was not consistent across studies. In one sub-sample, internal consistency was rather low (i.e., Study 1, Maladaptive Behavior condition, Cronbach's α = .66). The measurement could be improved by creating a larger item pool and submitting it to factor analysis. That way, the probability of finding a reliable structure with a sufficient number of items per factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(MacCallum et al., 1999)</ref> would rise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The findings have implications for future research and for interventions targeting decisionmaking problems and IU. First, the methodology introduced in the present studies can be applied in future investigations. More specifically, by using the safety behavior ratings, researchers could verify whether an IU-related behavior in fact qualifies as safety behavior. Preceding studies have found convincing, behavior-based paradigms to demonstrate IU-related behaviors in decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carleton et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Luhmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wake et al., 2022)</ref>. The uncertainty-reducing function and problematic nature of these behaviors could be more conclusively ascertained when combined with the safety behavior ratings used in the present studies.</p><p>All associations reported in the present studies were found in unselected, non-clinical samples, and they included common and partially even trivial decision scenarios. Thus, the findings suggest that safety behavior can play a role in non-pathological populations and in everyday functioning. Originally, the principle of reducing safety behavior comes from cognitive behavioral treatments of mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders: For example, a socially anxious patient may engage in the safety behavior of not speaking in front of others, which ironically maintains the underlying anxiety when carried out excessively. Accordingly, part of the treatment consists in giving up problematic safety behaviors (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr">Abramowitz &amp; Blakey, 2020)</ref>. If the same logic applies to IU-related safety behaviors, they may similarly contribute to the underlying IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jacoby, 2020)</ref>. This implies that IU and problems related to it could be improved by targeting safety behaviors, even in non-clinical settings. For example, when IU underlies a person's indecisiveness, psychoeducation might be beneficial. It could highlight that attempts to eliminate uncertainty (i.e., safety behaviors) may backfire and that learning to tolerate some level of uncertainty might be more effective. This could be particularly important in areas where decisional uncertainty is partly inevitable, such as medical decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Appel &amp; Sanatkar, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Han et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Simpkin &amp; Schwartzstein, 2016)</ref>. However, more research is needed to establish a causal effect of IU-related behavior on IU and indecisiveness. This could be achieved using paradigms similar to experimental studies demonstrating the negative effects of pathological safety behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Deacon &amp; Maack, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Olatunji et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In the clinical sphere, IU is considered a trans-diagnostic risk factor for mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Rosser, 2019)</ref>. Consequently, treatments have been introduced to reduce IU, with some targeting IU-related safety behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dugas &amp; Robichaud, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hebert &amp; Dugas, 2019)</ref> and this approach seems to be effective in alleviating IU and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder <ref type="bibr">(GAD, Dugas et al., 2022)</ref>. Similar logic, involving exposure to uncertainty while preventing experiential avoidance strategies like safety behavior, has even been applied to a trans-diagnostic treatment protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boswell et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Khakpoor et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Miller &amp; McGuire, 2023)</ref>. The treatments resulted in symptom reductions on measures of depression, panic disorder, OCD, and social anxiety disorder, and these reductions were correlated with reductions in IU. The current findings reveal a potential mechanism underlying these symptom reductions, showing that elevated IU is indeed connected to more use of problematic safety behaviors in a crucial area of psychological functioning, namely decision making. This, in turn, may help explain how reducing safety behaviors helps reduce IU and thus overcome mental disorders.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Wording of Safety Behavior Rating Items</figDesc><table><row><cell>Item</cell><cell>Item wording</cell></row><row><cell>no.</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>1</cell><cell>I behave like this because I feel uncertain</cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell>If I felt certain, I would behave differently</cell></row><row><cell>3</cell><cell>Dealing with the situation in a different way would increase my uncertainty</cell></row><row><cell>4</cell><cell>Acting differently would be difficult for me</cell></row><row><cell>5</cell><cell>This behavior restricts me</cell></row><row><cell>6</cell><cell>This behavior only helps in the short term</cell></row><row><cell>7</cell><cell>I might overdo it with this behavior</cell></row><row><cell>8</cell><cell>Others might wonder about this behavior</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Procedure</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
