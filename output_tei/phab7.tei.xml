			<abstract>
				<p>Rational mate choices are central to individual happiness and collective social goods. Yet, few studies assess mate choice rationality from the decision-theoretic perspective. Here we present an experimental test of rationality in human mate preferences through the lens of transitivity, a fundamental hallmark of rational decision-making. In the experiment, participants made repeated binary choices between pairs of potential romantic partners in both short-term and long-term mating contexts. We tested the transitivity of mate preferences by systematically comparing four prominent transitive models with four models that allow for intransitive preferences on the choice data. Overall, all transitive models provided better accounts than the intransitive models in Bayesian model selection and strong stochastic transitivity (SST), the most restrictive transitive model, outperformed other transitive models. On the individual level, participants rarely displayed intransitive cycles and most of them were best described by transitive models in Bayesian model selection. Our paper presents a systematic evaluation of transitivity in mate preferences and sheds new light on our understanding of human mating behavior.</p>

It plays significant roles in individual happiness, as well as social welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Diener &amp; Seligman, 2002)</ref>. How do we choose romantic partners? What qualities and quantities do we seek in potential partners? Researchers have long been interested in the characteristics that we favor in romantic partners, as the answers to these questions are crucial to our understanding of human mating behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hill, 1945;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Buss, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Mate choice is influenced by a wide range of factors, such as personal traits (e.g. attractiveness, personality and similarity), mutual affect (e.g., love), social status and financial prospects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buss et al., 2001</ref>). Of all the attributes that we consider in potential mates, physical attractiveness and financial resources are among the most influential ones. Both men and women assign high priorities to them when considering romantic partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Li et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Li &amp; Kenrick, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Todd et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Zhang et al., 2019)</ref>. The importance of these two attributes is almost universal and has been increasing steadily in the last several decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buss et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Walter et al., 2020</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evolutionary and social determinants of mate preferences</head><p>Despite the global consensus, people may weight physical attractiveness and financial resources differently in different in different contexts. Specifically, men typically more heavily weight physical attractiveness than women do, and women tend to more heavily weight financial resources than men do <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Buss, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Buss &amp; Barnes, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Buss et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Feingold, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">1992)</ref>. The sex differences are TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 4 typically attributed to socioeconomic and evolutionary reasons. Physical attractiveness is widely accepted to be a premium in social relationships and, additionally, women's physical attractiveness, from an evolutionary perspective, is thought to signal their reproductive capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gangestad &amp; Simpson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Maestripieri et al., 2017)</ref>. Conversely, financial resources (e.g., resource-related attributes such as ambition, earning capacity, social status) are valued heavily by women likely because women contribute more to the obligatory parental investment (i.e., pregnancy and lactation) than men do <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Trivers, 1972)</ref> and resources provided by men can be beneficial to both the women and their offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kenrick &amp; Keefe, 1992)</ref>. Thus, men and women appear to act in a way to rationally maximize their own benefits in mating behavior.</p><p>Their weights may also differ in different mating contexts. Women tend to value financial resources less in short-term partners than in long-term partners because financial resources are thought to be less important in short-term relationships. Rather, they place greater emphasis on physical attractiveness for shortterm partner selection, since it might be more beneficial to focus on good genes (as displayed by cues such as physical condition) as this could be heritable to their offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gangestad &amp; Simpson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kenrick et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Li &amp; Kenrick, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Li et al., 2011)</ref>. Besides, in societies with greater gender equality, the sex differences of mate preferences are likely to be smaller <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eagly &amp; Wood, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Walter et al., 2020)</ref>. It has been argued that the adaption to mating TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 5 contexts and social environments signals the ecological and social rationality of mate preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lenton et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Todd et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transitivity: Decision-theoretic rationality</head><p>The aforementioned social and evolutionary accounts provide compelling interpretations of the findings that men and women have different mate preferences and that they adjust their preferences adaptively upon different mating contexts and social environments. The rationality of mate choice, however, can be also assessed within a decision-theoretic framework. Axiomatic decision theories examine choice rationality via the structural consistency between choices, setting aside the weighting of attributes that determines mate values, and assert that rational choice should follow these principles. In behavioral decision research, decision-theoretic testing has proven highly valuable and has provoked fruitful research programs on the psychology of decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tversky, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Huber et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Simonson, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Regenwetter et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Transitivity is one of the most important decision-theoretic principles of rationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fishburn, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Luce, 1959)</ref>. It means that, for any given triplet {A, B, C}, if one prefers A to B and B to C, she should prefer A to C. This transitive preference can be written as ≻ ≻ . Otherwise, if transitivity is violated, people may exhibit irrational and cyclic choice patterns, such as ≻ , ≻ but ≻ .</p><p>Someone who maximizes their profits in the choices should not display the cyclic patterns and thus should follow the transitivity axiom. In light of the theories that suggest that both men's and women's mate preferences are shaped in a way to TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 6 maximize their own interests, transitivity testing is a uniquely powerful tool for evaluating the rationality of mate preferences.</p><p>Transitivity is closely related to the distinction between the compensatory and non-compensatory strategies in mate choice. Compensatory strategies refer to the decision processes that weigh all the relevant attributes and assign the weight to each attribute, allowing a low value on one attribute to compensated by a high value on another attribute. Compensatory strategies are typically consistent with transitive preferences. For example, the weighted-additive model assumes that individuals assess all relevant cues, multiply by the weight that the individuals assign to the cue and choose the one with the highest summed value <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brandner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Miller &amp; Todd, 1998)</ref>. The Euclidean Distance model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Conroy-Beam (Conroy-Beam, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Conroy-Beam &amp; Buss, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">2017)</ref> computes the distance from actual trait values to ideal trait values in a multidimensional space and the option with smaller distance has a higher mate value.</p><p>In contrast, non-compensatory strategies may violate the principle of transitivity. For example, the lexicographic rules assume that decision-makers consider only one attribute at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tversky, 1969)</ref>. A decision is reached as soon as the attribute under consideration favors one option against others, disregarding information on other attributes. Several heuristic models, such as Take-the-Best <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Miller &amp; Todd, 1998)</ref> and Avoid-the-Worst <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Grammer et al., 2002)</ref> are instances of lexicographic rules. Another noncompensatory example is the sequential aspiration-level model <ref type="bibr">(Miller &amp; Todd,</ref><ref type="bibr">TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 7</ref> 1988). This model assumes an individual assesses a potential mate's trait values sequentially and pursues further courtship only if the potential mate's trait value exceeds the minimum ideal value. These non-compensatory strategies may lead to intransitive preferences.</p><p>Transitivity is also essential to the popular idea of mate value, a procedure that combines different attributes in mate choice into an overall numeric value <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Symons, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Simao &amp; Todd, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Todd &amp; Miller, 1999 for applications)</ref>. Transitivity is the necessary condition for integrating different attributes into an overall unidimensional value because the unidimensional values are transitive themselves. If the transitivity of mate preference does not hold, it may be problematic to assign a unidimensional value to each potential mating partner in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental test of transitivity</head><p>Despite its theoretical and practical significance, few studies have examined the transitivity of human mate preferences. Very recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brandner et al. (2020)</ref> compared a set of compensatory vs. non-compensatory strategies in mate choice and found that compensatory strategies captured human mate choice data much better than non-compensatory strategies. Although they did not directly test transitivity, their results suggested that human mate preferences might be transitive. Another study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hatz et al. (2020)</ref> directly tested the transitivity of risky sexual decision-making. They formulated risky sexual decisions using facial attractiveness and the probability of contracting a sexually transmitted infection. Their model comparison focused on the Weak Order Mixture Model of Regenwetter and Davis-Stober (2012) as a stochastic TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 8 model of transitivity and the lexicographic semiorder mixture model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Davis-Stober (2012)</ref> as the intransitive competitor model and suggested that the transitive model fits the data better than the intransitive one.</p><p>Previous work suggests that mate preferences are probably transitive.</p><p>However, the conclusion regarding transitivity may be sensitive to the formulation of the transitive models. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tversky's (1969)</ref> pioneering work on the transitivity of risk preferences suggested that people may show intransitive preferences in gamble choices. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Roelofsma and Read (2000)</ref> reported intransitivity in intertemporal choice, a decision scenario where people choose between payoffs available at different time points. Recent analyses, however, suggested that the conclusions regarding transitivity may depend on the stochasticity assumption of the transitive model. Some seemingly intransitive patterns may be due to the stochasticity of preferential choice that was not considered in the analyses (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Birnbaum &amp; Gutierrez, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birnbaum &amp; Schmidt, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cavagnaro &amp; Davis-Stober, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Regenwetter et al., 2010;</ref>.</p><p>The conclusion regarding transitivity is also sensitive to the competitor models that allow for intransitive preferences. For example, in a test of transitivity of intertemporal choice, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dai (2017)</ref> suggested that although transitive models may explain data better than the saturated model that allowed for any combination of choice probabilities, the data could be even better explained by well-tuned intransitive models other than the overly flexible saturated model. Thus, it is important to involve TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 9 different forms of transitive and intransitive models for a rigorous test of transitivity, revealing the cognitive principles underlying mate choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current study</head><p>This paper presents a direct test of transitivity in human mate preferences.</p><p>Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brandner et al. (2020)</ref>, we were interested in how people integrate different cues in partner selection in the typical mate choice settings. According to the extensive evolutionary and social psychology literature, physical attractiveness and financial resources are arguably the most pervasive determinants of mate values. We thus created profiles of potential partners varying in physical attractiveness and financial resources for heterosexual women and men. We also considered two within-subject choice conditions, short-term and long-term partner selection, to test preference transitivity in different mating contexts.</p><p>Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hatz et al. (2020)</ref>, we directly compared transitive models with models that allowed for intransitive preferences. To address the sensitivity to the specification of transitive and intransitive models, we systematically tested four prominent transitive models and compared them with four models that allowed for intransitive preferences. Three transitive models (i.e., weak stochastic transitivity, medium stochastic transitivity, and strong stochastic transitivity) assume that participants have a fixed order of preferences but allow for unsystematic errors of selecting the less preferred option. The predicted choice probability is determined by the preference order and the allowed probability of committing an error. The fourth transitive model, mixture model of transitive preference (MMTP), allows for the fluctuation of TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 10 preference orders over time, according to which the predicted choice probability is the average of all possible preference orders.</p><p>In line with previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Davis-Stober, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hatz et al., 2020)</ref>, we considered lexicographic semiorder models as the main intransitive competitor models that allowed both transitive and intransitive preferences. To explore different sources of randomness, we specified three variants of the lexicographic semiorder model with different stochastic assumptions. The lexicographic semiorder models resemble some popular heuristic models of mate choice, such as Take-the-Best and Avoid-the-Worst <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Grammer et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Miller &amp; Todd, 1998)</ref>. Finally, we also involved a fourth intransitive model that allowed for full flexibility of choice probabilities (i.e. the saturated model) in the model comparison as the benchmark model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Fifty-six heterosexual women (Mage=20.00, SDage=2.09) and 51 heterosexual men (Mage=20.65, SDage=2.51) participated in the study. All the participants were students at East China Normal University, Shanghai, China. The study was approved by the Committee of Human Research Protection at East China Normal University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>We designed two sets of profiles, one Main set and one Alternative set. Each set consists of m = 5 profiles of potential mates. Each profile contained information on two attributes: physical attractiveness (indicated by a face image) and financial TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 11 resources (indicated by an annual income). Our construction of stimuli was primarily inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tversky's (1969)</ref> classic design for testing transitivity in risky choice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Regenwetter et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Regenwetter et al. ( , 2011</ref> also suggest that one of the transitive models (i.e., the mixture model of transitive preference as introduced below) cannot be properly defined and fit to experimental data easily unless m ≤ 5.</p><p>Following previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brandner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hatz et al., 2020)</ref>, we used face images to represent physical attractiveness. Face images were selected from the Oriental Face Database (http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jianyi/english-version). We recruited an independent group of participants (21 heterosexual men and 17 heterosexual women) to rate the physical attractiveness of opposite-sex face images.</p><p>Ten faces were selected to represent different levels of physical attractiveness based on the average rating scores (from the independent group of participants). Since people might judge physical attractiveness differently <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hehman et al., 2017)</ref>, we asked participants to rank the face images on physical attractiveness and then paired the image faces with the annual income adaptively for each participant (denoted as A, B, C, D, and E, with A as the most attractive and E the least attractive). The annual incomes also had five levels and were set at ¥90,000, ¥120,000, ¥150,000, ¥180,000, and ¥210,000 per year. At the moment of the experiment, ¥1,000 (Chinese Yuan) was approximately worth $142 (US Dollar). We chose annual incomes in the middle range, without extremely high/low values.</p><p>In the Main set, physical attractiveness and financial resources were set negatively correlated (i.e., the more attractive one had a lower annual income).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 12</head><p>Typically, both women and men have a preference for attractive partners and partners with good financial resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Buss, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Buss et al, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Feingold, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">1992)</ref> and thus they needed to make trade-offs between these two attributes in the binary choices. In the Alternative set, the two attributes were set positively correlated (i.e., the more attractive one also had a higher annual income). We included this design set in order to catch the trade-offs if participants perceived financial resources as a negative attribute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants first rank-ordered the two sets of five face images respectively.</p><p>With each set, they sorted the images from the most attractive to the least attractive by dragging the images onscreen. They were able to sort the images as many times as they wanted before submitting their final rank orders. This rank order was in turn used to create profiles. For the Main set, the most attractive face image was paired with the lowest salary ¥90,000; the second most attractive image was paired with the second lowest salary ¥120,000 and so on …; the least attractive face image was paired with the highest salary ¥210,000. For the Alternative set, the most attractive face image was paired with ¥210,000 and the least attractive face image was paired with ¥90,000, and so on. In the mate choice task, participants made binary choices in pairs of potential romantic partners' profiles. Ten unique binary choices were created from the five profiles for each set, making up a total of 20 unique binary choices. The 20 binary choices were repeated 10 times, with each repetition as a separate block. Participants TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 13 were allowed to take a self-paced break between blocks. Note that the choices within each block were fully randomized. The two design sets were mixed within each block to reduce the memorability of past choices, allowing us to obtain repeated but independent choice frequencies across blocks (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tversky, 1969</ref> for a similar manipulation).</p><p>To test different mating contexts, each participant performed the mate choice tasks twice; once for choosing long-term (i.e., marriage) partners and once for choosing short-term (i.e., casual sex) partners. Participants completed all the choices in one mating context before moving on to the other. The order in which participants did these two tasks was randomized across participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transitive models</head><p>For a rigorous test of transitivity, we considered four stochastic models of transitivity: weak stochastic transitivity (WST), medium stochastic transitivity <ref type="formula">(</ref> The four transitive models differed in model flexibility. This can be illustrated by the choice probability space each model allows. We ran a Monte Carlo analysis to demonstrate this. The five options formed a 10-dimensional choice-probability space, with each dimension representing the choice probability between one pair of options (ranging from 0 to 1). We drew 10 billion uniform samples from the full space (i.e., the saturated model), tested whether each of the samples was consistent with the models' predictions, and then estimated the proportion of the saturated model's predictions that were consistent with each of the models above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 15</head><p>As in the "Standard" column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1, WST was the most flexible transitive</ref> model, allowing for 11.7% of the saturated model. SST, by contrast, was the most parsimonious one, allows for less than 0.01% of the saturated model. MST and MMTP lay in between. Overall, the small proportions suggested that the test of these models against the saturated model was highly viable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>The allowed proportions of the saturated model space by the substantive models. The "Standard" column corresponds to the standard version of the transitive and LS models and the "Constrained" column corresponds to the models with the additional preference order constraint of ≻ ≻ ≻ ≻ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>Proportion of the saturated model allowed by each model We considered four models that allowed for intransitive preferences. The first three models were variants of the lexicographic semiorder model (LS). The lexicographic semiorder model was an influential cognitive model that allowed for intransitive preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tversky, 1969)</ref>. LS held an attribute-wise evaluation rule and implemented a threshold mechanism that permitted intransitive preferences. The fourth intransitive model was the saturated model that allowed for any choice probabilities. It was the most flexible model in the context of two-alternative forced binary choice.</p><p>Lexicographic semiorder error models. LS models can be equipped with a choice-error specification. To illustrate, consider a choice between A and B (where A is more attractive, but B has a higher income). One may first compare the attractiveness between A and B. If she perceives A as being more attractive than B and the difference in attractiveness reaches a threshold, she is likely to choose A over B. In a probabilistic term, that means (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Klugkist &amp; Hoijtink, 2007)</ref>. Here, we explored two versions of the "about equality" specifications. In one version, we allowed for a very small deviation of choice probability and specified 0.49 ≤ Pr[ ; ] ≤ 0.51, referred to as LSEM01, such that the allowed probability values were close to 1 2 ("01" refers to the allowed deviation of 0.01 from , to make the width of this "about equality"</p><p>equal to the error width of other preference orders between A and B (e.g., 0 ≤</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pr[ ; ] ≤ 1 2</formula><p>, see Guo, 2018 for a similar specification). We referred to the latter as LSEM25 ("25" refers to the allowed deviation of 0.25 from 1 2 ). For either LSEM01 or LSEM25, the predicted region was the union of the 21 preference orders' or semiorders' predicted regions. As in the "Standard" column of Rather, they allow for both transitive and intransitive choice patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constrained models</head><p>As noted earlier, although most participants would prefer attractive to unattractive partners and prefer high-income to low-income partners, we expected that some might not prefer high-income to low-income partners, especially in short-term mating contexts. To account for these individual differences, we designed the Main We applied the constraint to both the transitive and LS models. The constrained models are more restrictive than the standard models as in the "Constrained" column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>. For example, the constrained WST/MST/SST models only allow for 1/120 of the standard WST/MST/SST models' predicted regions.</p><p>The combination of stimulus and model designs allowed us to identify the diagnostic design set for each participant. For the majority of participants who preferred high income to low income in partner selection, the options in the Main set offered a valid tradeoff between attractiveness and financial income, facilitating a strong test of transitivity. They were likely to follow the constrained models with the Alternative set because in the Alternative set, A was both more attractive and more affluent than B, B was both more attractive and affluent than C, etc. On the other hand, for those who preferred low income to high income in partner selection, the Alternative set offered a valid tradeoff between options, facilitating a strong test of transitivity. Likewise, they were likely to follow the constrained models in the Main TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 21 set. We ultimately used the constrained models to precisely identify the data that was diagnostic for transitivity testing, while heterogeneous attribute weighting was allowed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian model selection</head><p>We used the Bayesian approach to penalize models for their flexibility in Directly fitting these models to the choice data for a Bayesian model selection was rather complicated. Fortunately, all the models in  We drew posterior samples from the saturated models using Stan (Stan Development Team, 2020). For each fit to a dataset (i.e., 10 binary choices × 10 repetitions), five independent chains were simulated.

In cases where the two runs identified different best models, the Bayes factors between the two were always close to 1 in both repetitions, with values between 0.87 and 1.08, suggesting that these "inconsistencies" were indeed because the two models explained the data almost equally well. The deviation of posterior model probabilities between the two runs were small, ranging from TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 23 0.00002 to 0.018 (mean = 0.0016, median = 0.0009) across participants and conditions.

With the Main set, men chose the attractive-but-low-income profiles more frequently than women did (F(1,105)=16.03, p&lt;.001, 2 =.11), which was consistent with the idea that men assigned more weight to physical attractiveness but less weight to financial resources than women did. Participants chose attractivebut-low-income profiles more frequently for short-term partners than for long-term partners (F(1,105)=71.69, p&lt;.001, 2 =.13) and the difference between short-and long-term partners was more pronounced for women than for men (F(1,105)=5.08, p=.03, 2 =.01).</p><p>Both men and women were very likely to choose the attractive-and-highincome profiles for long-term and short-term choices with the Alternative set, with all choice proportions above 87% (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref>).

Again, this difference between short-and longterm partners was more pronounced for women than for men (F(1,105)=6.05, p=.02, 2 =.01).

Yet, these numbers were much higher than the counterparts of the LS models.</p><p>The Alternative set showed slightly different patterns. A large proportion of participants' choices were consistent with the transitive models. Many participants' choices were seemingly consistent with the LS models too. This was likely due to the fact that the Alternative sets were non-diagnostic for most of the participants. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref>, seventy-one percent of the data that were consistent with the seven standard models were also consistent with the corresponding constrained models (i.e., the brown bars).

On the individual level, the vast majority of participants were consistent with at least one of the four transitive models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall model performance</head><p>We next examined the transitivity of mate preferences by comparing the standard transitive models against the standard models that allowed for intransitive preferences using the Bayesian method. Here, we combined the Main and Alternative sets for each participant in each condition. For each model, we obtained an aggregate log Bayes factor (BF) against the saturated model by summing up the log Bayes factors across participants. We did this separately for different sexes and different mating conditions as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 3</ref>. Positive values mean that the model outperformed the saturated model whereas negative values mean that the model performed worse than the saturated model. In aggregate, all transitive models outperformed the saturated model with decisive aggregate Bayes factors. The strong stochastic transitivity (SST), in particular, stood out as the best-performing model for both women and men, in both long-term and short-term mating contexts. By contrast, the lexicographic semiorder models rarely outperformed the saturated model, suggesting that our participants' choices were unlikely to follow the lexicographic rules. The only exception was LSEM01, which had an aggregate log BF of 9 for women making  Transitive models also provided the best log BF (against the saturated model) to the vast majority of our participants. Overall, 69% women and 83% men were best described by the transitive models in long-term choice and 89% women and 93% men in short-term choice (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 3</ref> for a detailed breakdown). Notably, SST, the most restrictive transitive model, provided the best fit to 46% women and 61% men in long-term choice and 73% women and 71% men in short-term choice. MST also obtained the best fit to a significant minority of participants. By contrast, lexicographic semiorder models only provided the best fit to a small fraction of participants. LSEM01 best fit 29% women and 14% men in long-term choice and 9%</p><p>women and 8% men in short-term choice. LSEM25 and LSMM provided the best fit to only one dataset respectively. The saturated model provided no best fit at all.</p></div>

In the comparison between transitive models and the saturated model (see the top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 4</ref>), almost all individual-level Bayes factors were greater than 3, supporting the transitive TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 30 models for both men and women, in both long-term and short-term mating contexts.</p><p>A majority of the Bayes factors were larger than 10, providing substantial evidence for the transitive models against the saturated model.</p><p>The pairwise comparisons between the transitive and LS models also suggested that most participants' choices were better described by transitive models</p><p>(2 nd to 4 th rows, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>Violin  Nonetheless, a few participants were best fit by the lexicographic semiorder models. Some datasets even provided non-anecdotal evidence for the LS models (mostly LSEM01) against the transitive models with Bayes factors greater than 3 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 4</ref>). But can we conclude that these participants displayed intransitive mate preferences? To answer this question, we combined the quantitative fits with the qualitative model consistencies on the individual level. We checked whether the participants who were best fit by the LS models displayed obvious TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 33 qualitative violations of transitive models. After close inspection, we found that across mating contexts and sexes, 31 of the 35 datasets best described by the LS models were qualitatively consistent with at least one of the transitive models (see the second columns of each of the four contingency tables in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 5</ref>). Thus, we could not conclude that those participants were using a lexicographic choice strategy. Rather, LS models outperformed transitive models, such as WST or MMTP, likely because the former was more parsimonious than the latter.</p><p>Among the seven participants whose data were qualitatively inconsistent with any of the transitive models, they were qualitatively inconsistent with the LS models either.

The results also suggested that the saturated model was overly flexible and could not outperform other models with model complexity penalized, even when the choice data were qualitatively consistent with none of the substantive models. Note. In each of the contingency tables, "Qualitative" rows indicate the numbers of participants whose data were or were not qualitatively consistent with the transitive models.

Each point represents the proportion of the more attractive option TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 37 being chosen in the pairwise choice, ranging from 0% (the plot center) and 100% (the white circle). For example, with the Main set, the RHS-cluster participants chose A (i.e., the more attractive option) 67% of the time in the pairwise choices between A and B whereas the participants in the LHS cluster only chose A 21% of the time in the long-term context.

Those non-diagnostic design sets were unable to uncover the intransitive patterns even if intransitive patterns could potentially show up. To test this possibility, we ran a robustness check by excluding the non-diagnostic datasets (i.e. the data that can be better accounted for by the constrained models, rather than the standard models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>). Specifically, we  As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, approximately 17% of the datasets in the Main set across conditions were best described by the constrained models, whereas 76% in the Alternative set were best described by the constrained models.

As transitivity testing can be sensitive to the different stochastic assumptions, we involved four prominent transitive models that make different stochastic assumptions. We also involved four prominent intransitive models, including the saturated model and three variants of lexicographic semiorder model <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tversky, 1969)</ref>. We also created stimuli adaptively for each participant, contingent on their attractiveness ranking for each image set, in different mating contexts. These models and designs expanded the scope of our transitivity testing.</p><p>Of course, there were exceptions. In our experiment, seven participants' data were qualitatively inconsistent with the transitive models. From the normative standard of rationality, these participants were less rational in mate choice. However, it has also been argued that the use of simple heuristics can be ecologically rational, even if they sometimes violate traditional standards of rationality such as transitivity (see <ref type="bibr">Todd et al., 2012 for thorough discussions)</ref>. From a cognitive perspective, TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 45 transitive strategies typically require loads of cognitive resources for rigorous calculation whereas simple heuristic strategies were less cognitively costly.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ecologically and socially rational mate preferences</head><p>Rational mate choice, of course, can be evaluated from other perspectives.

Our aggregate results and clustering analysis reveal similar patterns: Most men tended to select the attractive candidate while most women tended to select the higher-income candidate. Of course, this sex difference is not an ideal causal inference in the experiment as men and women dealt with different sets of stimuli. However, this finding is consistent with a large body of existing research on sex differences in partner selection.</p><p>This sex difference may be ecologically rational when we consider our evolutionary roots and social contexts. From an evolutionary perspective, our goals are successful survival, reproduction, and raising offspring. Physical attractiveness is believed to be a signal of high fertility in women and, thus, men's emphasis on physical attractiveness can be an adaptive strategy for maximizing reproductive success <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Symons, 1979)</ref>. In contrast, women's emphasis on financial resources can be due to their obligatory investment in raising offspring, such as pregnancy and TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 46 lactation <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Trivers, 1972)</ref>. Thus, women require more resources to ensure the survival of themselves and their offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kenrick &amp; Keefe, 1992</ref>).</p><p>The sex difference in mating strategy may also be the product of learning in modern societies. Physical attractiveness is widely thought to be socially desirable and thus both men and women seek physical attractiveness in mate choice. However, there is a large gap between men and women in the financial resources and social power they possess, despite the increasing gender equality across the globe. Many societies still have sex-differentiated stereotypes with men acting as resource providers and women acting as home-makers. The sex difference in mate preferences may well be shaped by both the actual gaps and the sex-stereotypical expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eagly &amp; Wood, 1999)</ref>.

Our study considered the most widely discussed attributes in mate choice. However, mate choice in real life typically involves more complex information. In some cases, it might even be implausible to consider all relevant information. Individuals might adopt more cognitively efficient strategies, such as lexicographic rules, even if they may lead to intransitive mate preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mill &amp; Todd, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Grammer et al., 2002)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future work</head><p>Our study has some limitations that could be addressed in future investigations. First, our construction of stimuli did not constitute a complete set of information involved in a typical mating decision. Although our study included the most pervasive and important attributes: physical attractiveness and financial resources, we did not include information such as age, occupation, and personality.</p><p>Undoubtedly those factors shape mate preference, but what is probably more important is that the more complex information may alter participants' decision strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bröder, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Payne et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lenton et al, 2013)</ref>. Lexicographic rules may be used more often in such more complex settings. On the other hand, the face images that conveyed physical attractiveness in the experiment may reveal other information such as perceived trustworthiness and health <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Little et al., 2011)</ref>, although physical attractiveness is believed to be the principal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Little et al., 2011)</ref>. It would be interesting to decompose more relevant information from the face images and integrate them into the experimental test of transitivity. The transitivity of mate preference with more complex information remains an open question.</p><p>Second, we assumed that participants had monotonic preferences along each of the attributes. For example, we assumed that participants always preferred the more TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 48 attractive candidate to the less attractive one, setting aside other attributes. Although this is a reasonable assumption, it has been argued that mate preferences sometimes may depend on the candidate's similarity to themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Buston &amp; Emlen, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that such a similarity-based rule is especially likely to appear when people verbally report their preferences, rather than in preferential choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Todd et al., 2007)</ref>. Our study uses preferential choice tasks and thus is less likely to induce such a similarity-based choice rule. Our monotonic assumption is also consistent with the weighted additive model that outperforms alternative models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brandner et al. (2020)</ref>. Yet, a closer examination of the monotonic assumption would be useful to further justify this assumption.</p><p>Third, our study was restricted to forced choice tasks. Another popular paradigm for experimental testing of transitivity is the binary choice with an indifference option (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hatz et al., 2020)</ref>. This paradigm allows the usage of more general models of stochastic transitivity such as the Weak Order Mixture Model. The mixture model of transitive preference considered in our study is similar to the Weak Order Mixture Model, but it cannot be directly applied to binary choice with indifference option. We look forward to future investigations to test other transitive models with different experimental paradigms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Birnbaum, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, future research can also extend this work to other principles of rational decision making. A good example is the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) axiom, which suggests that the preference between two options should be independent of a third option (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tversky &amp; Simonson, 1993)</ref>. In the TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES 49 context of mate choice, there are likely more than two possible alternatives under consideration. Thus a test of independence (and its violations) would be valuable.</p><p>Studies have found some evidence against IIA both in non-human animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lea &amp; Ryan, 2015)</ref> and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sedikides et al., 1999)</ref>, while few have formalized such a test . Further research can test the independence axiom in mate choice by using systematic evaluation and comparisons of the mathematical models. We hope that future research can extend the decision-theoretic approach to foster a better understanding of human mate preferences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>MST), strong stochastic transitivity (SST, see Falahatgar et al. 2018 for a recent overview), and mixture model of transitive preference (MMTP) (Regenwetter et al. 2011).

If someone perceives that the advantage of B's annual income over A's annual income reaches a threshold, she is likely to choose B with Otherwise, she is indifferent between A and B. threshold values for physical attractiveness and annual income created potentially different preference semiorders for the LS models. As attractiveness was represented by rank orders, the threshold for attractiveness, defined as the difference between rank orders, is on an ordinal scale. The threshold can take five different levels: 1 (meaning that all of the pairwise differences reach the threshold), 2, 3, 4, 5 (meaning that none of the pairwise differences reaches the threshold). Likewise, the threshold for annual income takes five different levels (i.e. ¥1~29,999, ¥30,000~59,999, ¥60,000~89, 999, ¥90,000~119, 999, ¥120,000 or more). That is because, any threshold value between ¥1 and ¥29,999, for example, makes the same prediction regarding the whole set of options, {A, B, C, D, E}. Any threshold value between ¥30,000 and ¥59,999 also makes the same prediction, and so on.The combination of the threshold values along the two attributes and the two sequential orders of evaluation (evaluating attractiveness first or annual income first) created 21 non-redundant preference orders or semiorders for the LS models (seeSupplemental Table S1for the list of non-redundant orders or semiorders).</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="3">TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>17 18</cell></row><row><cell cols="6">0 ≤ ≤ Pr[ ; ] ≤ 1.

LS models can also be equipped with mixture-preference specifications (referred to as lexicographic semiorder mixture model or LSMM). In the LSMM model, decision-makers are assumed to hold a preference semiorder at each point of time, but the preference semiorder may vary from moment to moment. Consequently, the overall choice probabilities are governed by the average of all states of preference orders or semiorders. We follow Davis-Stober (2012) to formally characterize LSMM's predicted region (see<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Davis-Stober et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hatz et al., 2020</ref> for similar applications). As for lexicographic semiorder error models, we considered two possible procedures of decision making in LSMM, allowing decision-makers to treat either attractiveness and annual income as the primary attribute respectively. Finally, we involved the saturated model that allowed for all possible pairwise choice probabilities (see also<ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Sopher &amp; Gigliotti, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Regenwetter et al., 2011)</ref>. The saturated model served as a benchmark model. If someone's data were best described by the saturated model, that means none of the transitive and lexicographic semiorder models provided an adequate account for the data. It is important to note that the intransitive models, including the lexicographic semiorder models and the saturated model, do not exclude transitive preferences.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Saturated model.</cell></row></table><note>Lexicographic semiorder mixture model.</note></figure>

The decision-theoretic approach is uniquely valuable to the study of mate choice rationality, by subjecting the latter to experimental testing. The overall evidence for transitive mate preferences is compelling. A majority of participants' data were best explained by strong stochastic transitivity, the most parsimonious transitive model, in Bayesian model selection. Transitive mate preferences are consistent with the proposals that human mating strategy may be acquired through sexual selection, a process of optimizing individual survival and reproductive success</figDesc><table><row><cell>TRANSITIVE MATE PREFERENCES</cell><cell>43</cell></row><row><cell>Transitive vs LS models</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>).
