<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reckless Gambles and Responsible Ventures: Racialized Prototypes of Risk-taking</head><p>From heroes, adventurers, and investors to villains, daredevils, and gamblers, there are many prototypical examples of people willing to go out on a limb to acquire that all too elusive fruit. Consider which social groups come to mind when asked who takes reasonable and responsible risks versus reckless and impulsive risks. Do these groups differ by race 1 ? Though much is known about how people engage with risk, an empirical understanding of how people mentally represent and associate risk-taking with social groups is largely absent. With the current work, we focus on understanding the mental representations of two prototypes of risk-takersreckless and responsible-and whether such prototypes evoke racial connotations. We propose that these disparate approaches to risk-taking are infused with racialized content. We posit that reckless risk-takers are envisioned (primarily by White residents of the U.S.) as more stereotypically Black (and less White) than responsible risk-takers.</p><p>Conceptual prototypes-or central features of a concept-are useful and important to consider here, because prototypes help organize social perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cantor &amp; Mischel, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fiske, 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rosch, 1999)</ref>. Risk-taking is a broad concept that encompasses a wide range of behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blais &amp; Weber, 2006)</ref>, wherein various prototypes of risk-takers are possible. For instance, consider someone who takes risks without properly considering the negative consequences involved (e.g., an overly optimistic gambler). Now, consider someone who thinks carefully about the downsides involved before making a risk decision (e.g., a well-informed investor). Both are examples of risk-taking; however, the underlying approach and evaluative connotation of these risks vary. Despite this intuitive distinction, little research has focused on how people come to understand others who take risks. Because risk-taking is a common and consequential experience in everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mishra, 2014)</ref>, it is important and interesting to understand how people mentally represent prototypes of risk-takers. Indeed, William James (1895) once asserted, "It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at all" (p. 21), underscoring the relevance of the shared human pursuit of risk.</p><p>We focus on the potential racial connotations of risk-taking given the impactful nature of racial groupings in how humans perceive and evaluate each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fiske, 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dovidio &amp; Jones, 2018)</ref> and the ambiguity of risk behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mishra, 2014)</ref>. Because ambiguity can facilitate racial biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dovidio &amp; Jones, 2018)</ref>, stereotyping might be leveraged in the interpretation of risk-takers. If associations between race and risk exist, then when the meaning of risk-taking is ambiguous, perceivers may use the race of a risk-taker to disambiguate the risk, and perceivers may make inferences about the race of a risk-taker when such information is not explicitly specified.</p><p>Such a pattern between race and risk associations would be evidence of bidirectional stereotyping, consistent with the connectionist model of stereotyping (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cox &amp; Devine, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Eberhardt et al., 2004)</ref>. This model posits that stereotypes can be activated in two basic directions: (1) social group categories can activate attributes (e.g., when prompted with the group "men", the attribute "assertive" may be activated); (2) attributes can activate social group associations (e.g., when prompted with the attribute "assertive", the group "men" may be activated). Strong connections between groups and attributes are considered bidirectional. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cox and Devine (2015)</ref> found that in a predominantly White U.S. sample, the stereotypical attribute of "threatening" is bidirectional with the social group of "Black men."</p><p>This means that when participants listed stereotypical attributes of "Black men," the attribute RACE AND RISK 7 "threatening" was one of the most common attributes reported. The same goes for the reversal: "Black men" was one of the most common social groups reported when participants generated social groups who exhibit the attribute "threatening." However, stereotypes can also be unidirectional, either primarily from a group-to-attribute direction or from an attribute-to-group direction. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cox and Devine (2015)</ref> also found that the stereotype attribute of "works for equal rights" strongly evokes spontaneous connections to Black men; however, that attribute is never activated when listing stereotypes of Black men, representing a unidirectional attributeto-group association.</p><p>Though stereotyping research 2 has traditionally focused more on the group-to-attribute route, attribute-to-group stereotyping is theoretically a rich direction to investigate stereotypic associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cox &amp; Devine, 2015)</ref>. Prior research in this direction has demonstrated the fruitfulness of measuring social group associations from prototypical attributes. When social group membership is not visible, perceivers rely on visible stereotypical attributes to make inferences of social group membership. For example, in the U.S., people with gender-atypical body motions, body shapes, facial features, and fashion preferences are readily inferred to be gay or lesbian <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cox &amp; Devine, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cox et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dotsch et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Johnson et al., 2007)</ref>. In addition to sexual orientation, particular concepts readily activate racial associations. People make stereotypical trait inferences of targets with Afrocentric facial features (i.e., shapes and hues), even if the target is categorically White <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blair et al., 2002)</ref>. Racially ambiguous faces displaying angry expressions tend to be categorized as Black Americans, particularly among racially prejudiced perceivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hugenberg &amp; Bodenhausen, 2004)</ref>. Further, priming crimerelated concepts (e.g., guns) strongly prompts visual attention to Black faces and misremembering Black faces as more stereotypically Black than they actually are <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Eberhardt et al., 2004)</ref>. When categorizing faces that appear "criminal," police officers are more likely to select Black (over White) faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Eberhardt et al., 2004)</ref>. Socioeconomic status prototypes can also evoke racial connotations. Representations of "welfare recipients" and the "poor" summon mental images resembling Black faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brown-Iannuzzi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lei &amp; Bodenhausen, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prototypes of Risk-Takers</head><p>Researchers across the behavioral sciences have largely agreed that risk is most broadly conceptualized as outcome variance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mishra, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mishra et al., 2017)</ref>. Risk-taking refers to selecting (or taking) options with relatively more outcome variance than options associated with less variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Byrnes et al., 1999)</ref>, for which there is the possibility of positive and negative consequences. Absent from this definition is any explicit stipulation of the valence of the behavior, although evaluative connotations can be implied.</p><p>Given this broad definition, taking risks can encompass a wide range of behaviors. From risking one's physical health to financial wellbeing to social reputation and belonging, risktaking emerges across many domains of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blais &amp; Weber, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Levenson, 1990)</ref>. Some approaches to risk-taking could be viewed with a sense of recklessness, such as when people decide to speed, have unprotected sex, use drugs, gamble, or commit crimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barclay et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blais &amp; Weber, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Byrnes et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Duell et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Figner &amp; Weber, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Other approaches to risk-taking, however, might seem more responsible, such as when people decide to donate a kidney, stand up for what they believe is right, initiate a friendship, move across the country away from their family to pursue their career, or invest in the stock market <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Becker &amp; Eagly, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blais &amp; Weber, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Duell &amp; Steinberg, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Patterson et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RACE AND RISK 9</head><p>The range of risks is not just limited to the domain in which the risks are taken, but the risk can vary in how they are engaged or approached. Risks can be taken rashly, without much thought or regard for the potential danger or consequences for oneself or others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnett, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Donohew et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Duangpatra et al., 2009)</ref>. For example, poor self-regulatory competence has been linked to participation in risky behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Magar et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Steinberg, 2010)</ref>. This approach would suggest that risks could be taken even when the potential costs are excessive.</p><p>Alternatively, risks can be taken prudently and calculatedly, with careful thought and consideration of the future consequences of an action <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berman &amp; West, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mishra et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, courageous action involves the pursuit of risks that are appropriate and measured as opposed to reckless <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gal &amp; Rucker, 2020)</ref>. This approach suggests that risks could be pursued in a way that mitigates the unnecessarily high potential for loss.</p><p>Considering this literature, we identify and focus on dual prototypes of risk-taking. The first involves taking risks in thoughtless and ill-considered ways, even though the risk of negative consequences could be quite high. We term this prototype of risk-taking as reckless risk-taking. The second involves risks taken in thoughtful and considered ways, wherein the risks involved would appear reasonable and appropriate. We term this prototype of risk-taking as responsible risk-taking. Although reckless and responsible risk-taking can both involve substantial uncertainty regarding the outcome, it is likely that the greater degree of thoughtfulness integral to responsible risk-taking will generally be associated with lower perceptions of risk involved in the decision. That is, we think that people may intuitively conceptualize risk-taking by naturally tending to conflate deliberation and costs of risks. Further, because people rarely have insight into the thought-processes of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Waytz et al., 2010)</ref>, they may merely draw inferences about deliberation based on the apparent appropriateness of the RACE AND RISK 10 risks taken. Though we center on these prototypes, there are certainly other combinations and dimensions of risk-taking that could be relevant for lay theories of risk-takers; however, we focus our inquiry on prototypes we predict contain racialized stereotype content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial Stereotypes</head><p>Because we are interested in whether different social groups come to mind when considering various prototypes of risk-takers, we must consider potential evidence of risk-taking content in documented stereotypes. As described below, White Americans' stereotypes of Black Americans have been characterized as being relatively negative, masculine, and impulsive, and these qualities may overlap with beliefs about risk-taking, particularly in its more reckless forms.</p><p>As a means to promote, maintain, and justify inequality, Black Americans have been historically stereotyped in a negative light by White Americans <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kendi, 2017)</ref>. Such negative stereotypes that are potentially related to risk-taking include the sexually promiscuous "Jezebel" for Black women, the uninhibited and animalistic "Mandingo" for Black men, and the mediadriven portrayals of Black people as the "dangerous criminal" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Eberhardt et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Goff et al., 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Johnson et al., 2008)</ref>. Further, Black men have been stereotyped as aggressive, angry, oversexed, threatening, and formidable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Calabrese et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Duncan, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Goff et al., 2008a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Hugenberg &amp; Bodenhausen, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wilson et al., 2017)</ref>. Conversely, White people (particularly White men) have been stereotyped in some relatively less negative ways potentially related to risk-taking: ambitious, intelligent, and materialistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Conley et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Petsko &amp; Bodenhausen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Skinner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zou &amp; Cheryan, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Racial stereotypes are also gendered (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Eagly &amp; Kite, 1987)</ref>. For instance, White Americans tend to conflate "Blackness" with "maleness" <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Goff et al., 2008b)</ref>. Black facial cues tend to be phenotypically associated with masculinity, such that Black (but not White) RACE AND RISK 11 ambiguously gendered faces are over-categorized as male <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Johnson et al., 2012)</ref>. Black Americans (relative to White Americans) also tend to be stereotyped as relatively dominant and athletic, consistent with masculine stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Galinsky et al., 2013)</ref>. Gender stereotypes have been found to encompass beliefs about risk-taking: Taking risks is often implied as a stereotype of the male gender role of agency and assertiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Sczesny et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wood &amp; Eagly, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Men in the U.S. have also been consistently stereotyped as more reckless than women over the past fifty years <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Nesbitt &amp; Penn, 2000)</ref>. Indeed, men tend to take more risks than women in a variety of potentially dangerous contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blais &amp; Weber, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Byrnes et al., 1999)</ref>. However, women tend to be more likely than men to take risks in ways that could be viewed as responsible. For example, women are more likely than men to indicate that they would donate a kidney, request flexible working arrangements, confront a friend or colleague about offensive remarks, and advocate for social justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Becker &amp; Eagly, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Morgenroth et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Black people also face stereotypes of impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Duncan, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Williams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wittenbrink et al., 1997)</ref>. Stereotypes of impulsivity-the tendency to act on a whim for shortterm gains, neglecting long-term consequences-may be applied to Black Americans as a function of believing they tend to occupy harsh and unpredictable ecologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Williams et al., 2016)</ref>. Taken together, such negative, masculine, and impulsive stereotypes that surround Black people might lead people to stereotype Black people as relatively reckless risk-takers. Though this literature is suggestive of possible associations of reckless risk-taking with Blackness, such associations have not been directly tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Research</head><p>We sought to understand whether people view risk-takers in racialized ways. No known research has empirically investigated how people perceive risk-takers or whether these RACE AND RISK 12 perceptions are associated with racial groups. First, we tested whether people will perceive Black men as more willing to take risks than White men (Study 1). Next, we sought to scrutinize whether specific prototypes of risk-takers are racialized. We tested whether people (race unspecified) described as taking reckless risks are attributed traits consistent with Black stereotypes (Study 2). Conversely, we tested whether people seen as taking risks responsibly are attributed traits consistent with White stereotypes. In Study 3, we examined whether participants also spontaneously envisioned reckless and responsible risk-takers in phenotypically racialized ways. We tested whether the visual representations of reckless (vs. responsible) risk-takers are perceived as phenotypically more Black (and less White) and attributed more stereotypically Black (and less White) traits.</p><p>In Study 4, we examined the potential consequences of racialized risk-taker associations.</p><p>In a financial investment scenario (with real money at stake for decision-makers), we tested whether visual representations of reckless risk-takers (derived from social perceivers' mental images of this category) are discriminated against in favor of visual representations of responsible risk-takers-resulting in lower pay for individuals whose facial appearance happens to look like a reckless risk-taker (Study 4).</p><p>To confirm that the risk-taking prototypes spontaneously activate racial associations broadly, we examined whether these associations would hold for positive racial stereotypes that are directly unrelated to risk-taking (Study 5). In other words, we were interested in whether people would guess that a reckless (vs. responsible) risk-taker has more Black stereotypic behaviors traits (and fewer White stereotypic behaviors and traits), even when those characteristics are positive (or at least neutral) in valence and unrelated to risk-taking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RACE AND RISK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head><p>Study materials and data for all five studies reported are available on the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://osf.io/vt2wk/?view_only=4aa85e8975af404a818d69ef32ad02a7. The Institutional Review Board approved of the studies reported in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>We tested whether the race of stimulus persons was associated with perceptions of risktaking, broadly construed, and with perceptions of masculinity. Several facial images of Black and White men were rated on perceived masculinity and again on perceived risk-taking. We also tested whether the relation between stimulus race and risk-taking perceptions was mediated by masculinity perceptions. Because it was not the main focus of this paper, the mediation results were reported in the supplement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Design</head><p>A sample of 147 MTurk workers participated in an online study in exchange for $0.50.</p><p>We used the Qualtrics survey platform to conduct our study and sampled the MTurk population.</p><p>The sample (71 women, 75 men, and 1 non-binary individual) consisted of mostly White people <ref type="bibr">(105 White,</ref><ref type="bibr">4 Black,</ref><ref type="bibr">19 Latino,</ref><ref type="bibr">16 Asian,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 8 multiracial)</ref> and their ages ranged from 18 to 71 years (M = 35.88, SD = 11.89). The sample was generally politically moderate (M = 3.72, SD = 1.78, on a 7-point scale from 1 = very liberal to 7 = very conservative).</p><p>This study was a within-subjects design in which all participants rated the perceived masculinity and perceived risk-taking of each of the 60 men (30 Black, 30 White) based on their headshots. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Judd et al. (2012)</ref>, in a design where participants are crossed with condition and stimuli (and are nested within its two levels), a sample size of 30 participants would be sufficient to detect a medium effect at 80% statistical power using 70 stimuli in a two-RACE AND RISK 14 condition study (35 stimuli per condition). We opted to recruit a substantially larger sample size of approximately 150, in order to have the statistical power to detect small effects with greater precision and to have a wider range of respondent diversity than would be captured with only 30 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Materials</head><p>Participants were asked to make two different sets of judgments about facial images: <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>perceptions of masculinity and (2) perceptions of risk-taking. Perceived masculinity was measured by rating the target image from 0-not at all to 100-extremely (sliding scale). Perceived risk-taking was measured with a rating from 0-not at all to 100-extremely. To give participants the same point of reference, "masculine" and "risk-taking" were broadly defined before making respective ratings. Masculinity was defined as having qualities or appearance traditionally associated with men, especially strength and aggressiveness. Risk-taking was defined as the willingness to take risky action in the hope of a desired result. Both definitions were taken from their dictionary meanings to most closely capture how laypeople come to understand these terms.</p><p>Participants rated all faces (randomly presented) on perceived masculinity and then again on perceived risk-taking. To manipulate race, facial images were borrowed with permission from the Chicago Face Database (CFD; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ma et al., 2015)</ref>. The highest-rated racially prototypical facial images of Black men (30 images) and White men (30 images) with affectively neutral expressions were selected. The images were also matched between race conditions on the perception of attractiveness, threat, and age (i.e., the mean ratings of these images did not differ as a function of race).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RACE AND RISK 15</head><p>We examined whether Black faces would be rated as more masculine and more risktaking than White faces. To test our hypothesis, we relied on multilevel models that allowed us to account for the race manipulation to be nested within each participant and stimuli as crossed random factors. As recommended by Judd et al. <ref type="formula">2012</ref>, we included a random intercept for stimuli and allowed target race to vary randomly across participants (i.e., response = target race + (1 | stimuli) + (target race | participants)). The first multilevel model analysis yielded a fixed effect of stimulus race on perceptions of risk-taking in the predicted direction, Mdiff </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These results supported our hypothesis that Black men are judged as more likely to take risks than White men. We examined whether a race-risk association can be directly detected accounting for the idiosyncratic features of stimuli. Using multilevel modeling and treating sample stimuli as a random factor, we observed relatively little variance between stimuli within racial categories (random effects variance due to stimuli = 16.26), suggesting that the observed effects were most likely due to the stereotypical activation of the racial categories (random effects variance due to racial category = 149.04). By taking these steps, we were better situated <ref type="bibr">RACE AND RISK 16</ref> to conclude that the observed effects are driven by the concept of race and not by any particular stimuli. Because we measured perceived masculinity before perceived risk-taking, it is worth noting that participants may have been primed to associate risk-taking with race. This finding supported the predicted racial association with taking risks, and the subsequent studies illuminate a more nuanced understanding of the race-risk connection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>The first study provided evidence of a Black male association with generalized risktaking. We next examined whether more specific forms of risk could provide a more nuanced and precise understanding of the racialized nature of risk-taking representations. We investigated two distinct prototypes of risk-taking: reckless and responsible. Because Black stereotype content can be relatively negative, masculine, and impulsive, we expected that the race associations of risk may manifest as an association between Blackness with reckless risk-taking as well as between Whiteness and responsible risk-taking.</p><p>We first examined whether racial associations are evident in people's trait representations of these prototypes of risk-takers. Specifically, participants were randomly assigned to nominate traits of one of the risk-taker prototypes, and then we tested whether the traits nominated differ in how stereotypically Black and White they are perceived to be. We predicted that the traits nominated for reckless risk-takers to be rated as more stereotypically Black (and less stereotypically White) than the traits nominated for responsible risk-takers. We preregistered our hypotheses on OSF: https://osf.io/6yhwd/?view_only=d2a4ace14c634c268110f520576e9418.</p><p>We explored whether masculinity and femininity of traits differed between risk-taker prototypes. We also tested whether the predicted racialization of each risk-taker category could be explained by other features associated with the traits selected. Considering that reckless and RACE AND RISK 17 responsible risk-taking likely connote differences in valence, we tested whether positivity alone accounted for any racialization differences between the risk-taker prototypes beyond other possible qualities, such as class, age, and gender associations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Participants</head><p>This experiment has a single, between-subjects factor: target risk-taker (reckless, responsible). A total sample of 304 MTurk workers participated in an online study in exchange for $0.60. We used Qualtrics to conduct our study and sampled the MTurk population using TurkPrime sampling services. Given that we did not have an effect size with which to calculate an a priori power analysis, we planned to target a relatively large sample of 150 participants per condition. We thus planned to recruit approximately 300 participants to have enough statistical power to detect medium-sized effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ledgerwood, 2018)</ref>. The sample (180 women, 121 men, 2 transgender individuals, and 1 non-binary individual [options were not mutually exclusive, in that all options that apply could be selected]) consisted mostly of White people (203 White, 37 Black, 33 Latino, 26 Asian, 7 Middle Eastern, and 11 multiracial) and their ages ranged from 18 to 70 (M = 31.85, SD = 9.77). The sample was generally well-educated (44.4% indicated having a bachelor's degree or higher) and politically moderate (M = 3.72, SD = 1.47, with the 7-point scale from Study 1). In this study (and the subsequent studies), we used a quality control feature to prevent access to those who do not pass basic English comprehension checks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Materials</head><p>Participants were told that the researchers were interested in which personality traits people associate with various social roles. Participants were then told that they would see a checklist of personality traits and were requested to look them over and select all traits that represent the category randomly assigned: either responsible risk-takers or reckless risk-takers.</p><p>Participants were then provided with a brief definition of whichever risk-taker prototype they were assigned. Responsible risk-takers were described as "people who take chances to achieve things they desire, but they carefully consider the potential downside that may be involved; they are willing to take risks only when the potential costs are reasonable." Reckless risk-takers were described as "people who take chances to achieve things they desire, without really considering the potential downside that may be involved; they are willing to take risks even when the potential costs could be quite high."</p><p>Participants were next requested to take a moment to consider what personality traits are associated with the risk-taker prototype and then were directed to select all traits that represent the risk-taker prototype from 99 traits presented in a randomized order. The personality traits presented were taken from a stereotype checklist commonly used in stereotyping research <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Galinsky et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Katz &amp; Braly, 1933;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Petsko &amp; Bodenhausen, 2019)</ref>. Consistent with the approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Petsko and Bodenhausen (2019)</ref>, after making their initial nominations, participants were subsequently presented with their nominations and were then asked to select the top ten traits that are the best representative of the risk-taker category.

Using these Blackness and Whiteness scores for each trait, we computed how stereotypically Black and how stereotypically White each participant's top ten traits were, on average. We used the same procedure to calculate how masculine, feminine, positive, old, and high status were the traits selected for each of the risk-taker prototypes.</p><p>Using the trait ratings of these dimensions, we conducted exploratory mediation analyses using Hayes (2017) PROCESS examining the effect of the risk-taker category on the stereotypical Blackness outcome with positivity, socioeconomic status, oldness, masculinity, and femininity as simultaneous mediators (with 5000 bootstrap samples). We then repeated this analysis with stereotypical Whiteness as the outcome.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our preregistered hypotheses were confirmed, such that the trait representations of reckless (vs. responsible) risk-takers were more stereotypically Black and less stereotypically White. These findings emerge even though the race of the risk-takers was never indicated or implied, suggesting that the racialization of risk-takers occurred spontaneously. This study builds on our initial evidence of a generalized Black-risk association by providing a more nuanced picture concerning the ways risk-takers are racialized, such that Black stereotypes appear to be specifically associated with reckless risk-taking more strongly than risk-taking broadly.</p><p>We found that the racialization of risk-takers was not simply reducible to the generally negative and positive valences potentially associated with these risk-taker prototypes. In fact, the perceived Whiteness of these risk-taker prototypes was not mediated by valence. Perceived</p><p>Blackness was mediated by multiple other factors beyond positivity. The racial distinction between risk-taker prototypes was not simply a function of how negative or positive it is perceived to be. Moreover, there are multiple factors seemingly contributing to this pattern, and the effects cannot be reduced to any single factor tested as none of them were full mediators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>We have provided evidence of a generalized Black-risk association when evaluating the perceived risk-taking propensity of Black and White men (Study 1). We also found that racial stereotypes overlap with two prototypes of risk-taking (Study 2). Given that trait representations of risk-takers evoke social content, we wanted to test for convergent evidence by examining whether the visual images people picture of risk-takers are also racialized.</p><p>We asked whether people envision reckless and responsible risk-takers in racially differentiated ways and whether this visualization corresponds with how stereotypes of risk-RACE AND RISK 26 takers are racialized. We investigated the imagined facial phenotypes of responsible and reckless risk-takers using the reverse correlation task. The reverse correlation task is a method that aggregates perceivers' selections of randomly varying visual stimuli to produce a twodimensional spatial representation of the targeted mental representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brinkman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dotsch &amp; Todorov, 2012)</ref>. The visual stimuli are created by overlaying many random noise patterns over the same base image. Participants classify these created stimuli on some construct (such as a social group category, emotion, or trait), and then their classifications are aggregated to produce a composite (or classification image or CI) of the target construct. We can also construct composite images based on the faces that were not chosen in the dichotomous choice trials (or the anti-classification image or anti-CI), which by definition are deemed less representative of the target construct than the chosen images. The anti-classification images may conceptually resemble the opposing ends of the target dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dotsch &amp; Todorov, 2012</ref>), because we define reckless and responsible risk-taking as opposing constructs. To examine perceptions of classification images, a different set of participants rate the CI on a dimension of interest and then compare these ratings to that of a CI produced with a different construct of interest and/or to the anti-CI.</p><p>We examined whether the trait representations attributed to the visual constructions of the risk-taker prototypes are racialized (and gendered). We predicted that the traits attributed to the reckless risk-taker image would be stereotypically more Black (and masculine) as well as stereotypically less White (and feminine) than the traits attributed to the responsible risk-taker</p><p>image. Because anti-CIs represent the conceptual opposite of what participants imagined the target construct to look like, we expected the opposite pattern of results for the anti-reckless and anti-responsible images, providing convergent evidence of racialization. We anticipate this RACE AND RISK 27 pattern because reckless and responsible risk-taking are theoretically opposing constructs, given the definitions provided to participants.</p><p>We also tested whether the racial and gender phenotypicality of reckless risk-takers and responsible risk-takers would significantly differ. We expected ratings of phenotypic Blacknessto-Whiteness and masculinity-to-femininity (both on a single continuum) to be higher for reckless than responsible risk-takers. We expected the opposite pattern for the anti-reckless and anti-responsible images. To be transparent, we collected additional classification judgments regarding the concept of a "reluctant risk-taker" for exploratory purposes, but these data were outside the primary focus of this paper, so the data are available on OSF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4</head><p>We have found that people attribute traits (Studies 2-3) and envision facial features (Study 3) of the reckless risk-taker prototype as Blacker than the responsible risk-taker prototype. Given that these risk-taker prototypes differ in racial stereotype content, they may be related to consequential kinds of social disparities and racial discrimination. For example, financial disparities in the U.S. exist based on race, such that Black Americans own less wealth and financial market share than White Americans (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pfeffer et al., 2013)</ref>. To better understand the psychological processes that may contribute to such disparities, we examined whether racialized risk-taker prototypes facilitate financial discrimination.</p><p>In the context of making investment decisions, we examined whether people would financially discriminate against an individual who resembles the visual prototype of a reckless risk-taker in favor of someone who resembles a responsible risk-taker, in a context where people are financially motivated to maximize benefit and minimize loss. We tested whether people would differentially entrust their money to ostensible investors. The presented visualizations of the investors were the collective mental images of reckless risk-takers and responsible risk-takers constructed in Study 3 (from the reverse correlation task). Recall that these images were rated as having markedly racialized phenotypes. After making initial reckless-responsible ratings of the investors, we endowed participants with 25¢ to allocate between two investors that could result in a payout ranging from tripling their investment to complete loss. This payout ostensibly depended upon how well participants allocated their investments to previously successful investors, providing only investors' visualized facial images to make their decision (the reckless and responsible risk-taker labels were concealed; participants only had the images to based their decision). Participants were also told that the more they allocate money to an investor, the more bonus pay the investor will receive. Given that we did not provide any relevant information on how well the visualized investors performed, the rational decision would be to allocate the investment evenly between investors to maximize the return. Moreover, to fulfill goals to be or appear egalitarian, participants should have been motivated to allocate evenly so each investor is paid equally. However, if participants believed they could make more money by investing in one investor more than the other, participants' self-interest would have been in opposition to motivations of diversifying financial risk or social egalitarianism.</p><p>We had three preregistered hypotheses. We predicted the reckless (vs. responsible) risktaker image would be allocated less money to be invested (H1). As a manipulation check, we predicted the reckless (vs. responsible) risk-taker would be rated as more reckless/less responsible (H2). Further, we predicted the effect of risk-taker image on investment allocations would be mediated by reckless-responsible perceptions (upon the advice of reviewers, this is reported in the supplement because it was a peripheral hypothesis; H3).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Participants</head><p>In a within-subjects design, participants reported their ratings and investment allocations well-educated (64% indicated having a bachelor's degree or higher) and politically moderate (M = 3.67, SD = 1.74; the same 7-point scale used previously).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Materials</head><p>Participants were told that they would review two people who ostensibly participated in a past study. They were told that these previous participants were asked to examine an array of financial stock that varied in potential benefit and risk and then select and financially invest in the stock they thought was most likely to return the greatest profits. Consistent with previous cover story approaches to evaluating classification images (e.g., Brown-Iannuzzi et al., 2017), RACE AND RISK 39 participants were told that some of these "investors" were more and some less successful in their selections. Participants were next shown two (supposedly) randomly selected investors to rate to what extent these investors appear reckless to responsible. These two images were actually the mental images constructed of reckless and responsible risk-takers in Study 3. To explain why the investor images looked "fuzzy," we provided a cover story that the researchers obscured the images of the investors' privacy. We then provided participants with an opportunity to earn bonus pay. We allotted participants with a 25¢ endowment that they could invest, with potential outcomes ranging from tripling their endowment to losing it all. Participants were tasked to make their investment by allocating their 25¢ endowment between the presented investors. Participants were informed that the payout of their investment depended on how well they allocated the money between the investors who were successful in their selections. We also told them that more money allocated to each investor will result in more bonus pay for them. This means the decision participants made involved a stake for themselves as well as for the target they were making a decision about. Upon completion of their ratings, allocation, and finally some exploratory measures, participants answered a few demographics items and then were debriefed.</p><p>We measured investment allocations by instructing participants to enter the number of cents from their endowment (0¢ to 25¢) in the textboxes adjacent to the pictured investors (presentation order randomized). Allocations were required to total 25¢. We measured the extent to which the two pictured investors were perceived as reckless/reckless with the following items using 9-point semantic differential scales: (1) reckless-cautious, (2) irresponsible-responsible,</p><p>careless-careful, (4) thoughtless-thoughtful, (5) inconsiderate-considerate, and (6) imprudentprudent. The presentation order of the traits was randomized. Reckless-responsible perceptions were scored by averaging the items together (McDonald's ω = .97), such that higher scores reflect greater perceived responsibleness (and lower recklessness). For exploratory purposes, we measured participants' levels of financial investment propensity, confidence, and knowledge. We reported the details and results of the exploratory measures in the supplement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>When the monetary interests of the participant and the target were at stake, we found clear evidence that participants were more willing to invest their money with someone who looked like a more phenotypically White, responsible risk-taker than with someone who looked like a more phenotypically Black, reckless risk-taker. Because we did not provide any relevant information to make investment decisions (participants were only provided the grainy reverse correlation images from Study 3 to make their decision), the rational response would have been to allocate their money evenly across investors to increase the chances of getting more money and decrease potential loss. However, given that discrimination was observed, the racially-RACE AND RISK 41 suffused appearance of the targets was potentially considered useful information in making allocation decisions. Given that the sample was composed primarily of White people, our findings are consistent with the tendency people have to be more willing to take risks with ingroup (vs. outgroup) members as a function of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cruwys et al., 2021)</ref>. These findings indicate that people are willing to discriminate against others who visually fit racially stereotypic notions of recklessness (in favor of those who fit stereotypic notions of responsibility) when their money is at stake, even though this decision would ostensibly disadvantage the bonus pay of the participant. If reckless (vs. responsible) risk-takers are more likely to be associated with Blackness (as we found in Studies 2-3), the findings of this study raise the possibility that reckless risk-taker stereotype content may contribute to psychological processes that facilitate discrimination against Black people in investment situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5</head><p>Our findings thus far have established an association between the concept of reckless risk-taking and Black stereotype content, as well as responsible risk-taking and White stereotype content. However, given the methodological approaches taken, there are some possible explanations for these associations that it would be helpful to rule out. The first possibility is that the stereotypes attributed to the reckless versus responsible risk-takers are based simply on valence (i.e., halo or horned effects). Although the Study 2 mediation analyses suggest that trait valence is only part of the story, more evidence on this issue would be valuable. The second possibility is that there may simply be semantic overlap in the stereotypes of Black Americans and reckless risk-takers, such that reckless risk-taking may not have been causally activating cognitive associations with Blackness, but merely occupying similar semantic space with Black stereotypes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RACE AND RISK 42</head><p>To address these concerns, we examined extrapolative stereotyping (i.e., using racial stereotypes to make guesses about others' unknown characteristics; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bruner, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Craig &amp; Bodenhausen, 2018)</ref>. By demonstrating that participants would engage in extrapolative racial stereotyping of reckless risk-takers in positive and neutral ways (e.g., viewing the target as likely to be a good dancer or post social media content about basketball), we strengthened the evidence that our results involve the application of Black stereotypes broadly, rather than mere reliance on negative valence when making inferences about reckless risk-takers. In this study, participants reviewed target information indicative of someone who either takes risks recklessly or responsibly (via their ostensible Twitter profile), without any specification of race. Participants then indicated how likely the target would be to post tweets that convey stereotypically positive Black or White content suggestive of user race, and rated the target in terms of positive and neutral racially stereotypical traits that are not directly related to risk-taking. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We had four primary hypotheses. We predicted that participants would indicate that the Twitter user with the reckless (vs. responsible) risk-taker profile would be more likely to post stereotypically Black tweets (H1) and be less likely to post stereotypically White tweets (H2).</p><p>Third, we predicted that participants would apply the positive/neutral Black stereotypic traits more to the reckless (vs. responsible) risk-taker target (H3).

Though much is known about how people come to make risky decisions, we know very little about how people make sense of the risk-takers themselves. Understanding which groups in society are viewed as the risk-takers is an important psychological question for person perception, stereotyping and prejudice, and decision-making research. The current research was the first known attempt to specifically examine perceptions and prototypes of risk-takers and whether these prototypes evoke racial connotations.</p><p>We posited that perceptions and mental representations of risk-takers would evoke racial connotations. Given the negative, masculine, and impulsive stereotypes of Black Americans <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Eberhardt et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Galinsky et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Goff et al., 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Goff et al., 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Johnson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Johnson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Williams et al.,</ref>  We acknowledge that valence is a relevant factor in distinguishing risk-taking prototypes and racial stereotypes. Even though valence is an important and interesting factor to consider when studying how people think about risk-taking, the observed differences in meaning attributed to risk-taker prototypes does not appear to be only explained by valence. This is It is worth noting that even though we are only examining the content of stereotypic associations (and not the origin or accuracy of such associations), there is evidence to suggest that Black people may be less likely than White men to engage with dangerous forms of risk RACE AND RISK</p></div>

This would make such Black-recklessness associations potentially contradictory with who is actually more willing to take reckless risks.</p><p>Our research was the first to consider risk-taking as an object of racialized perception and a component of stereotype content. Our findings offer a new way to think about how people understand, feel, and react toward others. Consideration of risk opens possibilities to integrate risk and risk-taking into existing social perception and stereotyping frameworks. For example, the "big two" dimensions of social perception and stereotype content research are agency and communion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fiske, 2018b)</ref>. The agency dimension-which comprises the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>It is also worth considering the limitations of the current research as well as future directions. In Study 1, we defined masculinity in terms of strength and aggression. Given the negative connotations of aggression, future work will be helpful for ascertaining whether stereotypical associations between Blackness and masculinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Johnson et al., 2012)</ref> also emerge if masculinity is described in strictly positive terms. Agentic perceptions of masculinityassertiveness, strength, and aggression-have long characterized masculinity in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Eagly et al., 2020)</ref>, which is why we focused on these aspects of masculinity. However, given that the attribute "aggressive" was well-represented in the reckless risk-taking traits selected from Studies 2-3, the definition of masculinity we provided in Study 1 may have contributed to a relationship between masculinity and (reckless) risk-taking. We addressed this concern by, in the subsequent studies, focusing our examination on two specific prototypes of risk-taking (i.e., reckless and responsible) rather than risk-taking broadly construed.</p><p>Considering construct validity, it is plausible that participants construed responsible risktaking as being less risky than reckless risk-taking. Indeed, we theorized that the levels of riskrelated deliberation and risk intensity are intuitively related. Although we find evidence of these dual prototypes of risk-takers to be meaningful in evoking racial associations, it is certainly likely that there are other relevant prototype configurations and dimensions to consider for racial and other social associations in the risk domain. Such alternatives involve deliberately taking extremely high risks (such as willingness to sacrifice one's safety or resources for another person or cause) or thoughtless low-risk behavior (such as doing relatively mundane tasks). Other dimensions potentially relevant in the social perception of risk-takers could involve the altruistic RACE AND RISK 52 or selfish aims of the actor, the involvement of short-vs. long-term self-regulation, the outcome resulting from the risk taken, or individual characteristics of the perceiver.</p><p>The context in which the risks are taken could also be relevant. The proposed risk-taking prototypes may partially reflect different stereotypically racialized risk-taking domains. For example, participants may see White people as more likely to take risks in stereotypically White domains (e.g., investing, poker, or extreme sports), while seeing Black people as more likely to take risks in stereotypically Black domains (e.g., slot machines, lottery, or substance misuse).</p><p>This area is ripe for more nuance and exhaustive classification of risk-taker perceptions and their relations with various social groups. The exploration of the social perceptions of risk-taking as a multidimensional construct is worthy of future inquiry.</p><p>On a more specific note, new research that appeared after Study 3 was conducted has raised concerns regarding an increased Type I error rate from the reverse correlation method using group classification images in a two-phase rating process (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cone et al., 2020)</ref>. However, there are several factors that help alleviate these concerns in the current studies. The first is that we observed a very large effect of the composite images on perceived risk-taking (d = 1.31) in a very well-powered design (99% power to detect a d ≥ .27) for the additional sample (Study 4), which suggests that even if we adopted a much more conservative alpha level (e.g., alpha =</p><p>.0005) to address the inflated Type I error rate, differences would still be statistically significant (exact p = 8.76 × 10 -38 ). Secondly, these recklessness ratings serve as evidence that the images we used were capturing facial cues associated with perceived risk-taking, as intended. The key differences in racial perceptions (Study 3) and reckless/responsible perceptions (Study 4) that we observed were large (ds &gt; .70), highly statistically significant (ps &lt; .001), and statistically well-powered, but as with all findings, replication is necessary. In this case, future studies relying on individual-level classification images will be particularly useful.</p><p>Although we found evidence that people were willing to differentially entrust their investment with targets depicted using the racialized images, this is not direct evidence of racial discrimination. It is possible that other differences between the images were responsible for participants' disparate treatment. One way to approach this concern would be to experimentally manipulate target race and test whether people invest less in the Black target relative to the White target, and whether this hesitancy is mediated by perceptions of reckless riskiness.</p><p>However, such a test would be likely complicated by social desirability concerns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Janus, 2010)</ref>, especially in this time of increased attention to issues of racial injustice. A successful design would need to get around this issue.</p><p>Our sample consisted of a majority of White MTurk workers residing in the U.S. It is unclear whether we should expect such processes to extend to other racial groups or to people outside of the U.S. It may be the case that race-risk associations are culture-specific and are held and used by White Americans as a way to rationalize or justify specific patterns of racial inequality in the U.S. context. But it is also possible these associations are recognized by other groups, potentially including Black Americans, since stereotype content can be acquired implicitly, and we did not exclude people of color from analyses. Future research should determine whether our findings generalize to other populations and cultures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>The reported research not only has theoretical significance for person perception, stereotyping, and decision-making but also highlights a potential psychological phenomenon that  <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(van Ryn et al., 2006)</ref>. These are just a few examples in which raciallybased biases in risk assessments could have life or death consequences in healthcare.</p><p>Stereotypes about risk-taking might also contribute to systemic inequalities in a variety of financial domains. U.S. mortgage lenders have been found to charge borrowers in predominantly Black neighborhoods contract rates substantially above competitive market rates even though the default rates did not differ by borrower race or ethnicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kau et al., 2012)</ref>. Further, Black borrowers were especially targeted during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and received lending rates far above the market for White borrowers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bocian et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Faber, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mayer &amp; Pence, 2008)</ref>. Students graduating from Historical Black Colleges and Universities were found to be charged substantially higher interest rates on borrowing student loans than students from predominantly White institutions (Student Borrower Protection Center, 2020).</p><p>Consideration of how Black people can be stereotyped as reckless risk-takers may also shed more light on the pernicious processes that promote racial bias in policing. An outcry for RACE AND RISK 55 racial justice was triggered in response to the brutal murders of unarmed Black Americans-George Floyd and Breonna Taylor-at the hands of police officers. According to researchers, Black men face approximately a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by the police in the United</p><p>States, a rate twice that of their White male counterparts, with Black women also disproportionately at risk <ref type="bibr">(Edward et al., 2019)</ref>. Black men were, by far, found to be the highest risk group for police-cause fatality, such that police violence is among the leading causes of death for young Black men in the U.S. <ref type="bibr">(Edward et al., 2019)</ref>. Such disparities were theorized to manifest from an array of possible psychological biases among systemic influences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kahn &amp; Martin, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Swencionis &amp; Goff, 2017</ref>). To answer the pleas to focus on and eliminate police violence perpetrated against communities of color, more research is needed on the psychology of racial bias in policing to better understand and effectively address this pressing and urgent issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Goff &amp; Kahn, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Knox &amp; Mummolo, 2020)</ref>. Given that use of force involves making decisions under risk, Black stereotype content that contains reckless riskiness may distort officer perceptions and facilitate discrimination.</p><p>Considering our results, we suggest that it is possible that medical providers, financial lenders, and police officers might use race as a proxy for estimating risk, presumably as a way to rationalize or justify discrimination. Even the phrase "at-risk", commonly employed to describe Black Americans across various domains and statistical disparities, might signal stigmatizing associations between Blackness and riskiness. Future research should look at whether professionals in these industries exhibit race-risk biases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RACE AND RISK 56</head><p>Though much is known about how people come to understand and engage in risky decisions, the current research is the first known attempt to investigate how people make social sense of the risk-takers themselves, particularly concerning race. We asked who in society is viewed as the risk-takers. We shed light on a novel racial bias in the social perception and stereotyping of risk-takers. Our findings suggested that mental representations of risk-takers evoke racial connotations, such that stereotypes about and perceptions of Black people are associated with notions of riskiness and recklessness. We further found that the use of these mental representations of risk-takers in financial decisions can have costly consequences. Results provided a foundation for informing theory and synthesizing research on person perception, stereotyping and prejudice, and decision-making. Implications of the current findings are potentially relevant to research and real-world situations in which risk assessments of people are common and consequential.</p></div>

We found that Black We also found that this generalized race-risk association can be accounted for by gendered race associations, such that Black targets were perceived as more risk-taking because they were perceived as more masculine than White targets.

These findings suggest that perceivers envision responsible risk-takers to be more warm and friendly than reckless risk-takers. As with the warmth findings, responsible risk-takers are pictured as having a stronger moral character than reckless risk-takers. The communal findings were expected as taking responsible and thoughtful risks poses less harm to others than taking reckless and potentially dangerous risks. Responsible risk-takers were envisioned as more competent than reckless risk-takers. This finding was anticipated as one of the primary differences in which responsible and reckless risk-takers were described was by the RACE AND RISK 75 thoughtfulness of the risk-takers' approach. Risk-takers did not differ on how assertive they were pictured. This was anticipated as assertiveness is considered an attribute of risk-takers, generally.</p></div>

Given this between-subjects design (two-tailed; alpha = .05), we needed at least 260 participants to have adequate power (.80) to detect a small-to-medium effect (d = .35; G*Power software; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Faul et al., 2009)</ref>. A total sample of 262 MTurk workers participated in an online study in exchange for $0.75. We used Qualtrics to conduct our study and sampled the MTurk population using TurkPrime sampling services. The sample (124 women, 137 men, 1 transgender, and 1 non-binary [gender categories were not mutually exclusive]) consisted of mostly White people <ref type="bibr">(200 White,</ref><ref type="bibr">15 Black,</ref><ref type="bibr">18 Latino,</ref><ref type="bibr">31</ref> Asian, 1 Middle Eastern, 2 Native American, and 8 multiracial) and their ages ranged from 20 to 73 (M = 38.67, SD = 11.80). The sample was well-educated (61% indicated having a bachelor's degree or higher) and politically moderate (M = 3.25, SD = 1.79; 7-point scale used previously).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and Measures</head><p>Participants were told that this was a study about how people perceive risk-takers and that there are two distinct forms of risk-takers. Participants were then provided with the reckless and responsible risk-taker definitions provided in Studies 2-3 (order of presenting the definitions was randomized). Participants were then told they would be shown a series of tweets ostensibly from a real person and that their identity has been masked to protect their privacy. Participants were provided with four experimental tweets ostensibly written by a Twitter user. The content of these tweets indicated the target user was either a person who takes reckless risks or responsible risks.</p><p>The message content embedded in the reckless risk-taker tweets included, </p><p>"Nothing like investing in your first home!", and (3) "Invest in a moderate growth diversified fund? Deal me in." Two filler, mundane tweets were included and were constant across conditions. Tweets were presented in a randomized order after the initial abstract risk-taker tweet (i.e., "…Take risks, RECKLESSLY/RESPONSIBLY…") to provide a frame of reference to interpret the subsequent more specific risk-taker tweets. To neutralize the race and gender of the Twitter user, we used initials for the user's name and Twitter's default image (an anonymous grey avatar) for the user's profile image. See OSF for the stimulus materials.</p><p>After reviewing the tweets, participants were asked to indicate the degree to which the presented attributes likely apply to the target. This was a measure of racial stereotype application. Finally, participants answered a few demographics items and then were debriefed.</p><p>We tested stereotype application by directing participants to indicate the degree to which each of the stereotypic traits likely applies to the target, from 0 = Not at all to 100 = Extremely. Stereotypic traits were taken from research on racial stereotype content <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cox &amp; Devine, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wittenbrink et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zou &amp; Zheryan, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>As a manipulation check, we measured the extent to which each tweet was perceived as coming from reckless/responsible risk-taker with the following bipolar pair using 9-point scales: </p></div>

The Twitter profiles used to manipulate the reckless risk-taker prototype (front) and the responsible risk-taker prototype (back).After reviewing the profile, participants were asked to describe their initial impressions of the Twitter user in a few sentences to engage with the presented information more deeply. As a check of the manipulation, participants were then asked to rate how reckless/cautious, irresponsible/responsible, careless/careful, and thoughtless/thoughtful the target appeared usinga 9-point semantic differential scale. Reckless/responsible perceptions were scored by averaging the items (McDonald's ω = .98), with greater scores indicating more responsible (and less reckless) perceptions. Participants were then asked to indicate how likely it was that the target would post each of a set of presented tweets, using an 11-point scale from not at all likely (1) to very likely (11). Participants were presented with 10 different tweets (with user information redacted) one at a time to rate; half of the tweets involved stereotypically Black content and the other half involved stereotypically White content. Racial implications of the tweets were established via pretesting; the stereotypically Black set of tweets differed strongly from the stereotypically White set of tweets in terms of racial connotations (d = 3.09, p &lt; .001, N = 99) but did not differ in perceived valence (d = 0.08, p = .390, N = 100); further, both valence means were well above the midpoint (5) of scale (means ranging 7.63 to 7.75), indicating that the tweets across conditions were perceived rather positively, on average (see the supplement). Sample tweets that were stereotypically Black included, "I was shooting hoops all weekend with my boys," "Respect for the true pioneers of hip hop," and "My momma's mac and cheese is top tier, no cap." Stereotypically White Tweets included, "What a sweet day for golfing on the greens," "Let's get ready to rock and roll," and "Have you guys ever had kombucha? It's so life changing." The RACE AND RISK 46 presentation order of the stereotypically Black and White tweets was randomized, with the individual tweets within each racial categorical randomized. Responses to the stereotypically Black (McDonald's ω = .84) and White (McDonald's ω = .68) Tweets were averaged, with higher scores indicating a greater perceived likelihood that the target would post the tweet. Participants were then asked to indicate the degree to which the presented racially stereotypical attributes likely applied to the target, from 0 = Not at all to 100 = Extremely. Black stereotypic traits included the following (averaged): streetwise, acts cool, can dance, and likes hip hop (McDonald's ω = .84). White stereotypic traits included the following (averaged): wealthy, intelligent, educated, and successful (McDonald's ω = .93). Higher scores indicated</figDesc></figure>

Although racial stereotypes are generally confounded with valence, such that dominant groups are generally viewed more favorably than subordinated groups, there are clear and specific themes described within these broad evaluative tendencies. The present findings indicate that risk-taking propensities constitute one such descriptive theme.Consistent with the argument made by Cox and Devine (2015), our findings-that prototypes of risk-taking can activate racial stereotypes-provided a compelling case to further consider the study of attributes that activate social group associations. Our findings suggest that understanding the effects of risk-taking prototypes on assumptions about perceived race can be revealing and meaningful in situations when risk-taking is presented absent of clear indications of race (e.g., when attempting to identify suspects of crimes involving risky behavior, such as distribution of illicit substances, reckless driving, or embezzlement).</figDesc></figure>

The distinction between reckless and responsible risk-taking could potentially reflect assertive risk behavior at low (reckless) and high (responsible) levels of competence. Future research should consider how perceptions of risk-taking and risk-aversion operate with other social perception dimensions (e.g., communion) as well as whether risk-taking content is contained in stereotypes of other social groups (e.g., based on age, class, occupation). Taken together, our findings suggest that perceptions and mental representations of risktakers connote racial associations, such that observers tend to (a) perceive Black people as more willing to take risks than White people, (b) associate reckless risk-takers with stereotypically Black traits, including phenotypic Black appearance, and also extending to positive as well as negative stereotypes (relative to responsible risk-takers), and lastly (c) such associations can have costly consequences.</figDesc></figure>

Results of Study 1 confirmed this hypothesis at the broadest level of risk, such participants tended to rate Black men as being more risk-taking and more masculine than White men. In Study 2, we found robust evidence of racialization of the trait representations of more specific prototypes of risk-taking, such that participants nominated stereotypically Black traits for reckless risk-takers and stereotypically White traits for responsible risk-takers. In Study 3, we found convergent evidence that people racialized visual representations of risk-takers, such that participants constructed facial images of reckless risk-takers that were attributed traits and perceived as more stereotypically Black (and masculine) and less stereotypically White (and feminine) than the facial images constructed of responsible risk-takers. In Study 4, we found people are willing to financially discriminate based on a target's visual appearance matching racialized prototypes of reckless versus responsible RACE AND RISK 49 risk-takers. In Study 5, we provided more direct evidence that the reckless (vs. responsible) risktaker prototype elicits application of Black stereotypes broadly, beyond negative valence per se.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
