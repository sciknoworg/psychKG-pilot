			<abstract>
				<p>Researchers have found significant utility in approaching choice from a behavioral economics lens. Recently, this framework has begun to be extended to the description and prediction of clinical-ethical choice. Here, researchers have found that common behavioral economics effects occur with clinical-ethical choice at the group level (e.g., framing effects, effort discounting, delay and probability discounting) and at the individual level (probability discounting). The current study sought to examine: the sign effect in ethical probability discounting, the commodity effect between monetary and ethical outcomes, and correlations among rates of monetary and ethical discounting, probability matching with money, and ethical theory preference. We observed: a sign effect with ethical outcomes consistent with past probability discounting research; a commodity effect with monetary outcomes discounted more steeply than ethical outcomes; no significant correlations among discounting tasks; and one of 12 statistically significant correlations between ethical theory preference and ethical discounting. In total, the present work further demonstrates the presence of behavioral economics effects with ethical decision-making. However, choice with ethical outcomes may not easily be predicted by choice with other commodities, measures in behavioral economics, or ethical theory preference.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Specificity and Generalized Ethical Outcomes Among Probability Discounting, Probability Matching, &amp; Ethical Theory Preference</head><p>Behavioral economics is a term that claims historical roots in several distinct disciplines.</p><p>As the name implies, behavioral economics attempts to describe and predict human behavior through the interaction of principles, processes, and logic from the disciplines of economics and behavior science. From the economics side comes the idea of commodity value and the assumption that people make decisions based on the momentary value of each commodity (or commodity bundles) involved in a choice situation. From the behavior science side comes methods for precisely observing and quantifying commodity value at the individual level; as well as precision in how molecular and molar contingencies might interact to determine the momentary value of a commodity based on an organism's current state and learning history.</p><p>Researchers and practitioners have repeatedly demonstrated the utility of taking a behavioral economics approach to account for behavior considered detrimental to the health of an individual or the larger community in which they live. For example, researchers have repeatedly shown the association between individuals' rates of discounting and demand and: substance abuse and misuse (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vuchinich et al., 2023</ref><ref type="bibr">), diet (e.g., McClelland et al., 2016</ref>, physical activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Phillips et al., 2020)</ref>, preparation and response to severe weather (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gelino &amp; Reed, 2020)</ref>, medical decision-making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bruce et al., 2016)</ref>, and public health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Strickland et al., 2022)</ref>. Across the many studies conducted in this area, a behavioral economics framework has shown utility in two ways. First, in precisely identifying the value of reinforcers and punishers that maintain unhealthy behavior patterns. Second, in predicting the likely success that people will have if they contact behaviorally-oriented interventions to reduce unhealthy behavior and to increase pro-health behavior.</p><p>The success of using behavioral economics to describe, predict, and control human choices suggests it might be a useful approach for understanding other decisions that people make on a regular basis. For example, researchers have recently begun to use a behavioral economics framework to describe choice related to clinical-ethical outcomes. For example, Experiment 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cox (2021)</ref> found that manipulating the cost/effort, framing as gains or losses, and framing around social preferences systematically influenced ethical choice in the same direction as past behavioral economics literature. Across both studies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cox (2021)</ref>, the researcher also found that what people claimed as the right thing to do (descriptive ethical behavior) appeared functionally distinct from why they claimed it was the right thing to do (normative ethical behavior); a finding that has been challenged for replicability and relevance to clinical-ethical choice in behavior analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bailey, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Cox and Javed (2023a) extended the above work by examining the role of probability discounting in ethical decision-making at the individual level. These researchers recruited 15 practicing behavior analysts and 30 non-behavior analysts. Each participant made 81 choices with varying probabilities that the ethical decision would cause short-term harm and be observed by others (i.e., televisibility). They had three primary findings. First, choice was systematically influenced by probabilities similar to past work in probability discounting. Second, participants' individual ethical choice could be predicted with over 80% accuracy using only the variables within the decision context. Lastly, practicing behavior analysts and non-behavior-analysts differed in the degree to which short-term harm and televisibility influenced choice, thus, highlighting potential areas of practical ethical disagreement in practice settings.</p><p>One limitation to past work extending the behavioral economics literature to ethical decision-making is that researchers have asked about highly specific clinical-ethical choices that someone might face. Another common finding from the behavioral economics literature is called the "commodity effect" (aka "outcome specificity"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cox et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rung &amp; Madden, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>That is, different reinforcers and punishers influence choice differently for different people, and choice with one reinforcer or punisher is not always predictive of choices with different reinforcers or punishers for the same individual. In the work presented here, we wanted to examine outcome specificity more directly as it relates to ethical choice. In so doing, choice with ethical outcomes could be examined more directly for being described, predicted, and controlled similarly to other outcomes tested by researchers using a behavioral economics approach.</p><p>A second limitation to past work testing specific clinical-ethical choices is the number of putative ethical decision contexts people might contact. It would be extremely tedious and time consuming for researchers to systematically test the hundreds or thousands of different clinicalethical decision contexts practitioners might face and relative to all known variables that influence choice. Developing a robust scientific evidence base around functional ethics could take decades and limit short-term practical applications of behavior analytic approaches to clinical-ethical decision-making. Thus, in the work presented here, we wanted to examine what happens with ethical choice when we move away from heavily detailed clinical-ethical contexts to more generalized ethical choices. And, in so doing, might we find patterns of choice that may generalize and allow us to predict choice across multiple decision contexts (a la discounting as a trait; Odum, 2011).</p><p>In sum, the purpose of this study was to further examine the suitability of a behavioral economics framework for describing, predicting, and manipulating ethical decisions. We did this in three ways. First, we tested outcome specificity by using common probability discounting tasks to compare choice with monetary outcomes and choice with ethical outcomes. Second, we tested how well we could predict ethical choice by comparing rates of probability discounting to patterns of choice on a brief probability matching assessment. Lastly, we sought to examine whether the results of a preference assessment <ref type="bibr">(MSWO;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">DeLeon &amp; Iwata, 1996)</ref> for ethical theories would allow us to predict the practical ethical choices made by participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. Thirty participants were recruited from the experimental platform Prolific (www.prolific.co). Prolific is an online platform where researchers can post research tasks and experiments for people throughout the world to sign up and work as a participant in exchange for monetary compensation. Participants were recruited for a study titled, "A study about decisionmaking with various financial and ethical outcomes." with the following description:</p><p>In this study, you will complete five total tasks involving choices between two outcomes that vary in the probability they will occur as well as the amount of hypothetical payoff.</p><p>There is no right or wrong answer. We are just interested in which option you would prefer.</p><p>Potential participants could sign up for the task if English was their first language, they had a minimum approval rate of 90 and a maximum approval rate of 100. Participants were compensated with a variable amount of money such that the earned hourly rate equated to $12.00 per hour for all participants. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the demographics for participants who completed the study.</p><p>After completing the informed consent process, all participants completed a series of six tasks: four of the tasks were probability discounting tasks; one was a probability matching task;</p><p>and one was a preference assessment for ethical theories.</p><p>Probability Discounting Tasks. All four discounting tasks were 5-trial adjusting probability tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cox &amp; Dallery, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jarmolowicz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Miranda et al., 2018)</ref>. For these tasks, participants were presented with an initial choice between a 50% chance of a larger outcome occurring and a 100% chance of a smaller outcome occurring <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). Following each choice, the probability of the larger outcome was adjusted by 50%/n where n is the trial number (e.g., second trial adjusted by 50%/2 = 25%; third trial adjusted by 50%/3 = 16.67%) and rounded to the nearest whole percentage for ease of presentation. For a full description of how these tasks work, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cox and Dallery (2016)</ref>, Jarmolowicz and colleagues (2016), or Miranda and colleagues (2018).</p><p>Two of the probability discounting tasks involved hypothetical monetary outcomes. One of these tasks involved gaining hypothetical money and the second involved losing hypothetical money. For both monetary discounting tasks, the smaller certain option was fixed at $50 and the larger uncertain option was fixed at $100 for all choices. That is, the smaller, certain option was always half the amount of the larger, uncertain option. 5-trial adjusting probability tasks were used given their efficiency in obtaining an indifference point that can be used to generate a rate of probability discounting similar to adjusting amount tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cox &amp; Dallery, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jarmolowicz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Miranda et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The third and fourth probability discounting tasks involved hypothetical ethical outcomes. We used a similar approach to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bruce et al. (2018)</ref> to adapt the 5-trial probability discounting tasks to ethical outcomes. Specifically, we exchanged the dollar amounts for the non-monetary outcome of interest which was the participant's "morals and ethics". To maintain the adjusting amount structure to quantify a rate of ethical discounting, the smaller, certain ethical outcome was always half the amount of the larger, uncertain option. Ethical gains were framed as behavior that complies with the participant's personal morals and ethics; and ethical losses were framed as behavior that violates the participant's personal morals and ethics. Past research has found that behavior analysts and non-behavior analysts alike will discount probabilistic ethical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cox &amp; Javed, 2023a)</ref>. Thus, 5-trial adjusting probability tasks were used given their efficiency in obtaining an indifference point that can be used to generate a rate of ethical probability discounting. Probability Matching Task. The probability matching task involved four, 10-trial blocks (40 total trials; <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The probability of the larger, uncertain option was always set such that the expected value of both options were equivalent. This allowed us to isolate the influence of probability on choice as opposed to the overall amount that could be earned from each option. Further, similar to counterbalancing with matching tasks generally, two of the blocks involved a choice between: (a) 10% chance of getting $100 and (b) 100% chance of getting $10; and two of the blocks involved a choice between: (a) 20% chance of getting $50 and (b) 100% chance of getting $10. The order of which each option was presented was counterbalanced across blocks.</p><p>The participant's bank always began at $0 for the first trial within each block. Following a selection of the certain option (100% chance of getting $10), the participant's bank was increased by $10 for the next trial. Following a selection of the uncertain option (20% chance of getting $50; 10% chance of getting $100), the task was programmed such that a random real number was drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. If the random real number was less than or equal to the associated probability, the participant's bank was increased by the larger, uncertain amount for the next trial. If the random real number was greater than the associated probability, the participant's bank did not change for the next trial.</p><p>Preference Assessment Ethical Theory. The final task that all participants completed was a preference assessment for ethical theory <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). Specifically, participants were asked to rank five ethical statements from most-to-least important when deciding whether something is the "right thing to do" or the "wrong thing to do". Each of the five statements described a unique ethical theory from the following list: utilitarianism (maximize benefit, minimize harm); deontology (rules, laws, and duties relevant to the situation); virtue theory (adherence to a virtuous behavior); ethics of care (social relationships among relevant people); or contract theory (social contracts agreed upon). In case the participant's preferred an ethical theory alternative to the five listed, five "Other (please write in)" options were provided. Similar to an MSWO preference assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DeLeon &amp; Iwata, 1996)</ref>, participants could only choose a single option as most preferred, a single option as second preferred, and so on.</p><p>Data Analysis. All quantitative analyses were conducted using the statsmodels <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Seabold &amp; Perktold, 2010)</ref>, pingouin <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Vallat, 2018)</ref>, scipy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Virtanen et al., 2020)</ref>, or scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Pedregosa et al., 2011)</ref> packages for Python (version 3.9.13). The data and code used for the analyses can be found at <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cox and Javed (2023b)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the demographic data for the 30 participants who completed this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The majority of participants self-identified as "White or Caucasian" (n=25; 83.33%), earned between $25,000-$49,999 or $75,000-$99,999 annually (n=7; 23.33%), and had earned a Bachelor's degree (n=14; 46.67%). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the results of monetary and ethical probability discounting. The h parameter represents that rate by which increasing the odds against (decreasing the probability) contacting a consequence reduces the value of the consequence. The rates of discounting are logged to normalize the distribution for more robust parametric statistical analysis. Across all probability discounting tasks, each marker represents the rate of discounting for one participant; the white star represents the arithmetic mean of all participants from that task; and the box-plot shows the minimum (lower line extending from the box), 25th percentile (lower edge of the box), median (line in the middle of the box), 75th percentile (upper edge of the box), and the maximum (upper line extending from the box) excluding outliers (diamond markers; defined as and value 1.5 times higher or lower than the interquartile range).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability Discounting</head><p>We observed both sign and commodity effects across monetary and ethical outcomes.</p><p>Specifically, similar to past research, participants discounted monetary gains slightly more than monetary losses (d=0.21); and, novel to this study, participants discounted ethical gains more than losses (d=0.78). We also observed a commodity effect. Monetary losses were discounted more than ethical losses (d=0.87) and monetary gains were discounted slightly more than ethical gains (d=0.20). Of note, however, is that the sign effect for monetary outcomes and commodity effect between monetary and ethical gains favored the null hypothesis (monetary sign effect: BF10=0.29; commodity effect for gains: BF10=0.24). With a N=30 and using a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, correlation coefficients greater than 0.45 or less than -0.45 are required to reach statistical significance. None of the correlations reached the level of statistical significance and, thus, none of the rates of discounting within and between outcome types were associated with each other in this study. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the results of the probability matching task. The left panel shows the average proportion of trials for all participants that the first option was chosen in each choice block (y-axis) as a function of the probability of contacting reinforcement for choosing the uncertain option (x-axis). At the group level, probability matching described choice well (r 2 =0.99; MAE=0.02) with participants showing undermatching (sensitivity/slope=0.72), and a slight bias (y-intercept) for the first alternative (bias=0.15).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability Matching &amp; Ethical Decisions</head><p>The right two panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> show the probability matching fit metrics for each individual participant. The probability matching equation accounted for more than 60% of the variance in responding for 21 of the participants (70%) and for more than 80% of the variance in responding for 17 of the participants (57%). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the fit metrics for the 17 participants for whom the probability matching equation described their data well (suggesting their sensitivity and bias parameters are interpretable). For these participants, the estimated mean (median) sensitivity was 0.41 (0.41) and estimated mean (median) bias was 0.22 (0.16). <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows a correlation matrix between probability matching parameters and discounting parameters for participants where the probability matching equation described their data well (r 2 &gt;0.8). With a N=30 and using a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, correlation coefficients greater than 0.52 or less than -0.52 are required to reach statistical significance. Under these criteria, we observed a statistically significant: negative correlation between matching sensitivity and matching bias (r = -.81); positive correlation between probability matching sensitivity and monetary gain discounting (r = .54); and negative correlation between probability matching bias and ethical violation discounting(r = -.55). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the results of the ethical theory preference assessment. At the group level, the distributional order whereby participants claimed an ethical theory was most important when deciding whether something is the right or wrong thing to do was: deontology, utilitarianism, virtue theory, contract theory, ethics of care. In addition to general rankings, there are two important observations of the data in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. First, any instance where a participant ranked one of the five primary ethical theories as a '6' indicated that they wrote an answer into one of the "Other" boxes and ranked it ahead of one of the ethical theories. Second, all ethical theories were ranked in each of the five possible locations (i.e., 1-5). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows a correlation matrix between individual participant ethical theory preference rankings and rates of ethical probability discounting. With a N=30 and using a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, correlation coefficients greater than 0.52 or less than -0.52 are required to reach statistical significance. Under such criteria, the only statistically significant correlation was a negative correlation between participants' preference for utilitarian ethical theories and discounting ethical violations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference Assessment Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we presented participants with three types of tasks: monetary and ethical probability discounting, probability matching, and ethical preference tasks. Responses were then analyzed at both the individual-and group-level, within and between tasks. Overall, four main findings are worth noting. First, we observed a sign effect when discounting ethical outcomes consistent with past discounting research. Second, we observed a commodity effect between discounting ethical and monetary outcomes. Third, rates of discounting and probability matching parameter estimates were largely uncorrelated. Fourth, ethical theory preference varied widely across participants and was largely unrelated to ethical discounting. Each of these will be discussed in turn.</p><p>The first major finding were sign effects consistent with previous discounting studies.</p><p>Replicating past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Estle et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Green et al., 2014)</ref> and suggesting there was nothing atypical or unique about the recruited sample, we observed that monetary losses were discounted more steeply than monetary gains. Novel to this study, we observed that ethical losses were also discounted more than ethical gains. This is a situational comparison. That is, in life, participants might find themselves in one of two unique situations. In one situation, they have to choose between two actions that will both lead them to violate their ethics or morals but where one is a smaller, certain violation and the second is a larger, uncertain violation. In a second situation, they have to choose between two actions that both adhere to their ethics or morals but where one is a certain, minor adherence and the second is an uncertain, greater adherence. The data in the present study suggest these participants are more likely to choose the smaller, certain violation and the uncertain, greater adherence-all else being equal.</p><p>We also found that the effect size for the sign effect was about four times greater for ethical outcomes (d=0.78) than for monetary outcomes (d=0.21). It is unclear exactly how this finding fits with previous literature. Past researchers have studied how gains and losses differentially influence discounting with monetary outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Estle et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Green et al., 2014</ref>) and non-monetary outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asgarova et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bruce et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bruce et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jarmolowicz et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jarmolowicz et al., , 2019</ref>. However, we were unable to find researchers who measured the sign effect across multiple commodities in a single study. Thus, there are many future research opportunities to better understand if the difference in sign effect sizes observed here were specific to ethical outcomes vs. monetary outcomes or would be common across outcomes with varying levels of fungibility and perishability <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Holt et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Past researchers have also found that sign effect sizes likely vary as a function of the amount gained or lost (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Estle et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Green et al., 2014)</ref>. This may also have played a role in the present experiment. While we were able to precisely define the amount of monetary outcomes gained and lost, the amount associated with personal morals and ethics was framed ambiguously and, therefore, may have been perceived as involving greater or lesser "amount" for each participant. This may explain why we found greater variability in rates of ethical probability discounting compared to monetary probability discounting. Regardless, many future research opportunities exist around identifying methods to more precisely define ethical outcome amounts so that researchers and practitioners can more precisely describe and predict the influence of ethical outcomes on ethical decision-making.</p><p>The second major finding was a commodity effect between discounting of monetary and ethical outcomes (aka outcome specificity). Specifically, monetary outcomes were discounted more steeply than ethical outcomes (though a reminder the Bayes Factor favored the null hypothesis for gains). Participants were willing to take more risks (choose the more uncertain outcomes), if those risks involved money as compared to their morals and ethics. These findings differ from past work in cross-commodity discounting. For example, researchers have compared delay discounting between money and food (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fazzino et al., 2022)</ref>, alcohol (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Moody et al., 2017)</ref>, methamphetamine (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Yoon et al., 2018)</ref>, and weight loss (Sze et al., 2017); and researchers have compared probability discounting between money and leisure activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hirst &amp; DiGennaro Reed, 2016)</ref>. The typical finding is that monetary outcomes are discounted less steeply than non-monetary outcomes. We found that monetary outcomes were discounted more steeply than ethical outcomes.</p><p>One hypothesis for why monetary outcomes tend to be discounted less steeply than nonmonetary outcomes are differences in the fungibility and perishability of money compared to non-monetary outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Holt et al., 2016)</ref>. That is, money is exchangeable for many different outcomes (highly fungible) and maintains its utility for a longer period of time (less perishable).</p><p>One's status relative to maintaining ethical values might be considered a form of social currency that, perhaps, allows one to influence others' behavior across a greater range of situations than money (moral licensing; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Polman et al., 2013)</ref>. And, in many religions, one's ethical status is argued to outlast any wealth gained in their lifetime making the perishability characteristic potentially relevant to moral and ethical outcomes. Combined, these could explain why monetary outcomes were discounted-on average-more steeply than ethical outcomes. However, much future research likely will be needed to determine whether this effect is replicable and what happens when the amount of ethical outcomes are defined more precisely.</p><p>The third major finding was that rates of discounting and probability matching parameter estimates were largely uncorrelated. No statistically significant correlations were observed between rates of discounting monetary and ethical outcomes. Further, no significant correlations were observed between rates of discounting monetary and ethical outcomes with participants for whom probability matching accounted for more than 80% of the variance in their choice. We did observe statistically significant positive correlation between discounting monetary gains and probability matching sensitivity (also a monetary outcome). And, we also observed a statistically significant negative correlation between ethical violation discounting and probability matching bias. In total, the results in the current study add to past research that rates of discounting with one commodity may not be predictive of rates of discounting with other commodities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cox et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rung &amp; Madden, 2018)</ref>. The results also suggest that different approaches to measuring reinforcer value also may not be predictive of each other as with discounting and matching in the present experiment where two of the eight possible correlations were statistically significant.</p><p>The fourth major finding of the current study involved measuring ethical theory preference and its relation to ethical discounting. We found the most-to-least preferred ranking of ethical theory preference at the group level to be deontology, utilitarianism, virtue theory, contract theory, and ethics of care. When comparing ethical preference with ethical discounting, the only statistically significant correlation occurred between preference for utilitarianism and discounting ethical violations (r = -.53). That is, as preference for a utilitarianism approach to ethical decision-making increased, participants were more likely to choose a larger-uncertain ethical violation. Overall, however, that one of the 11 correlations between ethical theory preference and ethical decision-making were statistically correlated suggests that what ethical choice is made (descriptive ethics) is likely to be functionally distinct from why they claim their choice is best (normative ethics). This is consistent with past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cox, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>There were several limitations to the current study that offer many opportunities for future research. First, to our knowledge at the time of writing, this is the first study to conduct a formal preference assessment for common ethical theories. Past research has measured which theories best describe participants' claims about why their choice is "right" or "wrong" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cox, 2021)</ref>. But, those measures involved a participant's post hoc justification of a decision made and a researcher's best guess of the underlying ethical benchmarks that described their verbal behavior. In contrast, the present study systematically measured participants' a priori preferences for explicitly defined logical benchmarks to assess ethical decisions, outside of decision contexts. Though the method used parallels preference assessments with robust experimental support (i.e., MSWO), it is unknown the extent to which this method for assessing ethical theory preference is reliable, valid, and practically useful.</p><p>A second limitation was that we used a novel, brief probability matching task to obtain matching parameters. Historically, researchers examining probability matching have applied concurrent schedules of reinforcement to a participant's choice until responding is stable. Only then would the concurrent schedules be changed, continue until responding was stable, etc.</p><p>Under such arrangements, participants often contact hundreds of trials across varying concurrent schedule arrangements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fantino &amp; Esfandiari, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Newell et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Otto et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, participants in the current study contacted 40 trials total, 10 at each concurrent schedule arrangement, and schedules changed regardless of stability. This difference from past research is likely why probability matching described well only 57% of participants' choice. We chose this route for the sake of efficiency given the constraints of a single-session, human operant study with multiple tasks and delivered online. Researchers interested in comparing within-subject choice from many behavioral economic tasks will have to identify methods leading to probability matching in more participants while reducing the total number of trials such as with temporal matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Klapes et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Klapes et al., , 2021</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the above mentioned areas for future research, the general theme of the present work highlights many directions for future research. Leaving behind the specifics of ethical decision-making, a generalized question behind the current work is how predictive different measures of choice from a behavioral economics lens are to one another. Biological organisms are rather complicated. They dynamically change their physiological and environmental conditions over time. They also continuously allocate behavior among many schedules of reinforcement and punishment that are associated with many types of phylogenetically and ontogenetically reinforcing and punishing stimuli. Working toward more precise and momentary predictions of behavior requires understanding how choice that defines a repertoire fits together into a comprehensive whole. One approach might be to expand variables considered within a single model of choice (e.g., concatenated matching law, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Davison &amp; McCarthy, 1988)</ref>. A second approach might be to identify how multiple models fit together like LEGOS™ to account for behavior in specific contexts (e.g., resurgence as choice; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Shahan &amp; Craig, 2017)</ref>. Regardless of the approach, much work remains to move the description, prediction, and control of choice from isolated decision contexts to repertoire-encompassing models.</p><p>In summary, the current work extended previous research by demonstrating that ethical choice can be described well by a probability discounting framework. We observed a sign effect consistent with previous research and a commodity effect suggesting people discount money and ethical outcomes differently. We also extended past preference assessment research to measure preference for ethical theories used to justify why something claimed as "right" is, in fact, "right" and, in so doing, replicated past research that descriptive and normative ethics appear to be functionally distinct. Finally, when the above was combined with patterns of choice on a brief probability matching task, we observed that monetary discounting of gains and losses, ethical discounting of gains and losses, estimated probability matching parameters with monetary outcomes, and ethical theory preference were largely unrelated. In total, this work replicates past findings that ethical claims are behavior and, therefore, subject to the same processes as all other behavior. But, much work remains to understand how choice in varying behavioral economics tasks aggregate into a behavioral repertoire.
