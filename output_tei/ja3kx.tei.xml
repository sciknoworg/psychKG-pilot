			<abstract>
				<p>Moral decision-making involves a complex interplay between cognitive reasoning and emotional forces. This paper presents a theoretical model that formalizes moral decision processes using a sigmoid function to balance conative (driving) and inhibitory (restraining) forces. Each force is represented as a vector whose intensity is quantified on a standardized scale, allowing the model to compute an emotional score. The probability of action is then determined by applying a sigmoid transformation to this score. The model is illustrated through case studies, including Heinz&apos;s Dilemma and The Betrayed Husband Scenario, demonstrating how emotional and contextual factors influence decision-making. The paper also explores the empirical calibration of the sensitivity parameter , which modulates decision reactivity, and discusses the limitations of linear addition in capturing non-linear and cumulative emotional effects. Additionally, we propose an extension incorporating priming effects and contextual variables, such as social pressure or temporal influences. Future research directions include empirical validation through psychophysiological measurements (EEG, fMRI) and the integration of dynamic temporal adjustments to refine predictive accuracy. This approach aims to bridge the gap between affective-cognitive mechanisms and quantifiable decision models, with applications in moral psychology, behavioral sciences, and artificial intelligence ethics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction: Theoretical Foundations and Methodology</head><p>The core methodology uses a sigmoid function to provide a continuous interpretation of the probability of action. This function balances the intensity of conative (driving) and inhibitory (restraining) forces to determine whether an action will be taken or not. It is important to clarify, however, that in this model, both conative and inhibitory vectors (denoted as and , respectively) are treated as positive values. Unlike traditional approaches where inhibitory forces are often represented with a negative sign to indicate aversive or inhibitory valence (as in psychological and emotional contexts), this model uses only positive values for both and . This change is made to avoid the complications of negative scaling while maintaining a valid mathematical framework for empirical analysis. Both conative ( ) and inhibitory ( ) vectors are expressed as positive values, with no negative signs, avoiding the complexities of negative scaling. So, the model incorporates an emotional intensity scale ranging from 1 to 5 . This scale reflects the emotional charge associated with each decision, where 1 indicates the weakest emotional force and 5 represents the strongest. The intensity of each force, whether conative or inhibitory, is thus quantified along this scale, which allows the model to capture the complexities of moral decision-making while remaining grounded in measurable, empirical terms.</p><p>In a state of ataraxia, where emotional effusion is absent and the individual remains indifferent to the decision at hand, the emotional score is equal to zero. This reflects a perfect equilibrium between conative and inhibitory forces, creating a condition where the individual is neither driven to act nor restrained by inhibitive influences. This state serves as a baseline, representing a condition of emotional neutrality and decisional indifference.</p><p>However, it is essential to recognize that this model, while theoretically robust, should be considered as a thought experiment that requires validation through empirical studies. The quantification and objectification of the 'vectorial forces' representing conation and inhibition, driven by ingrained moral values, must be carried out within the context of an ambitious project that integrates social psychology and neuroscience. Earlier versions of this model used a discrete activation rule to model the emergence of conative or inhibitory forces. In this binary framework, a force was activated only if the ideological valence of a value and its alignment with the telos produced a positive directional match. While this logic-based formulation offered clarity, it could not capture gradual misalignment or internal ambivalence, which are critical features of real-world moral cognition.</p><p>The transition to a continuous, geometrically structured framework-using a sigmoid activation function-was designed to overcome these limitations, allowing a smoother and more realistic representation of affective modulation.</p><p>Such a project would involve the measurement of these forces under controlled, standardized conditions and the establishment of a normalization framework to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the values associated with different moral systems.</p><p>In this context, it is crucial that the emotional values associated with moral decisions be aggregated in a way that reflects the values of a socially shared system. These values must be averaged or otherwise combined to provide a meaningful representation of the emotional forces that drive moral decisionmaking. A simple arithmetic mean could be one method of aggregation, but alternatives such as weighted averages, where certain values are given more importance based on their social or cultural prevalence, could offer a more nuanced representation of collective moral frameworks.</p><p>This model is situated within the broader axiodynamic framework. Axiodynamics refers to the formal modeling of behavior based on the structured interaction between emotionally encoded values and affective dynamics. It considers both the long-term value structures that shape decision-making and the fluctuating emotional forces that modulate action. We also introduce the concept of mémotions, defined as short-lived, affect-laden memory traces that influence immediate decisions but do not possess the stability of long-term values. Unlike deep-seated moral convictions, mémotions are transient and sensitive to recent experiences, media exposure, or social cues. They are especially relevant for understanding rapid shifts in moral engagement and emotional reactivity in volatile contexts.</p><p>This model draws on the theoretical contributions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sunstein (2003)</ref>, who highlights the tension between impulsive and reflective moral decision-making. As Sunstein argues, Much of everyday morality consists of simple rules that generally make sense but that fail in certain cases. It is wrong to lie or steal, but if a lie or a theft would save a human life, lying or stealing is probably obligatory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> This supports the notion that moral decisions are not always dictated by absolute rules, but can be influenced by situational factors, a point central to our model's flexibility in accounting for context.</p><p>Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Wang et al. (2021)</ref> reinforce the idea that moral decisions are driven by both cognitive and emotional dynamics, supporting the integration of emotional forces into the model. As they note, Moral decision-making refers to a process comprising all stages experienced by an individual, from the emergence of moral problems to the process of exhibiting a specific behavior. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> This underscores the need to account for both cognitive and emotional influences in moral decisionmaking, which is essential for understanding the dynamics of the model. Moreover, to empirically calibrate the parameter , experiments measuring participants' responses in moral dilemmas, such as Heinz's Dilemma, alongside physiological markers (e.g., heart rate variability or hormonal assays), will be essential. This calibration process is vital for adjusting the model's sensitivity to the emotional forces represented by and .</p><p>It is worth noting that this model represents an evolution from earlier conceptualizations of affective forces in axiodynamic frameworks. Initially, these forces were formulated through a discrete activation rule, but the current approach embraces a geometrically continuous framework that better captures the nuanced interplay between conative and inhibitory forces in moral decision-making processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Limitations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Limitations of Linear Addition: Towards a Non-Linear Modeling of Conative and Inhibitory Forces</head><p>While the current sigmoid-based formulation improves on earlier linear models, it also represents a departure from prior discrete activation models. In these earlier axiodynamic formulations, affective forces emerged only when the ideological valence and the directional projection of a value were strictly aligned-resulting in an on/off logic. Such binary modeling was useful to formalize moral clarity, but it could not handle ambiguous cases where partial alignment or conflicting drives coexisted.</p><p>The present approach thus replaces linear summation and binary logic with a nonlinear, differentiable transformation. By applying a sigmoid function to the emotional score (the difference between ( ) and ( )), it allows graded probability of action, better capturing internal tension and emotional ambivalence.</p><p>The current model's reliance on simple vectorial addition between conative ( ) and inhibitory ( ) forces seems inadequate to capture the full complexity of their interactions. Let us consider a general example where each vector is composed of several elements, such as values or memotions.</p><p>Imagine that an individual faces a moral dilemma, where they must decide whether to act impulsively (to save a life, for instance) or suppress this impulse due to potential legal consequences. The conative vector might then be composed of values like "Moral urgency" (rated at 4) and "Immediate need to act" (rated at 3), resulting in a total = 4 + 3 = 7. Similarly, the inhibitory vector might include memotions like "Fear of legal consequences" (rated at 5) and "Respect for social norms" (rated at 4), resulting in a total = 5 + 4 = 9.</p><p>The calculation of the emotional score E (the difference between and ) would then be = -= 7 − 9 = −2. According to this approach, the probability of action would be determined by applying a sigmoid function, but this method does not account for the potential interactions between these various values and memotions. For example, the combination of strongly opposing forces might create a more complex tension than what is suggested by the simple addition of the vectors. This simplification could overlook non-linear dynamics, where the combined intensity of the forces may be amplified or attenuated in a non-proportional manner, thus affecting moral decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Incorporating Contextual and Temporal Dynamics: Practical Implications for Model Improvement</head><p>While the current model provides a solid foundation for understanding moral decision-making, it does not fully account for the dynamic nature of real-world decision processes. In particular, the model could benefit from the inclusion of contextual variables, such as social influences, environmental factors, and cultural differences, that may modulate emotional responses and decision-making tendencies. For instance, the emotional intensity associated with certain values might vary significantly depending on the individual's social context or current circumstances (e.g., urgency, peer pressure, or societal expectations). Incorporating these contextual factors would provide a more comprehensive representation of the complexities inherent in moral decision-making across diverse situations.</p><p>Additionally, the model, in its current static form, does not account for temporal dynamics of decisionmaking, where emotions and values evolve over time in response to changing experiences or new information. Moral decisions are rarely made in isolation; they are often influenced by prior decisions, evolving emotional states, and accumulated experiences. Integrating these temporal dynamics could improve the model's ability to predict real-time decision-making, particularly in long-term scenarios or repeated moral dilemmas. The inclusion of such factors would not only enhance the accuracy of emotional quantification but also allow the model to better reflect the adaptive nature of human decision processes in response to evolving personal and social contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Premises and Methodology</head><p>It is important to emphasize that the present article offers a formal theoretical proposition rather than an empirically validated model. While the proposed framework is inspired by empirical findings in psychology and neuroscience, it currently lacks systematic experimental validation. Future studies will be needed to calibrate the model using physiological and behavioral data. As such, this paper should be understood as a conceptual foundation for subsequent empirical research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Evolution from Discrete to Continuous Vectorial Framework</head><p>The conceptualization of affective forces in axiodynamic modeling has evolved from an initial binary formulation to a continuous vectorial approach. In earlier versions, the emergence of a conative or inhibitory force was determined by a coherence function based on two factors: the ideological valence of a value and its contextual directional relevance.</p><p>Let:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• val( ) ∈ [−5, +5</formula><p>] represent the ideological valence of the value ,</p><p>• dir( ) ∈ {−1,0, +1} encode the contextual orientation of with respect to the situation.</p><p>The product of these two variables defined a coherence score:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Coh( ) = val( ) ⋅ dir( )</formula><p>A discrete activation rule followed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">{ = (|val( )|) if Coh( ) &gt; 0 = (|val( )|) if Coh( ) &lt; 0 = = 0 if Coh( ) = 0</formula><p>This Boolean rule allowed only values that were both positively valenced and directionally aligned with the current situation to generate force vectors. While it offered a clear-cut structure for modeling action versus inhibition, it was unable to capture intermediate emotional states, internal conflicts, or the probabilistic nature of moral hesitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Continuous Model Based on Sigmoid Function</head><p>The proposed model is based on a continuous function that quantifies the probability of action, determined by the difference between two opposing forces:</p><p>• Conative vectors (Vc): Represent the driving forces encouraging action, often linked to emotional or ethical motivations (e.g., saving a loved one or protecting a community).</p><p>• Inhibitory vectors (Vi): Represent the restraining forces that inhibit action, usually related to legal, social, or moral constraints (e.g., respect for laws or fear of punishment).</p><p>The calculation of the emotional score (E) is expressed as the difference between these two forces:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= −</formula><p>To transform this score into a probability of action, the model uses a sigmoid function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( ) = 1 1 + −</formula><p>In this function:</p><p>• is the emotional score resulting from the balance of conative and inhibitory forces,</p><p>• is a sensitivity parameter that adjusts the reactivity of the model to variations in .</p><p>A high value of reflects an impulsive decision-making profile, where small variations in emotional intensity result in sharp changes in the probability of action. Conversely, a low value of corresponds to a more reflective profile, where decisions are more gradually influenced by emotional forces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Incorporating Priming Effects in the Model</head><p>To further enhance the realism of the model, we introduce the concept of priming effects-external factors that can influence decision-making by modifying the emotional intensity associated with certain values.</p><p>Priming effects, such as social pressure or recent experiences, can either amplify or attenuate the emotional forces at play, which can ultimately affect the decision.</p><p>Rather than complicating the underlying model, priming effects can be easily integrated by adding a priming vector to the existing emotional vectors. This vector adjusts the intensity of either the conative force ( ) or the inhibitory force ( ), depending on the context:</p><p>• For conative forces: The priming effect can increase the emotional drive to act, thus modifying :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">′ = + conative</formula><p>• For inhibitory forces: Similarly, the priming effect can increase the emotional inhibition to act, thus modifying :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">′ = + inhibitory</formula><p>Where conative and inhibitory are scalar values representing the intensity of the priming effect in each direction. The addition of these priming effects does not alter the basic structure of the model but provides a way to adjust the decision-making process based on the specific context in which the decision is made.</p><p>This simple integration allows for the inclusion of dynamic factors like social influences, recent experiences, or environmental cues without altering the underlying decision-making framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1">Insertion of k calibration example :</head><p>The parameter k can be empirically calibrated through behavioral tests combined with physiological measurements, such as heart rate variability or hormonal assays. For example, an impulsive individual may exhibit a high k, amplifying their emotional reactivity to moral dilemmas, whereas a more reflective person would have a lower k, indicating more measured decision-making. Such studies would help better relate decision-making profiles to variations in k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numerical Illustration of k</head><p>To make the interpretation of the sensitivity parameter more tangible, we propose the following hypothetical values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">• = 1 :</formula><p>The sigmoid curve is shallow, corresponding to a reflective decision-making profile. Small changes in emotional score have minimal impact on action probability.</p></div>

The vertical dashed line at = 0 marks the indifference point where conative and inhibitory forces are balanced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2">Calibration and Empirical Quantification of Emotional Vectors, with a Focus on « »: Challenges and Methodological Considerations</head><p>In the current model, the essential calibration of the parameter is required to adjust the sensitivity to emotional forces represented by the conative vector ( ) and the inhibitory vector ( ). However, the quantification of emotional intensity associated with each value in the linear addition framework requires a more rigorous empirical approach.</p><p>To ensure the reliability of the calibration, it is essential to select individuals who share a similar axiotype, meaning a comparable value system. This helps control for variability in emotional responses that might arise from individual differences in moral or emotional frameworks. Furthermore, to obtain accurate measurements of emotional intensity, the sample must be sufficiently large to ensure statistical power and generalizability.</p><p>Standardized conditions must be established for data collection. One potential method for this is to use scripted video scenarios or video games that simulate moral decision-making processes, such as those resembling the trolley problem. These scenarios allow for controlled, repeatable measurements of emotional responses to specific moral dilemmas.</p><p>Once the emotional intensities associated with each value have been measured, it is necessary to consolidate the results across the sample. This consolidation will allow for the calculation of an average and , which can then be assumed to be generalizable to other individuals who share a similar value system, as determined through the axiotype selection.</p><p>This process ensures that the emotional vectors and reflect the collective emotional responses to moral dilemmas, offering a more robust and empirically grounded basis for the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3">Empirical Measurement and Standardization for Calibration of k</head><p>The parameter plays a crucial role in the model by controlling the sensitivity of the probability of action to the emotional intensity of the conative and inhibitory forces. It determines the slope of the sigmoidal function, meaning that small differences between the emotional vectors (conative) and (inhibitory) can dramatically alter the probability of action. Thus, governs how responsive the decisionmaking process is to changes in emotional intensity.</p><p>However, empirically adjusting remains an important challenge. To calibrate , it is essential to conduct experiments that test its effects in realistic moral decision-making scenarios. For example:</p><p>• Test Scenarios: In dilemmas like Heinz's Dilemma, we can measure participants' decisions and the corresponding emotional forces (e.g., urgency, fear, justice) and adjust to match observed decision tendencies. This can be done by analyzing the consistency between the model's predictions and the choices made by individuals in these scenarios.</p><p>• Psychometric Calibration: Using moral value scales and decision-making surveys, we can calibrate to reflect real-world sensitivity to moral decision-making across individuals. These tools can help link individual differences in moral judgments to the adjustments needed for .</p><p>• Contextual Sensitivity: To test how behaves in various emotional contexts (e.g., stress, urgency), we could examine decision-making under different emotional states, allowing for adjustments in to better capture the influence of contextual factors on moral decisions.</p><p>Through these methods, can be empirically calibrated to more accurately predict real-world moral decision-making behavior, offering a stronger foundation for the model's future applications and practical relevance in both psychology and decision science.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Example: The Heinz Dilemma</head><p>Consider the well-known Heinz dilemma. Heinz's wife is seriously ill, and the only drug that can save her life is sold at an exorbitant price by a pharmacist. Heinz does not have enough money to buy it and must decide whether to steal the drug to save his wife.</p><p>In this case, the conative vectors (Vc) represent the moral imperative to save his wife's life, while the inhibitory vectors (Vi) include the legal consequences and ethical dilemmas associated with theft. Using the proposed model, the probability of action can be predicted by quantifying the emotional intensity of these opposing forces and applying the sigmoid function to calculate the result.</p><p>For example, if the emotional score (E) indicates a strong conative force (Vc &gt; Vi), the probability of action increases significantly. Conversely, if the inhibitory forces dominate, the probability of action approaches zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1">Estimation of the Conative Vector (Vc)</head><p>The conative vector represents the forces motivating Heinz to act, mainly the moral imperative to save his wife. We estimate the intensity of each emotional factor using a scale of 1 to 5 , where 1 represents the weakest force and 5 the strongest.</p><p>For instance, in this example:</p><p>• Moral urgency to save his wife: 4</p><p>• Emotional urgency (love, desperation): 2 Thus, the conative vector (Vc) is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">= 4 + 2 = 6</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2">Estimation of the Inhibitory Vector (Vi)</head><p>The inhibitory vector reflects the emotional and ethical factors resisting action, such as the legal consequences of stealing. These factors might include:</p><p>• Fear of legal consequences: 2</p><p>• Respect for social norms: 1</p><p>• Hope for reconciliation with the pharmacist: 0.1 Thus, the inhibitory vector ( Vi ) is: = 2 + 1 + 0.1 = 3.1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.3">Emotional Score (E)</head><p>The emotional score (E) is the difference between the conative vector (Vc) and the inhibitory vector <ref type="bibr">(Vi)</ref>. With the values above, we calculate: = − = 6 − 3.1 = 2.9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.4">Calculation of the Probability of Action</head><p>Using the sigmoid function, the probability of action ( ( )) is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">( ) = 1 1 + −</formula><p>Where = 1.1 (the scaling factor).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.5">Summary:</head><p>• The conative vector (Vc) is the sum of emotional forces pushing Heinz toward action.

To the left of this point, inhibitory forces dominate, while to the right, conative forces outweigh, making action almost certain.</p><p>• The red vertical line ( = 2.9) marks Heinz's moral decision point. At this level, the probability of action is very close to 1 , suggesting that the model predicts almost certain action on his part to save his wife.</p><p>This graph effectively illustrates how emotional vectors (conative and inhibitory) interact to determine the likelihood of action, based on the forces at play in the moral dilemma.</p></div>

He is faced with a difficult choice: should he confront her, seek revenge, or leave the situation without reacting?</p><p>In this scenario, the conative vectors ( Vc ) might reflect the emotional urge to confront or seek justice, driven by feelings of betrayal and humiliation. Conversely, the inhibitory vectors (Vi) could represent the desire to preserve the relationship, avoid public embarrassment, or maintain self-control. The conative and inhibitory forces are estimated based on subjective emotional factors, using a scale from 1 to 5 . These values represent the intensity of the emotions involved, with 1 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. The sum of these forces gives us the total conative vector and inhibitory vector .</p><p>The emotional score (E) once again determines the probability of action.

The graph helps visualize how emotional intensity, as quantified by , influences moral decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Multi-Level Empirical Validation Strategy for Moral Decision Modeling</head><p>The proposed model offers a framework for understanding moral decision-making through a quantitative and dynamic approach, which can be used in various contexts. Its key contributions lie in its ability to transform emotional intensity into measurable probabilities, providing insights into decision-making processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Quantitative interpretation of ethical choices:</head><p>By applying a sigmoid function to emotional vectors, the model allows for a continuous probability calculation, enabling researchers to analyze moral decisions beyond binary choices (yes/no).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Flexibility and adaptability:</head><p>The model is flexible enough to be adapted to different decision-making profiles by adjusting the k parameter, which reflects individual sensitivity to emotional stimuli. This adaptability makes it possible to simulate how impulsive or reflective individuals might respond to the same moral dilemma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Integration of empirical validation methods:</head><p>The proposed model lays the groundwork for a multi-level empirical research agenda aimed at validating its core components and improving its predictive accuracy. Empirical validation is required at several levels:</p><p>• Calibration of the sensitivity parameter k: Controlled behavioral experiments are needed to estimate how individuals with different moral profiles respond to varying emotional intensities. These experiments could involve standardized moral dilemmas (e.g., Heinz's dilemma) in combination with psychometric assessments to infer typical ranges for k across different populations (e.g., impulsive vs. reflective profiles).</p><p>• Quantification of emotional intensities: Measuring the strength of conative and inhibitory vectors requires collecting data on how participants emotionally react to moral situations. Techniques such as self-report scales, physiological monitoring (e.g., heart rate variability, skin conductance), and behavioral indices can be used to estimate the relative magnitude of these affective forces.</p><p>• Neurophysiological correlates: Neuroimaging tools such as EEG and fMRI can help identify the brain regions and neural signatures involved in moral evaluation, conflict processing, and decision thresholds. These measures could be used to validate both the structure of the model and the functional significance of emotional scores in real time.</p><p>• Cross-individual and cultural variability: Longitudinal or cross-sectional studies across diverse populations would allow assessment of how individual differences in axiotype (value systems) or cultural context influence emotional calibration and decision thresholds.</p><p>By combining these different empirical approaches, the model can evolve from a conceptual framework into a predictive system grounded in measurable cognitive and affective dynamics. The integration of neurobehavioral data will be essential to refine the parameter space and ensure that the model remains sensitive to real-world variability in moral decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Applications in social and behavioral sciences:</head><p>This approach can be applied in fields such as moral psychology, sociology, and decision sciences, providing a new perspective on how individuals respond to ethical dilemmas in both personal and collective settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Limitations and Prospects for Improvement</head><p>While the proposed model offers an innovative framework for quantifying moral decision-making, several methodological and conceptual limitations deserve attention.</p><p>1 Simplicity of the conative and inhibitory vectors:</p><p>The model assumes a simple dichotomy between driving and restraining forces, whereas realworld decisions are often influenced by multidimensional factors, such as social cognition, emotional memory, and contextual pressures. These complexities are difficult to quantify accurately.</p><p>2 Calibration of the k parameter:</p><p>The parameter, representing individual sensitivity, is challenging to adjust without a solid empirical basis. Future experimental studies could help refine this calibration and link to psychological profiles, such as impulsiveness or cautiousness.</p><p>3 Absence of temporal dynamics:</p><p>The model does not currently account for the temporal evolution of moral decisions. However, some decisions change over time as a result of cognitive reevaluation or emotional regulation. Incorporating a dynamic time-based coefficient could offer a more accurate representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Empirical validation challenges:</head><p>While the theoretical model is promising, its validation depends on developing reliable tools for measuring emotional vectors. Techniques such as EEG (electroencephalography) and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) can provide useful insights, but these tools are still in development for such specific applications.</p><p>5 Limited applicability to complex decisions:</p><p>The model is more suited to binary decisions (to act or not). Complex moral dilemmas involving multiple dimensions and competing ethical principles are harder to reduce to a single equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Prospects for Improvement</head><p>These limitations open up promising avenues for future research, such as integrating contextual variables (social influences, cultural beliefs) and designing a hierarchical model for decisions occurring in dynamic environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion -Toward a Dynamic and Empirical Model</head><p>Despite the methodological limitations identified, the proposed model shows significant potential for formalizing moral decision-making processes. By integrating biological, axiological, and temporal variables, it opens the door to a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics of human behavior. This approach highlights how conative and inhibitory forces shape decisions, illustrating a structured framework that bridges the gap between affective-cognitive mechanisms and quantifiable moral actions.</p><p>One of the strengths of this model lies in its capacity to provide an analytical tool that extends beyond theoretical speculation. Its applications could span multiple disciplines, from behavioral psychology to artificial intelligence ethics. The capacity to model conative-inhibitory interactions numerically could lead to new ways of predicting decision-making in real-world ethical dilemmas. By refining the quantification of axiological parameters and integrating empirical validation techniques, future developments could significantly enhance its predictive power.</p><p>Beyond its theoretical significance, this model offers a practical tool for analyzing decision-making in contexts such as AI ethics, neuroeconomics, and behavioral simulations. Its potential applications in moral psychology and social sciences could provide new insights into real-world ethical dilemmas. For instance, understanding how emotional forces modulate moral choices could inform the design of human-centered AI decision-making systems, where ethical considerations are encoded into algorithms based on dynamic contextual influences.</p><p>The next critical step is to design empirical studies that validate these theoretical propositions. Experimental protocols, combining neurophysiological measurements (EEG, fMRI) and behavioral observations, will be essential to refine the model's predictive capacity. Moreover, integrating longitudinal analyses could provide insights into how moral dispositions evolve over time in response to social and cognitive conditioning. Calibration methods for the emotional intensity scale, alongside the refinement of the parameter , will play a fundamental role in adjusting the model's accuracy to empirical observations.</p><p>In the long term, integrating a dynamic temporal coefficient and validating the model through neurophysiological correlations could refine its predictive accuracy, offering deeper insights into moral decision-making across diverse social and cultural contexts. By incorporating social priming effects and contextual dependencies, the model could be expanded to account for cross-cultural variations in moral reasoning, further strengthening its generalizability.</p><p>Ultimately, this approach raises a fundamental question: to what extent can moral decision-making be fully quantified? While this model provides a rigorous framework, human cognition remains deeply shaped by unpredictable factors such as intuition, cultural conditioning, and social pressures. Integrating these complexities into a formalized model remains an open challenge for future research. In this sense, while mathematical formalization offers a valuable structural lens, moral decision-making may never be entirely reducible to purely computational principles. Nonetheless, this model lays the foundation for a novel quantitative approach to moral reasoning. Its future empirical validation will determine its robustness and adaptability across diverse ethical contexts, paving the way for interdisciplinary applications in psychology, neuroscience, and AI ethics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Glossary of Key Terms (Alphabetical Order)</head><p>Axiotype : A structured configuration of values and mémotions that characterizes an individual's or group's ideological and emotional profile. It represents the long-term affective-cognitive dispositions that shape moral judgments and behavioral tendencies across contexts.</p><p>Conative Force : A driving force that pushes an individual toward action, typically rooted in emotional urgency, ethical imperative, or motivational drive. Represented as a vector in the model, its strength reflects the emotional pressure to act.</p><p>Emotional Score (E) : The difference between total conative and inhibitory forces in a given decision context. It is used as the input for the sigmoid function to determine the probability of action.</p><p>Inhibitory Force : A restraining force that discourages or prevents action, associated with moral constraints, fear of consequences, or internalized social norms. Also represented as a vector, it balances conative impulses.</p><p>Mémotion : A transient, affect-laden memory trace that influences decision-making in the short term. Mémotions are less stable than values and more sensitive to recent events, media exposure, or social interactions. They play a crucial role in episodic emotional responses and situational moral engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity Parameter (k) :</head><p>A scalar that modulates the steepness of the sigmoid activation function. Higher values of k reflect greater emotional reactivity or impulsivity, while lower values correspond to more deliberative, gradual responses.</p><p>Value : A stable, long-term evaluative orientation toward a principle, norm, or ideal. Values are encoded with both valence (positive or negative ideological charge) and intensity (the strength of affective commitment). They contribute to the structure of the axiotype. </p></div>
