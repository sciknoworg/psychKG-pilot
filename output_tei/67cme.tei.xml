			<abstract>
				<p>Medial frontal negativity (MFN) is an event-related potential thought to originate in the anterior cingulate cortex. It is evoked by outcomes being worse than expected, such as when presented with unfair economic proposals during the Ultimatum Game (UG). This could mean the MFN indexes a social-emotional response, as commonly suggested in accounts that relate it to a violation of a social norm of fairness. To examine the link between MFN and norm violation, we designed an EEG experiment with participants acting as representatives in an UG. Participants responded either as themselves, or as representatives of two charities. Of these, a normcompatible charity conformed to the participant&apos;s values, while the norm-incompatible charity contrasted to them. The behavioural results showed that norm-incompatible representation reversed behaviour, with almost all fair offers being declined. The MFN, however, was unaffected by the norm representation, with unfair offers consistently evoking MFNs across conditions. We furthermore replicated the curious finding that unexpectedly generous offers evoke as much MFN as unfair offers. Thus, the MFN is not nearly as sensitive to higher-order socialemotional processes as commonly assumed. Instead, the perceived inequality that drives the MFN likely reflects a rational, probabilistic process.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Successful cooperation requires swift behavioural adjustments to social feedback and perceived social slights. In the literature on human performance, this is commonly seen as enabled by an early response to outcomes that are detected as "worse than expected", such as when making an error during a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . The electrophysiological correlate to this response is known collectively as the family of medial frontal negativities (MFNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> ) and involves an anterior negativity, ca. 200 ms after errors (error related negativity; ERN <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> ), negative feedback (feedback related negativity; FRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> ), and problematic decision making scenarios (medial frontal negativity; MFN singular <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ). As we define errors through social learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , it makes intuitive sense that what counts as an error should be mediated by its social context, and MFNs could therefore represent socially sensitive ERPs.</p><p>The literature on social decision-making games generally supports this assertion. For example, in the Ultimatum Game (UG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , participants respond to fair and unfair shares of a set amount of money by either accepting an offer (and both the participant and the proposer get their share) or declining it (and neither gets anything). Behaviourally, this leads to economically costly rejections of unfair offers, implying irrational motives as the outcome-maximizing decision is to accept all offers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . In fMRI studies, the scenario was found to activate areas related to cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , which was understood to regulate the conflict between financial and emotional motives. Likewise in EEG research, Boksem &amp; De Cremer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> showed unfair offers evoked MFN, which was found correlated with the sense of participants' justice sensitivity. Accordingly, they, and others who appreciate the social role of the MFN <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> , inferred that the MFN responds to unfairness, an erroneous violation of social norms.</p><p>Yet, the variety of paradigms employing MFNs may hide the inconsistence of the specific MFN pattern across studies, and the uncertainty to which social-emotional processes contribute to changes in the MFN. For example, the first UG study reporting negativity in response to offer perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> showed negativity to mid-value but not unfair offers (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">fig. 3</ref>). A more recent study replicated unfair MFN but showed this to be indistinguishable from unexpectedly generous offers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . Beyond the general sensitivity of the MFN, its social specificity was put to doubt by work suggesting social cues that affected decision making behaviour neither modulating MFN <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> nor FRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Likewise, while observing errors in others evokes socially-induced ERNs, this effect itself was found socially insensitive, being independent of competitive context or rewarding outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Alternative explanations may account for lack of psychophysiological correlates of socially salient effects, but the most parsimonious lacks prominence: The MFN is not as sensitive to higher-order social emotional processes as previously suggested.</p><p>In the present study we used the UG to investigate the extent to which the MFN is socially sensitive. Contrary to previous studies that investigated the MFN in relation to abstract traits and subtle social-emotional cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , we manipulate a factor that should directly, maximally affect the MFN's social context. Participants played the UG as representatives of charities that either agreed (norm-compatible representation) or contrasted (norm-incompatible representation) with their own values. If the MFN reflects an emotional response to problematic outcomes, then incompatible norm representation should elicit mass rejection of offers. Furthermore, if the MFN causes the UG response pattern, we should predict norm incompatibility to eliminate the MFN. In other words, the MFN as a socially sensitive ERP predicts a strong interaction between norm representation and fairness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods 1</head><p>Twenty healthy, unpaid volunteers (8 females, age 32.2±13.9 years) participated in the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>Participants were shown seven fictional charities and asked their financial support on a Likert-type scale. The single most and least appealing charities were used for norm compatible and norm incompatible conditions. Emotional involvement with these was validated after the experiment. Participants supplied their own photo for use in self conditions. Pictures of proposers were obtained from other students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>After receiving instruction and signing informed consent, participants were informed on whose behalf they were responding (norm representation), during <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Additional details on the methods are provided as supplemental materials 1</p><p>the block of 60 trials that followed. Trials started with the total amount to be divided shown between the proposer and responder's logo (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1)</ref>. Following a 500 ms cue, the offer was shown as numbers separated by a horizontal line. 1000 ms later, participants were to respond to offers by pressing Y (accept) or N (reject) on the keyboard. An animation followed to show the decision consequence; the two values moving to each party or disappearing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The experiment used a within-subject design with norm representation (compatible, incompatible, self) in counter-balanced order between 2 series of 3 blocks. Within each block of 60 trials, the 3 fairness conditions (unfair: &lt;50% for the participant, fair, and generous: &gt;50% for the participant) were presented orthogonally with 2 total sums of shares (£12 or £20) 2 and repeated 10 times in random order. The analysis used a repeated measures design with norm representation and fairness as factors. For behaviour, we analysed the acceptance rate whereas for EEG, we analysed the MFN, additionally including electrode (FCz, Cz, CPz) as factor. All ANOVAs were conducted with Greenhouse-Geisser adjustments where assumptions of sphericity were violated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EEG</head><p>EEG activity was digitised at 1024 Hz from 64 scalp locations using active electrodes. Electrooculographic activity was recorded using bipolar electrodes, one set placed lateral to the eyes, the other inferior and superior to the right eye. EEG analysis included average referencing, filtering (1-80 Hz BP), and independent component analysis. Following visual inspection for suspect components, source-level artefact-corrected EEG was reconstructed by applying weights of artefact-free components to the unfiltered data. Data were then further filtered (0.2-40 Hz) and segmented into 1200 ms epochs, time-locked to the offer and including 200 ms of baseline. An individually specified artifact rejection procedure further removed epochs based on thresholds. On average, the resulting procedure removed 19.01±5.12 % of epochs from analysis, which computed ERPs over the remaining 32.39 epochs per design cell.</p><p>Initial visual inspection of the MFN via grand average ERPs of fair and unfair conditions showed maximal negativity over the medial frontocentral to centroparietal cortex <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3)</ref>. To define the interval, we calculated the standardised difference between unfair and fair conditions, observing significant negativity from 290-470 ms. The MFN was measured as the mean activity within this window. representations to significantly differ, ps &lt; .031, with most offers accepted in the compatible, and least in the incompatible, condition. Contrasts between each level of offer fairness with its preceding level showed significant increases until the fair offer condition, ps &lt; .002. The interaction was further analysed by applying the same contrasts to each norm representation. This showed a similar pattern for self and compatible conditions: increased acceptance with fairness until the fair ceiling level at, ps &lt; .0007. Conversely, incompatible conditions revealed decreasing acceptance for unfair vs very unfair offers, p &lt; .004, after which a floor level was reached. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the reversed effect in norm incompatible conditions. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behaviour</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MFN</head><p>In repeated measures ANOVA on the average evoked potential with electrode (FCz, Cz, CPz), norm representation (compatible, incompatible, self), and offer fairness (unfair, fair, generous) as factors, neither electrode nor norm representation had a significant main effect, ps &gt; .20. Fairness, however, did significantly affect the ERP, F (2, 38) = 17.58, p &lt; .0001, 2 = .48. Planned comparisons on the effect revealed this was due mainly to both unfair, p &lt; .0003, and generous, p &lt; .002, evoking negativity relative to fair offers, with no difference between unfair and generous offers being observed, p = .48. The predicted interaction 3 between norm representation and fairness was not observed, F (3.26, 61.97) = 1.25, p = .30, 2 = .06, nor any other effect, ps &gt; .18.</p><p>To determine whether the data favours the hypothesis that norm representation does not interact with fairness, we ran a full factorial Bayesian Repeated Measures analysis with the same factors. A null-model was defined as including only all main effects, which showed good fit, BFm = 96.69, P(M|data) = .92. In contrast, low odds were observed for the alternative model that included the norm representation * fairness interaction, BFm = 0.39, BF10 = 0.050, P(M|data) = .047 (P(M) = .111). In other words, the data show strong evidence against the interaction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Norm compatibility dramatically affects how we behaviourally respond to unfairness. While normally, unfair offers are accepted far less often than fair offers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , but representing incompatible charities reversed this pattern. For example, people would almost never accept offers made to unpopular charities (e.g. Educate 'n' Arm), although they might accept the most unfair ones. Why would one accept just very unfair offers? Informal interviews with participants suggest participants favoured inconsequential donations to such charities if it meant a stranger would strongly benefit.</p><p>If this behaviour is a response to our provoked sense of justice, as indexed by the MFN, one would expect strong effects of norm-representation on the ERP. However, the MFN seemed insensitive to the behaviourally dramatic effect. Whether the participant themselves, a supported charity, or a loathed organisation such as Educate 'n' Arm was unfairly treated did not affect the MFN. It may therefore be that the MFN reflects an automatic effect in which all observed errors are treated alike; whether the social context concerns competitors, collaborators, or as here, antagonists, they are all socially equal. It may also be that the MFN is not socially sensitive.</p><p>Further dramatic evidence for this assertion is the observation that the MFN does not distinguish between unfair and generous offers. Are positive surprises and negative outcomes both violations of social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> ? They both signify unfairness, which is a social inference based on previous interaction experience. Yet, the present study calls into question the social-emotional quality of the response if it does not discern between hedonistically opposing offers. Rather than a violation of social norms, it may then be more neutrally described as an unequal response.</p><p>A more parsimonious alternative is that the MFN is not sensitive to top down control, and occurs as a bottom-up response to a low-level mismatch between features 20 . For example, in the present scenario, unfair offers were presented by unequal numbers, which necessarily involves complexity, while fairness has symmetrical features. Another possibility is that based on the UG itself, every offer size is imaginable, but fewer fair than unfair permutations exist. This probabilistic property makes it highly likely that responders would expect fair offers and consequently form an advance visual expectation.</p><p>That such lower-level considerations could account for effects on the MFN represents a serious problem for the state of the field. This is the case even if social cues and correlations with social traits have been observed, as a wealth of possibilities are open explanations if the MFN is not a-priori seen as a biomarker for social norm violations. In light of this, we urge the field to rule out all physical and statistical differences between conditions before considering a social account of their result. In the absence of such studies, we consider the MFN insensitive to social context.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Trial procedure.
