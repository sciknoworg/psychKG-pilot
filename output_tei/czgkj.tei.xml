			<abstract>
				<p>Prior research highlights the disparity in wealth-building activity participation among lower-to-middle-income (LMI) households, resulting in issues like the racial wealth gap. This presents an opportunity to improve how financial institutions offer products through proven strategies such as warm handoffs. In collaboration with a debt management and a financial services company, we conducted a field experiment testing the impact of a warm handoff process. This culminated in an offer to engage in a financial advisor call for further guidance on the next steps in their financial journey for participants completing a debt management plan (DMP). In the months leading up to their DMP graduation, 1,329 clients received either a four-email handoff over four months (high-touch), a one-email handoff (streamlined), or no handoff email (the control). We see stronger open and click-through rates for the handoff email in the high-touch treatment, compared to the streamlined treatment. Otherwise, we see statistically significant differences in open rates by race, with people of color engaging with these resources at higher rates. This suggests that behaviorally informed warm handoff strategies could effectively improve engagement with financial resources and financial well-being, particularly for people of color.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Racial differences in financial access</head><p>Financial inclusion remains a significant barrier for underrepresented populations, particularly African Americans. Research shows that the net worth of a White family is nearly 10 times that of a Black family <ref type="bibr">(McIntosh et al., 2020)</ref>, and that lower and middleincome (LMI) households are generally less likely to participate in wealth-building activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Shanks et al., 2014)</ref>. This has been further exacerbated by lower trust in financial institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Edelman Smithfield, 2024)</ref>, particularly among minority groups due to historical marginalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Heen, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Key drivers of Black and Hispanic wealth are housing, business, and stock equity. However, only 44 per cent of Black Americans own a home, compared to 73 per cent of White individuals. Meanwhile, stock equity accounts for 30 per cent of White wealth and only 4 per cent of Black wealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Perry et al., 2024)</ref>. The result is large discrepancies in wealth across races. This gap has largely been driven by historically discriminatory policies and differing starting conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Derenoncourt et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>While previous research has explored these disparities, less research has focused on the experimental testing of behavioral strategies for increasing engagement with wealthbuilding products. With deteriorating trust in institutions and preconceived notions around financial institutions, especially for minority groups due to historical marginalization, there is an opportunity to leverage warm handoffs to improve engagement with financial products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Warm handoffs</head><p>Warm handoffs are a strategy to connect and transfer customers to service providers, particularly in situations where services are not easily accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Taylor &amp; Minkovitz, 2021)</ref>. This involves the transfer of care and the introduction of a client from one service provider to another, typically all with the client in the same virtual or physical room. Warm handoffs are hypothesized to address certain barriers in the referral process and improve the acceptance of the new services by helping familiarize clients with the new providers and easing them into another service.</p><p>Moreover, warm handoffs are also believed to improve trust in the new service provider and build rapport through the transparent exchange of information in the client's presence (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2021). Though seemingly effective in healthcare contexts, there is little to no empirical evidence on the effectiveness of handoffs in financial domains for promoting wealth-building behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behaviorally informed messaging</head><p>Regarding effective messaging to encourage action, several behavioral concepts have otherwise been shown to facilitate engagement.</p><p>1) The foot-in-the-door technique, for example, has previously been used across subpopulations, showing that getting people to first comply with smaller requests may make them more likely to agree to larger requests <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Burger, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Guéguen et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>2) A key mechanism that drives willingness to engage with a financial product is trust. We see across contexts that trusted messengers and messaging play important roles in product engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Shen et al., 2023)</ref>, particularly around financial counseling for people of color <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hawkins &amp; Zuiker, 2019)</ref>. Further evidence also highlights the efficacy of operational transparency, or designing service interactions to show engagers the behind-the-scenes work done to offer these services <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buell et al., 2021)</ref>. This demonstration of effort shows evidence of causal links to trust.</p><p>3) Research has also focused on inertia and friction, finding that the less the user has to do for the transition, the better. For example, in one study, robo-advisors are shown to effectively reduce financial decision inertia <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Jung &amp; Weinhardt, 2018)</ref>. 4) There is also evidence that pre-commitment is an effective mechanism to help people follow through on their intentions, with research showing that people save more money when they pre-commit before they have the money in hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Roll et al., 2020)</ref>. 5) Finally, demonstrating progress and celebrating success are important considerations. Research shows that the closer someone is to achieving their goal, the faster the progress they make toward that goal. As such, if someone has made a lot of progress, it is typically more motivating to emphasize the distance they have left to go <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kivetz et al., 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our research</head><p>We designed a field experiment in partnership with a finance and investment company and a debt management organization to facilitate a behaviorally informed warm handoff process from the debt management company to the finance company. This handoff specifically targeted customers graduating from a debt management plan (DMP). A DMP is a program through which consumers can consolidate their debt and pay it off through one regular monthly payment with lower interest rates. Graduating customers were at most four months away from completing the DMP program. Such individuals had been making monthly payments of approximately $300 per month for 3 years to clear their consolidated debt.</p><p>Upon completing the program, these participants would have paid off their previously consolidated debts and were expected to have additional disposable income. Hence, the primary goal was to nudge these customers to redirect potential additional income toward a wealth-building product.</p><p>Through a preregistered pilot experiment (https://osf.io/d2be6), we aimed to investigate how employing a behaviorally informed warm handoff to a financial advisor and the behaviorally informed strategies identified could increase engagement with wealthbuilding financial products, particularly for people of color.</p><p>We hypothesized that 1) the high-touch, multi-month emails would result in higher engagement with all calls-to-action (CTAs) (booking a consultation with a financial advisor and engaging with the financial wellness self-assessment and informational webinar), 2) improve financial well-being, and 3) increase trust in both financial institutions. We also hypothesized that 4) the treatments would be more effective for people of color.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>A total of 1,329 participants graduating from a debt management plan (DMP) between May and August 2024 were included in the experiment. The two treatment groups (high-touch and streamlined) comprised of graduates living in one of three selected states: Georgia, Michigan, and New Jersey. The control group consisted of participants graduating during the same period (between May and August 2024) who did not reside in one of the three treatment states. All participants received a follow-up survey after graduating. People of color were specifically targeted through culturally tailored messaging within all emails. See <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for an overview of the study design.</p><p>The experimental conditions were as follows: 1) Streamlined Handoff Treatment: 103 participants were sent one email with the handoff offer, which nudged them to sign up for a consultation with a financial advisor at the financial services provider. They received this email one month before graduation.</p><p>2) High-Touch, Foot-in-the-Door Handoff Treatment: 206 participants were sent four emails with layered offerings over four months, including a financial wellness assessment, an informational webinar, a reminder email, and culminating with the handoff offer to sign up for a call with a financial advisor one month before graduation.</p><p>3) Control Group: 999 participants received no handoff emails. From the full population of non-experiment graduates, participants were randomly selected to match the AMI distribution of the treatment groups. We also oversampled within this group based on the expectation of low survey response rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Experimental flow</head><p>We used stratified randomization to equally assign participants to a treatment condition based on race (people of color versus non-people of color). Two-thirds of the sample was assigned to the higher-touch intervention, and one-third to the streamlined handoff. This was done to account for the higher-touch condition's higher likelihood of attrition over the four-month intervention period. The debt management institution conducted all randomization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>For the email experiment, we measured engagement through email open rates and clickthrough rates (CTR). The primary outcome was handoff engagement, or willingness to book a consultation with a financial advisor, which was measured through open and CTRs for email 4 only.</p><p>The follow-up survey measured subjective financial well-being (through the abbreviated CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale), trust in the two financial institutions, reasons for engaging or not engaging with the offers, financial knowledge sources, and DMP feedback. Participants were again provided with the handoff offer to sign up for a call with a financial advisor through the survey. We measured engagement again through link clicks within the survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Handoffs experiment 330 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: a higher-touch foot-in-the-door four-email handoff intervention sent over four months leading up to one month before graduation, or a streamlined one-email handoff intervention one month before graduation. Through the emails, participants were offered tools and resources from the finance company (an assessment, webinar, and one-on-one call with a financial advisor). The study materials are shown in Appendix A.</p><p>Treatment participants were excluded from the analysis if they did not receive any emails, resulting in a final sample of 309 graduates. On average, participants were 49 years old. Most of the graduates were female (65.70 per cent), White (45.53 per cent) or Black (43.90 per cent), and non-Hispanic (91.46 per cent). Between 68 and 87 participants in each cohort received the handoff emails over the treatment periods. Most graduates (82.20 per cent) were from Michigan, with the remainder being from Georgia or New Jersey.</p><p>On average, participants earned over $50,296.31 (SD = 13.92) in gross annual income and had initial debt of $11,199.60 (SD = $14,613.38) at the beginning of the DMP. They were enrolled in the DMP for 38.26 months (SD = 27.35) (or over three years). There were no statistically significant differences in these characteristics by condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-up survey</head><p>The survey was sent to 1,329 participants (all treatment and control participants), and we received 102 responses. From the 309 treatment participants in the experiment, there were 3 responses from participants in the Streamlined condition and 13 in the Foot-in-the-door condition. From the 999 in the control condition, we received 86 responses. Most survey respondents were either White (54.08 per cent) or Black (21.43 per cent) and non-Hispanic (52.04 per cent) or Other (28.57 per cent).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>For the email experiment, chi-squared tests were used instead of the preregistered logistic regression models to determine warm handoff success (the primary dependent variable) by experimental condition and engagement with each email by race. This was done due to low engagement rates across conditions. For the follow-up survey, ANOVAs were used to determine the differences in financial well-being and trust levels between the two treatment groups and the control group, and the differences in these outcomes based on ethnicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CTA engagement</head><p>In the email experiment (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>), average open rates were 31.07 per cent for those in the foot-in-the-door treatment versus 27.18 per cent in the streamlined treatment (X² = 0.58, df = 1, p = 0.448) indicating that higher-touch messaging resulted in higher, though non-significant differences in engagement.</p><p>The click-through rate for email four (the handoff offer) was 4.69 per cent for the foot-inthe-door treatment vs. 0.00 per cent for the streamlined treatment. The results showed no significant difference between the streamlined and foot-in-the-door conditions (X² = 0.28, df = 1, p = 0.598), indicating that a higher-touch handoff similarly resulted in a higher, non-significant likelihood of engaging with the warm handoff offer.</p><p>However, at the end of the follow-up survey, we see a high willingness to book a call with an advisor (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2B)</ref>. A chi-squared test was performed to determine if there were significant differences in clicking the CTA to book a financial advisor consultation across the three experimental conditions. We see the strongest engagement in the control (80.00 per cent) and foot-in-the-door conditions (76.92 per cent), versus the streamlined treatment (33.33 per cent) 1 . The results showed a statistically significant difference (X² = 58.73, df = 2, p &lt; 0.01) in click rates across the three experimental conditions, revealing a high willingness among some participants to book a call with a financial advisor.</p><p>Notably, this increased motivation may be influenced by the self-selection into the survey, as individuals who completed the survey were likely more engaged with managing their finances and had a higher baseline motivation to take action. Furthermore, completing the survey likely encouraged participants to reflect on their financial situations, encouraging further engagement with the handoff offer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Email (open and click-through rates) &amp; survey engagement rates (clickthrough rates) by experimental condition</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CTA engagement by race</head><p>To explore whether race moderated the effectiveness of the warm handoff email experiment, we examined the differences in engagement by race on booking consultations. Notably, we see significant differences in open rates by race, with over 40 per cent of non-White populations opening the handoff email (X² = 12.65, df = 2, p-value = 0.002) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3A</ref>). Despite this, there was no significant interaction by race for click-through rates (X² = 0.73, df = 2, p = 0.693; see <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>), suggesting the intervention's effectiveness was consistent across racial groups.</p><p>We analyzed email engagement, including click-through and open rates, by race across all intervention emails. Open rates varied significantly by race for some emails. While Emails 1 (p = 0.345) and 3 (p = 0.851) showed no significant differences, Email 2 (X² = 9.15, df = 2, p = 0.010) and Email 4 (X² = 12.65, df = 2, p = 0.002) revealed significant differences. Non-White participants were significantly more likely to open these emails, indicating potential opportunities to tailor messaging to further improve engagement across groups. However, across all four emails, no significant differences in click-through rates were found by race (p &gt; 0.05 for all emails). This suggests that race did not influence participants' likelihood of clicking through to access financial resources.</p><p>The results suggest limited overall effectiveness of the intervention in driving consultations or engagement with additional resources, with no statistically significant differences by condition or race for most outcomes. However, directional differences in email open rates for specific emails and relatively high engagement with the other offers highlight the need to refine messaging further to better resonate with our target audiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3. Email engagement rates (open and click-through rates) by racial category</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial well-being &amp; institutional trust</head><p>Lastly, following the handoff experience, we measured subjective financial well-being and trust in both institutions in the follow-up survey. The mean scores for subjective financial well-being were 2.05 (SD = 1.19) for the control group, 1.80 (SD = 0.75) for the streamlined treatment, and 2.11 (SD = 1.26) for the foot-in-the-door treatment (see <ref type="figure">Figure  4A</ref>). There were no statistically significant differences in subjective financial well-being (F = 0.416, p = 0.660).</p><p>Participants' trust in both financial institutions were measured across conditions to assess the impact of the interventions. For the debt management plan company, the control group reported an average trust score of 3.47 (SD = 0.68), the streamlined condition, 3.00 (SD = 0.82), and the foot-in-the-door condition, 3.64 (SD = 0.48). The overall mean trust score was 3.47 (SD = 0.67). There were no statistically significant differences in trust across conditions (p = 0.347) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>).</p><p>For trust in the financial services provider, mean trust scores were lower overall, with the streamlined condition having a mean trust score of 1.67 (SD = 0.47) while the foot-in-thedoor condition had a score of 2.50 (SD = 0.81). There were no statistically significant differences in trust across conditions (p = 0.145) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4C)</ref>. Notably, the small sample size for the streamlined condition may have limited statistical power for survey results.</p><p>These findings suggest that neither intervention had a measurable impact on subjective financial well-being compared to the control group, but trend-wise, we see that softer measures such as financial well-being and trust were highest for those in the higher touch treatment. This highlights the need for further research with larger sample sizes to identify more effective strategies to improve financial well-being and trust in financial institutions, which may further drive engagement with financial products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4. Financial Well-being &amp; Trust by Experimental Condition</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Through a collaborative field experiment, we aimed to determine if behaviorally informed warm handoff intervention would prove useful for increasing engagement with financial products, particularly among people of color. We also aimed to understand if engaging with these products would improve subjective financial well-being and foster trust in both financial institutions.</p><p>Trendwise, results indicate that higher touch messaging may be an effective mechanism for facilitating the warm handoff to a financial advisor consultation. We saw higher engagement in the foot-in-the-door treatment than in the streamlined condition with the handoff CTA. These findings align with behavioral science research showing that engagement strategies like the foot-in-the-door technique can effectively motivate larger commitments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Burger, 1999)</ref>. Notably, the differences in email engagement were not statistically significant within the email experiment.</p><p>However, through survey responses, we saw a significantly stronger willingness to book consultations across both the control and the foot-in-the-door conditions compared to the streamlined condition. This further suggests that providing opportunities for reflection (e.g., through surveys) and ongoing emails could play a meaningful role in driving engagement with financial products.</p><p>Furthermore, we saw significant racial differences in email engagement, particularly open rates, highlighting the potential for tailored messaging to resonate with people of color. These differences suggest that culturally tailored communication strategies may be critical in addressing trust and access barriers for people of color. However, the lack of significant differences in click-through rates by race indicates that while tailored messaging can capture initial attention, additional steps may be needed to translate this interest into action.</p><p>Finally, we saw no significant differences in subjective financial well-being and trust in financial institutions across conditions, but trendwise, we see higher financial well-being and trust for those in the higher-touch treatment. These findings suggest that while warm handoffs may facilitate initial engagement, they alone may not be sufficient to meaningfully impact participants' perceptions of financial well-being or institutional trust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Notably, the small sample size, especially in the streamlined group, and the overall low engagement rates may have limited the ability to detect meaningful differences across conditions. Additionally, self-selection bias in the follow-up survey may have influenced the results, as these participants were likely more financially motivated and engaged.</p><p>Future studies should aim to increase sample sizes and explore alternative methods for assessing engagement to mitigate these biases. Where there is opportunity, researchers should also aim to understand the impact these interventions have on actual financial outcomes such as wealth. Moreover, while this study focused on warm handoffs, future research could explore complementary and even higher-touch strategies (e.g., phone calls, and longer-term education campaigns) to sustain engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion &amp; Policy Implications</head><p>Through this experiment, we provide critical insights into the effectiveness of operational strategies like warm handoffs to improve engagement with wealth-building products, particularly among people of color. This study contributes to the growing research on behavioral strategies for promoting financial inclusion.</p><p>While our study shows initial evidence that warm handoffs have the potential to increase initial engagement, their overall impact on financial outcomes was limited. The low clickthrough rates and sustained engagement with offerings suggest that the intervention may not have provided enough motivational support to encourage participants to act on the financial advice offered.</p><p>By identifying some key engagement strategies, this research offers practical solutions for policymakers and financial institutions aiming to enhance financial inclusion for underrepresented communities. This research addresses the pressing issue of financial inclusion by focusing on novel and culturally tailored strategies to enhance engagement, especially for underrepresented populations. The findings have significant implications for policy, outreach, and the design of financial products, contributing to more effective and equitable financial engagement. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Email Design</head><p>Drawing from healthcare handoff practices and effective messaging strategies, both treatment messages utilized behavioral science-based elements such as building trust through operational transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buell et al., 2021)</ref>, goal gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kivetz et al., 2006)</ref>, celebrating progress, endowment effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kahneman et al., 1990)</ref>, and pre-commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kurth-Nelson &amp; Redish, 2012)</ref> to encourage engagement with financial products. Given the barriers specific to people of color around financial inclusion, we also structured these emails to highlight the systemic barriers that have resulted in less access for people of color and lower-income populations. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure A1.
