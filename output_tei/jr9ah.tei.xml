			<abstract>
				<p>While the primary goals of medical treatment are typically to shorten illness or relieve symptoms, we explore the idea that an important additional goal for some patients is to communicate need. Drawing on costly signalling theory, we argue that treatments-and in particular aversive treatments-can help patients legitimize their illness and thereby enable access to crucial support during convalescence. Four pre-registered within-subjects experiments (n = 874) show that participants are more inclined to provide care to people who undergo treatment, especially when that treatment is painful. Results show this incentivizes the use of antibiotic treatments for viral infections as well as risky drug treatments for mental illness. A cross-sectional of 194 chronic pain patients shows that those who experience stigma and doubt over the legitimacy of their illness are more likely to accept aversive treatments. Furthermore, two experiments (n = 653) indicate that subtle manipulations to one&apos;s sense of social support may increase willingness to accept treatment. These results indicate that people make decisions to provide care in part based on the presence/absence of treatment and furthermore that patients&apos; treatment decision making is informed by the social consequences of their choices. Signalling theory may help explain the surprising longevity of some ineffective and costly medical procedures.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>What motivates the use of medical treatments? While alleviating symptoms, shortening illness or reducing risks of death are clearly important motives, we explore the idea that an important additional goal for some patients is to signal need to other people. This signalling motive may help explain patient preferences for treatment with few biomedical virtues, a puzzling feature of historical medical practice and an important problem in contemporary medicine.</p><p>Signalling theory, developed in evolutionary biology and economics, explores the conditions in which a signal receiver can be confident that messages from a sender are honest <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barker et al., 2019)</ref>. Signalling theory is relevant in healthcare because sick people need rest and care during their convalescence and they must communicate this need to would-be-caregivers.</p><p>However, since rest and care are desired by many healthy people too, would-be-caregivers are often uncertain about the legitmacy of any given request for care. We suggest that aversive treatments could resolve would-be caregivers' uncertainty by enabling requesters of care to create a hard-to-fake signal that their request is legitimate. Why is the signal hard to fake?</p><p>Because the harms of treatment deter all but those who stand to benefit substantially from the care.</p><p>Care by family members, friends and others is often essential during convalescence and in its absence, mortality rates are markedly higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">House et al., 1988</ref>).</p><p>There is substantial evidence of this caregiving in small scale societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gurven et al., 2000)</ref> and indeed in Neanderthals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Spikins et al., 2019)</ref>. However, people sometimes capitalize on others' willingness to provide care by consciously or unconsciously exaggerating or generating the symptoms of a disease (hereafter illness deception) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Halligan et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mittenberg et al., 2002)</ref>. Hence would-be caregivers cannot be sure about the people's true need for care. Evidence of widespread uncertainty about the legitimacy of care requests can be observed in the testimonies of people who suffer from diseases that do not have visible manifestations -they often report that they find it difficult to gain emotional and practical support from others and their illnesses are perceived to lack legitimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dumit, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Glenton, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Newton et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rebman et al., 2017)</ref>. Their experiences suggests that people are sensitive to evidence about the legitimacy of illnesses. Medical treatment may provide this evidence.</p><p>Drawing on signalling theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barker et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zahavi, 1975)</ref>, researchers (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barra et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tiokhin, 2016)</ref> have suggested that medical treatment, and in particular aversive treatment, can provide credible evidence that the treated disease is legitimate. This is because individuals who are "genuinely" sick should be more willing to accept treatment harms than people engaging in illness deception. This difference stems from the fact that, for sick people, care is potentially life-saving whereas for people engaging in illness deception, the benefits are limited to a temporary release from duties or access to resources. Therefore sick people should be willing to endure greater harm to access this care (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barra et al., 2019)</ref>. From the caregiver's perspective, the fact that someone is willing to undergo aversive treatment carries information value about that person's health status and their need for care. Self-harm and suicidality have similarly been proposed as costly acts which enhance credibility and advertise a genuine need <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gaffney et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hagen et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>A key prediction of the signalling model is that people will be more inclined to provide resources to people who undergo treatment, especially aversive treatment. This prediction are tested in Study 1. In Study 2 examine the incentives that operate in two important areas of contemporary health care: underuse of non-medical interventions for mental health problems and the overuse of antibiotics.</p><p>Cues differ from signals in that only the latter are produced in order to influence another individual. Undoubtedly, medical treatments act as cues: our judgements about the severity of a friend's back pain are likely to change if we learn they are due to undergo surgery. But the surgery only counts as a signal if our friend's decision to undergo surgery is, in part, influenced by how the operation will change other people's judgements of his pain. Study 3 explores this cue/signal distinction. In a sample of chronic pain patients, we test if patients whose friends, family, and colleagues have withdrawn support or who directly suspect illness deception are more willing to use aversive treatments than patients who network has fewer concerns about the legitimacy of their requests for support. In experimental studies, we explore how subtle manipulations to perceptions of social support influence willingness to undergo treatment.</p><p>All our studies' hypotheses and analyses plans have been preregistered and every preregistered study we have conducted on this topic is described here, see:</p><p>https://osf.io/gs6wv/?view_only=954772cbbc304b72af0ff9ddac5a6d11 for preregistrations, datasets and R analysis files.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 1a and 1b: Medicine as a cue to caregivers</head><p>Study 1a assesses if participants are more inclined to provide care to people who undergo (aversive) treatments. We additionally investigate if people are more likely to donate towards a charity related to a disease which was aversively treated compared to a disease that was not treated in the relevant vignette. Study 1b compares the effects of self-administered and doctorprescribed treatments. Similar effect would indicate that the legitimizing force of treatments comes patients' willingness to endure the treatment rather than from doctors recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Design In this study 1a, we used a repeated measures (fractional factorial) design. The first factor was disease, and there were three levels: back-pain, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and stomach pain. The second factor was medical treatment, and there were also three levels: no treatment, treatment, and aversive treatment. Participants saw each of the diseases and each of the medical treatment levels only once (i.e., they read three vignettes) and the allocation of medical treatment to disease was random. The three disease levels appeared in the same order in Study 1, but since the effects of disease on the dependent variables is not of theoretical interest, this confounding with order has little relevance. To assess if participants were aware of the study goal, we invited them to speculate on the purpose of the study in a free-text box after reading all three vignettes. Study 1b differed from study 1a in three ways. First, the vignettes were different and desicrbed a sick person either underwent an aversive treatment recommended by a doctor, an aversive treatment they decided to undergo without a doctor's recommedation, or did not undergo treatment. The donation outcome measure was removed as it did not appear to be a sensitive measure of participants' willingness to provide care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited from Prolific and completed the experiment for a reimbursement of 0.70. The only inclusion criterion was a minimum age of 25. This was intended to increase the likelihood that participants had workplace experience. This and subsequent studies were approved by Brunel Research Ethics Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vignettes</head><p>In study 1a, the three vignettes described a colleague who claimed to be unable to work due to illness. Back-pain, acute respiratory infection, and stomach pain were chosen for the vignettes since these illnesses are familiar, and unlike, for example, a broken leg, and largely lack visible diagnostic symptoms. We created a version of the vignette in which the protagonist received no treatment, treatment, or an aversive treatment. Prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(de Barra et al., 2019)</ref> suggests that treatments will have a more substantial influence on caregiving when there is ambiguity over the authenticity or severity of the illness. We created this ambiguity by, as mentioned above, choosing illnesses without apparent causes. We also included contextual cues like general work dissatisfaction or a tedious task to create the perception that illness deception is possible.</p><p>One possible confound is that vignette characters with harmful treatments are experiencing more ill health than patients with benign treatments and therefore may be more deserving of care, independent of any signaling effects. To mitigate against this confound, we took the following steps: In the back pain vignette we made it clear that the treatment only caused a temporary increase in suffering the previous day and should, therefore, be irrelevant to current decision making. Similarly in the stomach pain condition, the aversive component -an endoscopy -was a brief procedure executed before the relevant caregiving opportunity. In the acute respiratory infection vignette, the treatment's aversive side effects, stomach pain and nausea, were included as additional symptoms of the disease in the no-treatment and treatment conditions. The vignette character, therefore, had the same number of health problems in all three conditions; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Someone that you work with came into work this week sniffling a little. She also has stomach pains and nausea. For various reasons your colleague keeps missing work since she was hired two months ago. It seems she does not enjoy her job very much. And now this week you see she is leaving work early and missing important meetings. Today she has emailed in sick from work and attached a sick note from the local doctor. The doctor wrote that her problem was not very serious and that he did not prescribe any antibiotics or medication. Once again, you and your colleagues are going to have to work on Saturday to complete her tasks.</p></div>

In the no-treatment condition, the protagonist's symptoms were described and participants were informed that "she/he has a doctor's appointment next week." Treatment was not mentioned. In the self-treatment condition, the participants read that the protagonist had an appointment next week but had begun a selftreatment that was both aversive and feasible to self-administer. The doctor-treated condition was identical except that the same treatment was described as a recommendation from the doctor. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>:</p><p>Vignette stimuli used in Study 1b.</p></div>

Doctor-administered treatment As above, but last sentence reads: Following her doctor's recommendation, she has been taking 10-minute baths in freezing iced water every morning to quicken her recovery.</p><p>To encourage participants to pay attention to the vignettes, we asked them to "describe what happened to your co-worker in the previous extract" in a free text box after reading the vignettes and completing the outcome variables. The responses were not analyzed.</p><p>The Psytoolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Stoet, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Stoet, , 2017</ref>) syntax for recreating this and all subsequent experiments is available on the Open Science Framework</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[https://osf.io/gs6wv/?view_only=954772cbbc304b72af0ff9ddac5a6d11].</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome variables</head><p>The caregiving index was the primary outcome variable and consisted of seven questions, each accompanied by a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree). Example items include: This co-worker is definitely ill; My team and I should take over all their work-related responsibilities until they recover fully; and It was fully acceptable for them to be late / absent. The full list of items is available in Supplementary File, section A. Item order was randomized between participants and between vignettes.</p><p>Cronbach's s of &gt;.89 indicated good internal consistency across the seven items. Given that this is a new measure of care, we examined the convergent and divergent validity of the caregiving index on a separate sample. The methods and results are presented in detail in the Supplementary File, section B. In brief, scores on the caregiving index correlate (r = .36) with principle of care, an index of the position that one is morally obliged to help those in need. It is also associated with high scores on the empathic concern sub-scale of the interpersonal reactivity index and the lower scores on the distrust of others sub-scale of the Machiavellianism scale. These latter two associations are not statistically significant.</p><p>The second outcome variable consisted of a single question at the end of the study, inviting participants to vote for one of three charities. The charity with the most votes received a donation of 25. The charities had a health focus that linked them to the three clinical areas of the vignettes: back pain (described as "A charity that funds research on back pain (Arthritis Research UK)"); acute respiratory infection ("a charity that funds research on colds, flu and other respiratory diseases (British Lung Foundation)"); and stomach pain (finally "a charity that funds research on stomach/digestive problems (Core -Fighting Digestive Diseases))". Hence, this item is a behavioural outcome measure of willingness to transfer resources to charities linked to the problems experienced by the vignette characters. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess if the probability of donating to a charity X was higher after reading a vignette featuring someone who experiences disease X plus treatment or aversive treatment versus after reading a vignette featuring someone who experiences disease X without treatment. We compare the fit of a model with the key predictor variable, presence/absence of treatment, to a model without this predictor. Since each participant makes a single donation decision, this is a between-subjects analysis.</p><p>There were no modifications to the pre-registered analysis plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>248 people (63% women) completed the study and the mean age was 37.04 (SD = 10.63). While we did not collect participant nationality, the population from which they are drawn, Prolific.ac.uk participant pool, are mostly resident in the UK (48%) or the US (29%) (Prolific, 2018).</p><p>In both experiments, a full model including a fixed effect for manipulation provided a better fit to the data than a comparison model without this manipulation variable (Study 1a: likelihood ratio = 137.56, p &lt; .0001, full and comparison model AIC: 1692, 1558.4 , full and comparison model BIC: 1719.3, 1594.9, Study 1b: likelihood ratio = 46.71, p &lt; .0001, full and comparison model AIC: 1235.1, 1192.4, full and comparison model BIC: 1261.6, 1227.7), see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> show the fixed effect coefficient estimates from the multilevel model.</p><p>Caregiving scores for aversive treatments were .72 points higher than for no treatment vignettes.</p><p>For reference, the standard deviation of caregiving index scores is .8. In study 1b, there was a statistically significant difference between self-treatment and no treatment (coefficient difference = 0.32, p &lt; .0001) and between prescribed-treatment and no treatment (coefficient difference = 0.30, p &lt; .0001), see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>. There was no statistically significant difference between self-treatment and prescribed treatment (coefficient difference = -0.02, p = .89). Thus, the presence of treatment has no effect on participants' propensity to vote to donate 25</p><p>GBP to a charity related to the treated disease.</p><p>To assess if participants had inferred the experimenter's intentions, and thereby might have biased the results, we asked participants "What question do you think the researchers are trying to answer?" at the end of study 1a and provided a free text box. Nine participants (4% of total)</p><p>correctly guessed that the aim was to assess caregiving when treatment levels varied. Excluding those participants from the analyses did not affect our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Participants were more inclined to provide care to people after medical treatments, especially after aversive treatments. No effect of the manipulation of participant donations to charity was observed. In hindsight, reading short vignettes about a specific person with symptoms may be too weak a manipulation to influence general attitudes towards charities loosely associated with these symptoms.</p><p>Studies 2a and 2b: Applications of signalling to mental health care and antibiotic stewardship Study 2 examines how signalling concerns might incentivise suboptimal treatment choice in two important health domains: drug treatment of mental health and antibiotic treatment of viral infections.</p><p>Many health problems, and particularly mental health problems, can be treated with drugs or with psychological treatments like therapy or exercise. These treatments might have different capacities to signal need: Psychological treatments like therapy, exercise, or self-administered cognitive behavioural therapy (three treatments recommended by the NHS) are unlikely to appear harmful and may not be effective at communicating need. In contrast, psychiatric drugs are perceived to be dangerous <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bongard et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Piguet et al., 2007)</ref>. In Study 2a we test the hypothesis that participants will be more likely to care for people who undergo pharmacological treatments than to people who undergo psychological treatments or no treatment.</p><p>Antibiotic resistance represents an important threat to human longevity and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Davies et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Howard et al., 2013)</ref>. In study 2b we examine if the ability of medical treatments to signal need incentivizes excessive antibiotic use. Two important antibiotic stewardship measures are (1) raising the threshold for prescriptions so that they are less often used for mild or viral infections and (2) delaying antibiotic use for a period to allow self-limiting illness to heal without intervention. Post-dated prescriptions are one way to delay use (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Spurling et al., 2017)</ref>. Non-use and delayed-use may provide patients with a weaker signal of need because they could be seen to indicate a minor infection. Antibiotic use, on the other hand, may suggest a health problem that justifies the population level-costs as well as the individuallevel harms. Hence antibiotic use may be a more effective signal of need for care than non-use or delayed use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Studies 2a and 2b were identical to Study 1b, bar the vignette content. In Study 2a, participants read three vignettes about characters with mental health problems who underwent either a drug treatment, a psychological treatment, or no treatment. After each vignette, participants completed the caregiving index. Both the symptoms profile and the treatment regimens were based on descriptions from the NHS website, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref>. </p></div>

We sought to include descriptions of treatments in the vignettes that closely mirror what might happen in clinical contexts. We therefore based the treatments on clinical trials assessing these stewardship measures. The treatment elements of the cough vignettes were based on the descriptions of the interventions in three arms of a trial by De la Poza Abad (2016). In this trial, participants were allocated to conditions including no offer of antibiotics, a delayed offer of antibiotics, or an immediate offer of antibiotics. In the urinary tract infection vignettes, the treatments were based on a trial by Little et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Little et al., 2010)</ref> in which patients in a delayed condition were offered antibiotics in a few days if they did not improve or were provided immediate antibiotics. We also included a no-antibiotic treatment in which, consistent with the UK's NICE guidelines, patients</p><p>were "advised that paracetamol can be used for pain relief". Thus, all three arms are plausible healthcare experiences for people in the UK with UTIs. The final set of treatments were derived from an RCT on management strategies for sore throat <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Little et al., 1997)</ref> in which patients were offered immediate antibiotics, antibiotics if symptoms failed to settle in three days, or no antibiotics.

There was no statistically significant difference between immediate antibiotics and delayed antibiotics. A sensitivity analysis with 300 Monte Carlo simulations using the SIMR package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016)</ref> indicated that this study had 80% power to detect changes of .18 units on the 1 to 5 caregiving scale. Therefore, a difference between immediate and delayed prescriptions that is smaller than .18 units may well be missed by these analyses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Results of study 2a indicate that participants were more likely to provide care when the vignette protagonist underwent a drug treatment. There was no evidence that psychological treatments had signalling value. This suggests that patients experience an incentive to reject psychological treatments and accept pharmacological treatments.</p><p>Participants perceived that an illness was more legitimate when the sick person received immediate or delayed antibiotics, supporting the hypothesis that antibiotic treatments have signalling value. If this finding generalises to real-world settings, antibiotic stewardship measures may benefit from considering how to provide people with evidence of need without antibiotics. The results are consistent with research indicating that 'legitimation' of illness to employers and others is an important reason for seeking treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Little et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Studies 3a, 3b, and 3c: Stigma, illness legitimacy, and patient preferences for aversive treatments Studies 1 and 2 show that people are more willing to provide care to those who undergo a medical treatment, creating an incentive for over-treatment. We next focus on how on how people respond to these incentives. In 3a, an observational study of people with chronic pain, we examine if patients are more inclined to accept aversive treatments if their social contacts suspect illness deception or are reacting negatively to their illness. Specifically, we assess if participants who report that others do not see their illness as legitimate or who experience illness stigma will be more accepting of treatments, and in particular aversive treatments, than participants whose friends/family feel their illness is legitimate.</p><p>Then, in two experimental studies, 3b and 3c, we randomise chronic pain patients to complete an illness-legitimacy measure or a control chronotype measure and then assess their willingness to accept treatments. We hypothesise that spending a few moments reflecting on the perceived legitimacy of one's illness will result in an increase in willingness to accept medical treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Sample In all studies, recruitment was limited to people who reported 3 months or more of pain on a prolific.ac pre-screening questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>In all three studies, treatment acceptance was assessed by asking participants if they would accept a series of treatments in order to access one additional pain-free day during their worst period of their pain. Four items assessed preferences for benign treatments with low signalling value (e.g., "I would do 1 hour of intense exercise every single day" or "I would download and use a pain-related smartphone app for 30 minutes every day") and the other four items assess preferences for more aversive treatments which presumably have greater signalling value (e.g., "I would undergo a minor surgery which will result in some visible scarring" or "I would take a drug that carries a risk of stroke"). See Part C of the Supplementary materials for the full list of items and the psychometric properties of the scales. The item order presentation was randomized between participants.</p><p>To assess chronic pain levels use used the Chronic Pain Grade Scale, it its original (studies 3a or 3b, B. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Smith et al. (1997))</ref> or newly revised form (study 3c, Von <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Korff et al. (2020)</ref>).</p><p>We also asked participants to describe the nature, duration, and location of their pain in free-text boxes.</p><p>In the correlational study, we included a measure of stigma, the eight-item Stigma Scale for Chronic Illnesses <ref type="bibr">(SSCI-8, Molina et al. (2013)</ref>) to assess people's sense that their value as a social partner has declined due to their illness. The SSCI-8 assess a sense that other people are avoiding or rejecting you (e.g, "Because of my pain/illness, I felt left out of things" or "Because of my pain/illness, people were unkind to me") and negative emotional responses to these loss of social value ("I felt embarrassed about my pain/illness").</p><p>To more directly measure the perception that other people think one's illness is legitimate, the correlational study (3a) used a 6-item measure, derived from the caregiving index used in studies 1 and 2. Items included "Other people sometimes think I am lazy rather than sick", "If people took my pain/illness more seriously, I would have greater support" and "Some friends and family members are skeptical of my pain/illness".</p><p>The experimental studies 3b and 3c used the same legitimacy measure as an experimental manipulation. In these between-subjects studies, participants were randomised to complete the legitimacy index or a control chronotype index with the same number of items. Since the results of study 3b were somewhat ambiguous, we repeated the study and included slight changes to the items and a free text box in which participants were invited to explain their responses. This was intended to increase the duration and intensity of the manipulation.</p><p>To summarise, 3a asks if low-legitimacy and stigma predict higher levels of treatment acceptance in a correlational study. In 3b and 3c, we examine if a manipulation to legitimacy (completing the legitimacy index) increases people's tendancy to accept treatments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>835 participants were recruited for Study 3. This excludes 64 participants who had scores 1 ("low disability low intensity pain") on the Chronic Pain Grade Scale in studies or 0 ("chronic pain absent" on the revised measure). Participant's mean age was 33.94 (SD = 11.04) (SD) and 54.65 % were women. 65.27 % experienced musculoskeletal chronic pain (e.g., back pain, joint pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia), 13.48% reported pain the internal organs (e.g., stomach pain, prolonged period pain) and 14.92% experienced pain the head/mouth/ears.</p><p>The cross-sectional data from Study 3a indicate that 182 people with chronic pain are more inclined to accept treatment if they report experiencing illness stigma or if they concerns about the perceived legitimacy of their illness, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 9</ref>. The effect of low legitimacy appears appears more pronounced for on aversive treatments, see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. (Note this analysis provides a clearer test of our hypotheses than the preregistered plan, but the qualitative patterns are similar, see Supplementary file, Part D).   Interaction plots showing legitimacy concerns influence aversive treatment concerns more than less aversive treatments.</p><p>Randomising chronic pain participants to complete an illness legitimacy measure (intended to briefly foreground people's legitimacy concerns) appeared to increased people's willingness to accept aversion treatments. In study 3b, the effect of this manipulation was in the predicted direction but not statistically significant. We therefore repeated the experiment (Study 3c) with minor modifications intended to increase the strength of the manipulation, resulting in larger effect sizes and statistically significant differences, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref>. Models including an interaction term did not indicate a stronger effect of the manipulation on more aversive therapies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Results are consistent with the theory that aversive treatments are deployed by people who struggle to gain support from others as a signal of authenticity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>These experiments show consistent support for the hypothesis that would-be caregivers use medical treatments -especially aversive treatments -as evidence of illness authenticity. A crosssectional study and two experiments suggest that patient's preferences may be shaped by these incentives: a perception that other people do not see your illness as legitimate is associated with greater preference for aversive treatments. This signalling incentive could lead people to consume more medical treatments than expected from a strictly biomedical perspectice.</p><p>Strictly speaking, acceptance of an aversive treatments provides information about the authenticity of someone's need for care, but not necessarily about the authenticity about the specific cause of that need for care. People with somatization disorders, for example, often undergo procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barsky et al., 2005)</ref> which have little biomedical effect but that may have some positive influence on their social position and potentially their self-image. It is worth nothing that effective treatments can be effective signals too, and we can expect patients to prefer these for obvious reasons.</p><p>While we have stressed the importance of aversive treatments that deter all but those to stand to gain significantly from caregiving, there are likely be a broad range of conditions where low-cost signals preferable. In some situations, the costs of providing support are so low that caregivers may be quite willing to help despite the risk of illness deception (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barra et al., 2019)</ref>. Similarly if honesty has been demonstrated in other past interactions or if the caregivers anticipate reciprocity, low-cost but potentially "fakable" communication may be sufficient. In these contexts, undergoing benign treatment (like homoeopathy or over-the-counter medicines) may adequately communicate ones need. In the varied circumstances of inter-personal dependency that illness creates, communication of need will likely take many forms including low and hight cost signals, and honest and dishonest signals (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barra et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Számadó, 2011</ref>).</p><p>Our results are some implications for healthcare. Patients with poor mental health often use pharmacological treatments over behavioural and psychological treatments for mental health problems, despite the fact that pharmacological treatments are sometimes less effective and more harmful <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cronin et al., 2020)</ref>, with side effects like gastrointestinal problems, weight-gain, and sexual dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cascade et al., 2009)</ref>. Our results suggest an explanation for this pattern of behaviour: Because they are perceived as harmful <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bongard et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Piguet et al., 2007)</ref>, pharmacological treatments are more effective in signalling to others that one has a legitimate need for care. Exercise, on the other hand, may signal vitality and capacity rather than illness, reducing the perception of need. By better understanding the social consequences of treatment choice, researchers may be able to better understand how to develop non-pharmacological interventions that do not undermine user's ability to recruit care from others.</p><p>Over 80% of human antibiotic use occurs in primary care <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Goossens et al., 2005)</ref>, where unnecessary prescriptions for infections like colds and cough are common. These results support our hypothesis that patients are incentivized by the signalling value of treatments to seek antibiotic treatment irrespective of their curative value. Consistent with this, educational interventions that successfully influence patients' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about antibiotics appear to have little effects on prescription rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Burstein et al., 2019)</ref>, perhaps because they do not address the underling motive for treatment.</p><p>More broadly, signalling concerns may be one important force driving demand for treatments that are, from a strictly biomedical perspective, unnecessary. Medical procedures with no or even negative direct effects are strikingly common across cultures and through history.</p><p>Today, "low-value" treatments are an important cause of rising health care costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brownlee et al., 2017)</ref>. The Institute for Medicine, for example, estimates that $210 billion is spent on biomedically unnecessary treatment each year in the US alone (M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Smith et al., 2013</ref>). If we look beyond conventional medicine to traditions that make less use of robust tools for evaluating outcomes, the scale of overtreatment is larger still. Our results suggest that when signalling considerations are present, the marginal value of additional medical consumption is higher. We might expect individuals to undergo treatments to undergo treatments with limited or negative biomedical action if the treatment enables them to credible signal a need for care. Of course, from the patient's perspective, treatments with biomedical as well as social benefits will be preferred. However, our read of contemporary as well as historical medicine is that effective treatments are often unavailable <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wootton, 2006)</ref>. Signalling concerns may influence the kinds of treatments patients prefer as well as the quantity. All else equal, treatments perceived to be harmful and risky may have an advantage over ones perceived to have few risks or side effects.</p><p>More observable treatments (splints, operations etc.) present greater scope for displaying need than more subtle privately consumed medicines.</p><p>Study 3a usefully demonstrates the boundary conditions of the signalling model. Firstly, chronic pain patients with few concerns about legitimacy and who experience little stigma are less likely to seek aversive care. Secondly, signalling concerns are less likely to drive overuse of benign treatments like homoeopathy. Instead, we expect signalling concerns to play an important role in patient preferences for extensive diagnostics (e.g., scans), surgery and other kinds of invasive and potentially harmful treatments.</p><p>Our study used pre-registered experimental methods to test predictions grounded in welldeveloped theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barker et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">de Barra et al., 2019)</ref> with real-world relevance.</p><p>However, caution is warranted when generalizing online studies to health seeking behaviour and caregiving beyond the lab. Another limitation of this study is that we used a novel self-reported outcome measure, the caregiving index, reflecting people's willingness to provide care.</p><p>However, our validation work suggests good internal consistency and reliability of the scale, as well as convergent validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>People appear to be more willing to provide care to people with ambiguous symptoms who undergo an aversive treatment. This, in turn, serves as an incentive for the use of medical treatments, independent of their effectiveness. Treatments can provide a badge of authenticity, enabling patients to persuasive communicate their need and enabling caregivers to allocate their resources efficiently. This may be an important but overlooked mechanism that can explain some patterns of medical decision making.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>AnalysisA linear mixed effects model in which scores were nested within participants was used to test theeffects of the disease manipulation on the caregiving index scores. Participants are modelled as random effects while manipulation (no treatment v treatment v aversive treatment), disease, and sex are modelled as fixed effects. The fit of a full model (care &amp; ! = manipulation ! + disease ! + sex ! + participant "[!] ) was compared to a model without the manipulation (care &amp; ! = disease ! + sex ! + participant "[!] ) using a AIC, BIC and likelihood ratios.
