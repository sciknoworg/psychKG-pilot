				<p>Probabilistic models of delay discounting allow the estimation of discount functions without assuming that these functions describe sharp boundaries in decision making. However, existing probabilistic models allow for two implausible possibilities: first, that no reward might sometimes be preferred over some reward (e.g., $0 now over $100 in 1 year), and second, that the same reward might sometimes be preferred later rather than sooner (e.g., $100 in a year over $100 now). Here we show that probabilistic models of discounting perform better when they assign these cases a probability of 0. We demonstrate this result across a range of discount functions using nonlinear regression. We also introduce a series of generalized linear models that implicitly parameterize various discount functions, and demonstrate the same result for these. The nonlinear regression method we describe is available as an open-source R package called &quot;ddDesidModels&quot; (https://github.com/kinleyid/ddDesidModels).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Delay discounting and discount functions</head><p>Humans and other animals exhibit a near-universal tendency to subjectively devalue future rewards as a function of their delay, a phenomenon known as "delay discounting." The steepness with which future rewards are discounted has been implicated in a range of psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amlung et al., 2019)</ref> and associated with addictive <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amlung et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">MacKillop et al., 2011)</ref> and otherwise unhealthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Story et al., 2014)</ref> behaviours.</p><p>A long-standing problem in the delay discounting literature has been to determine the form of the "discount function" describing the decline in a reward's subjective value with respect to its delay, that is, to determine the function f satisfying the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u(D) = v D f (t; p)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where u(D), the subjective utility of a future reward D, is equal to its face value v D multiplied by a function f of its delay t parameterized by some parameter vector p. For example, if t is equal to 1 year, and f (t; p) = 0.5, then $100 in 1 year has a subjective value of only $50. This means that an agent obeying this discount function would be indifferent between $50 available immediately and $100 available in 1 year. Any function f should satisfy the following constraints: first, for f (0; p) = 1 (i.e., no delay implies no discounting). Second, f (t 2 ; p) &lt; f (t 1 ; p) if t 2 &gt; t 1 , i.e., f should be monotonically decreasing with respect to t.</p><p>A range of functions satisfying these constraints has been proposed. The classical model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Samuelson (1937)</ref> describes exponential discounting:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f (t; k) = e −kt<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where k is an individual-difference parameter controlling the rate at which subjective value declines with reward. In the exponential model, discounting compounds at a constant rate, namely 1 − e −k per unit time. However, empirically, people exhibit declining discount rates with increasing delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Thaler, 1981)</ref>. For example, the subjective value of a reward may decline 10% with a delay of 1 month but only 50% with a delay of 12 months, whereas a constant compound discount rate of 10% per month would mean that the subjective value of the reward is only 0.9 12 ≈ 12% of its face value.</p><p>An alternative function that can account for this declining rate of discounting is the following, describing hyperbolic discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mazur, 1987)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (t; k) = 1 1 + kt (3)</formula><p>where k is again a parameter controlling the rate of discounting. It can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f (t; k) = e − log(1+kt) t t</formula><p>which describes exponential discounting with a compound discount rate 1 − e − log(1+kt) t that declines with increasing t.</p><p>Hyperbolic discounting is widely used to quantify individual differences in delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Odum, 2011)</ref>. However, it is argued to not always provide an accurate fit to individual-level data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Franck et al., 2015)</ref> and a wide range of alternative discount functions has been proposed. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides a list of commonly used functions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Probabilistic models of discounting</head><p>The best-fitting parameters of a given discount function for a given individual decision maker can be obtained by maximum likelihood estimation. We can impose the following general probabilistic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Becker et al., 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dai and Busemeyer, 2014)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P (I) = σ [γ(u(I) − u(D))]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where P (I) is the probability of selecting an immediate reward I, σ[x] = 1 1+e −x is the logistic function, and γ is a parameter controlling the steepness of the logistic function. In this model, the probability of selecting the immediate reward is modelled as a logistic function of the difference between the subjective utility of the immediate reward and that of the delayed reward. u(I), the subjective utility of the immediate reward I, is simply its face value v I . u(D), the subjective value of the delayed reward D, is given by equation 1. Thus equation 4 can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p(I) = σ [γ(v I − v D f (t; p)] (5)</formula><p>Maximum likelihood estimation can then be used to obtain a set of parametersp fit to an individual's decisions.</p><p>There are special cases where we can recover a discount function by manipulating the regression coefficients from a generalized linear model of decision behaviour, thereby avoiding nonlinear regression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wileyto et al. (2004)</ref> introduce this approach for the hyperbolic discounting function, using the following logistic regression equation to model the probability of selecting the immediate reward:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P (I) = σ β 1 1 − v D v I + β 2 t<label>(6)</label></formula><p>When P (I) = 1 2 , an individual is indifferent between the immediate and delayed rewards, meaning their subjective values are equal, i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">u(I) = u(D) meaning v I = v D f (t; p)</formula><p>Thus, we can set P (I) = 1 2 and replace v I by v D f (t; p), and then rearrange the equation to obtain a discount function parameterized by the regression weights. Because the logistic function σ[•] produces a value of 1 2 only when its input is 0, we write</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">β 1 1 − 1 f (t; p) + β 2 t = 0</formula><p>Solving for f (t; p), we arrive at</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">f (t; p) = 1 1 + β2 β1 t</formula><p>which describes hyperbolic discounting with k = β2 β1 . We can extend this approach to the case of exponential discounting using the following regression equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P (I) = σ β 1 log v I v D + β 2 t<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Repeating the steps above to solve for f (t; p), we arrive at</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">f (t; p) = e − β 2 β 1 t</formula><p>which describes exponential discounting with k = β2 β1 . Similarly, for scaled exponential discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Laibson, 1997)</ref>, we can use the following regression equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">P (I) = σ β 1 log v I v D + β 2 t + β 3 (8) yielding f (t; p) = e − β 3 β 1 e − β 2 β 1 t<label>(9)</label></formula><p>which describes scaled exponential discounting with w = e − β 3 β 1 and k = e − β 2 β 1 . Unfortunately, this approach is not possible for all discount functions. For example, the inverse qexponential discount function <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Green and Myerson, 2004)</ref> cannot be written in a form that is linear in parameters (which is necessary for a function to be recoverable from a linear model).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Desiderata for probabilistic models of discounting</head><p>Both the general model described by equation 5 and the special cases using generalized linear regression suffer from the same shortcoming: they make implausible predictions for cases where the immediate reward is nothing (i.e., when v I = 0) and where the immediate and delayed rewards have equal face values (i.e., v I = v D ). For these boundary cases, common sense would suggest that a probabilistic model of discounting should satisfy the following desiderata:</p><p>D1. Something rather than nothing: when the immediate reward has a value of 0, it should never be chosen. I.e., v I = 0 implies P (I) = 0. For example, we would expect someone to never choose $0 now over $100 in a year.</p><p>D2. Sooner rather than later: when the immediate and delayed rewards have equal dollar values, the immediate reward should always be chosen. I.e., v I = v D implies P (I) = 1. For example, we would expect someone to always choose $100 now over $100 in a year.</p><p>For the general probabilistic model described by equation 5, the probability of selecting the immediate reward is always greater than 0 and less than 1, and thus D1 and D2 above are not satisfied.</p><p>Interestingly, for the special generalized linear regression cases, D1 is satisfied. For the case of hyperbolic discounting, the expression that is linear in the β parameters approaches negative infinity as v I approaches 0:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">lim v I →0 + β 1 1 − v D v I + β 2 t = −∞</formula><p>Therefore, the logistic function of this expression approaches 0 as v I approaches 0:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">lim v I →0 + σ β 1 1 − v D v I + β 2 t = 0</formula><p>satisfying D1. Similarly, for the case of exponential and scaled exponential discounting:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">lim v I →0 + β 1 log v I v D + β 2 t = −∞ lim v I →0 + β 1 log v I v D + β 2 t + β 3 = −∞ thus: lim v I →0 + σ β 1 log v I v D + β 2 t = 0 lim v I →0 + σ β 1 log v I v D + β 2 t + β 3 = 0</formula><p>again satisfying D1. However, D2 is not satisfied for any of these models. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows that, for a given value of t, at v I = v D there is a nonzero chance of the delayed reward being selected (e.g., of a choice of $100 in 1 year over $100 now). The aim of the current study is to offer probabilistic methods of discounting that satisfy both D1 and D2, and to determine whether these models better describe empirical discounting behaviour. For brevity, we will refer to models that satisfy both desiderata as "D+ models" and models not satisfying both desiderata as "D− models".</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Model fitting</head><p>For each model, the quality of fit was assessed according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akaike, 1974)</ref> as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">AIC = 2n − 2 lnL</formula><p>where n is the number of parameters in the model andL is the likelihood of the data under the model. Lower AIC values indicate better model fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Numerical optimization</head><p>We compared the general probabilistic model in equation 5 to the following model, which satisfies D1 and D2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">P (I) = σ γ σ −1 v I v D − σ −1 [f (t; p)]<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">σ −1 [x] = log x 1−</formula><p>x is the logit function, the inverse of the logistic function (figure 3). As v I approaches 0, the logit function approaches −∞ and P (I) approaches 0, satisfying D1. Similarly, as v I approaches v D , the logit function approaches ∞ and P (I) approaches 1, satisfying D2. Moreover, as in the generalized linear models described above, P (I) = 1 2 only when</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">v I = v D f (t; p)</formula><p>, that is, when the face value of the immediate reward is equal to the discounted value of the delayed reward. Thus, the meaning of the discount function in the D− model is preserved in the D+ model.</p><p>However, comparing the D+ and D− models in equations 5 and 10, we can see that they differ in more than their satisfaction of D1 and D2: the D− model accounts for the absolute values of the rewards whereas the D+ model does not. We can see this by rewriting the D− model as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">p(I) = σ γv D v I v D − f (t; p)<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Thus, the D− and D+ models differ not only in whether the terms v I v D and f (t; p) are logit-transformed (and thus whether they satisfy D1 and D2), but also whether the sharpness parameter γ is scaled by the face value of the delayed reward. This means that any difference in quality of fit between the models could be a consequence of this difference in scaling rather than a consequence of differential satisfaction of D1 and D2. To create models comparable without any such confound, and to remain agnostic as to whether the sharpness parameter should scale linearly, nonlinearly, or not at all with v D , we performed a second comparison, introducing the following scale factor in both equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">ς(v D ; α, λ) = α ln λ v D + 1<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where by ln λ v D we denote the one-parameter Box-Cox transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Box and Cox, 1964)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_28">of v D : ln λ v D =    v λ D − 1 λ , if λ ̸ = 0 ln(v D ), if λ = 0<label>(13)</label></formula><p>As shown in figure 4, ς(v D ; α, λ) allows γ to scale linearly, nonlinearly, or not at all with v D depending on the values of α and λ. Thus, a second set of comparisons were made between the following probabilistic models:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">P (I) = σ γς(v D ; α, λ) v I v D − f (t; p)<label>(14)</label></formula><p>which does not satisfy D1 and D2, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">P (I) = σ γς(v D ; α, λ) σ −1 v I v D − σ −1 [f (t; p)]<label>(15)</label></formula><p>which satisfies both D1 and D2. Maximum likelihood estimation was performed via Nelder-Mead optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Nelder and Mead, 1965)</ref> as implemented by the optim function in R v4.2.3 (R Core Team, 2023). To ensure the discount functions were positive and monotonically decreasing, k and s parameters were constrained to be greater than 0 and w parameters were constrained to be between 0 and 1. Moreover, α was constrained to be greater than 0 to ensure that the probability of selecting the immediate reward increased with the value of the immediate reward. These constraints were imposed by reparameterization: for a parameter θ, the constraint θ &gt; 0 was imposed by letting θ = e θ ′ and optimizing over θ ′ . Similarly, the constraint 0 &lt; θ &lt; 1 was imposed by letting</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">α = 30, λ = 0 α = 6, λ = 1 2 α = 0, λ ∈ R α = 1, λ = 1 0 100 200 0 100 200 1 1 v D ς(v D ; α, λ)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">θ = σ[θ ′ ], where σ[•]</formula><p>is the sigmoid function, and again optimizing over θ ′ . Each parameter being optimized (θ ′ in the above reparameterizations) had a starting value of −5, 0, or 5 (except for λ, which had starting a starting value of −1, 0, or 1), and each combination of starting values was used to ensure that a wide range of the parameter space was explored. Thus, each optimization was repeated 3 (number of parameters) times.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion and future directions</head><p>We have demonstrated that probabilistic models of delay discounting can be improved by a simple alteration to ensure they satisfy commonsense desiderata in boundary cases where the immediate reward is nothing, and where the immediate and delayed rewards have equal face values. We have demonstrated this improvement both for nonlinear regression models and for fast-and-simple generalized linear models. In so doing, we introduced a series of novel models following the approach introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wileyto et al. (2004)</ref> in which a discount function is implied by a generalized linear model and parameterized by its regression weights. The boundary case desiderata (D1 and D2) assume that individuals should always choose some reward over nothing and should always choose the same reward sooner rather than later. These assumptions are normative, and in practice not all participants will conform to them, perhaps even for rationally intelligible reasons. For example, perhaps I know I will spend $100 in a year on something harmful that will become available then and so I instead opt for nothing (i.e., I choose $0 now over $100 in a year). Similarly, perhaps I want something that costs $100 and only becomes available in a year, but I know that if I receive $100 now I will end up spending it too early, and so I opt to postpone the reward (i.e., I choose $100 in a year over $100 now).</p><p>However, idiosyncratic cases like these have to be glossed over in normative models of decision making. Moreover, it seems more likely that choosing nothing over something or choosing the same reward later rather than sooner would reflect inattention or motor error rather than a genuine preference. These sources of noise are fundamentally different from the stochasticity inherent in the decision process assumed by various models of decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Becker et al., 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ratcliff, 1978)</ref>. Thus, norm-violating decisions should not be used to estimate normative models of decision making but might instead be taken as indicators of data quality. For example, in a recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lin et al. (2018)</ref> refer to choices between the same reward sooner vs later as "no-brainer" decisions and remove data from participants who made the "wrong" decision in these cases too often.</p><p>There are several ways that future work might extend on the results presented here. First, none of the present models account for the well-known "magnitude effect" in which participants exhibit shallower discounting when absolute reward values are higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Green et al., 1997)</ref>. One approach here, suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wileyto et al. (2004)</ref>, is to let k = k 0 + mv D , where m quantifies the magnitude effect. We can add a third term to their original regression equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">equation 6</ref>to account for the magnitude effect as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">P (I) = σ β 1 1 − v D v I + β 2 t + β 3 tv D</formula><p>The following discount function is then recoverable:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">f (t; p) = 1 1 + β2 β1 + β3 β1 v D t</formula><p>which describes hyperbolic discounting, accounting for the magnitude effect with k 0 = β2 β1 and m = β3 β1 . It is possible that equivalent alterations could be made to the other generalized linear models. For nonlinear models, we could likewise replace k parameters with k 0 + mv D .</p><p>A second direction for future work might be to extend the present models to account for cases in which the earlier reward is not immediate (e.g., in the choice between $50 in 2 months or $100 in a year). In this case, we refer not to immediate and delayed rewards I and D, but instead to sooner and later rewards S and L. The indifference point is then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">v S f (t S ; p) = v L f (t L ; p)</formula><p>where v S is the value of the sooner reward S and t S is its delay. v L and t L have equivalent meanings in terms of L. For these cases, we can again extend the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wileyto et al. (2004)</ref> as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">P (S) = σ β 1 1 − v L v S + β 2 t L − t S v L v S</formula><p>where P (S) is the probability of selecting the smaller sooner reward. This reduces to the original equation (6) when t L = 0. If we let P (S) = 1 2 and set v L v S = f (t S ;p) f (t L ;p) (based on the definition of the indifference point), we can derive the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">f (t S ; p) f (t L ; p) = 1 1+ β 2 β 1 t S 1 1+ β 2 β 1 t L</formula><p>which implies hyperbolic discounting with k = β2 β1 . Similarly, for nonlinear regression models, we could compare the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">P (S) = σ v S v L − f (t L ; p) f (t S ; p)</formula><p>which satisfies neither D1 nor D2, with the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">P (S) = σ σ −1 v S v L − σ −1 f (t L ; p) f (t S ; p)</formula><p>which satisfies both. These models are not derivable from equation 4, but nonetheless ensure that the indifference point P (S) = 1 2 occurs only when the discounted values of the rewards are equal, i.e., when v S f (t S ; p) = v L f (t L ; p). Such extensions of the models presented here may prove to be fruitful avenues for future inquiry.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Plot of the logit functionσ −1 [x] = log x 1−x .As x approaches 0, the logit function approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches 1, the logit function approaches positive infinity.</figDesc></figure>
