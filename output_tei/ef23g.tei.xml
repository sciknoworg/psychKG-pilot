			<abstract>
				<p>Life abounds with situations in which we must decide whether to act unethically for personal gain or to be prosocial, thus maintaining a positive image of ourselves as being a &apos;good person&apos;. Evidence suggests that acute stress may influence moral decisions and prosocial behavior. However, it is currently unclear whether stress increases or decreases immoral behavior. Here, we hypothesize that stress, through its effects on cognitive control, has different effects on moral decision making for different individuals, depending on their moral default. We test this hypothesis by combining a task which allows for inconspicuously measuring spontaneous cheating with a well-established stress induction task. Our findings confirm our hypothesis, revealing that effects of stress on dishonesty are not uniform, but instead depend on the individual: for those who are relatively dishonest, stress increases dishonesty, whereas for participants who are relatively honest stress does not increase dishonesty and perhaps makes them even slightly more honest. These findings go a long way in resolving the conflicting findings in the literature on the effects of stress on prosocial behavior, suggesting that stress affects prosocial behavior differently for different individuals, depending on their moral default.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Our everyday life is full of situations in which we have to choose between behaving unethically for personal gain or being prosocial and thus maintaining a positive image of ourselves as being a 'good person'. Just think of cheating on your tax return, cheating in sports or board games or indeed fudging or faking research data. Often these moral conflicts need to be resolved under acute stress or can elicit stress themselves as for instance when considering cheating in an exam.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that acute stress influences moral decisions and prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Starcke et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Starcke et al., , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Taylor, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">von Dawans et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Youssef et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Faber &amp; Häusser, 2022)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Starcke and colleagues (2011)</ref> found that a higher stress response was associated with more selfish decisions in emotional moral dilemmas. In contrast, van Dawans and colleagues (2012), found that stressed participants engaged in more prosocial behavior, as expressed by more trusting and trustworthy behavior and increased sharing. As illustrated by these examples, it is not at all clear whether stress increases or decreases immoral behavior.</p><p>A potential mechanism through which stress may influence moral decisions is cognitive control.</p><p>Specifically, the Stress Induced Deliberation-to-Intuition (SIDI) model proposes that changes in decision-making under acute stress result from a combination of impaired cognitive control and enhanced intuitive response tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Yu, 2016)</ref>. This model is supported by research showing stress-induced shifts from deliberative and goal-directed behavior to habitual and automatized behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schwabe &amp; Wolf, 2009</ref>. In addition, from a neural perspective, it has been found that stress impairs prefrontal functions such as directing attention and inhibiting inappropriate actions, which are essential components of self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arnsten, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Starcke et al., 2012)</ref>. More precisely, it has been shown that stress is associated with reduced functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr">(vmPFC;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Maier et al., 2015)</ref>. A strong functional connectivity between these two brain areas has been associated with successful self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hare et al., 2009</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Scholz et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, higher cortisol levels, associated with acute stress, were found to be correlated with increased connectivity between vmPFC, ventral striatum and amygdala, which the authors interpret as an enhanced motivational signal favoring the immediately rewarding option <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Maier et al., 2015)</ref>. Taken together, in accordance with the SIDI model <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Yu, 2016)</ref>, these findings suggest that stress biases the decision process in the brain by reducing self-control capacities while increasing the motivational salience of intuitive actions that are often associated with immediate reward.</p><p>In a series of recent studies, it was shown that this capacity for self-control also plays an important role in dishonesty (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Speer et al., 2022b)</ref>. These studies reveal that there are substantial individual differences in (dis)honesty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gino &amp; Wiltermuth, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Speer et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Speer et al., , 2022a</ref>, with some being extremely honest and some being completely dishonest, and everything in between. These individual differences to a large extent determine how individuals employ cognitive control to resolve moral conflict. It was found that cognitive control is not needed to be honest or dishonest per se, but that it depends on an individual's moral default. Cognitive control allows individuals to override their moral default, helping intuitively dishonest participants to be honest, whereas it promotes cheating for intuitively honest participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Speer et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Speer et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Speer et al., , 2022a</ref>).</p><p>In light of these findings, we hypothesize that stress, through its effects on cognitive control, will have different effects on moral decision making depending on a person's moral default. A person who is intuitively honest will be less able to override their moral default and will thus become more honest under stress, whereas a cheater will cheat even more, as self-control processes are impaired and intuitive decisions are facilitated. A person's moral default may thus determine whether stress increases or decreases honesty.</p><p>Not taking the moderating role of a person's moral default into account may help explain the mixed results of the effect of stress on moral decisions reported in the literature. In a recent review of 19 studies on the effect of acute stress on moral decisions and prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Faber &amp; Häusser, 2022)</ref>, seven studies found decreased prosocial behavior under stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bendahan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">FeldmanHall et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Potts et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sollberger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Vinkers et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">von Dawans et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>, four reported increased prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tomova et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">von Dawans et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">von Dawans et al., , 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zhen et al., 2021)</ref>, five revealed mixed results depending on certain moderators <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Margittai et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nickels et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Prasad et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schweda et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Youssef et al., 2018)</ref>, and three studies did not find any behavioral differences between stress and control conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schweda et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Singer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Veszteg et al., 2021</ref>).</p><p>In the current study we test the hypothesis that a person's moral default moderates the effect of stress on (dis)honesty by combining the newly developed Spot-The-Differences Task (SPOT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Speer et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Speer et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Speer et al., , 2022a</ref>, which allows for inconspicuously measuring spontaneous cheating on a trial-by-trial basis, with the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST), a well-established stress induction task. We implemented a mixed design in which participants completed a first block of the SPOT cheating task, were then exposed to either a psychosocial stress task or a matched control task, and then ended the experiment with the second and final block of the SPOT.</p><p>An individual's level of cheating in the first block of the SPOT is taken as a measure of the participant's moral default. This design allowed us to test for differences in cheating behavior due to the induction of acute stress, while accounting for participants' moral default.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 120 participants (62 females; age 18-28 years; M = 20.6, SD = 2.28) from an online community for university students, where students can sign up for experiments. The study was approved by the university's internal review board and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>Participants completed two tasks in this study: two blocks of the Spot-The-Differences task <ref type="bibr">(SPOT;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Speer et al., 2020)</ref> to measure cheating behavior and the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Smeets et al., 2012)</ref> in between the two blocks of the SPOT task to induce acute stress.</p><p>Random assignment of participants to one of two conditions (acute stress and control) allowed us to test the effect of acute stress on cheating by comparing changes in cheating behavior in the acute stress versus control group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAST</head><p>The MAST is a well-established stress paradigm which is used in various scientific disciplines ranging from cognitive and social neuroscience to psychology and medical sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(O'Connor et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Quaedflieg, van de Ven, et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Treadway et al., 2017: amongst others)</ref>. The MAST combines social with physical stressors and has been found to reliably induce elevated cortisol levels and subjective ratings of stress. The MAST consists of a 5 min preparation phase and a 10 min acute stress phase (in total 15 min). It is a combination of a Hand Immersion Task (in ice cold water, see below) which induces physical discomfort and a socially evaluative aspect, involving being judged on a Mental Arithmetic Task and being filmed throughout the whole task, which induces social stress. It is important to note 6 that while participants were under the impression of being filmed by means of a visible camera set up, no actual recordings were made for privacy reasons. The MAST control condition consists of immersing a hand in lukewarm water and conducting a far simpler mental arithmetic task without social evaluation as explained in more detail below. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> presents an overview of the MAST procedure. The 5 min preparation period served to seat participants in front of a computer screen and instruct them about the upcoming task via a PowerPoint presentation. Participants were informed about the Hand Immersion task, the Mental Arithmetic Task, and that they were going to be monitored by the experimenter as well as</p><p>videotaped so as to later analyze their facial expressions. In addition, they would have to provide written consent for the videotaping and were informed that they would have the right to withdraw at any time during the task. It was also made clear to them that the whole procedure would be quite uncomfortable.</p><p>In the MAST, Hand Immersion and Mental Arithmetic trials are presented alternatingly and with varying lengths (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. The order and duration of the trials are predetermined and identical for all participants. However, participants were told that the duration of each trial would vary randomly but would never exceed 90 s. Specifically, participants were instructed that the hand immersion trials would vary in duration but would never last longer than 90s. They were also told that the hand immersion trials would alternate with Mental Arithmetic trials that would minimally last 45 s.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Smeets et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Hand Immersion Task. Participants were instructed to immerse their hand up to and including the wrist in ice-cold water (temperature at the start of the session (degrees Celsius): M = 2.24, SD = 0.55; temperature at the end of the session: M = 2.92; SD = 0.7) while they were being videotaped and closely monitored by an experimenter that displayed a lack of empathy, by keeping a neutral facial expression in spite of the participants' discomfort. They were told that the videotapes would be analyzed for facial expressions of pain. It was also made clear that participants were allowed to withdraw their hand at any time (n=6 participants made use of this option; supplementary materials show that the main findings are robust to exclusion of these participants). Participants could place their arm on a towel next to the water bath after each Hand Immersion trial and during the Mental Arithmetic trials.</p><p>Mental Arithmetic Task. The Mental Arithmetic Task consisted of counting backwards starting at 2043 in steps of 17 as fast and accurately as possible. Also during this mental arithmetic task, participants were led to believe that they were videotaped. Each time they made a mistake, they were given negative feedback (the experimenter verbally pointed out they made a mistake) and were requested to start over at 2043. They were told to continue with the mental arithmetic until the computer signaled the end of the trial. Participants were informed that the arithmetic task would take at least 45 s (max 90s, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control Condition.</head><p>As in the experimental condition of the MAST, the control condition consisted of a 5 min preparation phase and 10 minutes of Hand Immersion alternated with Mental Arithmetic. The 5 min preparation phase was identical to that of the experimental condition of the MAST, except that no mention of audio-or videotaping was made and that participants were told that the water was lukewarm (temperature at the start of the session (degrees Celsius): M = 35.21, SD = 1.69; temperature at the end of the session: M = 32.27; SD = 1.75). In between the Hand Immersion trials, participants performed the Mental Arithmetic Task while resting their arm on a towel alongside the water bath. In the control condition the arithmetic task consisted of counting from 1 to 25 at their own pace starting anew at 1 when 25 was reached. The experimenter remained in the room to check participants' compliance with the instructions, but participants were not given any feedback on their performance. The duration of the various trials and their order paralleled that of the experimental condition of the MAST (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spot-The-Differences Task</head><p>In the Spot-The-Differences task (SPOT; Speer et al., 2020) participants were presented with pairs of cartoon images and instructed that there are always three differences between the images and their task is to find them. Differences consisted of objects that were added to or removed from an image, or objects that differed in color between images. Participants were instructed that the purpose of the study was to investigate the accuracy of visual search for marketing purposes such as searching for a product in an assortment or information on a webpage. In order to increase credibility of this cover story, a simple visual search task was added at the beginning of the experiment (see Appendix 1). Further, participants were instructed that the effect of motivation, elicited by monetary reward, on speed and accuracy of visual search would be investigated.</p><p>Crucially, although participants were told that there were three differences in all trials, in 25% of the trials there were only two differences and in 25% there was only one difference. Since reward (see below) was contingent on participants reporting that they had found all three differences, without having to point them out, this design allowed and encouraged cheating behavior (i.e., reporting having found all three, even when objectively fewer than three differences were present in the images).</p><p>All stimuli were standardized in size and were presented on a white background on a computer screen. The ratio of 50% -50% (three differences vs fewer than three differences) was chosen based on the results of pilot studies that indicated this ratio to be optimal in reducing suspicion that the pairs did not always contain three differences.</p><p>Trials were further categorized into normal (~50%), hard (~25%) and very hard trials (~25%), for which participants could receive 5cts, 20cts, and 40cts, respectively. The majority of trials with three differences (the filler trials) were categorized as normal trials (~88%) and the majority of trials with one or two differences (cheatable trials) were categorized as hard or very hard (98%, the trials of interest). To reduce suspicion that none of the harder trials contain three differences, some of the three difference trials were categorized as hard or very hard and some of the trials with one or two differences were categorized as normal. The reward was independent of the number of differences in the image pair for the trials of interest. The different levels of difficulty were added to reduce suspicion about the real purpose of the task. It was assumed that if trials are labeled as hard or very hard, it would be more credible to the participant that the image pair actually contained three differences, but they were just too hard to spot. In addition, levels of difficulty were introduced to eliminate possible demand effects: we wanted participants to cheat for monetary reward and not to prevent seeming incompetent, which may be associated with different underlying psychological mechanisms and consequently confound the analysis.</p><p>To further reduce suspicion about the purpose of the study, approximately 10% of all trials (12 trials) were point-and-click trials. In these trials, participants had to click on the location in the images where they spotted the differences. Consequently, cheating was not possible on the pointand-click trials. Participants could only click three times, after which the trial advanced. If participants clicked on the wrong locations they did not receive any reward for that trial.</p><p>Participants always knew prior to the start of a trial whether it was a point-and-click trial, indicated by a screen requesting participants to click on the image. This ensured that participants would not refrain from cheating on all other trials, while still reducing the suspicion about the real purpose of the study. Participants were told that only approximately 10% of trials were point-and-click trials because it would take too much time to point out the differences for every pair. For the point-andclick trials 12 additional stimuli were used. All of the point-and-click trials had three differences.</p><p>Six of the point-and-click trials were labeled as normal, three were labeled as hard and three were labeled as very hard. This was done to mirror the ratio of levels of difficulty in the regular trials.</p><p>For the hard and very hard trials we used stimuli that during the pilot testing for the stimuli were too hard to be used as regular trials, that is trials with an average completion time (time to find all three differences) longer than 6 s. In sum, there were 132 regular trials (of which approximately half were cheatable trials) and 12 point-and-click trials. The maximum amount of money earned if a participant cheated on all cheatable trials was approximately 25 Euros, whereas if a participant did not cheat at all, he or she would earn approximately 4 Euros. After completion of the full study, participants were debriefed. Then, all participants received the maximum of 35 Euros (including the 10 Euros show-up fee) irrespective of their actual cheating behavior.</p><p>Each trial started with a fixation cross which was presented for a variable amount of time between 1 and 3 s (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). Subsequently, the Level of Difficulty screen was presented for 2 s, informing the participants about the level of difficulty of the upcoming trial. This screen also displayed how much money could be earned on that trial. As a result, participants were aware of the potential gains of cheating on every trial. Subsequently, another jittered fixation cross appeared (jittered between 1 and 3 s). Next, an image pair was presented for 6 s, a duration that was determined by behavioral pilot testing to be sufficient for most participants to find all the differences (see Appendix 2), and participants engaged in searching for the three differences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Speer et al., 2020</ref> for examples of the image pairs). Finally, participants were asked whether they spotted three differences (yes/no response). On this decision screen, again the potential reward for this trial was presented, to make the reward more salient and increase cheating behavior and participants' responses were recorded. On the decision screen the current balance was also shown, which was done to demonstrate to the participants that if they stated that they had found the three differences, their current balance increased immediately. It was assumed that this direct noticeable effect of behavior on the increase of the current balance would further motivate participants to cheat. The buttons corresponding to "Yes" and "No" were switched across trials. Additional analysis confirmed that switching did not induce confounding effects. Once the participants responded, the choice was highlighted by a blue box for 500 ms to indicate that the response was recorded, and the trial ended. If no response was made, the trial ended after 4 s. In addition, there were five practice trials, in which participants could get acquainted with the task. Stimulus presentation and data acquisition was performed using Presentation® software (Version 18.0, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, www.neurobs.com).</p><p>Stimuli for the SPOT Task. Stimuli for the task consisted of 144 image pairs that were downloaded from the Internet. Cartoon images of landscapes containing several objects were selected, to make them engaging and challenging enough for the participants. Landscapes were chosen as they generally satisfied the necessary criterion of containing several different objects. The stimuli consist of pairs of images that are identical apart from a certain number (1-3) of differences that were created using Adobe Photoshop. Differences consisted of objects added to or removed from the landscape picture or changed colors of objects. Differences were fully randomized across all pairs of images, which means that all image pairs could be presented with either one, two or three differences. To make sure that participants would be able to find the differences between the images in a reasonable amount of time, we ran a pilot study on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (N = 205) to test the difficulty to spot the differences between the images and to determine the optimal duration of picture presentation (see Appendix 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>To explore the effects of acute stress on (dis)honest behavior, a mixed pretest-posttest design was implemented, in which participants made (dis)honest decisions in the two blocks of the SPOT: one block before the MAST or the associated control condition and one block after. The effect of acute stress induced by psychosocial stress paradigms was estimated to last around 15 minutes <ref type="bibr">(Kudielka et al., 2007)</ref> with elevated cortisol levels for the MAST still detectable 40 minutes after beginning of the MAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Smeets et al., 2012)</ref>. Each block of the SPOT had a duration of approximately 30 minutes on average, so performance in the second block fell well within the window of expected elevated stress levels. Participants first completed the first block of the SPOT (15 min for one block; 72 trials). Subsequently, participants were randomly assigned to complete either the MAST or the control condition (15 min). Finally, participants finished the second block of the SPOT (15 min). This design allowed us to compare the effect of stress on (dis)honest decisions. At the end of the experiment participants completed a short questionnaire testing whether participants were suspicious about the real purpose of the task (5 min).</p></div>

Specifically, the extent to which participants cheated during the first block of the SPOT ( ℎ ! ) is expected to impact cheating behavior in the second block of the SPOT. ℎ ! is a standardized measure (i.e., z-score) of the percent of cheating in trials of interest during the first block of the SPOT. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>There was substantial variability in how much participants cheated in the first block of the SPOT.</p><p>The most honest participant did not cheat in any of the trials, while the most dishonest participant cheated in all trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3)</ref>. Obviously, the extent to which participants can behave even more strongly in line with their moral default due to acute stress is limited by their behavior during the first block of the task. For example, the participant who was always honest at t = 1 cannot become even more honest (floor effect) as a result of the stress treatment, while the participant who cheated in all of the tasks cannot cheat even more (ceiling effect). To eliminate ceiling and floor effects, we performed the analysis on a subsample of participants (n = 97) who have a standardized cheating measure between the 10th and 90th percentiles. Importantly, no statistically significant difference was found between the control and stress groups in the percent of trials participants cheated during the first block of the SPOT (F(1, 95) = .74, p-value = .39). As a robustness check, we show that obtained model estimation results for the subsample are very similar to those obtained with the full sample (see Appendix 3). We analyzed the effect of acute stress on cheating behavior by using a logistic regression model estimated on behavior in the second block on the SPOT. The probability that a participant cheats during the second block of the SPOT is influenced by: (1) their moral default (as reflected in the extent to which the participant cheated during the first block of the SPOT), (2) stress (indicating if the participant was assigned to the experimental condition of the MAST), and the interaction between (1) and (2). We found that cheating in the first block of the SPOT (t = 1) has a positive effect on the probability of cheating in the second block (t = 2) (estimated mean equal to 1.25, 95% credible interval (CI) of [1.10; 1.40], and p-value &lt; .001). This shows that the level of cheating 16 between the two blocks is strongly correlated, with participants who cheated more at t = 1 being also more likely to cheat at t = 2. In addition, the results showed a statistically significant effect of stress on the probability of cheating at t=2 (estimated mean equal to .25, 95% CI = [.09; .40], and p-value = .001). Most importantly, we found support for an interaction effect between stress and moral default (estimated mean equal to .55, 95% CI = [.60; .80], and p-value &lt; .001). To show the combined effect, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> presents the estimated probability of cheating in the second block of the SPOT (t = 2) for participants in the control and stress group for varying levels of cheating during the first block (t=1). The results show that participants in the stress group who cheat more than the average in the first block (standardized cheating at t=1 &gt; 0) have a higher probability of cheating at t=2 compared with similar participants in the control group. Conversely, very honest participants tend to become more honest after stress, although this effect is less pronounced. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study we investigated the effect of acute stress on (dis)honesty. We found that effects of stress on dishonesty are not uniform, but that they depend on the individual's moral default: for those who are relatively dishonest, stress increases dishonesty, whereas for participants who are relatively honest, stress does not increase dishonesty, perhaps even making them slightly more honest.</p><p>To assess participants' default inclination to cheat (i.e., their tendency to cheat in the absence of stress) participants completed a first block of the SPOT, a task designed to measure trial-by-trial cheating inconspicuously. Participants were then exposed to the MAST (or its control condition)</p><p>to induce acute physical and social stress. Comparing participants' behavior in the second block of the SPOT to that of the first block made it possible to assess the effects (main effect and interaction) of an individual's moral default and acute stress on cheating.</p><p>We found that for most participants stress increased dishonesty. Most importantly, however, when taking into account individual differences in tendency to cheat (as reflected by cheating in the first block of the SPOT), a significant interaction effect was observed. Whereas stress made dishonest participants even more dishonest, this was not the case for more honest participants who may even became slightly more honest under acute stress. Thus, the results support our hypothesis that acute stress enhances participants' default tendency for (dis)honesty, i.e,, their moral default (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Speer et al., 2022b)</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, the SIDI model <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Yu, 2016)</ref> proposes that acute stress influences decisions by impairing cognitive control and promoting intuitive response tendencies.</p><p>Neuroimaging research on dishonesty has shown that people differ in their moral defaults and that people require cognitive control to override this default: individuals who are by default honest need willpower, in the form of cognitive control, to cheat, whereas cheaters need cognitive control to be honest <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Speer et al., 2022b)</ref>. This line of research has shown that a network of brain regions associated with cognitive control is more strongly activated when honest people cheat, whereas for cheaters the same network is more engaged when they decide to be honest <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Speer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Speer et al., 2020)</ref>. It follows that if cognitive control is impaired by acute stress this should impact dishonesty differently for different people. Taken together, our current findings, the literature on the impact of stress on control, and the neuroimaging literature on dishonesty suggest that acute stress impairs cognitive control and would thus leave individuals less able to override their moral default. As a result, lacking sufficient cognitive control resources under stress, participants with an honest default consequently rely more on their intuition to be honest, while cheaters under stress will be more likely to succumb to their default dishonest tendencies.</p><p>The moderating role of moral default on the effect stress on (dis)honesty may help reconcile the mixed results in the literature. As mentioned in the introduction, a recent review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Faber and Häusser (2022)</ref> reported that results from studies investigating the effect of stress on moral decision-making ranged from increased prosocial behavior, to no behavioral differences and mixed effects contingent on moderators, all the way to increased prosocial decisions. These inconsistencies across studies may be at least partially driven by differences in the average moral default of participants across studies. Accounting for individual differences in moral default may help resolve the controversy on the effect of stress on (dis)honesty.</p><p>Because some participants cheated (nearly) all the time and some participants (almost) never cheated, ceiling and floor effects were to be expected. Specifically, if a participant cheated very often in the first half of the study there was hardly any possibility for stress to further increase cheating in the second half. Similarly, for an extremely honest participant who does not cheat at all in the first half of the experiment there is no room to become more honest. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of stress and moral default after removing the 10% most extreme participants from the sample. Importantly, we also included a sensitivity check in which all participants were included, even those whose behavior can't be further changed, and also analyses in which we removed the top and bottom 5% and 15% of participants (see Appendix 3). These analyses revealed that the interaction effect remains significant even with all participants included or with different exclusion criteria. However, whereas the main analysis (excluding the most extreme 10% participants) showed a large stress-induced increase in cheating for cheaters and a smaller decrease in cheating for honest participants, including all participants mainly revealed an effect of stress on cheaters (i.e., increasing cheating). Thus, when allowing stress to have more impact on behavior (by removing those who can't be influenced), we observed that stress indeed potentiates participants' default (dis)honesty on both ends of the moral default distribution.</p><p>Nevertheless, the effect of stress on dishonesty seems most pronounced for those with a relatively dishonest moral default.</p><p>The insights gained from this study have important implications for managers and policy makers as our results demonstrate that stress tends to generally increase dishonesty, but particularly for those with a strong natural tendency to cheat. However, our findings also reveal that the effects of stress on dishonesty are not uniform: for relatively honest individuals stress does not increase dishonesty and may actually make the most honest individuals even more honest. It is thus advisable to avoid exposing dishonest individuals to stress when there are opportunities to cheat, 20 whereas it may be advisable to let honest participants make decisions when conditions are stressful and offer opportunities for dishonesty.</p><p>It should be noted that participants who were more likely to cheat or be honest under stress in this specific experimental paradigm may not show the same behavior under acute stress in a different paradigm designed to elicit (dis)honesty. Nevertheless, previous research has shown that cheating on the SPOT task is associated with stable neural patterns in the brain as well as well-established personality measures associated with impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Speer et al., 2022a)</ref>, which suggests that the individual differences in cheating observed in our paradigm may indeed reflect stable variations in moral default. More research is needed, however, to evaluate the generalizability of the role of the moral default on the effect of stress on (dis)honesty in other experimental paradigms and contexts.</p><p>To conclude, our findings show that the effect of acute stress on dishonesty are not uniform but are contingent on an individual's moral default. While stress increased cheating for the dishonestly inclined, more honest participants did not cheat more under stress and may even become slightly more honest. These findings go a long way in resolving the conflicting findings in the literature on the effects of stress on prosocial behavior, with some studies reporting an increase and others a decrease in prosociality. The current findings suggest that stress affects prosocial behavior differently for different people, depending on their moral default.

Specifically, participants were told that the experiment would start with a simple visual task and then proceed to visual searches in more complex visual stimuli in the second task. In this first task, the goal was to determine whether a specific target was present or absent. In each trial participants were presented with colored letters presented in random locations on the screen. If the target was present, then participants had to press the left mouse button as quickly as possible. If no target was present, then they had to press the right mouse button as quickly as possible. For this task, participants had to search for a green T. Participants</p><p>were instructed to answer as quickly as possible while still being as accurate as possible. The task took approximately 5 minutes and was not analyzed as it was included solely for the purpose of increasing the credibility of our cover story.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix 2: Validation of the picture set</head><p>Stimuli for the task consisted of 144 Spot-The-Difference image pairs that were downloaded from the Internet. Cartoon images of landscapes containing several objects were selected, to make them engaging and challenging enough for the participants. Landscapes were chosen as they generally satisfied the necessary criteria of containing several different objects, which made the task of spotting differences more challenging and engaging. The stimuli consist of pairs of images that are identical apart from a certain number (1-3) of differences that were created by the experimenter using Adobe Photoshop. Differences consisted of objects added to or removed from the landscape picture or changed colors of objects.</p><p>To make sure that participants would be able to find the differences between the images in a reasonable amount of time, we ran a pilot study on Amazon's Mechanical Turk with 205 subjects using 180 pictures to test the difficulty to spot the differences between the images and to determine the optimal duration of picture presentation.

We systematically check how sensitive the results are to different exclusion criteria. This appendix reports four additional sets of results based on: the full sample (n = 120), a subsample of n = 108 participants that excludes the top 5% and the bottom 5% participants based on the standardized measure of cheating in the first block of the SPOT, a subsample of n = 86 participants that excludes the top 15% and bottom 15% participants, and a subsample of n = 114 participants that excludes the six participants who withdrew their hand at least once during the hand immersion task. The results are very similar to those reported in the paper, which shows that there is very little, if any, sensitivity to different ways of determining very honest (bottom %) and very dishonest (top %) participants, and to compliance during the hand immersion task.</p><p>Results with the full sample (n = 120) Cheating in the first block of the Spot-The-Differences task has a positive effect on the probability of cheating in the second block (estimated mean = 1.35, 95% CI = [1.22; 1.49], p-value &lt; .001).</p><p>The results show a statistically significant effect of the Stress treatment on the probability of cheating (estimated mean = .20, 95% CI = [.04; .35], p-value = .01).
