			<abstract>
				<p>Food seeking and avoidance are powerful drivers of behavior in healthy and clinical populations. The urge to eat engages primary reward systems in the brain, thought to bias preference for energydense or high-calorie food more likely to sate hunger. Yet, this notion doesn&apos;t hold for individuals struggling with symptoms of eating disorders where high-calorie food is avoided. To date, it is unclear how innate or learned food biases may interact with general reward processing to guide learning and decision-making. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate whether and how biases for high-and low-calorie food alter reward learning and decision-making in a large sample of participants (pilot N = 227, main-study N = 279) with typical or disordered eating behavior. Importantly, food characteristics (high-versus low-calorie) were completely incidental to the task goal of maximizing monetary reward. Using an emotional arousal manipulation involving a monetary win or loss, we also examined whether heightened arousal, thought to influence goaldirected behavior, enhances the impact of food biases on reward learning. Consistent with prior notions of food-relevant biases, we found and replicated that the typical eating group learned better (i.e., chose the more probabilistically rewarding category) when high-calorie foods were more rewarding, while the disordered eating group learned better when low-calorie foods were more rewarding. The arousal manipulation enhanced this group-dependent bias. Fitting behavior to reinforcement learning models enabled us to identify distinct cognitive components underlying the effect of food biases on learning and decision-making: Typical and disordered eaters showed differences in their pre-experimental preference for a food type (high-or low-calorie food, respectively) and the extent to which they learned from positive outcomes associated with that preference. These findings provide a mechanistic account of how food biases alter reward-based choice, especially under heightened arousal. Our results suggest that interventions altering innate or learned food preferences could target habit-directed mechanisms to help mitigate maladaptive eating behavior.</p>

The high prevalence of disordered eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Silén &amp; Keski-Rahkonen, 2022)</ref>, characterized by patterns of restricted eating or loss of control overeating, has triggered substantial medical attention, including a focus on psychotherapeutic, pharmaceutical and neuromodulatory interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Monteleone et al., 2022)</ref>, associated with high social and economic costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Streatfeild et al., 2021</ref>).

Moreover, underconsumption or restricted eating may engage similar neural circuits to generate opposite behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(O'Hara et al., 2015)</ref>. Of special interest are models of anorexia nervosa, as patients can develop the motivation to forgo food altogether, against all biological instincts.

We characterized decision-making in two populations with putatively distinct food biases: those with active symptoms and a history of an eating disorder (i.e., disordered eaters, 'DE') and those without any symptoms or history of eating disorder (i.e., typical eaters, 'TE').</p><p>Past research has demonstrated that disordered eaters, like anorectic patients -across 'restricting' and 'binge/purge' subtypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Uniacke et al., 2020)</ref> -make decisions based on health rather than tastiness, opting for fewer high-fat options <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Foerde et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Foerde et al., , 2015</ref>. Moreover, individuals struggling with anorexia nervosa show a bias for low-calorie foods in both implicit "wanting" (even after weight restoration; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cowdrey et al., 2013)</ref> and instrumental responding, which correlates with disease severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Vogel et al., 2020)</ref>. We therefore screened 4,000 participants online and recruited a DE group of participants with a self-reported history of anorexia nervosa (restricting or binge/purge subtype) and/or bulimia nervosa. All participants in the DE group exhibited active eating disorder symptoms that are considered severe (as determined by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, 'EDE-Q', .</p><p>We also recruited the TE group from this large sample, including participants with no history of any eating disorder. Both groups (TE, DE) were matched on age, sex at assigned birth, education, and non-eating-related psychiatric disorder (see Supplementary Information, 'SI' <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref> for sample characteristics).</p><p>To test whether food biases influence reward learning and decision-making, we designed a novel reward learning paradigm ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). Here, participants learned the values of two categories from trial and error, with the objective of choosing the more (probabilistically) rewarding category to maximize monetary earnings. The categories were either food-related ('raw' versus 'cooked/baked' food, serving as a cover for low-versus high-calorie food, respectively) or unrelated to food (control condition: indoor versus outdoor scenes). We predicted that overall task performance would be similar between groups. We nevertheless expected a food-specific learning bias, such that the TE group would learn better from highcalorie food, while the DE group would show the opposite bias, learning better from low-calorie food. Notably, we predicted these group-specific biases even though the calorie content of the food stimuli was irrelevant to the goal of maximizing rewards in the task. We further compared a series of reinforcement-learning models to determine the computational mechanism supporting group-dependent food biases in reward learning and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baribault &amp; Collins, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Collins &amp; Shenhav, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, emotional arousal and stress can also influence and even predict the trajectory of maladaptive eating habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Connan et al., 2003)</ref>.

To examine the modulating role of emotional arousal, we included an arousal manipulation halfway through the reward learning task: participants won or lost $8 by 'spinning' a wheel of fortune, either experiencing heightened positive emotion (win) or negative emotion (loss) after the spin ) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>). We expected that heightened arousal, regardless of positive or negative valence, may enhance the salience of food stimuli and inhibit goal-relevant mechanisms, further enabling habit-related food biases in learning and decision-making.</p><p>To investigate food biases in TE and DE participants, we conducted a behavioral pilot study (N = 227) using our novel paradigm (SI 3). We then preregistered the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rouhani et al., 2022)</ref> to replicate our initial results (N = 279) and further evaluate the impact of an arousal manipulation on decision-making in TE and DE groups. . Experimental study design. (A) An example of a sequence of trials and (B) the overall structure of the reward-learning task. Participants learned through trial and error which of two categories was more rewarding in each of 4 blocks (outcomes were $10 or $0); reward contingencies were probabilistic (75/25 reward probability); half the blocks included food stimuli ('food block', categories: raw and cooked/baked food, which served as a cover for lowand high-calorie food, respectively) or scene stimuli ('control block', categories: indoor and outdoor scenes). After completing one block of each type, participants experienced an arousal manipulation in which they 'spun' a computerized wheel of fortune (predetermined outcomes of winning or losing $8). They next completed two more learning blocks of each type (order of blocks counterbalanced across participants). Participants completed self-ratings </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Similar overall learning between groups and tasks. As our measure of learning and task performance, we considered 'correct' responses as the choice for the more rewarding category (regardless of whether the outcome was probabilistically rewarded or not on that trial). As expected, the TE and DE groups were matched in their learning performance (mixed-effects logistic regression: Β = 0.06, z = 0.84, p = 0.40; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2A</ref>-B) and did not differ in their ability to learn from the food versus the control (scene) categories (interaction between group and block category: Β = -0.04, z = -0.68, p = 0.50, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2A</ref>). Matched learning performance between groups suggests that any differences in how food preferences influence reward-based choice (see below for analysis of the food blocks) are unlikely due to overall differences in learning ability. performance. (C) First learning block (pre-arousal manipulation): average proportion of correct choices in the food blocks of the reward learning task when the underlying reward category was either high-calorie food stimuli ('cooked/baked' food category) or low-calorie food stimuli ('raw' food category). (D) The increase in self-reported alertness ratings (i.e., 'pre' and 'post' arousal) served as a manipulation check that the wheel of fortune generated an increase in arousal. (E) Second learning block (post-arousal manipulation): the arousal manipulation boosted the group-specific food bias in reward learning, such that TE eaters (gray) learned better when the underlying reward category was represented by high-calorie food stimuli, while the opposite was true for DE eaters (orange) who learned better when low-calorie food stimuli were more rewarding. A reinforcement learning model that included groupspecific food biases for the initial values (pre-existing preferences for the food categories) and positive learning rates of the reward categories reproduced the pattern of behavioral results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Typical eaters (TE) learned better from high-calorie food; disordered eaters (DE) learned</head><p>better from low-calorie food. While both groups learned equally well on average, we identified group-specific differences for food categories in the expected direction: participants in the TE group learned better when high-(versus low-) calorie foods were more rewarding, and vice versa for the DE group (interaction between group and food-calorie category: Β = -0.23, z = -3.63, p &lt; 0.001). This pattern of results replicated our pre-registered pilot results (Β = -0.33, z = -3.71, p &lt; 0.001), which did not include an arousal manipulation; for comparison to the pilot study, see SI 3</p><p>and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref>). This replicated finding confirms group differences in how high-and low-calorie food influence learning to pursue rewards, even if the rewards are unrelated to dietary choice.</p><p>Positive and negative emotional arousal enhanced group-specific biases. The arousal manipulation increased alertness across groups (Β = 0.26, t = 4.53, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2D</ref>), with no difference in this increase between groups (Β = -0.02, t = -0.17, p = 0.87). While we did not find the arousal manipulation to influence overall learning performance (Β = 0.02, z = 0.52, p = 0.60), we did find it to boost the overall group-specific bias in reward learning (three-way interaction between group, food category, and block number (indicating pre-and post-arousal): Β = -0.45, z = -3.47, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2C</ref>-E).</p><p>Consistent with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015;</ref>, we found a win on the wheel of fortune to increase happiness ratings (Β = 0.91, t = 12.20, p &lt; 0.001), while a loss decreased happiness ratings (Β = -1.21, t = 14.73, p &lt; 0.001), with no difference in these changes between groups (Β = 0.08, t = 0.53, p = 0.60). Interestingly, we did not find the valence of the wheel of fortune's outcome ($8 win or $8 loss) to have a significant effect on learning performance (Β = 0.49, z = 1.32, p = 0.19), pointing to a general (rather than a valence-specific) effect of heightened emotional arousal in enhancing food-related biases.</p><p>Food biases were captured by group differences in initial values and positive learning rates in reinforcement-learning models. To identify the precise cognitive mechanism underlying food-related biases in reward learning, we fit hierarchical reinforcement-learning models to choice data (see Methods for model specifications). We used standard Rescorla-Wagner Qlearning <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972</ref>) as our baseline model. Within this reinforcement learning framework, we examined four cognitive components that could support group biases in decisionmaking: (1) sensitivity to reward receipt, meaning the extent to which the reward outcome is valued (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Huys et al., 2013)</ref>, (2) distinct learning rates for positive versus negative prediction errors, referring to the extent to which positive versus negative outcomes asymmetrically update values (e.g., M. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Frank et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Niv et al., 2012)</ref>, (3) persistence in choosing the same category that was previously chosen (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Eckstein et al., 2022)</ref>, and (4) initial values for each reward category, reflecting pre-experimental and potentially Pavlovian biases for low-and highcalorie food <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Vogel et al., 2020)</ref>. For each parameter, participant and population-level posterior distributions were estimated simultaneously via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carpenter et al., 2017)</ref>. WAIC scores (Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion; Watanabe, 2010) that penalize for model complexity were used to compare alternative models (see Methods for complete model fitting/comparison procedures and results). We further evaluated the best-fitting model through posterior predictive checks ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) and parameter recovery (S1 4, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S3</ref>).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for parameter values): 'M0': base model, standard Rescorla-Wagner Q-learning model; 'M1': base model adding a reward-sensitivity parameter; 'M2': base model adding different learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors; 'M4': base model adding a choice persistence parameter for a particular category; 'M4': base model with fit initial preexperimental values for each food category; 'M2 + M4': model that includes the asymmetric learning rate (M2) and initial value (M4) components; 'group-difference + M2 + M4': best-fitting model that includes group-difference parameters (DE versus TE) in the positive learning rate (M2) and in the initial values (4M) of the food categories (fit for each learning block). (B-D) Group-difference parameter distributions for the best-fitting model (y-axis indicates density); typical eaters ('TE') versus disordered eaters ('DE'). Parameters were considered significant if their 95% confidence interval did not span 0 (dotted line). In the first learning block (pre-arousal, top row), (B) DE had higher initial values for low-(versus high-) calorie food stimuli and (C-D) higher positive learning rates across food categories (low and high calorie). However, in the second learning block (after the arousal manipulation, bottom row), group differences in (E) initial values for the food categories and (F) positive learning rate for low-calorie stimuli no longer passed significance. Nevertheless, post arousal, (G) DE's positive learning rates for high-calorie food shifted to be lower than that estimated for TE; this change was specific to high-calorie foods (not low-calorie foods). The arousal-induced changes in positive learning rates account for the behavioral pattern of food biases observed during the second task block.</p><p>We first compared hierarchical models that successively included all possible combinations of each of the tested four components (see M1 to M4 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A</ref>  demonstrating single-component model fits). We found that a model that fit (M2) distinct ('asymmetric') learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors ('positive and negative learning rates') and (M4) initial category values provided the best fit overall. We next added group-level difference parameters (DE versus TE) on the initial values and learning rates. If there were no differences between groups on these parameters, then the estimated group difference would be near 0, and the model would fit worse. We instead found that including group-level difference parameters for each learning block (pre-and post-arousal) and each food category (low-versus high-calorie) in the initial category values and for positive (but not negative) learning rates, better fit behavior ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A)</ref>. Importantly, this model captured the observed patterns of learning behavior (diamond points in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>, C, and E) and its parameters were recoverable (SI 4). We next focused on which of these parameter distributions reflected significant differences between groups (where the 95% confidence interval does not span 0;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Figure 3B-G).</formula><p>During the first learning block (pre-arousal), the DE group had higher initial values for the low-(versus high-) calorie food category ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3B</ref>). This points to a pre-experimental preference in the DE group for low-calorie food or an aversion towards high-calorie food, relative to the TE group. DE participants also demonstrated higher ('positive') learning rates for positive prediction errors in general (irrespective of whether the high-or low-calorie food categories were rewarding; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3C</ref>-D). This indicates greater DE sensitivity (updating values more) for outcomes associated with positive prediction errors than the TE group. To note, these group differences in the first block led to similar overall behavior across groups ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2C</ref>), suggesting that interactions between initial values and learning rates produced behavioral patterns that obfuscate group differences in the reward learning task (although these group differences were immediately apparent in the pilot sample, SI 3).</p><p>Interestingly, during the second learning block (post-arousal), group-specific food biases more clearly emerged in participant behavior in the reward learning task. In the model, this pattern was supported by a striking change in DE's positive learning rate for high-calorie food (but not low-calorie foods) after the arousal manipulation, which was significantly lower in the DE group compared to the TE group ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3G</ref>). In other words, individuals in the DE group were less sensitive to positive outcomes associated with high-calorie food items, compared to the TE group. This relative group shift in the positive learning rate for high-calorie stimuli enabled the model to capture post-arousal food biases on reward-based decision-making wherein the DE group learned better from low-versus high-calorie food, and vice-versa for the TE group ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure    2E</ref>). Furthermore, group differences in the initial values and positive learning rate for low-calorie stimuli were no longer significant ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 3E-F</ref>), suggesting that the change in positive learning rates for high-calorie food was selectively sensitive to arousal levels.</p><p>Individual differences in disordered eaters. Given the potential heterogeneity of symptoms and behaviors within our non-clinical DE sample, we evaluated individual differences in our results in an exploratory analysis (see Statistical approach in Methods). While we did not find any of the tested variables to exert independent effects on learning performance, individual differences in binge-eating behavior and psychotropic medication use interacted with arousal effects to predict food-related learning bias.</p><p>Specifically, we found that greater binge-eating behavior in DE participants (reported in the last 6 months; EAT-26 questionnaire: , predicted less of a post-arousal change in learning bias (Β = -0.25, z = -3.40, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4A</ref>). In other words, binge-eating behavior was associated with relatively less learning from low-calorie stimuli and more learning from high-calorie stimuli compared to DE participants who did not report binge eating. This finding indicates that the observed learning bias for low-versus high-calorie stimuli may be driven by symptoms and behaviors of anorexia and/or bulimia other than binge eating. Bingeeating disorder can moreover underlie the rapid consumption of high-calorie food <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Davis et al., 2020</ref>). While we did not explicitly recruit participants with binge-eating disorder, comorbid symptoms in our study suggest different reward associations than that for anorexia and bulimia, potentially including less avoidance of high-calorie food.</p><p>On the other hand, DE participants on psychotropic medication (versus those without medication) showed a stronger post-arousal change in the bias to learn from low-versus highcalorie stimuli after arousal (Β = 0.52, z = 2.79, p = 0.005; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4B</ref>). We did not find a similar interaction between TE participants on or without psychotropic medication (Β = -0.46, z = -1.04, p = 0.30). Given that 30-40% of each group included participants reporting psychotropic medication <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>), the greater change in learning bias for medicated DE participants (but not TEs) may reflect a stronger influence of the arousal manipulation in accentuating associations generated by eating disorder rather than the effects of psychotropic medication alone. reported binge-eating behavior in the last 6 months, relative to those who did not report any binge-eating episodes, showed a smaller post-arousal shift in the DE bias to learn from rewarding low-versus high-calorie stimuli. (B) DE participants on psychotropic medication showed a stronger post-arousal shift in the DE bias to learn from rewarding low-versus high-calories stimuli than participants without medication. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.</p><p>Eating disorder predicts health ratings and calorie accuracy. Lastly, we tested how the two groups differed in their explicit evaluations of high-and low-calorie food. Not surprisingly, participants in the DE group rated high-calorie food as less healthy and low-calorie food as healthier than TE (interaction between group and food category: Β = -0.27, t = -3.34, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Moreover, we found that individuals in the DE group were less likely to underestimate the number of calories in high-calorie food (interaction between group and food category: Β = 116.27, t = 3.46, p &lt; 0.001).

In this study, we investigated how innate or learned biases for food modulate general reward learning and decision-making mechanisms in typical ('TE') and disordered ('DE') eaters.</p><p>Given the impact of arousal on dietary behaviors and goal-directed actions, we also included an arousal manipulation where participants either won or lost a spin on a wheel of fortune. While participants in the TE and DE groups performed equally well in the reward-learning task, we identified and replicated an important food-related learning bias: the TE group learned better when the underlying reward category was represented by high-(versus low-) calorie food stimuli, while the DE group exhibited the opposite bias, learning better when low-(versus high-)</p><p>calorie food stimuli were more rewarding. An arousal manipulation amplified these groupspecific food biases regardless of valence (win or loss). Computational modeling of choice behavior emphasized the role of pre-experimental (innate or learned) food values and changes in learning rate for positive prediction errors in driving observed food biases on reward learning.</p><p>Eating behavior holds special reigns in recruiting goal-directed and habit-learning systems as a primary reinforcer. Maladaptive eating patterns, across restricted and unrestricted eaters, have been associated with the greater use of habit-learning mechanisms in behavior and in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Foerde et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Foerde et al., , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Koban et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xue et al., 2022</ref>). In the current paradigm, the task goal was to select the category associated with higher probabilistic reward.</p><p>Images of high-and low-calorie food stimuli tested whether food preferences would elicit habitlike biases on behavior that may compete with goal-directed choice. Across our pilot decisionmaking task (no arousal manipulation) and current study (with arousal manipulation), we found evidence of such food biases on reward learning. Consistent with work demonstrating attentional and motivational preference for high-calorie food <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cunningham &amp; Egeth, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Guleken &amp;</ref> Uzbay, 2022) -a putative marker of adaptive evolution -typical eaters learned better when high-(versus low-) calorie stimuli generated more reward. On the other hand, disordered eaters, having learned to associate high-calorie food with punishment and low-calorie food with reward, learned better when low-(versus high-) calorie stimuli were more rewarding. In other words, the congruence of habit-like preferences with goal-directed action predicted learning performance across groups.</p><p>In the current paradigm, group-level food biases only fully emerged after the arousal manipulation; however, computational models of reinforcement learning point to which cognitive components differed between groups even before arousal. Capturing dynamics of trialby-trial behavior enables a more fine-grained and mechanistic interpretation of what, if anything, is driving different group behaviors, an approach fueling the burgeoning field of computational psychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Haynos et al., 2022)</ref>. Of the tested components, we found that a reinforcement-learning model that included participant-specific initial values and distinct learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors ('positive and negative learning rates') best explained choice data overall. This finding indicates that decision-making is guided by individual variability in pre-task values for reward categories as well as the extent to which those values are updated after experiencing a reward outcome. These participant-level learning rates further explain behavior when fit separately for outcomes that are better (positive reward prediction error) and worse (negative reward prediction error) than expected.</p><p>Moreover, the model better accounted for observed behaviors when considering group differences in initial values and positive learning rates for the two reward categories (low-calorie stimuli ('raw') category versus high-calorie stimuli ('cooked') category). Notably, these group differences captured the pattern of observed food biases on learning performance (pre-and postarousal). During the first learning block (pre-arousal), the initial values for low-calorie stimuli were higher for DEs than TEs, revealing that DE participants exhibited pre-experimental, potentially Pavlovian-like, preference for low-calorie food and/or avoidance of high-calorie food <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Vogel et al., 2020)</ref>. DEs also exhibited higher positive learning rates across food categories, demonstrating greater value updating or sensitivity to outcomes that were better than expected, compared to TEs. This finding may be consistent with evidence from neuroimaging studies showing elevated prediction-error signaling in anorexia nervosa (G. K. W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Frank et al., 2018)</ref>, as a stronger prediction-error response would drive value updating in the same way as a higher learning rate. Despite these model-estimated differences in initial values and positive learning rates in the pre-arousal block, there were no overall group differences in raw or model-generated behavior, pointing to how group differences in trial-by-trial dynamics can be masked by averaged data (to note, average group biases were immediately apparent in the pilot task, SI 3).</p><p>After the arousal manipulation, there was a specific and marked group shift in the strength of positive learning rates for high-calorie stimuli. Here, DEs, compared to TEs, updated their values less for high-calorie, but not low-calorie, stimuli after experiencing outcomes that were better than expected. In other words, the arousal manipulation strengthened food biases by shifting learning away from positive outcomes associated with high-calorie stimuli in DEs, relative to TEs. This finding suggests greater avoidance of high-calorie stimuli, putatively strengthened by arousal, in our DE sample.</p><p>Given the strong negative associations with high-calorie food in anorexia and bulimia nervosa, we further investigated whether specific eating disorder behaviors may predict this avoidance. In an exploratory analysis, we examined the influence of restraint, binge, and purge behaviors in the last 6 months. Binge-eating predicted relatively less avoidance of high-calorie stimuli post-arousal, which may indeed be a distinguishing factor of binge-eating disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Davis et al., 2020)</ref> where food is rapidly consumed in large quantities versus anorexia and bulimia nervosa, where food is often abstained from or purged. Future investigations could examine how arousal, including physiological measures of arousal, and food biases may interact to predict actual eating behavior in disorders characterized by restrictive versus binge-type eating. On the flip side, we found that psychotropic medication use was associated with stronger post-arousal change to the DE-learning bias. Our TE group, which was matched with DE to include a similar proportion of participants on psychotropic medication, did not show such effects. While speculative, this exploratory result raises the interesting possibility that eating disorder (with more severe cases perhaps necessitating medication), rather than comorbid psychiatric disorder or the effects of medication itself, may interact with arousal effects to strengthen the observed DE-learning bias.</p><p>Although heightened arousal can sometimes help or hurt goal-directed performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yerkes &amp; Dodson, 1908)</ref>, we did not find arousal to influence learning performance overall.</p><p>Instead, the arousal manipulation brought out more habit-like behavior in both groups (DE, TE), advantaging learning for stimuli consistent with pre-experimental reinforcement. Notably, the extent to which specific eating disorders exhibit 'implicit' biases for high-or low-calorie food has been mixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Paslakis et al., 2021)</ref>. While in our pilot task we found food biases without an arousal manipulation, our results suggest that heightened arousal draws out these biases more reliably. We further did not find the valence of the arousal manipulation (win or loss) to modulate choice behavior, suggesting global arousal effects. Nevertheless, more extreme experiences of negative arousal, in the form of stress, for example, can uniquely drive long-term maladaptive eating behaviors like starvation or binge-eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Connan et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Evers et al., 2018)</ref>. Future work could examine how different magnitudes and durations of negative versus positive arousal may prompt distinct decision-making biases in typical and disordered eaters.</p><p>While our investigation provides novel insights into how biases for high-and low-calorie food alter reward learning and decision-making, it has limitations. One limitation of the current study is that our disordered eating population was not clinically evaluated, precluding the characterization of specific disorder as well as the stage of disease or recovery. The DE samples in our pilot and present study were selected based on high EDE-Q scores (minimum of 3 on the EDE-Q global score), indicating severe eating disorder symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Velkoff et al., 2023)</ref>. Our study sample was further characterized by self-reported history of anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia nervosa (113 out of 138 participants reported a history of anorexia nervosa).</p><p>Nevertheless, our DE group represented a range of specific eating disorder symptoms and behaviors, which we characterized (SI 1) and tested in an exploratory analysis. While these individual differences in our DE sample did not undermine our group results, a larger study recruiting clinically well-characterized participants for particular eating disorder behaviors may reveal relevant distinctions in food biases (such as for binge-eating disorder). Additionally, our online DE samples self-reported relatively high weight status (as assessed by body mass index, BMI), which is unusual for even weight-restored anorectic patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Redgrave et al., 2015)</ref>. Selfreported BMI may not correspond to actual BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gosse, 2014)</ref>. Future studies should replicate our key findings in samples that are clinically characterized and where BMI, body composition, and food consumption can be more directly assessed (controlling for self-report biases).</p><p>That being said, it is worth stressing that we replicated an overall food bias in our DE sample across two independent studies, in line with our preregistered hypotheses (for information regarding the pilot study, see SI 3). This bias is consistent with learned associations of low-calorie food with reward and high-calorie food with lesser reward or punishment in disordered eaters. Notably, both studies varied regarding numerous factors (e.g., recruitment from different online platforms, male/female participation, arousal manipulation, etc.; SI 3), demonstrating the robustness of the effect. Moreover, the results held when we controlled for and separately evaluated individual differences in self-reported eating disorder (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or both), BMI, diagnostic history, psychotropic medication as well as specific eating disorder symptoms and behaviors.</p><p>The present findings, which include evidence of group-specific biases along with computational modeling of choice behavior, may moreover offer specific targets for novel treatments. Previous interventions include goal-directed strategies, which can alter food decisions by regulating focus; for example, attending to the 'health' or 'tastiness' of food can shift choice in the goal-consistent direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hutcherson &amp; Tusche, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tusche &amp; Hutcherson, 2018)</ref>, while focusing on the 'positive' or 'negative' outcomes of consuming food can increase or decrease food craving, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sun &amp; Kober, 2020)</ref>. Whether these goal-directed strategies are effective for those with eating disorders is unclear. Our results instead indicate the potential utility of interventions that target pre-experimental habits, which, although less flexible to change, may support long-term behavior modification. Improved decision-making in anorexia nervosa is indeed related to reduced use of habit-related regions in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Foerde et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, for DEs, learning to associate reward with high-calorie food, either explicitly or incidentally (e.g., the current learning paradigm), may help ease restrictive behaviors. Our results further suggest that an arousal manipulation could help induce these biases, at which point training DEs to learn from and be more sensitive to rewarding outcomes linked to high-calorie food may help reverse maladaptive associations. Strategies can additionally be used to reduce the anxiety associated with high-calorie food, such as exposure therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Steinglass et al., 2014)</ref>, which may better allow for reward associations with high-calorie food to be formed. Rewardbased interventions for anorexia nervosa have in fact been proposed and represent an exciting avenue for current and future endeavors in supporting individuals struggling with atypical dietary behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Haynos et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Altogether, we demonstrate how food preferences and arousal may interfere with goaldirected action in typical and disordered eating, highlighting potential cognitive targets for treating maladaptive eating behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Participants. The study protocol was approved by Caltech's Institutional Review Board (IR20-1051), and all participants provided informed consent prior to beginning. To recruit our typical (TE) and disordered eating (DE) groups, we administered a screener to 4,000 participants on the online platform Prolific (half female (2,000), 18-40 years old). The screener included the EDE Questionnaire (EDE-Q; , which asked participants to rate the frequency of eating disorder symptoms and behaviors from 0 ('No days') to 6 ('Every day') as well as selfreports of eating-related and non-eating-related psychiatric disorders. Consistent with the selection method outlined in our preregistration <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rouhani et al., 2022)</ref>, for our DE group, we invited participants who scored at least 3 -above the clinical cutoff of 2.8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Velkoff et al., 2023)</ref> on the global measure of the EDE-Q -and who self-reported a current or past history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. For our TE group, we invited participants who scored less than 1.5 on the EDE-Q and did not report a current or a past history of any eating disorder. Additionally, all participants must have correctly answered all attention checks, which were items randomly inserted within four questionnaires, asking participants to press a particular response <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zorowitz et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the above criteria, we invited a total of 1,003 participants to take part in our reward-learning paradigm one week later, 575 of which completed our study. In line with our preregistration, we excluded participants who missed more than 5% of the decision-making trials and/or failed more than two attention checks in the questionnaires. While we initially recruited an even number of participants based on sex assigned at birth, the majority of participants who qualified for the eating disorder group were female (138 out of 165). Due to this low sample of male participants in the DE group, we decided to exclude male participants from both groups.</p><p>We further matched the DE group (N = 138) with participants from the TE group (N = 141) based on age, education, and self-report of at least one non-eating-related psychiatric disorder (given comorbidities in eating disorders); see SI 1 and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref> for sample characteristics.</p><p>Within the DE group, 113 out of 138 participants reported a history of anorexia nervosa.</p><p>We further checked for differences in behavior between self-reported eating disorder (anorexia nervosa only (n = 54), bulimia nervosa only (n = 25), or both (n = 54)), diagnostic history, current psychotropic medication, as well as current eating disorder behaviors (e.g., restraint, binge, and purge behaviors; for sample characteristics, see SI I; also see 'Statistical approach' below for further detail). We did not find any variable to exert independent effects on learning performance, nor any subgroup to exhibit a different pattern of results. However, these supplementary post-hoc analyses found individual differences in the DE sample to interact with our primary effects and we report these exploratory findings in the manuscript.</p><p>Procedure. Participants completed three sections: (1) reward-learning task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>), (2) eight short questionnaires evaluating eating behaviors and mental health (SI 2.2), and (3) assessment of a selection of food stimuli on health and calorie accuracy (participants were not aware of these assessments when they completed the reward-learning task). The online study took, on average, minutes to complete, and participants were paid a rate of $15 per hour.</p><p>Reward-learning task. The probabilistic learning task consisted of six blocks in the following order: (1) practice block, (2-3) two pre-arousal learning blocks (one 'food' and one 'control' block), (4) wheel-of-fortune arousal manipulation (win or loss), and (5-6) two post-arousal learning blocks (one 'food' and one 'control' block; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>). Across participants, we counterbalanced three task elements: (1) the order of the food and control blocks, (2) whether the wheel of fortune resulted in a win or a loss, and (3) which stimulus category was initially more rewarding in each block, leading to a total of 8 configurations. The trial-unique food and scene stimuli were randomly selected on each trial (each item only appeared once in the rewardlearning task; for stimuli information, see SI 2.1)</p><p>Participants were instructed to learn which of two categories on a trial (represented by two stimuli displayed on the screen) was more rewarding through trial and error; they chose one stimulus and received feedback about the outcome (rewarded or not). During the practice block (14 trials), participants were walked through the task, made decisions between indoor and outdoor scenes (control task), and experienced one 'change-point' event to the underlying reward distribution. A change-point event indicates a reversal of the rewards associated with each category, meaning the more rewarding category became the less rewarding one. They had to correctly answer all comprehension questions before moving on to the actual task.</p><p>Each learning block included either two food items as categories ('food block') or two scene categories ('control block'; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). One stimulus category was always more rewarding than the other (75% versus 25% reward probability). The categories were specified in the instructions but were not labeled on decision-making trials. In the food blocks, the categories were raw versus cooked/baked foods, which highly correlated with the calorie content of the food, serving as a cover story for low-and high-calorie foods, respectively (high-calorie mean calories: 1208.14; low-calorie mean calories: 99.18). The categories in the control blocks were indoor and outdoor scenes. Each learning block consisted of 40 trials, and on trial 20, the reward categories reversed (change-point). On each trial, participants had 5 seconds to make a choice ('1' for the left category and '2' for the right category), or else they would miss the outcome on that trial. On average, participants missed less than 0.2% of trials. The outcome of any trial was presented for 1 second and showed either '$0' ('not rewarded') or '$10' ('rewarded'), a small proportion of which participants were told they would receive (in reality, participants received the same payment of $15/hour for this task regardless of performance). Each trial was separated by a one-second inter-trial-interval.</p><p>After two learning blocks, participants 'spun' a digital wheel of fortune via a key press (arousal manipulation). They were told that the length of their press predicted the wheel's outcome; however, the outcome of the wheel (winning or losing $8) was predetermined.</p><p>Participants were told the full $8 would be added or removed from their earnings. This arousal manipulation increases positive emotion (in the case of a win) and negative emotion (in the case of a loss) during reward learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015;</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, throughout the learning task, participants rated their current state on four measures: arousal (denoted as 'alertness' to avoid semantic confusion or a specific positive/negative valence), happiness, hunger, and thirst on Likert scales ranging from 1 through 6. More specifically, for arousal/'alertness', the scale ranged from 1 (sleepy/distracted) to 6 (very alert); for happiness: 1 (very sad) to 6 (very happy); for hunger: 1 (very hungry) to 6 (very full);</p><p>for thirst: 1 (very thirsty) to 6 (quenched). These ratings were collected four times: (1) at the beginning of the experiment, (2) before the arousal manipulation, (3) after the arousal manipulation, and (4) at the end of the learning task ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>). Alertness and happiness ratings were collected to verify changes induced by the arousal manipulation (see Results). We also checked for changes in thirst and hunger ratings, which did not significantly change across task.</p><p>Food-stimuli ratings. After completing the questionnaires, participants rated a selection of high and low-calorie food items, 20 from each category (40 in total). They rated each food item (randomized order) on the perceived healthiness on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 'very unhealthy' to 6 'very healthy'. Participants had a maximum of 10 seconds to answer. They next estimated the total number of calories for 20 of the food items (10 low and 10 high-calorie items)</p><p>and had a maximum of 15 seconds to answer.</p><p>Statistical approach. For repeated-measures statistical tests, we used mixed-effects models (R package, lme4; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bates et al., 2015)</ref>. We treated participants as a random effect for both the slope and the intercept of each fixed effect; however, if the model did not converge, we incrementally simplified the random effect structure, until convergence was achieved (the simplest structure included model participant intercept as a random effect). To predict binary choice data in the reward-learning task, we ran generalized linear mixed-effects logistic regression models, and otherwise ran linear mixed-effects regression models. In each model, we also statistically accounted for individuals' BMI as a nuisance variable, although we never found BMI to exert significant effects (see SI 1 for further detail).</p><p>We additionally implemented several exploratory tests to assess individual differences in the DE group that might impact the observed pattern of results. More specifically, we evaluated differences between self-reported eating disorder (anorexia nervosa only (n = 54), bulimia nervosa only (n = 25), or both (n = 54)), history of diagnosis, current psychotropic medication, as well as current eating disorder behaviors (EDE-Q subscales: restraint behavior, eating, shape and weight concerns; EAT-26 measures on binge and purge behavior in the last 6 months; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table    S1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref> for sample characteristics). We tested each variable in logistic regression models predicting correct choice (within the DE group) twice: once as an independent variable and again as a variable that interacted with the post-arousal change in learning performance.</p><p>All data and code to reproduce statistical results and figures are available:</p><p>http://github.com/ninarouhani/2024_Rouhanietal_eatingDM.</p></div>

Our baseline model was a standard Rescorla-Wagner model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972)</ref>, where the value ('Q') of a chosen stimulus category ('s') is updated during a trial (t) using the following equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">!"# $ = ! $ + ( ! − ! $ ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>a fit learning rate ( ) determines the extent to which the reward prediction error on that trial (calculated by subtracting the value of that category, ! $ , from the reward outcome, ! ) is used to change the value of that category on the next trial.

Note that without comparing across groups, choice persistence may be equivalent to asymmetric learning rates in this behavioral context <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sugawara &amp; Katahira, 2021)</ref>. However, allowing single parameters to change demonstrated that the asymmetric learning model captured group differences better than choice persistence. Model fitting and comparison. We fit hierarchical reinforcement-learning models to choice data using Stan <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carpenter et al., 2017)</ref>. Parameters from equations 1-6 were simultaneously fit at both the participant and (across-group) population level using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. All priors were drawn from weakly informative normal distributions. We report the population-level (hyperparameter) distribution means of fit parameters in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We ran each model 2,000 iterations (500 warmup) on 4 chains, and verified that there were no divergences, a BFMI (Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information) of ≥ 0.2 for all chains, R-hat values ≤ 1.01, and effective sample sizes ≥ 400 for all parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baribault and Collins 2023)</ref>. If the number of effective sample sizes was too low, we ran the model for 5,000 iterations. All included models met these diagnostic criteria. RStan scripts are publicly available:</p><p>http://github.com/ninarouhani/2024_Rouhanietal_eatingDM.</p><p>To compare models, we computed the Widely Applicable (or Watanabe-Akaike)</p><p>Information Criterion ('WAIC', <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watanabe, 2010)</ref> for each model ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A)</ref>. The WAIC reflects a model's out-of-sample predictive performance by measuring the difference between (see α) Q0 = -0.67 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> for difference parameters) the average log-likelihood of a model for the observed data with the variance of the average loglikelihood for simulated data drawn from the posterior distribution. This approach is considered robust to overfitting as it adjusts for the effective number of parameters in the model, accounting for model complexity. Lower scores indicate a better fit.</p><p>We conducted checks on the best-fitting model, including posterior predictive checks (model predictions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) and parameter recovery, see SI 4 for details.</p><p>Group-difference parameters from best-fitting model.

They were fit on low (versus high) initial Qvalues (2 parameters in total, 1 for each block), and were fit separately to positive learning rates for high-and low-calorie food stimuli (4 parameters in total, 2 for each block). Note that fitting group-difference parameters on the negative learning rate did not improve fit. We considered parameter distributions to reflect significant differences between the DE and TE groups only if their 95% confidence interval did not span 0. <ref type="bibr">1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Participants</head><p>Participants in the disordered eaters ('DE') group scored and above on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire ('EDE-Q';  and reported current or past symptoms of anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia nervosa. Participants in the typical eaters ('TE') group scored less than 1.5 on the EDE-Q and reported no history of any eating disorder. While we initially screened for an even number of males and females, the vast majority of the DE group were female, and we therefore excluded males from further analysis. We matched participants based on age and education but were not able to match groups based on Body Mass Index ('BMI'; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>). The DE group had higher BMI scores than the TE group, and higher BMI scores were associated with higher global EDE-Q scores (B = 0.10, t(277) = 9.93, p &lt; 0.001), consistent with previous work showing a positive relationship between BMI and EDE-Q scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ralph-Nearman et al., 2020)</ref>. We statistically accounted for this difference by including BMI as a nuisance variable in all of our analyses (although we never found BMI to exert significant effects). We also compared behavior between DE participants binned into low-and high-BMI groups and did not find statistical differences in behavioral patterns.</p><p>Given the prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorder in DE, all participants rated their current and past symptoms of psychiatric disorders that are comorbid with eating disorders on a 5-point scale from 0 ('Never') to 4 ('Debilitating'). To better match the DE and TE groups, we recruited TE participants that self-reported a history of at least one (non-eating-related) psychiatric disorder. We implemented this recruitment strategy in order to target the specific effects of eating (versus other related) disorders, and to better match psychotropic medication use between the two groups. The DE group still had higher median values (by one point) for selfreported depression, social-anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>).</p><p>We also characterized differences between the DE and TE groups on eating-disorder symptoms and behaviors.

DE participants also engaged in more binge-eating and purge behaviors than the TE group in the last six months (all ps &gt; 0.001, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1B</ref>, measures from Eating Attitudes Test: .  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Stimuli selection.</head><p>We selected food stimuli from the thoroughly characterized 'Food-Pics_Extended' database <ref type="bibr">(Blechert et al., 2019)</ref>. Specifically, we chose 80 unique (baked or cooked) high-calorie food items (mean calories: 1208.14, median: 552.50) and 80 unique raw low-calorie food items (mean calories: 99.18, median: 61.45); we further verified that the sets of food stimuli were similar in their visual properties (e.g., object size and image complexity; the nutritional and visual properties of each stimulus are provided in database). For our control task, we selected 80 indoor and 80 outdoor images from the SUN database <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Xiao et al., 2010)</ref>. The wheel of fortune stimulus was adapted from previous work, which has verified its effect on mood by increasing positive emotion after a win and increasing negative emotion after a loss, tested in a non-clinical population <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015;</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.</head><p>Questionnaires. After the reward-learning task, participants completed a set of eight questionnaires (questionnaire order was randomized). This included two more questionnaires characterizing eating behavior: the Power of Food Scale <ref type="bibr">(Cappelleri et al., 2009)</ref> and the Eating Attitudes Test (' <ref type="bibr">EAT-26': Garner et al., 1982)</ref>. al., 2018). While we found higher scores for the DE group across these mental health measures <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S2)</ref>, we did not find these variables to exert any independent or interactive effects in our statistical models (no variable passed statistical-significance thresholds after multiplecomparison correction). We are therefore not reporting findings from this analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Pilot results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1.</head><p>Pilot sample and procedure. In our pilot experiment, we recruited participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk ('mTurk') who scored either 3 or above (DE group: n = 108; 67 female; age: mean = 38 years old, standard deviation = 9 years) or less than 1.5 (TE group: n = 119; 72 female; age: mean = 37 years old, standard deviation = 10 years) on the EDE-Q questionnaire . Note that we did not require current or past (self-reported) eating disorder in this pilot sample for inclusion, likely explaining the higher participation of males. Participants completed a decision-making task (similar to the current experiment) without the wheel of fortune task (arousal manipulation). This decision-making task included one food and one control block that were each 45 trials with two change-point events (within each block).</p><p>Given the smaller number of trials as well as more frequent change points, we did not fit pilot behavior to computational models that require more trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.</head><p>Reward-learning performance. In our pilot study (and replicated in the main study), we did not find overall differences in learning performance between the DE and TE groups (Β = 0.01, z = 0.14, p = 0.89). Moreover, matching our key finding, we found an overall interaction between group and learning for high-and low-calorie food categories in our pilot (Β = -0.33, z = -3.71, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2A</ref>): DE participants learned better when the low-(versus high-)</p><p>calorie category was more rewarding, while TE participants learned better when the high-(versus low-) calorie category was more rewarding. For comparison, we again report the effect replicated in the independent sample described in the main manuscript (Β = -0.23, z = -3.63, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2B</ref>). Extending the results of the pilot, the main study demonstrated that an arousal manipulation significantly enhanced these biases (see main manuscript).</p><p>We note that our pilot and current sample of participants differed substantially: they were recruited from different platforms (mTurk versus Prolific) and subject to different selection criteria (e.g., in our pilot, we did not screen for a history of eating disorders, likely leading to greater male participation). Regardless, the biased patterns of decision-making in the DE and TE groups do replicate across these two independent samples, suggesting that current EDE-Q symptoms may substantially account for food-related learning bias. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref>. Learning in pilot and main studies. Across the pilot (A) and main study (B), we replicated food-related learning biases for disordered ('DE') and typical ('TE') eaters: DE learned better when the more rewarding category was represented by low-calorie food stimuli, while TE learned better when the more rewarding category was represented by high-calorie food stimuli. Note that the pilot reward-learning task did not include an arousal manipulation. Overall performance differences between samples, such as better learning in the study sample, may be due to different recruitment strategies: pilot participants were recruited from Amazon mTurk instead of Prolific and were not filtered for self-reported eating disorder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Computational model checks</head><p>We conducted posterior predictive checks by comparing model-generated behavior to participant data. The model replicated overall learning patterns (diamond points versus circled points in main manuscript, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>) and group-specific food biases, as well as their enhancement after the arousal manipulation (main manuscript, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2C</ref> &amp; E). We also conducted parameter recovery on the 8 parameters of the best-fitting model. For each parameter, we chose 9 values (including 0 as well as 4 positive and 4 negative values) that spanned each parameter's range, in even increments. We fit the model to data that had been generated by the model using each set of ('true' or generative) parameter values and evaluated recovery (similarity between 'fit' values to the original 'true' values). Parameter recovery was successful for all parameters ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S3, below)</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S3</ref>. Parameter recovery plots for the best-fitting model. The model included fit parameters, 'base Q': base initial Q-value across categories and groups; 'Q-rel-diff b1': group difference initial Q-value for low-(relative to high-) calorie food stimuli in block 1; 'Q-rel-diff b2': group difference initial Q-value for low-(relative to high-) calorie food stimuli in block 2; 'beta': softmax inverse temperature; 'base alpha-neg': base learning rate for negative prediction errors across categories and groups; 'base alpha-pos': base learning rate for positive prediction errors across categories and groups; 'alpha-pos-lc b1': group difference learning rate for positive predictions errors associated with low-calorie stimuli in block 1; 'alpha-pos-hc b1': group difference learning rate for positive predictions errors associated with high-calorie stimuli in block 1; 'alpha-pos-lc b2': group difference learning rate for positive predictions errors associated with low-calorie stimuli in block 2; 'alpha-pos-hc b2': group difference learning rate for positive predictions errors associated with high-calorie stimuli in block 2. Dotted diagonal line indicates value equivalence between the x-axis (original 'true' parameter values) and y-axis (recovered 'fit' values). Error bars are 95% confidence intervals for the fit parameter's posterior distribution; successful recovery indicated by error bar crossing the dotted line. Parameter recovery was successful for all parameters.</p></div>
