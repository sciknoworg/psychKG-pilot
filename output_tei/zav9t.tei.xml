			<abstract>
				<p>The current age is characterized by having too many options. Decision-making is harder when there are numerous options to choose from. However, having a large number of options is not necessarily a problem for everyone and in this context, maximizing and satisficing tendencies are described. Yet, there is a debate about the effect of these tendencies on well-being and it has to be asked as to whether maximizing and satisficing have an adaptive or maladaptive effect on our well-being. Moreover, it raises questions regarding the conceptualization and measurement of maximizing and satisficing tendencies. In a sample of 480 subjects from the general population, a two-component model of maximizing was examined. The results show that the two-component model (maximizing as a strategy and maximizing as a goal) is an efficient way to measure maximizing tendency. The results show that maximizing as a strategy (measured as alternative search) was maladaptive (was positively related to depression and negatively related to happiness), whereas maximizing as a goal (measured as high standards) had no maladaptive effect (was not related to well-being at all). In addition, the two components were differently associated with personality factors which strengthen the need for measuring maximizing as a two-component model. In the current study, it was found that even though great effort was invested in studying maximizing tendency, satisficing tendency stayed behind and its conceptualization and measurement are unclear. Therefore, the (mal)adaptive effect of these tendencies depends on their conceptualization as well as on how these tendencies are measured, and also on their different relationship with personality factors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Paradox of choice</head><p>Nowadays, there are often too many options in situations related to decision-making. This can lead to difficulties with processing such huge amounts of information <ref type="bibr">(Álvarez et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Piasecki and Hanna (2011)</ref> have suggested that negative experiencing is caused by a deficiency of sufficient options although there is a debate surrounding this. While it seems likely that having several options leads to making better decisions, having a large number of options can have also a negative effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kinjo &amp; Ebina, 2014)</ref>. This has been called the paradox of choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schwartz, 2000)</ref>. In other words, having too many options in the decision-making process can lead to the inability to make a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schwartz, 2004)</ref>. In particular, the following three problems are related to the paradox of choice: the first is the process of obtaining information about the options related to the choice. The second is the increase in possibilities, which is accompanied by increasing the standards of the desired result. The third problem is that making a mistake in decision-making with so many options available is considered a personal failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002)</ref>. In this context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schwartz (2000)</ref> has suggested that less freedom (in the meaning of fewer options) could be better in the decision-making process. Indeed, it has been argued that in this context "less is sometimes more" <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schwartz, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maximizing and satisficing</head><p>However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schwartz et al. (2002)</ref> has explained that if all people reacted negatively to large numbers of options, there would be significant problems making even common decisions. Thus, they distinguish between "maximizing" and "satisficing" in the context of the paradox of choice. The maximizing tendency is the effort given to selecting the best option and the satisficing tendency to selecting a sufficient or "fairly good" option. In other words, maximizing tends to consider a large, if not absolute, number of potential choices in finding the best option and making the best decision. Satisficing tends to consider some criteria of options and when the criteria of options meet with the satisficer's criteria, this is good enough to make a decision. Unlike satisficers, an increasing number of options in decision-making can be a huge problem for maximizers. Maximizers have far greater difficulty obtaining information about all options in order to make the best choice. Moreover, there is always a chance that there is a much better option than those currently available <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002)</ref>. While maximizers only consider the decisions with the best results to be correct, satisficers consider all those with sufficient results to be correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jenkins &amp; Nolan, 2010)</ref>. The biggest difference between maximizers and satisficers is how they evaluate the choice after it has been made. It is important for satisficers to have a fairly good result while maximizers are unlikely to say that they have achieved the best result after making their choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002)</ref>. Despite maximizers being able to objectively make better decisions than satisficers, satisficers feel subjectively better with the decision they have made <ref type="bibr">(Álvarez et al., 2014)</ref>. Maximizers are not able to experience happiness, compared to satisficers who are satisfied with their decisions. The maximizing tendency to find and make the best decision can be maladaptive. In other words, it can contribute to a lower experience of happiness, subjective well-being and a higher incidence of depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Diab et al. (2008)</ref> have pointed out that maximizers can be portrayed as unhappy and exhausted from the constant search for the best option. Yet, it is important to consider a way of measuring the maximizing tendency which may not show maximizers as being less happy or depressed. Rather, maximizers could be more motivated and subjectively much more satisfied because of the high goals they are able to achieve through this tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bubić &amp; Erceg, 2018)</ref>. Maximizers can experience more success due to the higher maximizing tendency and success can in turn make them happier <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lyubomirsky et al., 2005)</ref>. In this context, having a large number of options in the decisionmaking process may not be negative for maximizers. A greater number of choices be an opportunity to achieve greater goals which can have a positive effect on experiencing satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dalal et al., 2015)</ref>. Indeed, personal goals are very important in the context of happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Myers &amp; Diener, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The original theory claims that the maximizing tendency is maladaptive while the satisficing tendency is adaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002)</ref>. In other words, it states that that maximizers are less happy (or more depressed) than satisficers and vice versa. Yet, this could arguably be the other way round. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dalal et al. (2015)</ref> have argued that <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schwartz et al. (2002)</ref> did not provide an exact definition of these constructs and thus maximizers could be as happy as satisficers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Diab et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dalal et al., 2015)</ref>. In particular, the operationalization of maximizing is not clear and there is disagreement about how to measure it. It is also not clear if maximizing should be viewed as maladaptive or not. In the theory of paradox of choice (satisficers vs maximizers), certain things need to be clarified: a) anchoring of the theory and conceptual model as well as measuring these tendencies; b) the relationship between these tendencies and well-being (e.g., happiness and depression); c) the relationships between satisficing, maximizing and other variables (variables which are important to both well-being and decision making)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual model and measuring of maximizing and satisficing</head><p>In the paradox of choice theory, there is no consensus regarding how satisficing and maximizing should be conceptualized and measured. As a result, there are some other issues which need to be addressed: a) it has been suggested that the maximizing and satisficing tendencies constitute a continuum. By this, these tendencies are measured through one tool where a high score indicates maximizing and a low score indicates satisficing <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nenkov et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Diab et al,, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lai, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Weinhardt et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Richardson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dalal et al., 2015)</ref>. However, others have suggested that maximizing and satisficing tendencies are two separate variables. Therefore, they should be measured by two different instruments or subscales where a high score indicates a high rate of maximizing tendency and a low score indicates a low maximizing tendency. The same applies to the satisficing tendency measured separately from the maximizing tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Turner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Misuraca et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ďuriník et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rim, 2017)</ref>; b) in addition to the discussion of how to measure the maximizing and satisficing tendencies, there is also a debate how the maximizing tendency should be operationalized. It has been suggested that maximizing consists of high standards, alternative searches and decision difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nenkov et al., 2008)</ref>. While some researchers exclude decision difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Diab et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lai, 2010)</ref>, others think that high standards should not be part of maximizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Turner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ďuriník et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Richardson et al. (2014)</ref> have added regret as part of maximizing. <ref type="bibr">Dalal et al. (2016)</ref> exclude alternative searches and decision difficulties because they suggest it is an outcome of maximizing rather than being part of it; c) the way of measuring maximizing and satisficing can be crucial. There could be a difference when these tendencies are measured as a continuum, through one measure which consists of high standards, alternative searches and decision difficulties or when one or two of these parts are excluded. On the other hand, the differences in results can also be caused by measuring these tendencies separately. These problems explain the mismatch between the claims as to whether the maximizing tendency is maladaptive or not.</p><p>In this regard, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheek and Schwartz (2016)</ref> have suggested that maximizing should be viewed as a two-component model consisting of maximizing as a goal and maximizing as a strategy.</p><p>They go on to say that maximizing as a goal is characterized as high standards and is not maladaptive while maximizing as a strategy is characterized as an alternative search and is maladaptive. This is because maximizing as a goal is characterized as the effort to achieve high goals due to high standards and can be motivating in some way. However, maximizing as a strategy is characterized as an exhausting effort to compare the huge amount of possibilities during decision-making. They have also suggested measuring satisficing separately from maximizing. The current study tries to address these inconsistencies by measuring the satisficing and maximizing separately and measuring maximizing as a strategy and as a goal.</p><p>Maximizing and satisficing and its relationship to well-being According to several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nenkov et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Diab et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lai, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Turner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Weinhardt et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mikkelson &amp; Pauley, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Richardson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Misuraca et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dalal et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rim, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ďuriník et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">)</ref>, the relationship between satisficing and maximizing and wellbeing is not clear. Some authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Turner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rim, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ďuriník et al., 2018)</ref> suggest that maximizing is maladaptive while other authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Nenkov et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Diab et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lai, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dalal et al., 2015)</ref> have found that maximizing is not maladaptive. As described above, the way of measuring these tendencies appears to be crucial. The way of measuring (in terms of the chosen instrument) may have contributed to the fact that the maximizing tendency is related differently with the same variables across several studies. This could also contribute to inconsistencies as to whether the tendency to maximize is maladaptive or not. Therefore, the question is if there exists a compact approach to measure these decision-making tendencies, which would contribute to clearance of these inconsistencies?</p><p>The current study wants to address these inconsistent findings by looking at how the relationships between satisficing and maximizing and well-being would be if maximizing was measured by a two-component model, separately from satisficing . It also wants to look at how decision making tendencies are related to a personality and self-rumination when maximizing is measured as two-component model (as a goal and as a strategy) and also separately from satisficing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016)</ref>. We hypothesize that satisficing tendency would be adaptive decision-making tendency, it means that satisficing will be in positive relationship to happiness and in negative relationship to depression. In the context of two components we hypothesize that maximizing as a strategy would be more maladaptive than maximizing as a goal. In addition, we hypothesize that maximizing measured as two-component model would be related to personality and self-rumination in a different way.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Subjects</head><p>From the 525 subjects, the sample was made up of 480 subjects from the general population in Slovakia (105 men and 373 women, two subjects do not state their gender) aged between 18 and 62 (M = 27.07; SD = 9.87). The data collection was carried out face-to-face (n = 90) as well as online (n = 390). Most of the subjects were in a relationship (n = 205), single (n = 171), married (n = 90), divorced (12). Education: high school (n=221), university (n=240), primary school (n = 9). The face-to-face data collection took place among employees at the unemployment office and among employees at high school. The online data collection was done through popular social network groups on Facebook (3 social groups were addressed, 2 with about 100,000 members and one with about 15,000 members). The members of these social network groups are mainly undergraduates. The a priori sample size was not computed but the effectiveness of the used sample size was checked by a sensitivity analysis (computed by G*Power calculator). Given by alpha level 0.05, power 0.8, it was found that N = 480 is enough to find the effect size r = 0.11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Measures</head><p>The measurements of the maximizing and satisficing tendencies were chosen based on the suggestion of the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheek &amp; Schwartz (2016)</ref>. They recommend measuring the maximizing tendency as a two-component model and the satisfaction tendency separately from the maximizing tendency. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheek &amp; Schwartz (2016)</ref>, the MTS-7 captures the concept of maximizing as a goal best from all available measures of the paradox of choice. For measuring maximizing as a strategy they recommend using only one subscale of MI -the alternative search subscale, whose items best reflect the nature of what maximizing as a strategy is. In addition, the items from the "less ambitious satisficing" subscale represent the concept of satisficing more accurately in contrary to other variables for measuring satisficing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dalal et al., 2015)</ref> was used to measure the tendency of maximizing as a goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016)</ref>. It consists of 7 items (e.g.: "No matter what I do, I have the highest standards for myself.", or "I don't like having to settle for good enough."; McDonald's ω = 0.85; α = 0.77) focused on measuring high standards. Subjects respond to every item using a 5-point Likert scale -from 1-strongly disagree to 5-strongly agree. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dalal et al. (2015)</ref> argue that a higher level of MTS-7 reflects higher high standards which create a maximizing tendency. A lower level of MTS-7 reflects lower high standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MTS-7 -7-item Maximizing Tendency Scale</head><p>MI -Maximization Inventory -and its subscale -the alternative search subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Turner et al., 2012</ref>) was used to measure the tendency of maximizing as a strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The MI consists of three subscales to measure alternative search, decision difficulty and satisficing. The alternative search subscale consists of 12 items (e.g.: "I usually continue to search for an item until it reaches my expectations.", or "I find myself going to many different stores before finding the thing I want."; McDonald's ω = 0.88; α = 0.85). Subjects respond to every item on a 5-point Likert scale -from 1-strongly disagree to 5-strongly agree. A higher level in the MI-alternative search subscale reflects a higher alternative search in the decisionmaking process, and vice versa. tendencies. In the present study the less ambitious satisficing subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Misuraca et al., 2015)</ref> was used to measure the satisficing tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016)</ref>. It consists of 4 items (e.g.: "If I am happy with my work, I do not seek better opportunities.", or "When I watch TV or listen to the radio, I tend to follow the first program that I find interesting."; McDonald's ω = 0.60; α = 0.56). Subjects respond to every item using a 5-point Likert scale from 1-strongly disagree to 5-strongly agree. A higher score reflects higher less ambitious satisficing, and vice versa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(John &amp; Srivastava, 1999)</ref>. A modification of the Czech version to the Slovak version of this scale was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hřebíčková et al., 2016)</ref>. The subscales extraversion (e.g.: "...is outgoing, sociable"; McDonald's ω = 0.91; α = 0.86) and neuroticism (e.g.: "...gets nervous easily"; McDonald's ω = 0.89; α = 0.87) were used to measure personality traits. Both subscales consist of 8 items. Subjects respond to every item on a 5-point Likert scale -from 1-strongly disagree to 5-strongly agree. A higher score reflects a higher level of neuroticism, and vice versa. Scoring is the same in extroversion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999)</ref> was used to measure happiness. It consists of 4 items (e.g.: "In general, I consider myself: from 1-not a very happy person to 7-a very happy person", or "Compared to most of my peers, I consider myself: from 1-less happy to 7-more happy"; McDonald's ω = 0.87; α = 0.82) which measure subjective happiness. Subjects respond to every item on a 7-point Likert scale. A higher score reflects a higher level of happiness, and vice versa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beck et al., 1996)</ref> measures the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. It consists of 21 items (McDonald's ω = 0.93; α = 0.92) characterized by 4-5 assertions and 4 grades that evaluate the problem. Every item can have a score from 0 to 3 by choosing one of the statements. One example of the item to measure the intensity of crying as a symptom is: 0 ("I don't cry any more than usual."), 1 ("I cry more now than I used to."), 2</p></div>

The data was collected between January and March 2019.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data Analysis</head><p>Before data analysis, the missing values were checked. Subjects with missing information about their age (n = 32) and subjects lower than 18 years old (n = 3) were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>If the subject had more than 80% missing values, also was excluded from the analysis. After this exclusion, the missingness was about 0,4%. The missing values were imputed by using multiple imputation methods (with a minimum of 5 imputations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rubin, 1987)</ref> and at least 10 iterations per one imputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Reiter &amp; Raghunathan;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">2007)</ref>. Multiple imputation was proceeded by package MICE (van Buren, 2020). Descriptive statistics and correlations were computed on every imputed dataset and pooled estimates are reported. In exploratory analysis (see supplementary materials), the regression models with interactions were estimated. Before carrying out an exploratory analysis, the linearity and collinearity of variables was inspected.</p><p>The linearity of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable was not verified in the model but separately using the curve estimation method. In multicollinearity, a critical value for VIF of more than 5 and a tolerance of less than 0.20 was chosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(O'Brien, 2007)</ref>. The data were analyzed in R statistical software (R core team, 2018).</p><p>The analytical code and data are available in the supplementary materials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>In In this study, maximizing was measured as a two-component model: as a goal and a strategy.</p><p>In addition, satisficing was measured separately from maximizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016</ref>).</p><p>This study found that in the context of well-being, only maximizing as a strategy was in a significant relationship with well-being. Specifically, it was found that maximizing as a strategy and depression were positively related. The other decision-making tendencies (maximizing as a goal, satisficing) and well-being were not related. On the other hand, in the context of personality, it was found that maximizing (as a goal and also as a strategy) were related to personality traits and self-rumination, but in different ways. Results also show that satisficing tendency in the current study was not related to anything.</p><p>Cheek and Schwartz (2016) have stated that maximizing as a strategy (measured as an alternative search) could be maladaptive. According to the findings of the study, this could be true. Maximizing as a strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016)</ref> is characterized by doing alternative searches. This is accompanied by a constant comparison of options <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Turner et al., 2012)</ref> which could be stressful. In the current study it was found that maximizing as a strategy was positively related to neuroticism and depression. Thus, these findings support the claims that maximizing is a maladaptive decision-making tendency which has a negative effect on well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002)</ref>. However, given the results of this study, it is appropriate to pay attention to how maximizing is measured, because while the maximizing as a strategy was positively related to a neuroticism and depression, and negatively related to extraversion, the maximizing as a goal was not significantly related to well-being and was positively related to extraversion and negatively related to neuroticism. However the latter correlation was weak and insignificant. Maximizing as a strategy was also more strongly related to self-rumination than maximizing as a goal. According to these results, we suggest that it is meaningful to differentiate between maximizing as a goal and maximizing as a strategy.</p><p>Both of the maximizing tendencies from the two-component model of maximizing were positively related to self-rumination.</p><p>The last decision-making tendencies related to the theory paradox of choice which was examined in our study was satisficing. Satisficing is characterised as a potentially adaptive decision-making strategy which leads to positive affectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schwartz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Turner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016</ref>). In the current study, we found very weak insignificant relationships satisficing and all other variables ( other decision-making tendencies:</p><p>maximizing as a goal, and maximizing as a strategy, with well-being variables: happiness, and depression, but also with personality factors such as neuroticism, extraversion, and with selfrumination). Based on our results, we were unable to offer sufficient evidence suggesting whether satisficing is adaptive or maladaptive.</p><p>The fact that satisficing was unrelated to anything is a rather surprising result The construct measuring satisficing also showed a lower level of reliability. On the other hand, these results are in accordance with the study in which the authors developed the measurement tool which we used. The reliability is approximately the same as in the study from the authors who created this questionnaire/subscale. The same applies to the relationship between satisficing and wellbeing. In the original work (a subscale called less ambitious satisfying) it was not related to depression or life-satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Misuraca et al., 2015)</ref>. Although there exists three subscales measuring satisficing tendency, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheek and Schwartz (2016)</ref> proposed a less ambitious satisficing subscale as a good variant to measure this tendency because items of this subscale better reflect this tendency. According to them, a more ambitious satisficing subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Misuraca et al., 2015)</ref> reflects general perseverance rather than satisficing. In addition, some items of the satisficing subscale from maximizing inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Turner et al., 2012)</ref> reflect something like "make the best of the situation", and some items reflect the "tolerance of uncertainty" rather than satisficing tendency <ref type="bibr">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016, p.132)</ref>. In accordance with these recommendations,we decided to measure it with the less ambitious satisficing subscales.</p><p>However, the results in the current study appear to question the extent to which satisficing is a valid construct (in the sense of, for example, its criterion validity) in the context of the theory of paradox of choice. Specifically, the extent to which this construct is useful in the form in which it is currently recommended to measure it. Satisficing, as defined, could be a relevant and useful construct, but it seems that in its current form, its conceptualization and its measurement is rather disputable. In other words, although it is an undeniable fact that in recent decades much attention has been paid to the controversial nature of the tendency to maximize, a future direction should be focused also on satisficing tendency and its conceptualization and measurement.</p><p>Knowing how the paradox of choice decision making tendencies are related to neuroticism, extraversion and self-rumination could explain the different findings regarding the maladaptive and adaptive nature of these tendencies. Because all three variables (neuroticism, extraversion, and self-rumination) have been repeatedly and stably identified as factors that are strongly related to depression and happiness (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hakulinen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Van Eeden et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Olatunji et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pishva et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sariçam, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">DeNeve &amp; Cooper, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hills &amp; Argyle, 2001)</ref>, and it was also indicated by the results of our research. The different effects of maximizing as a goal and maximizing as a strategy on well-being could thus be explained through different relationships to variables that are significant in the context of well-being.</p><p>This is also pointed out by our exploratory analysis through multiple regression and moderation analysis through interaction (see supplementary materials). These exploratory results suggest that the (mal)adaptive effect of these decision-making tendencies could be different depending on the presence of different levels of these personality factors. From a practical point of view, whether any of the above-mentioned decision-making tendencies will be maladaptive or adaptive, it is important who (in terms of personality factors) chooses these tendencies. For instance,in people with higher levels of neuroticism or self-rumination, these tendencies could be more maladaptive. However, the results of the exploratory analysis need to be taken with a grain of salt, as multiple regression and interaction have several limitations, especially if they are implemented on cross-sectional data <ref type="bibr">(Tzaglev &amp; Henik, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wagenmakers et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>These exploratory results could rather serve as an inspiration for forming hypotheses for further research with more complex designs (e.g., longitudinal or experimental).</p><p>The results have shown that it is not straightforward to make inferences as to whether maximizing is maladaptive or not. It depends on how it is measured and which other contextrelated variables are taken into account. The two-component model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016)</ref> can contribute to clarifying the uncertainty about the measurement of maximizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cheek &amp; Ward, 2019)</ref>. Some studies have already found evidence for the support of the two-component model of maximizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cheek &amp; Ward, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mikkelson &amp; Ray, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cheek &amp; Goebel, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>This study also found support for the two-component model of maximizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016)</ref> as well as finding that satisficing should be measured separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Turner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ďuriník et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Miceli et al., 2015)</ref>. According to our findings, maximizing as a goal and maximizing as a strategy could be related to well-being in different ways. It is useful to differentiate between maximizing as a goal and maximizing as a strategy as well as measure maximizing separately from satisficing, not as a continuum. The results</p><p>show that the differentiation between the two is needed because they were related to well-being and personality in a different way and it supports the effectiveness of the two-component model.</p><p>The practical implications examined in the current study can contribute to a perception of maximizers and satisficers.</p><p>Although differentiation between maximizing as a goal and as a strategy could contribute to clear the confusion in the literature, the results suggest that measuring these tendencies separately is not enough. The different ways of measuring maximizing and satisficing lead to the confusion in their conceptualization. However, the biggest problematic question is about personality. The discrepancy about the (mal)adaptive effect of maximizing could be caused, for example, by the emotional stability of sample or self-rumination. In other words, had the sample consisted of more neurotic people, maximizing could have been maladaptive, and vice versa.</p><p>The constellation of personality traits in the sample could, therefore, cause (mal)adaptive effect of these tendencies. However, this was never controlled.</p><p>This study aimed to verify the two-component model and discuss the (mal)adaptive effect of the decision-making tendencies related to the theory of paradox of choice, and their relationship to personality and self-rumination.</p><p>Our results led to three main conclusions:</p><p>At first, maximizing as a goal, and maximizing as strategy are related to well-being and personality in different ways, and it makes sense to distinguish and measure them in the form of the two-component model. Therefore, the two-component model is an efficient way to measure maximizing.</p><p>Second, the maladaptive or adaptive function of maximizing as a goal and maximizing as a strategy could be explained precisely through their different relationships to personality factors.</p><p>However, to verify this statement more accurately, it would be necessary to conduct research with more complex design (e.g. longitudinal or experimental). The obtained results contribute to the further research in considering personality traits and self-rumination in the context of maximizing and satisficing.</p><p>Third, although satisficing is a part of the theory of the paradox of choice and was measured as was recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheek &amp; Schwartz, 2016)</ref>, it was not significantly related to any of the variables. In addition, it yielded a lower level of reliability which is in line with the previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Misuraca et al., 2015)</ref>, but it was below the recommended cut-off. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly re-evaluate the current conceptualization and measurement of satisficing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>-consists of 6 subscales.
