			<abstract>
				<p>The frame of risky choice could alter and shape an individual&apos;s risky preferences. Within an option of typical risky choice, that is, &quot;p% chance to win $Q,&quot; naturally embedded a hidden-zero outcome, namely, &quot;(1-p)% chance to win $0.&quot; Despite its pervasive existence, there is insufficient evidence of the existence or a cognitive mechanism of the hidden-zero effect in risky choice. To this end, we proposed an attentional based risk-aversion model for behavior and process level to interpret the mechanism of the hidden-zero effect. We presented participants&apos; explicit or hiddenzero outcomes in pairs of certain versus risky options and measured their choice preferences and eye-movement characteristics. We observed that participants were less risk avoidant in the explicit-zero condition than in the hidden-zero condition, and a descriptive attentional bias shifted this preference to favor certain options in the hidden-zero condition (Study 1). We further combined the eye-tracking data with hierarchical Bayesian modeling (Study 2). We observed that a model combining behavioral and process attention provided better predictions regarding participants&apos; preference. When presenting zero outcomes, an empirical attentional bias integrating eye-movement features indicated that attention plays a central role to alter the attention allocation and consequent choice preference from certainty options to risky options in risky decision-making. These findings highlight the potential mechanism of the hidden-zero effect in risk decision-making on cognitive and computational levels.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The frame of risky choice could alter and shape an individual's risky preferences.</p><p>For example, to simplify decision-making, one of the most common and classical forms of risky choices goes on in our daily life, and risky decision research, is the choice preference between bioptional alternatives: one risky and one certain option with a non-zero outcome and its corresponding probability (e.g., 70% chance to gain $100). Crucially, these partially described contexts naturally neglect the co-existedalbeit hidden-zero-outcomes (e.g., 30% chance to gain $0). Several studies have indicated that merely changing the completeness of presentations (i.e., fully or partially describing options) while keeping the absolute value of options intact may alter individuals' preference in the framing effect of risky decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kühberger &amp; Tanner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schulte-Mecklenbeck &amp; Kühberger, 2014)</ref> and intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Magen, Dweck, &amp; Gross, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Read, Olivola, &amp; Hardisty, 2016</ref>). However, according to our review of the literature, few studies have investigated the impacts of the co-existing but hidden zero outcomes on risky choice and the potential mechanisms of the shifted choice preference. Therefore, this study aimed to thoroughly uncover whether explicitly presenting zero outcomes alters individuals' choice preferences in risky decision-making and reveal its underlying mechanism using computational modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Zero outcomes in classic models of risky decision-making</head><p>Whether the existence of zero outcomes alters choice preference in risky choice is essential to test classic computation-based decision models. Classic risky decisionmaking models based on mathematical computation are by default silent to the hidden information in risky options. These models share a common assumption that rational decision-makers would compute the values for each option through a weighting and summing process and select the option with the highest value. Examples are the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKING</head><p>classic Expected Value (EV) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pascal, 1670)</ref> and its successors, Expected Utility theory <ref type="bibr">(EU;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1947)</ref>, Prospect theory (PT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>, and Cumulative Prospect theory (CPT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>In all those models, the EV or utility of an option with a zero outcome (or zero probability) is always equal to zero; therefore, the zero outcomes do not necessarily affect the final decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Effects of zero outcomes on decision-making</head><p>Contrary to the general neglect of zero outcomes in classic computation-based decision models, recently, an increasing number of studies have shown that zero outcomes of options affect choice preference in a variety of types of decision-making.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr">Magen and colleagues (2008)</ref> first reported the hidden-zero effect in intertemporal choice. In their study, compared with a silencing of the zero outcome, explicitly referring to the zero outcome in each alternative (e.g., '' Would you prefer [A] $5 today and $0 in 26 days OR [B] $0 today and $6.20 in 26 days?'') decreases participants' willingness to choose impatient choices (i.e., "To receive $5 today").</p><p>Similarly, in consumer choice, consumers have difficulties making decisions when one of the product attributes is zero, namely, the zero-comparison effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Palmeira, 2011)</ref>. In his view, zero indicates an absence of a reference point to evaluate its meaning; thus, individuals do not necessarily know how good or bad zero is and would not react strongly to options with zero outcomes.</p><p>In the risky choice field, however, the possible impact of zero outcomes has not gained sufficient attention compared with intertemporal choice. The seminal research by Kühberger and his colleagues has indicated that hiding or presenting specific components of choice options eliminates or enhances the classic framing effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kühberger &amp; Tanner, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schulte-Mecklenbeck &amp; Kühberger, 2014)</ref>. For example, hiding the zero outcome of a risky option (e.g., 2/3 probability that nobody will be saved) would eliminate the framing effect, whereas presenting only the zero component intensifies the framing effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kühberger &amp; Tanner, 2010)</ref>. Kühberger explained these results based on the fuzzy-trace theory: Individuals reduce all quantitative information (e.g., 1/3 probability that 600 individuals will be saved/dead) into a qualitative gist (some individuals will be saved/dead) and choose the alternative that leads to more lives saved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhang and Slovic (2019)</ref> reported a zero effect in the loss frame of life-saving decisions: Presenting a zero outcome pushes an individual to choose based on the EV of options. Even when the first gamble offered a larger expected loss, participants had strong preferences for an option with zero outcome (50-50 chance that 8 or no one will die) than that without zero outcome (50-50 chance that 4 or 3 will die). These findings imply the hidden-zero effect in risky choice may also exist. However, no direct evidence is available regarding the existence and cognitive mechanism of hidden-zero effect in risky decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Attention process underlining the hidden-zero effect</head><p>Attention is one of the most important aspects and crucial mechanisms underlining decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brandstätter and Körner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krajbich, Lu, Camerer, &amp; Rangel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011)</ref>. Attention could influence behavioral choices (i.e., choice bias) and decision processes (i.e., attentional bias).</p><p>Individuals are more likely to choose the options with more attention or been last fixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brandstätter and Körner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krajbich, Lu, Camerer, &amp; Rangel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011)</ref>. Attention may also modulate the speed of value integration in the relative decision value evolving, as assumed by the attentional drift-diffusion model (aDDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Krajbich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Krajbich &amp; Rangel, 2011)</ref>. This effect of attention to decision-making has gained solid direct evidence. For instance, manipulating attention can alter the preference in intertemporal choice and moral decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fisher &amp; Rangel, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pärnamets et al., 2015)</ref>; shifting the attention of the message recipient to the complementary frame would reduce or even eliminate attribute-framing bias, that is, the tendency to evaluate objects differently when HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKING objects are framed positively or negatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kreiner &amp; Gamliel, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Parallel with this line of research, several exploratory studies have proposed that attention may underline the cognitive process of the hidden-zero effect in intertemporal decision-making. For example, <ref type="bibr">Radu and colleagues (2011)</ref> examined the "temporal attention hypothesis" and observed that explicitly presenting zero outcomes shifted participants' attention away from immediate options and toward more distant options, increasing participants' patient choice. Additionally, when explicitly highlighting the zero outcomes, participants allocated more attention to later but larger (LL) options than sooner but smaller (SS) options <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Read et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>However, this role of attention in the hidden-zero effect has not been investigated in risky choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Attentional risk-aversion model of hidden-zero effect in risky choices</head><p>Due the aforementioned deficiencies of the EU-based model family on zero options (zero outcome or zero probability), we developed a series of attentional riskaversion (aRA) models to capture the cognitive processes in the hidden-zero effect, with which, we could predict choice preference in risky choices. Given that we were interested in the asymmetry preference in the hidden-zero effect, we focused on a PTbased risk-aversion model (RA) as a baseline model for its flexibility and adaptiveness: RA has been shown to capture the potential behavioral asymmetry choice preferences in loss aversion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sokol-Hessner, Camerer, &amp; Phelps, 2012)</ref>, which outperformed EU-based models. Furthermore, most of the decision models in the literature, at least to some extent, have not yet been informed by empirically valuable source evidence that directly examines the underlying processes; as Marewski ingeminated, "models ought to be fully specified so that they are able to not only post hoc describe but also a priori predict behavior and they should make detailed predictions about cognitive processes rather than just predicting decisional outcomes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Marewski &amp; Bröder, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKING</head><p>To bridge this gap, we introduced an attentional bias into the RA model and developed several variants of the RA model in order to improve the model performance regarding explaining the cognitive mechanism of risky decision-making in the hidden-zero effect. Notably, our aim is to compare models and progressively develop models from their basic form to include attentional bias and combine process data (e.g., eye movement).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.1">Attentional risk-aversion model on the behavioral level</head><p>To compare the effectiveness of the attentional bias in the hidden-zero and explicit-zero condition, we developed two RA model variants for the hidden-zero condition (RA and aRA) and two RA-pλ model variants (see below) for the explicitzero condition (RA-pλ and aRA-pλ).</p><p>In all models, the subjective value of the certain option follows the value function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= 100% × =<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Vc and X represent subjective value and the objective payoff of certain options, respectively. The ρ parameter (0 &lt;= ρ &lt;= 2) governs the size of the subjective value given the sure payoff.</p><p>For the value of the risky option, because there were only zero payoffs rather than losses in our experimental settings, the direct formulation based on the RA model is to assign a "0" at the loss position.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= × = × 0 = 0<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In the explicit-zero condition, however, we assume that the risk (i.e., probability) of receiving the "0" payoff may alter participants' choice preference when deciding between the risky option and the certain option. Thus, we introduced an RA-pλ model and defined the value function of the risky option as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= × − (1 − )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where p is the probability that is associated with the risky payoff, and the λ parameter</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKING</head><p>(-5&lt;= λ &lt;=5) determines the effect of the probability of obtaining the zero payoff.</p><p>After we compute the values of both options, we convert the values into choice probabilities by using the Softmax action selection rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sutton &amp; Barto, 1998)</ref>. The probability of choosing the risky option is determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(R) = 1 1 + (−( − ))<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where the τ parameter (0&lt;= τ &lt;=5) is the inverse Softmax temperature that controls the stochasticity of participants' choice. More important, we have now hypothesized that participants' attention bias is crucial in the current task, which introduced a descriptive attentional bias, , which resulted in the aRA model and the aRA-pλ model, respectively. As such, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(R) = 1 1 + (−( − +))<label>(5)</label></formula><p>To avoid the non-identifiable behavioral in the mode fitting caused by the presence of , given the product between τ and , we then rearrange the formulation and obtain a regression-like component in the Softmax:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(R) = 1 1 + 0+ 1 (−( − ))<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Here, β0 and β1 depict the effect of the descriptive attentional bias and subjective value, respectively (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table A3</ref> for the summary of models).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.2">Attentional risk-aversion model at the process level</head><p>As aforementioned, to include process measurement as a crucial building block in our cognitive models, we incorporated selection bias (SB) score derived from eyemovement data into our models to account for trial-by-trial attentional processes. </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">β0 = β0' + β0SB ×SBX (7)</formula><p>where SBX is a type of SB score, and β0SB quantifies the effect of the corresponding SB score. Accordingly, by applying this new β0 to Eq. 6, we rearranged the new parameters and the p(R) now becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(R) = 1 1 + 0 + 1SB + 2 (−( − ))<label>(8)</label></formula><p>This parameter reconstruction has at least two advantages. First, as we have calculated the SB score for every trial, we can probe into the attentional bias on a trial-by-trial basis and track the within-trial variance. Second, because the SB score is obtained from a separate modality (i.e., eye movement) that implies trace processes, a benefit could be realized in the development and interpretation of our cognitive model (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table A3</ref> for the summary of models in Study 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Scope and hypotheses of this study</head><p>In this study, we explored the existence of the hidden-zero effect in risky decision-making and developed computational models that utilize an attentional RA model as their core to quantify the attentional process and the corresponding choice preference in the hidden-zero effect. In Study 1, we used a questionnaire and hierarchical Bayesian modeling to first elucidate the existence of the hidden-zero effect in risk decision-making and then assess how attentional bias is implemented to guide an individual's choice preference in the hidden-zero condition and explicit-zero condition (Study 1).</p><p>In Study 2, we focused on the trace process (using eye-tracking) of the hiddenzero effect and accommodated the process data into our models by synthesizing the evidence of behavioral readouts and process dynamics. We explored the connection between SB and the hidden-zero effect on the process level and examined their performance.</p><p>Taken together, we proposed three hypotheses:</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1): The hidden-zero effect exists in risky decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKING</head><p>Namely, explicitly presenting zero outcomes reduces the proportion of choosing certain options.</p><p>Hypothesis (H2): The reduced tendency to decide on certain options might be accounted for by an attentional bias at the valuation level, with explicitly presenting zero outcomes alters the bias such that risky options are more preferred than certain options.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 (H3): Attention might play a key role in the hidden-zero effect in risky decision-making, which would be reflected by the increased model performance by accommodating eye-movement data that track the trial-by-trial attention feature. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Materials and procedure</head><p>Participants were instructed to fill in a paper-based questionnaire that comprised 70 pairs of hypothetical risky choices (with 64 experimental pairs). Each experimental pair included one certain option (e.g., 100% probability of receiving CNY 98, outcome value range: CNY 90-99) and one risky option (e.g., 27% probability of receiving CNY 369, outcome value range: CNY 105-1,828). The probability of the risky option was either low (5%-30%) or high (70%-95%). Both options in each pair had approximately equivalent EVs (EV difference range: 0-5.5).</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to either the hidden-zero (n=74) or the explicit-zero (n=63) conditions. In the hidden-zero condition, both options had only one outcome (e.g., CNY and CNY 369); thereafter, neglecting the zero outcomes in risky choices is as in classical risky choice tasks. In the explicit-zero condition, both options had two outcomes: one outcome was the same as in the hidden-zero condition, and the other explicitly presented the former's corresponding zero outcomes (e.g., 27% probability of receiving CNY 369 and 73% probability of receiving CNY 0; see Appendix for more details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Model fitting and model selection</head><p>We adopted the "hBayesDM" package <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn, Haines, &amp; Zhang, 2017)</ref> to fit all aforementioned candidate models using the Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis (HBA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gelman et al., 2014)</ref>, which uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme to perform full Bayesian inference and obtain the actual posterior distribution.</p><p>We employed HBA rather than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) because HBA could account for population-level generality and individual difference and provide a much more stable and accurate estimate compared with MLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahn, Krawitz, Kim, Busemeyer, &amp; Brown, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>By following the approach in "hBayesDM" package, we applied weakly informative priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gelman et al., 2014</ref>) and assumed the individual-level θ (denoting a generic parameter) was drawn from a group-level normal distribution: θ ~ Normal (μθ, σθ). In HBA, all group-level parameters and individual-level parameters are simultaneously estimated through the Bayes rule by incorporating behavioral data. We fit each candidate model with four independent MCMC chains using 1,000 iterations after 1,000 iterations for the initial algorithm warmup per chain, which resulted in 4,000 valid posterior samples. Convergence of the MCMC chains was assessed visually (from the trace plot) and through the Gelman-Rubin R-hat Statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gelman &amp; Rubin, 1992)</ref>. R-hat values of all parameters are close to 1.0 (at most, smaller than 1.1, in this study), which indicates adequate convergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKING</head><p>To compare the effectiveness of the attentional bias in the hidden-zero and the explicit-zero conditions, we tested two RA model variants (RA and aRA) as candidate models for the hidden-zero condition and two RA-pλ model variants (RA-pλ and aRA-pλ) as candidate models for the explicit-zero condition.</p><p>For model comparison, we computed the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) score per candidate model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Vehtari, Gelman, &amp; Gabry, 2017)</ref>. The WAIC score provides an estimation of out-of-sample predictive accuracy in a fully Bayesian manner and is more reliable than the traditional point-estimate information criterion (e.g., AIC). A lower WAIC score indicates a better out-of-sample prediction accuracy of the candidate model. A difference score of 10 on the information criterion scale is considered decisive <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2004)</ref>. Therefore, we selected the model with the lowest WAIC as the winning model for subsequent analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Results</head><p>Sixteen option pairs (0.19%) were excluded for the analysis of Study1 because of null response, resulting in 8,615 valid responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Choice preference</head><p>We calculated the proportion of choosing certain options as the dependent variable and used binary logistic regression implemented in a generalized linear mixed model to predict participants' choices. We took the condition (hidden-/explicitzero) and the probability of the risky option and their interaction as fixed effects predictors, and Subject ID as the random effects <ref type="table">(Table A1</ref>). The effect of condition was significant (β = -.93, p &lt; .001, odds ratio = .39, 95% CI = [ .29, .54], <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref>), indicating that the presentation of zero outcome negatively predicted individuals' preference for a certain option. These results suggest that presenting the zero outcome prompted individuals to decide more on risky options, despite that both options were approximately equivalent.

All the participants had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision and signed consent forms prior to the study. One participant was excluded from the analyses because of an incomplete eye-movement recording, thus, the final sample was 59 participants for the remaining analyses. Each participant was paid CNY 50 in cash for participation. To incentivize participants, they were endowed an additional amount as per their actual choices in one randomly selected trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Apparatus</head><p>Eye movements were monitored with an EyeLink 1000 Eye-tracker (SR Research, Canada), with the eye position sampled at 1000 Hz. Displays were presented on a 19-inch CRT monitor running at a refresh rate of 75 Hz with a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels. To minimize head motion, a chin rest located 60 cm away from the monitor was used. Viewed from this distance, the screen subtended a visual angle of 28° horizontally and 21° vertically. The eye-tracker was calibrated using a 9-point calibration procedure. A drift correction (operated by the experimenter) was performed before each trial. Participants' responses were recorded by logging button presses on the keyboard.</p></div>

To assure the display equivalence to the option pairs of the explicit zero condition, we used an "X" sign as placeholders for the zero outcomes (of the certain options and risky options) in the hidden-zero condition (e.g., X% for CNY X, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 3</ref>).</p><p>In each condition, the decision task comprised four 24-trial (1/3 were fillers) blocks, with the presentation mode counterbalanced across the blocks.

The experimental trials were approximately or exactly equal across different blocks. In addition, to ensure that participants could not perceive or identify more than one attribute at once without making an eye movement <ref type="bibr">(Rayner, 2009)</ref>, any two of the eight attributes (4 payoffs + 4 probabilities) in a single stimulus lay in the periphery (out of the central 5° of vision).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.1">candidate models</head><p>To compare the models with or without eye-movement data, we first fit the same models that were described in Study 1 to participants' choice data in the hidden-zero (M11 and M12) and explicit-zero (M21 and M22) conditions, respectively. Given the unique features of the eye-movement data, where a trial-wise trace process was precisely measured, we incorporated the three aforementioned SB scores into the computational models for both conditions to examine whether attention played a mechanistic role in the hidden-zero effect. Hence, we tested six models each for the hidden-zero condition (M11-M16) and the explicit-zero condition (M21-M26). Both sets of models (for both conditions) started with the base model (M11/M21), that is, the RA model or the RA-pλ model, respectively. M12/M22 included a simple descriptive attentional bias (denoted as β0, as in Study 1). On top of that, M13-M16</p><p>(and M23-M26) incorporated different SB scores derived from eye-movement data, namely, SBoption, SBzero_outcome, SBnon-zero_outcome, and SBzero_outcome+SBnon-zero_outcome (denoted as SBzero_outcome_none_zero_outcome thereafter), respectively. Given that we could formally test the effect size and contributions of each SB score, the newly constructed models thus provided stronger process implication than the pure attentional bias models (aRA and aRA-pλ, subsection 2.1.3) alone. By selecting the winning model, we could also examine which SB score contributed to the altered cognitive processes;</p><p>hence, the consequent choice preference.</p><p>Model estimation and model comparison procedures remained the same as in Study 1 (subsection 2.2.2) except that we reconstructed the attentional bias by including SB scores in the Softmax function (Eq. 4). Because the SB scores entailed specific attentional features, the newly constructed bias term suggested an empirical attentional bias (relative to the descriptive attentional bias in Study 1). Notably, regarding the principle of parsimony, we included only SB scores that had significant results in the previous analysis in the subsequent computational modeling analysis <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table A3</ref>).</p></div>

Strikingly, accommodating eye-movement attentional SB (i.e., SB scores;</p><p>M13-M16/M23-M26) further enhanced model performance in both conditions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">General Discussion</head><p>We investigated the hidden-zero effect in risky decision-making and developed an attentional risk aversion (aRA) model to examine its process mechanism by combining hierarchical Bayesian modeling and eye-tracking. In Study 1, we verified the presence of the hidden-zero effect and observed that when presenting the zero outcomes for a risky choice, individuals' choice preference toward certain options could be eliminated, namely, the certainty effect, and preference could be shifted by a This finding identified the existence of the hidden-zero effect in risky choice, which is in consensus with previous results of zero outcomes in risky and intertemporal choice fields. Our results were consistent with Zhang and Slovic (2019),</p><p>who reported a zero effect in the loss frame, that is, presenting a zero outcome pushes individuals to choose based on the EV of options; except that in our study, the zero effect is in the gain frame. Our results were consistent with those in intertemporal choice, given that the SS option and LL option in intertemporal choice correspond to a certain option and a risky option in risky choice, respectively. Presenting zero outcomes decreases participates' willingness to choose impatient choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Magen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Read et al., 2016)</ref>. However, our results slightly differ from the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kühberger and Tanner (2010)</ref>, that is, eliminating the zero component increased the choice proportion of a risky option. This difference may have been caused by the range of risky levels. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kühberger and Tanner (2010)</ref>, their risky levels were limited to 1/3; in our study, we systematically set a relatively larger range of risky levels, from 5% to 95%.</p><p>We further identified the possible boundary conditions of the hidden-zero effect in risky choices, that is, the size of the hidden-zero effect might be shaped together by the risky level and dispositional risk preference. One major difference between Study 1 and Study 2 is that the hidden-zero effect is relatively stronger at the higher risky level than that at the lower risky level in Study 2. Given that the risky level was quite HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKING close in the two studies, one possible reason is the participants in Study were relatively risk avoidant compared with those in Study 1. The participants in Study 2 choose more risky avoidance choices (between 13% and 37% across all conditions) than in Study 1, and their PRS scores were lower than 5 points (out of 9 points, M = 3.29, t = -12.67, p &lt; .001). Moreover, in Study 2, participants were paid based on their actual choices during the eye-tracking experiment, which may have led to a higher tendency for risk avoidance. Therefore, we could infer that the hidden-zero effect is more likely to be observed at a higher risky level and within populations that are more risk avoidant. This inference might indicate that it is a unidirectional effect, that is, decreasing the level of risk avoidance, not increasing risk approaching.</p><p>In addition, the core of our cognitive models is derived from PT. We demonstrated adaptiveness and generalizability of the PT model family and that the PT model family can account for a large range of risky decision-making paradigms.</p><p>Notably, although these finding may challenge EU-based models, we did not invalidate PT in general, but rather, indicated that these models have an applicable boundary condition, that is, they are not applicable to conditions when zero outcomes are explicitly presented.</p><p>In summary, our results implied that the zero component should not be neglected in research on risky decision-making. Despite the numerical value of zero outcomes being void, it nonetheless affects choice preference by changing the information processing of decision-making.</p></div>

This attempt provided a potentially richer and more powerful path compared with traditional behavioral-based models. The literature on cognitive modeling had mainly fit to behavioral data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chávez, Villalobos, Baroja, &amp; Bouzas, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dai, Pleskac, &amp; Pachur, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wulff &amp; van den Bos, 2017)</ref> or used single/multiple eye-movement features to predict behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Krajbich, Armel, &amp; Rangel, 2010)</ref>. These practices could explain the behavioral effect at large but did not consider the combined power across modalities, for instance, when eye movement was recorded alongside behaviors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Contributions and implications</head><p>Our research set a relatively large range of risky levels to systematically examine the hidden-zero effect in risky choice and proposed attention as its underlying cognitive mechanism. Theoretically, our aRA model offers a more integrative computation account to understand the role of hidden-zero outcome in risky decisionmaking. These findings compensate for the lack of zero components in classic decision models that take zero outcomes as irrational components. Additionally, we extend the boundary of fuzzy-trace theory beyond the framing effect in a larger range of risky levels.</p><p>Our findings also supply a potential means to manipulate an individual's preferences in risky settings. Given that the attentional bias may shift an individual's choice preference in risky decision-making depending on whether zero outcomes are presented, the hidden-zero effect could be used as a cheap but effective behavior nudge to encourage high-risk decisions. For example, delivering potential void outcomes may promote risk-taking, for instance, when opening new markets and adopting new production methods to improve enterprise innovation decisions.</p><p>Computationally, our attentional RA model accommodates process features to disentangle the potential role of attentional bias in the computational processes underlying the hidden-zero effect. Our process models make predictions based on observed information (e.g., choice and outcome) and the information of the latent underlying processes (e.g., attention). These advantages make process models superior for explaining the underlying behavioral effects and quantitatively evaluating the candidate models based on their psychological implications. This model fitting framework may provide new insights into future decision-making modeling.</p></div>

Finally, following the same procedure in Study 1, we tested whether the winning model was able to recapitulate individuals' behavioral pattern. By comparing posterior model predictions with the actual choices, we demonstrated that models integrating SBzero_outcome and SBnon _zero_outcome (in hidden-zero condition, M16; in explicit-zero condition, M26) indeed well captured participants' choice preference (seeFig. 5C/F).</figDesc></figure>

In Study 2, with the effect of individual differences of risk avoidance traits controlled, we observed that when explicitly presenting zero outcomes led choice preference and attention toward risky options. Computationally, while evolving empirical attentional bias (i.e., SB scores) to zero as well as non-zero outcomes in the modeling, the model predicted the choice preference more precisely than other candidate models regardless of hidden or explicit present zero outcomes. These results suggest that an attentional bias toward outcomes alters the attentional allocation to risky and certainty options in risky decisionmaking, and presenting the zero outcomes may lead to an unmixed effect of probability aversion in risky choices.HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKING4.1. Hidden-zero effect of risky choiceOur results indicated that the zero component has indispensable consequences on individuals' risky decision-making preference and process. Although the value of zero outcomes is an absolute null event for a rational decision-maker, it entails a decreased choice proportion of a certain option by reducing the bias toward it and induces increased attention to the zero component of a risky option. This may challenge the prediction of EU-based risky choice models.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>HIDDEN-ZERO EFFECT IN RISKY DECISION-MAKINGin risky choice.Specifically, our results indicated that attention could moderate the information processing of the option attributes. In Study 2, explicitly presenting zero outcomes drew more attention to a risky option and then entailed a decreased preference for certain options. This mechanism was consistent with the new line of research that has highlighted the role of attentional bias in decision-making. The closest example is fromRead and colleagues (2016), who explained the hidden-zero effect in intertemporal choice such that individuals have an attentional bias to the zero outcome of SS option and may alter choice preference. Kreiner and his colleagues (2018) also observed that shifting the attention of the message recipient to the complementary frame would reduce or eliminate attribute-framing bias, that is, a tendency to evaluate objects framed positively (75% success) more than objects framed negatively (25% failure). Pachur and his colleagues<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pachur, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, Murphy &amp; Hertwig, 2018)</ref> connected measures of attention process to the CPT and observed that attention allocation causes choice regularities that can be captured by CPT. Compared to these studies that mainly focused on an interpretational approach, our results, by using computational modeling in both studies, consistently demonstrated the quantitative contribution of attention to predicting behavioral regularity. Specifically, at the behavioral level, model evidence assessed by WAIC suggested quantitative improvement when including the empirical attentional bias. After including eyetracking attention in the modeling (Study 2 only), this contribution of attention was manifested by a sizable decrease in the WAIC scale. Thus, our results indicated that attention played a key role in the hidden-zero effect in risky decision-making, which would be reflected by the increased model performance quantitatively and qualitatively.</figDesc></figure>

Our endeavor of considering choice preference and attentional process in model estimation might provide a method to avoid such an impasse: either be confirmed or falsified simply by using several paradoxical cognitive processes as evidence, such as fixation numbers or durations. Moreover, in comparison with the data-driven strategy in a previous model fitting, accommodating eye-movement data in the model fitting help us distinguish candidate models based on the psychological implication of the specific eye-movement index, as is the case in Study 2 (section 3).</figDesc></figure>
