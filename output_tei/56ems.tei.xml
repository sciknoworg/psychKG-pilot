			<abstract>
				<p>One critical aspect of decision-making research pertains to the use of cues and the strategies employed for making choices in real-world scenarios. This article aims to shed light on the utilization of association rule mining, a data mining method, to uncover hidden patterns of cue usage in the context of decision-making. While association rule mining is widely employed in fields such as genetics and medicine, its application in the psychology of decision-making remains largely unexplored. We begin by presenting the features of association rule mining and subsequently provide an illustrative procedure using real-world data. Finally, we offer recommendations and discuss the potential application of this tool in studying the psychology of decision-making, particularly in relation to heuristics</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Consider a research scientist who aims to identify the most frequently utilized signs and symptoms by practitioners in making diagnostic decisions regarding diseases.</p><p>The choice and relative importance attributed to each sign or symptom may vary among practitioners and contexts. Medical decision-making becomes particularly challenging when multiple relevant information cues are present. In such situations, individuals are likely to employ heuristics, which are strategies designed to facilitate quick and accurate decision-making with minimal cognitive effort. Notably, heuristics that utilize fewer cues often outperform strategies relying on a larger set of information.</p><p>Identifying a decision heuristic (also referred to as a choice algorithm, decision rule, or decision strategy; e.g., van de Kaa, 2017) can be approached through either process tracing or outcome-oriented methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Riedl, Brandstätter, Roithmayr, 2008)</ref>. The outcome-oriented approach focuses on predicting future decision outcomes, while the process-tracing approach aims to better understand the decision-making process itself. Commonly used techniques for identifying decision heuristics include eye movement analysis, information display boards, computerized process tracing, phased narrowing, active information search, and verbal protocols. However, most of these investigations are conducted in laboratory settings. In contrast, scholars in naturalistic decision-making study real-world decisions made by professionals in their respective environments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Klein, 1998)</ref>. These researchers employ qualitative techniques such as observations and interviews. This paper advocates the use of association rule mining to extract plausible decision heuristics from databases containing multiple cues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association Rules and Heuristics Identification</head><p>Heuristics in judgment entail employing a parsimonious decision strategy that considers a subset of meaningful cues from a larger set of possibilities. Interestingly, heuristic-based decisions can be computationally derived from datasets. For instance, let us consider the research scientist who constructs a database encompassing observed attributes (e.g., behavioral signs) and their associated decisions (e.g., presence or ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 4 absence of disease). Extracting informative relations from such datasets, which often include numerous variables, can be challenging when relying on typical statistical procedures. Logistic regression modeling is a commonly used method for predicting binary outcomes. However, the quality of the model's adjustment depends on the number of included parameters, and complex models are susceptible to overfitting, which can pose difficulties when generalizing to new datasets. Moreover, fully comprehensive models are unlikely to accurately predict real-world decision-making processes, as the human mind does not possess the omniscience of "Laplace's demon." It is implausible to precisely predict how one cue may compensate for another under different circumstances.</p><p>For the aforementioned reasons, modern computational methods for extracting heuristics were primarily designed to align with the "less-is-more" principle (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gigerenzer and Brighton, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 2006)</ref>. Along these lines, algorithms were developed to identify frugal solutions, specifically tailored to detect non-compensatory forms of heuristics. For example, the Fast-and-Frugal Trees (FFT) R package has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Phillips et al., 2017)</ref>. FFT enables professionals and decision modelers to obtain a finite and streamlined decision tree from datasets containing actual decisions. It facilitates final binary classifications through sequential paths composed of nodes (cue-based questions, e.g., "Is pulmonary embolism present?"), leaves (decision outcomes, e.g., "No disease" or "Disease"), and branches representing connections between nodes or nodes-to-leaves. FFT offers practical advantages, including the ability to deliver simple, ready-to-use models at lower costs, the capability to identify heuristics with robust predictive value using training and test datasets, and the simplicity and transparency that allow domain-specific experts to examine their internal plausibility and contextual relevance.</p><p>As a complementary approach to FFT, it is valuable to employ a procedure that identifies attribute-value combinations that occur more frequently. This can be achieved through association rule mining using the apriori algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agrawal and Srikant, 1994)</ref>. In other words, this algorithm allows scientists to explore the most informative ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 5 subsets of attributes. One significant advantage is that the algorithm can be applied in a supervised or unsupervised manner. The supervised approach is particularly useful as it enables the identification of meaningful cue subsets that are associated with a target variable (e.g., presence or absence of disease). Furthermore, the algorithm can be constrained to highlight attribute-value combinations that act as sufficient conditions for the target variable. For example, a rule such as Attribute1, Attribute2 → disease implies that if attributes 1 and 2 are observed together, the decision outcome is exclusively related to the presence of a disease.</p><p>Ordonnez and Zhao <ref type="formula">2011</ref> However, it is crucial to recognize that decision rules identified through association rule mining may represent plausible rules used by decision-makers, influenced not only by the decision problem but also by the decision-maker's characteristics and the social context (e.g., the need to justify a decision) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Payne, Bettman, and Johnson, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>These discovered rules can be used for continuing education of professionals whose decisions were included in the dataset. They can serve as a foundation for discussions on actual decision-making processes, aiding in a better understanding of real-world decision-making.</p><p>To summarize, implementing the association rule mining procedure can provide a descriptive overview of how people combine different attributes and how these attributes relate to decision outcomes. Metrics associated with association rule mining can ascertain that the observed attribute-value combinations serve as sufficient conditions for a decision, suggesting that specific attribute sets may have contributed to the actual decision-making process.</p><p>The subsequent sections will present the features of association rule mining and provide recommendations for selecting valuable rules. Results from real behavioral data will be presented to underscore the importance of association rule mining as a convenient methodological instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association rule mining: background</head><p>Mining association rules was popularized by the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agrawal, Imieliński, and Swami (1993)</ref>. It was initially used for extracting associative rules in customers' purchasing routines. For example, if a customer buys onions and potatoes in a supermarket, then they are more likely to buy burger meat. To introduce the basics and concepts of association rule mining, we shall consider using our initial example.</p><p>Consider a set of items I = {I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I m } and a set of transactions</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D = {t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t n }.</formula><p>A transaction t is a subset of I, t n ⊆ I. In our case, each transaction t is an observational unit incorporating the cues that have been observed or not (1 or 0) and the decision about the disease (i.e., "No disease" = 0 vs. "disease" = 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 7</head><p>The table 1 displays a short fictional data : Confidence. Exploring the most frequent itemsets is the very first step prior to estimating the significance of a rule. A second useful indicator is the confidence.</p><p>Confidence of an association rule X → Y is an indicator of the conditional frequency of the presence of Y given the presence of X in the transactions. (1/3)/(2/3) = 0.5, meaning that 50% of the transactions containing {N ausea} also contain {No Disease}. Note that a rule with a confidence level of 1 is not, by itself, a good indicator since it can be observed in only one transaction. Accordingly, the frequency at which this exact rule is observed is of pivotal importance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">conf (X → Y ) = Supp(X ∪ Y )/Supp(X).</formula><p>Lift. Support and confidence are not always enough. The data explorer might want to know to what extent the antecedent of the rule is linked to its consequent. In other words, the frequency at which the presence of the antecedent predicts the consequent.</p><p>The Lift is calculated by dividing the confidence of a rule by the unconditional frequency of the consequent (the support of the consequent).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lif t(X</head><formula xml:id="formula_2">→ Y ) = conf (X → Y )/supp(Y ) or Supp(X ∪ Y )/(Supp(X) • Supp(Y )). A lift</formula><p>value of 1 means that the antecedent and the consequent are independent, a value &gt; 1 signifies a positive correlation, and a value &lt; 1 signifies a negative correlation. It is more interesting to select the rules associated with a lift value &gt; 1 if the research scientist wants to identify the combinations of variables that are more likely to be associated with an outcome. For example, a lift higher than 1 would indicate that exhibiting a set of signs and symptoms includes the presence of a specific consequent ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 9 (Disease) more often than not exhibiting this set of signs and symptoms.</p><p>The lift of the rule {F idgety, T ense} → {Disease} = conf ({F idgety, T ense} → {Disease})/Supp({Disease}) = 1/(2/3) = 1.5, meaning that people who are tensed and behave fidgetingly are more likely to be those who get diagnosed because the transactions containing {F idgety, T ense} contain more {Disease} than the transactions that do not contain {F idgety, T ense}. As such, lift combines the diagnostic value of support and confidence and provides a first overview of a rule's interestingness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rules interestingness and statistics</head><p>There are many other measures of interestingness associated with specific procedures for selecting some of them depending on the data structure and the researcher's goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guillet and Hamilton, 2007)</ref>. There is no single measure of interestingness that is appropriate for all cases. For example, the lift is sensitive to the number of transactions in a dataset and is symmetrical regarding the relationship between the antecedent and the consequent.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Lif t(X → Y ) ≡ Lif t(Y → X).</formula><p>Conversely, another measure of interestingness called conviction is asymmetrical <ref type="bibr">(Brin, Motwani, Ullman, and Tsur, 1997)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Conviction (X → Y ) = 1 − Supp(Y )/(1 − conf (X → Y )) where conviction (X → Y ) = conviction(Y → X).</formula><p>Lift is a primary measure of rule interestingness. If the research scientist has developed a hypothesis according to which the direction of association is of pivotal importance, she could complement the inspection of a rule's interestingness with a value of conviction or use other alternatives (see for a review <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Geng and Hamilton, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Merceron and Yacef, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practice of association rule mining</head><p>Transaction data. A widely used algorithm for mining association rules is the Apriori algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal, Imieliński, and Swami, 1993)</ref>. The algorithm sequentially explores the entire database to generate frequent itemsets. Prior to executing the data mining process, there is an initial phase of data preparation. The Apriori algorithm ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 10 operates on transaction data, also known as "basket" data, which consists of qualitative attributes. If the nonverbal behavior scientist is interested in including continuous variables in the analysis, she may consider converting them into ordinal categories. For instance, the age variable can be divided into nominal categories (e.g., adolescent, middle-aged, senior, old) (as shown in an example by <ref type="bibr">Hahsler, Grun, and Hornik, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Each transaction represents a vector of items, and the lengths of these vectors can vary across transactions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> provides an illustration of transaction data 3. Rank the rules by support, with the top-ranked rules being those that are most frequently observed in the set of transactions.</p><p>Case study : nonverbal behaviors screening of passengers at airport</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context</head><p>Within two french airports, a program is currently implemented aiming at detection people who might pose a threat to aviation security. The program is based on the detection of atypcal signs of behavior displayed by passengers. The observation of passengers may result in a selection for a resolution conversation. During the observation phase, the agents are required to list nonverbal behaviors in a "referral report" on the basis of a standardized checklist. Within this referral report, it is specified whether a selected passenger was finally handed over to the airport law enforcement authorities or not.</p><p>Our objective was aimed at studying security agents' decision-making patterns in relation to the reported nonverbal behaviors. More specifically, it was aimed at finding whether a type of decision of selection (referring to the authorities or not) was related to a meaningful set of nonverbal behaviors. The data processing was primarily guided by a descriptive approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Data. Between 2013 and 2015, 784 referral reports were filled out after casual conversations with airport passengers. The referral reports have been filled out by 40 agents trained to behaviorally detect suspicious signs. Out of these 784 transactions, 154</p><p>included an intervention of the authorities. This procedure was not initially designed for scientific research but for constructing statistical records about detection activity.</p><p>Procedure. An algorithm designed to extract the behaviors from the referral reports was executed prior to obtain the transaction data. For launching the analysis,</p><p>Arules <ref type="bibr">(Hahsler, Grun, Hornik, 2005)</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IT=involuntary twitch</head><p>The table displays the top-ranked rules, which have a lift value higher than 1.</p><p>These rules maintain their position due to consistent confidence levels and support for the consequent. The first rule has a support of 0.49, indicating that these behaviors were influential in the initial selection of passengers in 39 transactions. Considering the overall results, it can be inferred that the selection process was more strongly influenced by such behavioral attributesre lated to stress and nervousness.</p><p>{authorities involved = Yes}. The second computation involved the positive side of the consequent. As for the first computation, we get our rules pruned and the ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 13 results yielded a total of 316 rules. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> displays the rules ranked by support. The results indicate that the top-ranked rules have a low level of support. The most frequent rule is observed in only 5 cases. However, these rules are more significant in terms of their length and have higher lift values. The higher lift values are due to a lower proportion of transactions containing the positive consequent relative to the total number of transactions. A striking observation is that there are qualitative differences in the antecedent compared to the previous results. It appears that decisions to refer to the authorities are most frequently associated with passengers' gazing behaviors, fear, and aggressive conduct. In general, anxiety states are linked to negative decisions, while more fearful and/or aggressive states are linked to positive decisions. Based on this data, we can reasonably interpret that different heuristics are at play in specific types of decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present paper aims to introduce experimental psychologists to a convenient tool for identifying decision rules in a dataset. Association rule mining, beyond its ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 14 application in supermarket management, is used in various scientific domains. For example, it is utilized in bioinformatics to mine gene expression datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Creighton and Hanash, 2003)</ref> and in medicine to relate medical procedures with diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Doddi, Marathe, Ravi, Torney, 2001</ref>), among others.</p><p>The set of results obtained from association rule mining can serve as preliminary evidence and provide a good foundation for hypothesis testing. However, it is important to note that association rules cannot be used as a basis for inferring causation. While many trivial associations can be filtered through pruning, researchers need to make sense of the interesting combinations they obtain.</p><p>On a related note, scholars have developed compelling methods for coding behaviors in various areas such as facial behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ekman and Friesen, 1978)</ref>, vocal behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Juslin and Scherer, 2005)</ref>, Proxemics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hall, 1963)</ref>, gaze behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Argyle and Cook, 1976)</ref>, and Kinesics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ekman and Friesen, 1969)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers can take advantage of these existing techniques in conjunction with observer software (e.g., Observer XT) to develop their coding scheme. Association rule mining can be particularly useful as behavioral cues can now be extracted automatically (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Frauendorfer et al., 2014)</ref>, allowing for the collection of large amounts of data and the discovery of interesting rules. Additionally, integrating additional data such as verbal content, facial action units, and cardiovascular measurements provides a deeper understanding of behavior pattern analysis. Therefore, association rule mining is a suitable approach for scientists seeking to evaluate behavioral units in a systematic and comprehensive manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific case of dyadic or group interaction studies</head><p>The usage of association rule mining is not limited to the analysis of intrapersonal behavior. Transaction data can be prepared for analyzing dyadic or group interactions.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guillame-Bert and Crowley, 2011)</ref>, has been used by educational data scientists to predict the impact of tasks, nonverbal behaviors, and social conversational strategies on interpersonal rapport building between tutors and tutees during learning sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Madaio et al., 2017)</ref>. Rapport scores were determined by independent raters based on 30-second video slices out of 60 hours of video. This approach allows for the temporal localization of units (events), facilitating sequential analysis in predicting specific outcomes. The Titarl algorithm, for instance, enables the derivation of rules like: If there is an event of the Tutee's "knowledge telling" at time t and an event of the Tutor's use of "praise" at time <ref type="bibr">[-57 to -15]</ref>, then there is a 100 % chance of the event {Rapport = 6} occurring at time [0 to 60]. Exploring rules that predict outcomes from temporally located behavioral units provides a refined understanding of interaction dynamics in dyadic and group contexts using multiple sources of videotaped interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performing group comparisons</head><p>In most cases, experimental scientists test hypotheses using between-subject designs. In the case we have presented, we treated security agents as a single group.</p><p>However, when aiming to mine rules for hypothesis testing, it is important to investigate whether there are differences in support for common consequents. In this regard, utilizing an algorithm called contrast set mining rules is more appropriate (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bay and Pazzani, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bay and Pazzani, 2001)</ref> An exact rule is worth analyzing if it has a high lift value. A higher lift indicates a stronger link between the antecedent and the consequent, suggesting that a specific segment of decision cues (the antecedent) is highly important for reaching a particular decision. Consequently, the involvement of this cue segment in the decision-making process cannot be considered insignificant. Similarly, if subject matter experts identify a rule as a potential decision-making bias, it should be taken into consideration.</p><p>In the introduction, it was mentioned that the association rules procedure can serve as a useful prerequisite for identifying heuristics. Interestingly, the association rule method allows for the combination of cues, which aligns with the notion that decision-makers often utilize additional information beyond single-cue heuristics, as observed in recognition or take-the-best heuristics. Therefore, this procedure can contribute to the development of domain-specific heuristics that accurately describe decision-maker behavior. While informative associations can be discovered, it is important to note that other peripheral factors not directly related to the cues, such as the context or communication, may also have an influence. Thus, transaction data can be enriched with new information to further enhance the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>We have seen that exploiting association rule mining data could provide insightful contribution into the analysis of indicators from the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and collective point of view. Association rule mining dovetails with the combinatorial and dynamic nature of decision-making cues. There are many variants of association rule algorithms that would satisfy specific research needs as seen above. The arules R package could be used in association with arulesViz .</p><p>The package arulesViz has been specifically designed to explore through various plotting methods frequent itemsets and rules as a function of the measures of interestingness.</p></div>

Decision trees, as mentioned earlier, establish a sequential relationship where only one attribute is connected to a decision, while association rules can have multiple attributes associated with the decision. Additionally, the hierarchical nature of decision trees assigns varying degrees of importance to different cues. For example, in FFT data from Phillips (2017), thallium scintigraphy results have higher diagnostic value than chest pain in diagnosing a heart attack. Conversely, association rule outputs yield subsets of cues associated with outcomes without specifying an order of importance among them. Notably, the differences in algorithmic functioning between decision trees and association rules have differential consequences. Association rule outputs can provide abundant solutions, which may contain spurious associations and redundancies. Fortunately, procedures have been designed to mitigate these shortcomings. Decision tree algorithms recursively partition the data and may overlook interesting rules discovered through association rule mining. In essence, there are circumstances where FFT algorithms are preferable over association rules, and vice versa. If the goal is to obtain a quick, ready-to-use decision model with prescriptive value, decision tree algorithms are advantageous. On the other hand, if the aim is to explore interesting patterns with informative value, particularly in datasets with numerous observations and attribute values, association rule mining is more suitable.

Arules is the implementation of the ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 12 apriori algorithm in R. The parameter was constrained so as the confidence equal 1 in order to extract only exact rules and a minimum support threshold of 0.002 in order to have at least two observations of the rule among the 784 reports. Two analyses were computed, one for {authorities involved = Yes} and one for {authorities involved = No}. We fixed a minimum length of 2. The program included a maximum of 120 nonverbal behaviors in the checklist but the longest transaction in D comprised only 14 items. The results were sorted as a function of the support into decreasing order.Results{authorities involved = No}. The first computation was concerned with the negative consequent. After having pruned the redundancies, the output indicated that 1447 rules were found. Afterwards, we ranked the rules by support. The top-ranked rules are displayed in table 3.

The algorithm (i) defines distinct groups as the antecedent for example {SEX = Female} and {SEX = Male}, (ii) finds combinations of attributes-values that are common across groups, which are named contrast sets (i.e., Age = Young ∧ Authorities involved = Yes ∧ Fidgety) and (iii) provides the support for the contrast sets in each category. The idea is that the support of the conditional frequency for males (Age = Young ∧ Authorities involved = Yes ∧ Fidgety | {SEX = Male}) is different of the support of the same conditional frequency for females (Age = Young ∧ Authorities involved = Yes ∧ Fidgety | {SEX = Female}) for a predefined minimum support difference δ. The hypothesis testing of differences between groups ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 16 regarding contrast sets could be done with χ 2 statistics using a contingency table (including ¬ { Age = Young ∧ Authorities involved = Yes ∧ Fidgety}). The analysis of group differences with long contrast sets outperforms classical pairwise comparisons.Capitalizing on rule-based heuristics to facilitate human decision processRule-based decision routines should be brought to the attention of decision-makers themselves, as they are in the best position to interpret the results and assess their alignment with common practices. By examining the results, decision-makers can gain insights into underlying aspects of decision-making that they may have been unaware of. This process can lead to improved performance and learning by eliminating unnecessary elements from decision habits and focusing on fewer predictive indicators.</figDesc></figure>

For this reason, metrics have been designed to extract the most frequent itemsets and the most informative rules. In the next step, we introduce these metrics based on the above fictional data. Support, confidence, and lift are deemed the basic metrics to examine rule interestingness.Support. Since a rule derives from an itemset, it makes sense that the first thing a data analyst wants to do is to search for the most frequent itemsets. The Support is the first indicator to be considered. The Support is the number of transactions containing the itemset out of D. For example, the support of the itemset {F idgety, T ense, Disease} = 2/3 because it is seen in the first and the second ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND DECISION MAKING 8 transaction out of three transactions, meaning that these items are simultaneously observed in two observational units only. Conversely, the itemset {F idgety, T ense, N oDisease} = 0/3 because none of these variables are displayed together.

The formal definition of a rule is X → Y , where X ⊆ D, Y ⊆ D, and X ∩ Y = ∅.X is the antecedent and Y the consequent. A rule derives from what is called an itemset, which is a segment of items in I. For example, from the itemset {F idgety, N ausea, Disease}, it is possible to derive multiple rules, such as {F idgety, N ausea → Disease} or {N ausea → F idgety, Disease}. Because rules can be bidirectional and because both the antecedent and the consequent might be composed of one or multiple items, many other combinations can be derived from the same itemset (e.g., {Disease → F idgety, N ausea}).</note></figure>
