				<p>Sports and exercise require constant on-the-fly decision-making from professional athletes and recreational exercisers alike. In the final minutes of a game, a team may for instance face the choice of sticking with their current strategy, or surprising the opponents with a new approach. Such decisions can be framed in terms of an exploration-exploitation trade-off: the need to balance exploiting a certain outcome with the potentials and risks that come with trying out something new. The explore-exploit framework has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of decision-making across fields such as cognitive science, behavioral economics, and clinical psychology. However, its potential remains largely untapped in sports and exercise psychology, where it could provide valuable insights into decision-making processes, because in sports and exercise, decisions naturally occur in dynamic, uncertain environments with fluctuating rewards and inherent costs. We propose that integrating standardized computational decision-making paradigms to formally investigate the mechanisms underlying exploration-exploitation decisions in sport contexts is a promising approach for our field. Applying these paradigms can provide novel insights into how athletes and exercisers navigate high-stakes, dynamic environments, identifying the factors that shape exploration-exploitation strategies in athletic performance. These insights might enhance training methodologies, optimize decision-making under pressure, and deepen our understanding of human adaptability in complex environments. Furthermore, studying this trade-off in elite sports presents unique opportunities for basic research, offering a setting for examining the limits of human decision-making and the generalizability of cognitive models to peak performance settings.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In sports and exercise contexts, professional athletes and recreational exercisers are constantly required to make decisions 1 . For example, imagine you decided to take up a running to lose weight. Initially, your training program has worked well but in the last two weeks you hit a plateau. Weight loss has stalled, and running feels monotonous. What are you going to do? Do you stay with the current program, hoping that the plateau is temporary, and that progress will resume? Or do you switch to another program, even though you do not know whether it will be effective and will suit you and your lifestyle? This example shows a situation where a known option no longer provides enough benefits, prompting someone to explore other options that might be more rewarding. The journey of world-class track and field athlete, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, offers a vivid example of how exploring a new option can yield higher rewards even though it might not guarantee success. From an early age, she was recognized as a prodigy, consistently defeating her opponents and accumulating numerous victories. However, her undeniable talent and success notwithstanding, McLaughlin-Levrone began to struggle as she transitioned into her professional career. Her dissatisfaction with her performance grew as she repeatedly fell short against her biggest rival at that time, world-record holder Dalilah Muhammad. Despite being one of the best in the world, she found that her existing strategies and training methods were no longer yielding the desired results. Realizing this, she decided to switch to a new coach, adjusting her training approach and training focus. However, changing coaches carries its own risks, as success is not guaranteed. Hence, this choice comes with costs. The decision to explore for other options proved to be a turning point in her career. Shortly after implementing her new training program, she won her first Olympic gold medal, set a world record and finally triumphed over Muhammad 2 . Since then, McLaughlin-Levrone has solidified her reputation as virtually unbeatable in the 400-meter hurdles competitions, proving it with a seemingly effortless gold medal victory at the 2024 Olympics, setting yet another world record <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Clearly, when faced with diminishing returns in her current approach, the decision to explore new but uncertain alternatives paid off for McLaughlin-Levrone. However, in sports, it is also common to face uncertainty about whether continuing with a familiar strategy will be effective, or one might even have to start without any clear strategy due to a lack of information: Here, initial exploration is necessary to identify available options and associated rewards. Imagine, for example, you are playing tennis against a new opponent you know nothing about. Consequently, you must try different strategies to gather information and identify your opponent's strengths and weaknesses. While exploring, you notice that she struggles to defend your smashes. So, what will you do? Will you spend the entire match at the net, trying to win by relying solely on that strategy? Since smashes are physically demanding, this approach could become too effortful and fatiguing over time. Additionally, sticking to the same tactic might become boring and there is also a risk that your opponent will eventually adapt and learn how to counter your smashes. Such external and internal factors influence the rewards associated with different strategies, making the outcome unstable and hard to predict, forcing players to continuously adapt.</p><p>These are just a few examples that highlight how many decisions in sports and exercise revolve around choosing between a known action with known rewards and trying out a lesser-known option that might lead to a better outcome. Researchers refer to this type of decision-making dilemma as the explorationexploitation trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . This trade-off applies to micro decisions that are related to specific situations (e.g., choosing/changing a strategy during a Tennis match), as well as to macro decisions like choosing a particular career path or selecting a new sport as a hobby. While these decisions can all be framed within the exploration-exploitation trade-off, the examples also highlight the complexity and dynamic nature of this trade-off in sports and exercise contexts, as these situations are characterized by ever-changing rewards, uncertain environments, and choice-related costs. Across various research domains (e.g., animal research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , cognitive neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , psychiatry research <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , computer science <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , organizational management 11 ) the exploration-exploitation trade-off has been studied as a fundamental decisionmaking framework. To investigate how individuals and animals navigate this trade-off, research makes use of standardized, domain-general, computerized paradigms. When combined with computational modeling, these paradigms enable the quantification of exploration-exploitation tendencies and the mathematical specification of reward-maximizing behavior across different decision-making contexts and task configurations, thereby allowing for the assessment of decision quality. Research using these paradigms has provided valuable insights into the mechanism underlying exploration-exploitation decisions, the role of individual differences 5 , as well as the impact of situational and temporal dynamics on how individuals navigate this trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . While research on decision-making in sports and exercise is vibrant and has provided several important insights e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , the exploration-exploitation trade-off has yet to be formally studied in these contexts.</p><p>Here, we suggest that using established computational paradigms to study the explore-exploit trade-off in sports and exercise holds promise for uncovering critical features of decision-making processes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Additionally, this approach could contribute to testing and refining the boundary conditions of human decision-making theories. These findings could offer broad implications, including applications in sports-related action selection and exercise behavior. Furthermore, these insights could enhance sports performance while also advancing fundamental research in decision science (please see Box 1). Our paper is structured in three parts. First, we provide a conceptual introduction to the explorationexploitation trade-off and highlight its relevance as a key framework for understanding adaptive decisionmaking. We will then outline different computerized paradigms and computational models used to quantify exploration-exploitation tendencies. Finally, we examine the complexity of decision-making in sports by identifying individual differences, key context-dependent factors and self-regulatory demands. We discuss their potential influence on the navigation of the explore-exploit trade-off and the insights which could be gained by studying these dynamics for sports and exercise research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The exploration-exploitation trade-off</head><p>The exploration-exploitation trade-off 4 describes a broad framework which characterizes reward-based decisions between options. Specifically, the trade-off captures the constantly occurring decision of choosing a familiar option with known high rewards (e.g., a known training method, or the same tactics) or searching for new options that might offer even higher rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . In technical terms, this reflects a trade-off between exploiting known rewards and exploring new options to gain reward information, with the goal of improving future decisions and maximizing long-term rewards <ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . On the behavioral level, the trade-off is often framed as a decision between staying with the current option or switching to another Box 1: What can basic science gain from studying the exploration-exploitation trade-off in sports and high-pressure environments?</p><p>A significant body of research on the exploration-exploitation trade-off has focused on the general population or individuals with specific psychopathological conditions e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . While these studies have provided promising insights, they have largely been conducted in highly controlled lab environments. This raises questions about their applicability to real-world decision-making. In reality, decisions are often made rapidly, shaped by ever-changing external conditions and internal states <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . To consistently perform at a high level, elite athletes have to optimize their decisions, balancing risk and reward while making the right choices at the right time. They have to integrate external and internal changes and adapt dynamically to maintain peak performance. Consider Formula 1 driver Lando Norris' tire choice during a race. He is speeding towards a chicane at 300 km/h in the rain. His decision isn't just about race strategy, it affects his career, his reputation and even his safety and that of others. At this level, the cost of a poor decision is immense. Consistent with this, elite athletes have been highlighted as one of the few groups who operate in such dynamic, high-stakes environments, where split-second decisions can define success and failure and even determine life or death <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Yet, these elite athletes seem to manage these decisions remarkably well, maintaining high performance and mostly avoiding fatal consequences. This raises an intriguing question: What sets elite athletes apart from nonathletes in decision-making? Are they more risk-tolerant, more reward-sensitive? Are they better at integrating reward information and adaptively respond to changes? Or are they simply more efficient at finding the most rewarding solutions? Studying fundamental decision-making frameworks, such as the exploration-exploitation trade-off, within these high-performance settings and with elite athletes could provide valuable insights not only into the limits of human decision-making but also into the adaptive strategies that enable peak performance under pressure. one <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Imagine, for instance, a tennis player, who usually tries to stay at the baseline and plays from the back of the court, may decide to switch tactics and move to the net for volleys, aiming to score points more quickly and catch the opponent off guard. However, depending on context-dependent dynamics and ever-changing conditions (in sports, but also in other decision contexts), navigating the explorationexploitation trade-off often reflects a more complex process of learning and adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Therefore, the exploration-exploitation trade-off should not be seen as a single, binary choice but rather as a continuum, with pure exploitation and pure exploration marking the extreme ends <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Always exploring is maladaptive, as it involves constantly gathering information about different reward-options without utilizing this knowledge, thereby missing out on actually exploiting these rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . For instance, a basketball player who constantly tries different shots, without sticking to one that works, risks missing out on scoring. By focusing too much on exploring options, they settle too late and fail to exploit the successful strategies. On the other hand, always exploiting without gathering new information prevents adaptation to environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . For example, a basketball player who keeps relying on the same shooting spot even though opponents adjusted their defense, preventing them from hitting the basket. While the decision in the former example involves stopping exploration and committing to exploitation at a specific moment, the latter focuses on the possibility of shifting from exploiting an option that may no longer be as rewarding to exploring alternatives. While both decisions fall within the explorationexploitation framework, they do not reflect exactly the same trade-off, as decision context and reward configurations differ. These examples show that the exploration-exploitation framework encompasses a broad spectrum of decisions, and that the nature of the trade-off depends on the specific decision context. Consequently, different paradigms have been used trying to capture different operationalizations of the trade-off. Historically, these paradigms have been used to investigate decision-making in terms of information search, foraging, and reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Computational approaches have been applied to model simple, one-time decisions with stationary rewards and more complex decisions that mirror more real-world conditions, where environments are dynamic, and rewards evolve over time. As different paradigms might be useful for different sports and exercise related questions, we will outline these three paradigms in the following sections. For each, we will provide a sports-or exercise-related example illustrating how the paradigm can be operationalized, review the general characteristics of the paradigm, and explain how exploration-exploitation behavior is quantified within this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>From exploration to exploitation -How to choose a sport?</head><p>People frequently face decisions that involve choosing between a sequence of options <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . This often requires gathering information about these options before making a choice. For example, when choosing a new sport, a child may first explore several sports (e.g., football, swimming, tennis) to gather information on what each sport offers. However, at some point, they will switch from exploration to exploitation, selecting the sport to focus on. This transition reflects one operationalization of the explorationexploitation trade-off and is the central concept in the study of optimal stopping problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Optimal stopping problems provide a domain-general framework for understanding how individuals decide between a sequence of fixed options. A classic formal example is the Secretary Problem, in which participants have to choose the best candidate for a job after sequentially interviewing applicants <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . In this task, the value distribution of the options is completely unknown. Simply put, the recruiter does not know how good or bad the available candidates are. Through exploration, information is gathered about each candidate's value in relation to the position, allowing them to be ranked relative to others. After evaluating the current candidate, the decision-maker has to choose to either accept or reject them. Importantly, once a candidate is rejected, they cannot be revisited. The task requires a one-time decision: when to stop exploring and commit hiring a candidate, thereby shifting to exploiting rewards. This approach assumes a fixed reward for each choice and requires participants to manage the trade-off of settling too early against the possibility of finding a better option by continuing to explore. Hence, the objective of the task is to maximize the probability of stopping exploration at the option with the highest value <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . This optimal strategy can be modeled using a cutoff rule. According to this rule, individuals initially gather information by evaluating a number of options during an exploration phase. The highest value observed during this phase is set as the cutoff threshold. Thereafter, the individual selects the first option that exceeds this threshold, transitioning to exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>). A) The exemplary decision to be made is selecting a new sport. B) Participants are presented with a sequence of options, evaluated one by one, without the possibility of returning to their previous options. Each option can either be rejected or accepted. Once an option is accepted, the exploration phase ends, and the stopping threshold is set. C) The equation of the optimal stopping rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Probability of selecting the best option to maximize the chances of stopping with the highest-value choice that begins after skipping the first r options. In this equation is the total number of options, and represents the position of a given option in the sequence. The second equation shows the optimal stopping point: when is large, the change of selecting the most rewarding option is maximized by initially observing and skipping approximately the first / options, where is Euler's number (~ 2.718). D) A probability curve showing the likelihood of selecting the best option as a function of the fraction of choices considered, before selecting. The black dashed line represents the fraction of options that should initially be explored, marking the optimal stopping threshold. The blue curve represents the probability of selecting the best option when following the optimal strategy, with its peak aligning with the optimal stopping threshold. E) A comparison of individual stopping decisions with the theoretical optimal stopping threshold across multiple trials.</p><p>Crosses below the threshold would indicate underexploration, while those above would indicate overexploration.</p><p>Please note, that the figures do not represent real data, but are a conceptual demonstration of the paradigm of interest.</p><p>Because many everyday decisions can be framed as optimal stopping problems, this paradigm quickly gained popularity in psychological research <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> . However, the strict assumptions underlying the classic tasks -such as fixed rewards, unknown reward distributions, no revisiting of previous options, and framing the trade-off as a one-time binary choice -has been criticized <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . This criticism led to a surge of research applying the paradigm with less rigid assumptions e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . Research across domains has shown that people often make suboptimal decisions in these tasks, such as exploring too little or too much <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . Furthermore, reward maximizing seems to vary as a function of prior information 30 , individual differences, time horizons <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , task competition, and emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . While various sports and exercise decisions (e.g., picking a beach volleyball teammate, choosing a coach, picking specific equipment) can be framed as optimal stopping problems and studying these tasks can provide insights into the occurrence and quality of such decisions, most decisions however occur in more dynamic environments, requiring an approach to exploration-exploitation trade-offs that also includes strategic adjustments. For example, going back to the initial example of choosing a sport, an individual might initially favor football over swimming, perceiving greater rewards in the former. However, as they continue exploring and gather more information, their preferences and perceptions might shift due to environmental or internal factors, prompting them to reassess their initial choice, potentially also leading to the decision to return to swimming. Therefore, decision-making in dynamic environments rarely reflects a one-time choice. Instead, it involves repeated transitions between exploitation and exploration e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</p><p>From exploitation to exploration -When to switch to another team?</p><p>Rewards are not always fixed; as circumstances change, so does the best course of action. If the rewards associated with a strategy are not fixed but dynamic, then adaptive decision-making becomes essential e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . In sports, it is common for a strategy or action that is initially successful to yield diminishing returns over time. This shift pushes individuals to evaluate whether to persist with the current approach or adapt by exploring alternative options <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . For example, imagine being a Formula 1 (F1) driver, but not any F1 driver. You are the teammate of four-time world champion Max Verstappen (in the year 2024) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . As the "second driver" of the team, your role is to support Verstappen in winning races and score points to secure the Constructors' Championship, prioritizing team success over personal victory. While staying with Red Bull Racing offers known rewards (e.g., salary, popularity, competitive car, podiums, occasional wins), your personal success may diminish as your role focuses more on supporting Max Verstappen. Over time, perceived rewards are decreasing, may feel predictable and become less aligned with your personal goals, which might diminish the value of staying with your current team <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . Now, imagine Ferrari offers a better car, greater potential for podiums, a better team position and a higher salary. Switching teams would therefore promise initial higher rewards compared to staying. Mechanistically, as rewards from your current situation diminish, the value of exploring new opportunities increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . However, exploration comes with costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . It takes time, energy and effort to adapt to a new team. It also comes with uncertainty and risks regarding whether the anticipated rewards will even be realized <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Staying with Red Bull and the associated familiar rewards avoids these risks but incurs opportunity costs, as exploiting the current situation means forgoing potential rewards elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . Ultimately, the decision to shift from exploiting the current option to exploring a new one involves a cost-benefit analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</p><p>Probably the most prototypical example of an organism facing this cost-benefit analysis between an option with diminishing rewards and the costs of traveling to a new option is the foraging behavior of animals, where decisions are centered around searching for critical resources that are needed for survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . To study such decisions more systematically, foraging tasks have been developed. In these tasks, the agent typically navigates a patchy environment. Each patch is associated with a certain (often predictable <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> ) reward. The agent has to decide whether to remain in the current patch, and "harvest" the available rewards (i.e., exploitation) or travel to the next patch (i.e., exploration) in anticipation of replenished resources. Each patch contains limited resources, meaning that with continued exploitation, rewards gradually deplete and the benefits of staying in a patch fall to an asymptote <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Since the objective of these tasks is to maximize long-term rewards, it might be justified at some point to exit the current patch and explore a replenished one. However, travelling to the new patch incurs costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , such as travel time or effort demands. In foraging tasks, the exploration costs, the environmental richness of the patches, as well as the exploitation-associated reward rate is manipulated, affecting the opportunity costs of staying in the current patch <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> . Translated to the Formula 1 example above, exploration costs might appear as the effort and time needed to adapt to a new team. Environmental richness corresponds to the rewards that other teams might offer, such as superior cars or higher salaries, while the exploitationassociated reward rate captures how quickly the benefits of staying with Red Bull deplete.</p><p>In summary, foraging tasks involve a series of decisions about when to stop exploiting resources and when to explore new ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> . Therefore, these tasks aim to investigate the repetitive transitions from exploitation to exploration in response to decreasing rewards and exploration-associated costs. Empirical evidence suggests that, decision agents rely on the reward distributions of the available options to select an optimal point for this transition. This is typically modeled through the lens of the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> . According to the MVT, choices are guided by a threshold rule: an agent should stop exploiting the current patch and move to a new one when the immediate reward from the current patch falls below the average estimated reward available in the environment, reflecting the opportunity costs of continued exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>). In sports and exercise, shifting away from a strategy that becomes less effective is common. This pertains to major decisions like career choices or smaller, momentary ones, such as adjusting tactics when an opponent learns to counter your shots. Conceptually, these decisions closely resemble those in foraging tasks. Foraging tasks can provide insights into how individuals adapt by comparing their decisions to a modeled optimal solution. This comparison could reveal the strategies individuals use to maximize rewards and how they align with the optimal strategy for reward maximization across different sportsrelated conditions. However, many sports situations differ from typical foraging paradigms in that options are not presented sequentially but simultaneously, often characterized by high uncertainty about what will be effective in a given context. To identify a rewarding option, initial exploration is necessary. Moreover, rewards tied to different options not only deplete but also fluctuate, making it even harder to adaptively navigate the trade-off. This adds complexity to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, as it seeks to capture the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in a dynamic, ever-changing environment.</p><p>Balance exploration and exploitation -Which tires to select?</p><p>In dynamic environments, the most rewarding strategy changes as the context evolves <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . Let us return to the Formula 1 example. As a driver, you have to make strategic decisions during a race regarding tire selection. There are multiple tire compounds available: soft, medium, and hard. Each compound has different performance characteristics and durability. You need to decide which tires to use at the start of the race, and which to choose with only five laps remaining. What are you going to do if it starts to rain with just one or two laps left, but you are the race leader knowing if you going to pit, you will probably lose -a dilemma once faced by McLaren driver Lando Norris <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42</ref> . Technically, the driver faces several options with dynamic reward structures. To determine which strategy will be most effective at different time points, the rewards associated with the different approaches have to be explored to decide which strategy is likely to maximize long-term rewards. This decision involves the trade-off between exploring to reduce uncertainty and potentially improve future decisions and exploiting currently known, immediate rewards e.g., 19,43 . This trade-off is typically investigated through n-armed bandit tasks. In the restless narmed bandit task, the agent has to choose between multiple slot machines (or "arms"), each offering different rewards, with the goal of maximizing overall returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45</ref> . The reward values associated with each bandit are unknown and non-stationary, meaning they change dynamically. This dynamic environment introduces a high level of uncertainty which promotes exploration to gather information about the reward values associated with each option <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46</ref> . This information could only be obtained by selecting the respective option and observing the reward it yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> . However, the non-stationary nature of the rewards ensures that some level of uncertainty remains. On each trial, the agent faces the dilemma whether to exploit the currently known best option (which comes with opportunity costs as higher rewards could be foregone) or explore further to potentially discover a better option. Exploration aims to reduce uncertainty, while exploitation seeks to maximize immediate rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44</ref> . To maximize long-term rewards in such a dynamically changing environment, the focus shifts from a simple transition between exploration and exploitation to finding an optimal balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p><p>Solving the optimal explore-exploit balance analytically in complex paradigms is often intractable e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">47</ref> , but many approximate approaches can be used to guide one's decisions. The methods differ in which source of information they use to determine the probability to explore. One popular approach is to use the so-called softmax function, in which the highest valued choice has the highest probability to be chosen (exploitation), but other options are explored with a non-zero probability that depends on their current value estimate. In effect, softmax implements a cautious approach that combines an exploitation focus with a cost-conscious tendency to explore <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48</ref> . Another popular approach, the so-called upperconfidence-bound (UCB) rule, focuses more directly on gathering information and hence tends to explore options about which least is known, even when they have a low estimate of reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45</ref> . Finally, a purely random approach is implemented in the so-called epsilon-greedy strategy, which simply used a fixed probability to randomly explore any of the not-best options, regardless of their value or uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48</ref> . It's interesting to note that these different approximations can perform with different success depending on the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49</ref> . Broadly speaking, decision making research in humans suggests that humans flexibly adapt their use of more random or more directed exploration approaches to the current conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> (please see Box 2). As highlighted by our selection of approximation methods, modeling decisions in such dynamic contexts depend on the specific objectives that govern how exercisers or athletes balance exploration and exploitation in their decision-making ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). One important feature of the paradigms to study explore-exploit trade-offs is that they can be flexibly adapted. This this allows researchers to investigate how participants balance exploration and exploitation under varying conditions and contexts. Wilson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> for example developed a horizon task, a modified version of a n-armed bandit task, which introduces different time horizons into the decision-making dynamics. Here, participants are presented with options (e.g., tire compounds) and are shown prior outcomes (e.g., lap times) that are associated with each option. The number of choices they can make per trial varies (e.g., 1 or 6), effectively manipulating the time horizon. By changing the information provided (i.e., the number of prior lap times shown for each option) and the length of the horizon, researchers can examine whether participants tend to rely more on random (trying new options unpredictably) or directed exploration (choosing options based on expected information gain), depending on how much time (or choices) they have to optimize their choices.</p><p>Which factors could shape explore-exploit trade-offs in sports and exercise?</p><p>Across research domains, the described paradigms have been used to capture how participants navigate different types of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, providing important insights into the mechanisms underlying decision-making. Studies demonstrate that this navigation varies as a function of numerous factors, including individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51</ref> , situational contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52</ref> , temporal dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53</ref> , developmental stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54</ref> , neural activity 7 , social influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55</ref> , internal sensations <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> , and affective states <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58</ref> . In the next part of the paper, we will provide a (non-exhaustive) list of key factors that are relevant to sports and exercise settings and that have been found to matter in explore-exploit decisions.</p><p>To highlight promising research questions, we discuss the potential benefits of studying these factors in the context of decision-making in sports and exercise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual differences</head><p>Individual differences can shape how athletes perceive and respond to competitive situations, influencing the decisions they make. For example, in a simulated basketball task, Raab and Johnson found that actionoriented individuals tend to make faster and riskier decisions compared to state-oriented individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59</ref> . In a sports-independent gambling task, athletes with greater experience and higher trait emotional intelligence tended to make quicker but less risky decisions. This was possibly due to an ability to better anticipate the emotional consequences of their choices, ultimately leading to improved decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">60</ref> .</p><p>While these findings highlight the influence of trait differences on decision-making in sports-related contexts, their role in shaping the exploration-exploitation trade-off in this domain has not yet been studied. However, research suggests that individual differences may influence the effective balance of the trade-off (please see Mehlhorn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> for an overview). For example, Richner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">61</ref> conducted a study investigating the role of personality, cognitive flexibility and contextual antecedents in explorationexploitation behavior. The researchers employed a "lab-in-the-field" approach, sampling participants from the Swiss Armed Forces. Participants completed various self-report questionnaires, a battery of cognitive flexibility tasks, a lab-based four-armed bandit task, and a war simulation task. Results suggest that cognitive flexibility plays a central role in facilitating effective exploration-exploitation performance.</p><p>Specifically, it appears to mediate the positive effect of emotional stability on such performance.</p><p>Moreover, emotional stability was identified as a protective factor for cognitive flexibility, particularly in the presence of context-related negative stressors, thereby ensuring consistently good explorationexploitation outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">61</ref> . These findings suggest that trait-related individual differences play a central role in managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off, particularly in high-pressure environments. Given that sports settings, especially at the professional level, are often characterized by high stakes and negative stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">62</ref> , the impact of individual differences on exploration-exploitation tendencies is promising to investigate. This research could help identify individuals particularly skilled in managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off, which could, for example, be valuable for talent identification in sports.</p><p>Decision-making skills are rarely considered in talent identification and selection in sports, but there is a growing call for change <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">63</ref> . Incorporating theses skills could also enrich the concept of the "Athletic Intelligence Quotient (AIQ)" 64 , which consists of 10 subtests measuring cognitive abilities argued to be important in sports performance and is currently being tested for use in the drafting process in the National Football League and National Basketball Association <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65</ref> . Besides that, there may also be stable individual differences in people leaning more towards exploration or exploitation across various decisions.</p><p>Studies show that even genetic phenotypes are linked to different search strategies in a foraging task.</p><p>Struk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50</ref> found that variations in the PRKG1 gene are associated with an individual's tendency towards locomotion and assessment -self-regulation strategies that correspond to the explorationexploitation behavioral patterns observed in fruit flies. If stable traits are associated with a predisposition toward exploration or exploitation, this could also be considered in team composition, match strategy and player selection at different stages of the game to maximize performance. Research on animal behavior, such as in ant colonies, shows that a specialized distribution of "team members" focusing on either exploration or exploitation can be most effective under certain circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">66</ref> . If stable differences in explore-exploit behavior exist even in non-human animals, and assigning individuals to tasks that suit their tendencies improves performance, then it is likely that this might also be relevant to optimize human group performance. For example, different positions in soccer might demand distinct decision-making profiles, where a team's overall success could be enhanced by strategically matching athletes to positions based on their explore-exploit tendencies.</p><p>If exploration-exploitation behavior is considered a stable trait, one would expect individuals to exhibit consistent tendencies when completing the same exploration-exploitation task multiple times. These trait-based tendencies might also influence their choice of sports and decision-making patterns in competitive situations. However, sports contexts are dynamic, with constant variability due to factors such as opponents, risk levels, match significance, physical exhaustion, fatigue and effort demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">67</ref> . In such contexts, decisions are rarely static and deterministic; instead, they are often dynamic and probabilistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68</ref> . Hence, while a person's inherent tendencies might guide their decisions towards one end of the continuum, their navigation of this exploration-exploitation trade-off is also impacted by externally driven, context-dependent antecedents and internal self-regulatory demands. Whereas Richner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">61</ref> define context-dependent antecedents primarily as affective signals linked to self-regulation at different time horizons (e.g., task motivation, stress), we use that term to refer to situational dynamics, including fluctuations in opponent's behavior, changing risk levels, and the evolving physical and strategic conditions of competition. In the next part, we will explore a non-exhaustive set of factors that we deem critical to better understand the dynamics of exploration-exploitation trade-offs in sports and exercise.</p><p>These might influence decision-making in sports, where athletes are not making static, binary choices with a clear mind, but rather operate in high-pressure, ever-changing conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance Regulation Laboratory</head><p>Context-dependent antecedents</p><p>In sports, decision-making is often dictated by time constraints. Consider the closing minutes of a highstakes game: The World Cup title hangs in the balance, and only a few points separate the two teams.</p><p>Under such intense time pressure, how is the exploration-exploitation trade-off resolved? While classic exploration-exploitation tasks haven't yet been used to investigate the effects of time pressure in a way that mirrors the demands of real-world sports, related research offers valuable insights. Research, studying decision-making under uncertainty with explicit time constraints, manipulated by a countdown running out, shows that individuals tend to process information more rapidly and review less information before making a choice compared to conditions without time limits, and hence rely more on known options <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">69</ref> . In contrast, traditional exploration-exploitation research has manipulated time contexts more indirectly, often through adjustments to the anticipated time horizon in multi-armed bandit tasks. For example, by varying the number of decisions participants expect to make, studies have shown that individuals engage in more exploratory behavior when anticipating a greater number of future choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> .</p><p>This suggests that when time, or the opportunity to make decisions, is low, people tend to explore less and rely more on exploitation. These findings raise important questions about how explorationexploitation decisions dynamically change under acute, external time pressure, as seen in sports. How do decisions evolve as time runs out? Maule et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">69</ref> found that although time pressure was associated with reduced risk taking, this is not always the case. When the safer option requires more effort than the riskier one, participants tend to prefer the riskier option, even in the face of time pressure. This suggests a more nuanced trade-off between effort and risk, where time pressure is not the only determining factor.</p><p>Participants also behaved riskier under time pressure when negative consequences were expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">69</ref> . In the context of sports, a negative anticipated consequence could be the loss of an important game, or being replaced on the team. The key question then is how these temporal dynamics and the risk-taking behavior shift in response to the game score. Does the threat of losing or having a significant advantage during a match impact the navigation of exploration-exploitation tendencies? Lejarraga and Hertwig <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> found that participants explored more when faced with the risk of loss compared to when expecting a gain in a partial feedback binary choice task, providing evidence for a "loss-gain exploration asymmetry" 12 .</p><p>In the context of sports, this might mean that a player or team facing a loss is more inclined to take risks, attempting unpredictable or less familiar strategies, while a team with a comfortable lead may play it safe, sticking to established tactics.</p><p>In summary, decision-making in sports is shaped by context-dependent changes, which influences the balance between exploration and exploitation. Research suggests that individuals tend to rely more on familiar options as time runs out, though factors like anticipated effort and risk, as well as anticipated loss can further modulate these tendencies. Given athletes' expertise in high-stakes decision making, investigating how they navigate these trade-offs compared to non-athletes, while also examining the impact of dynamic changes on decision-making processes could provide valuable insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underly performance and maintenance of performance under pressure.</p><p>Sports and physical exercise are inherently demanding contexts, and context-dependent changes further intensify these demands by requiring adaptive decision-making to achieve one's goals. These high demands alter sensations and perceptions. Additionally, goals might not remain static but can evolve over time, even when external conditions stay the same. In the following, these internal changes are described in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal dynamics and self-regulatory demands</head><p>Sports and physical exercise are inherently demanding contexts, and context-dependent changes further intensify these demands by requiring adaptive decision-making to achieve one's goals. These high demands alter sensations and perceptions. Additionally, goals might not remain static but can evolve over time, even when external conditions stay the same. In the following, these internal changes are described in more detail.</p><p>Imagine a marathon runner hitting the infamous "wall" -their legs heavy, lungs burning, every step demands sheer willpower. Or a basketball player in the final minutes of a tied game, the heart is pounding, muscles aching, yet they need to make split-second decisions. In sports, these sensations and the way they are perceived shape how an athlete moves and chooses what to do next. The ability to push through these challenges comes at a cost and we can intuitively assume that, as these demands build up, they influence decision-making over the course of a match, a run, or any high-stake performance context.</p><p>Research indicates that the "current state of the individual" 5 plays an important role in navigating the exploration-exploitation trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . While much of the existing research comes from animal studies where the "current state" is defined in terms of metabolic energy expenditure e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">71</ref> , internal sensations such as boredom <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">72</ref> , effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">73</ref> , fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">74</ref> , pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">75</ref> , motivational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">76</ref> , or emotional states 77 mark central selfregulatory demands in sports and exercise and might also have an impact on exploration-exploitation tendencies.</p><p>Engaging in sports or exercise requires effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">73</ref> . Research suggests that in a decision-making task, people are more likely to take risks when the safer option demands greater effort e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">69</ref> . Since individuals tend to minimize effort and conserve energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">78</ref> , it might be interesting to examine whether high effort demands during a decision-making task could influence exploration-exploitation tendencies. When effort requirements are high, do people tend to rely more on learned, automatized behavior to reduce computational costs? <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> If so, this could provide valuable insights into training, emphasizing the importance of practicing diverse strategies that can become automated to reduce cognitive load under high-effort conditions. At the same time, having a repertoire of adaptable, highly practiced strategies may ensure that athletes can effectively respond when familiar approaches fail.</p><p>Even though it might seem counterintuitive, boredom is a common sensation in sports experienced by elite athletes but also by recreational exercisers <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">79</ref> . It often arises when training becomes monotonous, such as when movements have to be practiced ad nauseam to achieve perfection, or when the task's value is not immediately apparent, for example in training sessions where the long-term benefits of improvement or increased activity are not instantly rewarding <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">80</ref> . Boredom is understood as a signal that the current action holds low value, prompting individuals to explore alternative actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">81</ref> . In three experiments, Geana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> demonstrated that perceived boredom was higher in tasks with low informational value, and was associated with increased exploration, even at the cost of immediate, certain rewards. These findings suggest that boredom might trigger exploration as an adaptive response, even if it does not directly lead to reward maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> . This is particularly relevant to sports and exercise,</p><p>where boredom frequently occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">72</ref> . If boredom signals a low value of the current action, it may push athletes towards exploratory behavior, potentially leading to increased risk-taking or experimentation with novel strategies. While this could sometimes jeopardize performance and the chances of winning, it might also present opportunities, if managed effectively, for creative play and strategic innovation, making it an important sensation of investigation.</p><p>Another aversive sensation related to sports is the experience of pain, but enduring it can be the key to achieving rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">82</ref> . Pushing through discomfort can lead to greater rewards, but does pain prompt a shift in strategy at some point even at the cost of immediate rewards? Imagine you are deep into a run with four kilometers still to go, but you have a painful blister on your foot. How do you respond? Do you continue running as before, trying to push through, or do you try to find a motion that is less painful, even if it means running slower than usual, and potentially missing your target time. Krypotos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">75</ref> conducted three experiments in which participants chose between combinations of pain and rewards.</p><p>After a brief period of exploration, participants ultimately exploited the option associated with the least pain. Interestingly, experiencing painful stimuli also triggered renewed exploration for alternatives even at the cost of rewards. These findings highlight the complex interplay between aversive experiences like boredom, pain and adaptive decision-making, which might similarly influence athletes navigating the trade-off. From an exploration-exploitation research perspective, pain may influence how individuals balance sticking to familiar, rewarding strategies and adjusting their approach to reduce discomfort, potentially at the cost of performance or long-term goals. Understanding these dynamics can provide insights into how decision-making in terms of the trade-off adapts under physical strain.</p><p>To summarize, as the examples above show, internal sensations can influence decision-making during a game and even shape broader strategic choices. While the overarching goal in sports is often to win (or in exercise settings, to improve), these sensations can alter perceived goals over the course of a match.</p><p>The default assumption is that goals remain fixed -winning in competition or maximizing progress in training. Similarly established paradigms investigating exploration-exploitation tendencies are typically grounded in the principle of reward maximization in the sense of scoring as many points as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44</ref> , accumulating the most resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , or finding the single best option <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . However, goals and associated rewards are not always stationary, solely defined by the obvious outcome like winning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . For example, if short-term victory was the only motivator, a tennis player might stick to a consistently successful strategy, like playing at the net, as long as this approach yields high rewards. However, internal sensation, such as feelings of boredom, pain or perceived effort can introduce temporal changes in the goals (e.g., entertain the crowd, making the game end as fast as possible, alleviate boredom), ultimately influencing momentary decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Here, we introduce the exploration-exploitation trade-off -and computerized paradigms to study it -as a powerful and flexible decision-making framework to facilitate our understanding of the key factors that shape these trade-offs in sports and exercise contexts. Studying sports and exercise behavior through the lens of the explore-exploit framework can provide valuable insights into how athletes and exercisers navigate this trade-off in dynamic, high-pressure environments, helping to identify the critical components of decision-making in sports. By explicating its conceptual foundations, the paradigms that are used for testing its dimensions, and by highlighting factors that shape this trade-off, we hope to encourage fellow researchers to test the utility of explore-exploit research in physical activity and exercise research (e.g., how do people select their sports?) but also in high performance sports (e.g., talent identification, AIQ, deciding under pressure).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Overview of paradigms and related examples capturing the exploration-exploitation trade-off</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Fig 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Conceptual description of a foraging task: Structure, Analyses, and InterpretationA) The key decision participants face is determining when to switch teams to maximize overall reward. B) Participants are sequentially presented with the same decision. 1. They decide whether to stay with a team ( ) or initiate switching to a new one (⊳). 2. They choose to stay with Team A, earning substantial rewards (e.g., money, supporters, progress). 3. They stay again, but obtained rewards diminish. 4. Recognizing the declining returns, they switch to the next team. However, switching incurs costs, such as waiting time, during which no rewards can be gained. Upon joining Team B, they receive replenished rewards. This decision process repeats throughout the task.C) The Marginal Value Theorem provides an optimal exit threshold. Average reward rate ( ) is computed by taking the difference between sum of rewards ∑ collected in that team (money, supporters, progress) and the associated sum of costs ∑ (e.g., time, energy, effort) relative to the time spent with the team plus the time it takes to switch and adapt to a new team . Net reward rate is the accumulated rewards of staying with the team ∑ minus the costs ∑ , divided by the time spent with that team . Participants should switch teams when the reward rate from the current team ( ) drops below the estimated average reward rate ( ). D) Plot of exit thresholds and average reward rates. The y-axis represents the average rewards earned divided by the time spent in a decision block, while the x-axis represents the prospective rewards foregone in the current team when switching to the next team (i.e. the exit threshold in terms of expected rewards). Initially, staying longer increases rewards, but after a certain point, diminishing returns occur. The peak of the curve marks the switching point, maximizing long-term rewards. Exiting too early results in missed rewards, whereas staying too long results in lower overall gains. Crosses represent individual participants exit points<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> . The red circle highlights the optimal threshold. Please note, that the figures do not represent real data, but are a conceptual demonstration of the paradigm of interest.</figDesc></figure>

They are presented with three tire compounds, each associated with different, initially unknown, lap time outcomes. Participants start with complete uncertainty about the reward structure. After selecting a tire, they receive feedback in the form of the lap time. B) Example sequence of tire selections. In the first trial, the soft compound is chosen, resulting in a lap time of 1:20 minutes. Selecting the soft compound again leads to a slower lap time of 1:22. Switching to the medium compound results in a lap time of 1:25. The hard compound is then selected and appears faster again. C) Softmax action selection rule, used as a modelling approach for optimal choice behavior. The probability ( ) of selecting tire depends on its expected value ( ) relative to all other available options. Choices are modulated by the inverse temperature parameter , which governs the sensitivity to differences between expected rewards: higher values lead to more deterministic (exploitative) choices, while lower values increase randomness (exploration). After observing the outcome (lap time), the expected value ( ) for the chosen tire is updated according to the learning rate , which determines the extent to which prediction errors (the difference between observed and expected rewards) adjust future expectations. D) Observed vs. modeled behavior. The plot compares actual participants choices (blue dashed line) to predictions made by a softmax-based model (green line) across trials. The model assumes that participants balance exploration and exploitation based on learned outcomes. Blue crosses represent individual trial data. Differences between observed and predicted behavior may indicate that participants use strategies beyond what the softmax model captures. Please note, that the figures do not represent real data, but are a conceptual demonstration of the paradigm of interest. Paradigm variations: the horizon task</figDesc></figure>
