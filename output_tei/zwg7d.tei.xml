<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disentangling Components of Suboptimal Risky Decision Making in Affective Distress</head><p>Affective distress disorders such as anxiety and depression impact a significant proportion of the populationapproximately 298 million and 193 million people, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Santomauro et al., 2021)</ref>. Maladaptive decision-making, namely over-valuation of bad outcomes and attenuated valuations of good outcomes, has been observed in individuals with affective disorders (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Paulus &amp; Yu, 2012)</ref>. However, current understanding of value-based decision components underlying these trends remains convoluted. Some argue that maladaptive decisions are driven by an aversion to risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Charpentier et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hartley &amp; Phelps, 2012)</ref>, whereas others suggest that aversion to loss plays a more prominent role <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Xu et al., 2020)</ref>. One reason for the incongruence is that risk and loss components are rarely assessed simultaneously. Additionally, most studies of affective disorders implement case controls and clinical diagnoses, which obscures differences that exist along the heterogeneous spectrum of anxious and depressive symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Yip et al., 2023)</ref>. The present study used a novel adaptation of an established risky decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Levy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ruderman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tymula et al., 2013)</ref> to clarify differential contributions of risk and loss to value-based decision making across the spectrum of affective distress symptoms in the general population.</p><p>The way risk is conceptualized plays a role in what we understand about affective distress and decision making. Risk is classically defined in behavioral economics by assessing how individuals choose between options with known probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bach &amp; Dolan, 2012</ref>). The objective degree of risk is conceptualized as the variability between potential outcomes relative to the expected value (EV; the product of the probability and the outcome; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Markowitz, 1952)</ref>. The larger the disparity in magnitude and/or probability of potential outcomes, the riskier the option. In contrast to economic definitions, psychological assessments of risk typically concern decisions with unknown probabilities where the degree RISKY DECISION MAKING IN AFFECTIVE DISTRESS 4 of risk is linked to magnitude of and aversion to the undesirable outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Botelho et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schonberg et al., 2011)</ref>. A major challenge in reconciling these two conceptualizations is that the latter largely focuses on uncertainty regarding the probability of an undesirable outcome (including but not limited to the absence of reward or presentation of punishment), while the former focuses on the subjective perception of probabilistic outcomes in general (e.g., whether gains or losses are overweighted). Both models involve uncertainty and there is evidence linking both anxiety and depression to discomfort with uncertainty as well as sensitivity to negative outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Katz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levy &amp; Schiller, 2021)</ref>. However, the extent to which uncertainty aversion drives decision making for individuals with greater affective distress is uncleardoes it exist with respect to probability uncertainty generally or is it domain specific with respect to potential loss? The current study was designed to provide conceptual clarification by exploring whether decision differences observed in affective distress are associated with intolerance of uncertainty, sensitivity to negative outcomes, or some combination of the two.</p><p>Risk preference is typically quantified with decision-making tasks in which participants select between options that vary in the magnitude and probability of potential outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Botelho et al., 2023)</ref>. Choice behavior is generally driven by the goal of maximizing positive outcomes and minimizing negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bishop &amp; Gagne, 2018)</ref> and is informed by assessing and comparing the subjective value (i.e., subjectively adjusted EV) of available options <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rangel et al., 2008)</ref>. With relevance for anxiety and depression, clarifying the drivers of economic risk tolerance requires tasks that index probability, magnitude, and valence of potential outcomes (for conceptual reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bishop &amp; Gagne, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Paulus &amp; Yu, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>It is well known that the way that people go about making choices is influenced by external and internal states <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rangel et al., 2008)</ref>. In line with the 'risk-as-feelings' hypothesis, RISKY DECISION MAKING IN AFFECTIVE DISTRESS 5 emotional responses, rather than cognitive assessments of risk, often drives decisions involving uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Loewenstein et al., 2001)</ref>. Under this theory, uncertainty creates an internalized negative state that influences decision making despite objective factors such as probability remaining unchanged. Anxiety and depression are characterized by increased negative affect, which may exacerbate the 'risk-as-feelings' effect when faced with potential negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Phelps et al., 2014)</ref>. Elevated sensitivity to punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Katz et al., 2020)</ref> and increased intolerance of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carleton et al., 2012)</ref> likely also impact decision making, with potentially differential severity as a function of affective symptoms. However, the association between affective distress and risky decision making remain unclear. There are numerous studies examining the relationship of anxiety and depression with risky decision-making, but a primary limitation of these studies is their focus on gain outcomes, which does not allow for examining gain/loss asymmetry (valence). As a result, it is hard to differentiate between the possibility that risk aversion (i.e., discomfort with increased variance in probabilistic outcomes), loss aversion (i.e., discomfort to the possibility of loss), or some combination is driving decision making. A prior influential study including gain and loss assessments concluded individuals with anxiety exhibited increased risk aversion but not loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Charpentier et al., 2017)</ref>. However, participants in that study were required to choose between a risky prospect and a certain outcome, which assesses tolerance of risk versus no risk. In the present study, by contrast, participants decide between two probabilistic outcomes of disparate value, which is more reflective of real-life decisions and requires consideration of both the EV of and variance between available choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Holt &amp; Laury, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Wright et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>The present study aims to investigate how risk, as defined by economic theory (degree of uncertainty/variance) and psychological theory (potential of a negative outcome), RISKY DECISION MAKING IN AFFECTIVE DISTRESS 6 contributes to decision-making in individuals with affective distress symptomatology. To achieve this, we implemented a binary choice paradigm including pairs of probabilistic lotteries with gain only, loss only or mixed monetary outcomes and examined choice behavior. If behavior is driven by general discomfort with uncertainty, we would expect to observe avoidance of high variance options regardless of the lotteries' potential outcomes ( ). Alternatively, if behavior is driven by fear of undesirable outcomes/loss, we would expect gain maximization/loss minimization, meaning individuals would select gambles on the basis of having a more favorable EV ( ). Anxiety is typically associated with a preference for guaranteed or low-risk/low-reward options over high-risk/high-reward gambles <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hartley &amp; Phelps, 2012</ref>). These preferences have been observed in induced <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Raghunathan &amp; Pham, 1999)</ref>, subclinical <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Schmidt et al., 2018)</ref> and clinical anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Giorgetta et al., 2012)</ref>. However, it has been suggested that such choice behavior may be explained by the framing effect whereby risk preference of individuals with anxiety is influenced by an option being described as safer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Xu et al., 2013)</ref>. This means that anxious individuals may be motivated to select lower variance options due to the desire to avoid a negative outcome rather than wanting to minimize uncertainty. We predict that individuals with elevated affective distress will be more avoidant of uncertain outcomes in general, as per the economic conceptualization of risk, but particularly so when gambles involve loss, in accordance with the psychological theory of risk.</p></div>

The GAD7 is a 7-item scale designed to measure the core symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder per the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association [AMA], 2013). Participants reported the extent to which they experienced each symptom over a retrospective period of 2 weeks using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Previous literature has indicated a cut-off score of 10 is able to identify anxiety disorders with 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Spitzer et al., 2006)</ref>.

Participants reported how much they had been bothered by each problem over the past two weeks using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at RISKY DECISION MAKING IN AFFECTIVE DISTRESS 8 all) to 3 (nearly every day). A cut-off score of 10 has been shown to identify major depressive disorder at a sensitivity and specificity of 88% <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kroenke et al., 2001)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995).</head><p>The DASS is a 21-item scale designed to measure negative affect (depression), physiological arousal (anxiety), and general anxiety/tension (stress). Participants reported how much each statement applied to them over the past week using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (did not apply at all) to 3 (applied very much or most of the time). Internal consistency in the present study was excellent for Depression ( = .94), Anxiety ( = .90), and Stress ( = .90).</p><p>Repetitive Negative Thought Questionnaire (RNTQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Stout et al., 2022)</ref>. The RNTQ is a 22-item scale designed to measure trans-diagnostic and disorder-specific repetitive negative thought. Participants indicated how typical each statement regarding thoughts or behaviors was to them on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all typical) to 6 (extremely typical). Elevated RNTQ scores have been observed in individuals with probable anxiety and/or depressive disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Stout et al., 2022)</ref>. The RNTQ includes four subscales:</p><p>Worry, Interference, Brooding and Pessimistic Fixation. Internal consistency in the present study was excellent for all subscales (α ≥ .88).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RISKY DECISION MAKING IN AFFECTIVE DISTRESS 9</head><p>The decision under ambiguity and risk task (DART) was developed to expand on the principles of a similar task <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Levy et al., 2010)</ref>. In contrast to the previously used version,</p><p>wherein participants were only presented with one option at a time, to be compared to an option that was not visually presented (i.e., a fixed reference), the DART required participants to choose between two lotteries displayed side-by-side on each trial (which reduced memory load as compared to the original version). The choice options were displayed in the form of 'urns', filled with a mix of red and blue marbles representative of the probability of winning or losing monetary amounts displayed above each urn ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>More specifically, each visible row of marbles corresponded to approximately 10% of the contents of the urn. Gamble pairs consisted of a fixed urn that remained unchanged within a block and a variable urn that presented variations in both probability and magnitude of potential outcomes as a function of the lottery type. Participants were advised that a marble would be drawn from their selected urn. Blue marbles corresponded to positive outcomes while red marbles corresponded to negative outcomes.</p><p>Experimental Conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions reflecting lottery types distinguished by the valence of potential outcomes. In the gain-only condition, participants were presented with reward-only lotteries that could result in monetary gain but not loss. The G/L-separate condition consisted of both reward-only lotteries (G/L-reward; identical to those presented in the gain-only condition) and punishment-only lotteries (G/L-punishment), where money could be lost but not gained. The G/L-mixed condition contained mixed lotteries whereby drawing a blue marble resulted in monetary gain but drawing a red marble resulted in monetary loss.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Schematic of Risky Trials from the Decision Under Ambiguity and Risk Task</head><p>Note. Participants were instructed to select either the urn on the left or on the right. Blue marbles were always the winning ones. The fixed and variable options were presented equally often on either side of the screen for each combination of choices in a pseudo-randomized fashion. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions (Panel A) comprised of one or two lottery types as indicated by the brackets.</p><p>Panels B-D are illustrated with a variable urn with a 10% probability of winning. The fixed urn always had a 50% chance of winning (or losing) a set amount of money. In reward-only lotteries (Panel B; presented in the gain-only and G/L-separate conditions) participants could win/gain but not lose money. In punishment-only lotteries (Panel C; presented in the G/L-separate condition) which participants could lose but not win money. In mixed lotteries (Panel D; presented in the G/L-mixed condition), participants could either win or lose money.</p><p>Panel E presents an overview of potential outcomes (X denotes potential wins, Y denotes potential losses) and probabilities of variable urns for each lottery type.</p><p>The fixed urn was always a risky lottery (i.e., both the outcome amount and probability of potential outcomes were known). On half the total trials, the variable urn was also risky, with the probability of winning being equally balanced between 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. In the other half of the trials, the variable urn was an ambiguous lottery in which the potential outcomes were known but their probabilities were partially occluded (see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>). Note that this manipulation resulted in two fundamentally different forms of uncertainty. In each condition, there were two blocks of 40 risk trials and two blocks of 40 ambiguous trials for a total of 160 trials. The current study is solely focused on risk, and therefore ambiguity will not be discussed further. In the gain-only condition, we presented two blocks of 40 risky reward-only trials. The G/L-separate condition consisted of one block of 40 risky reward-only trials, one block of 40 risky punishment-only trials. In the G/L-mixed condition, two blocks of 40 risky mixed trials were presented. Within each condition, blocks were presented in a randomized order.</p><p>DART Parameters. In addition to the probabilities of the choice options, we also manipulated the potential winnings. For reward-only lotteries (presented in gain-only and G/L-separate condition) the fixed gamble constituted a 50% chance of winning +$0.50 while the variable option constituted a chance of winning the following amounts: +$0.25, +$0.50, +$0.90, +$1.70, +$3.25. For punishment-only lotteries (presented in the G/L-separate condition) the fixed gamble comprised a 50% chance of losing -$0.25, while the variable gamble could result in losing the following amounts: -$0.15, -$0.25, -$0.45, -$0.85, -$1.65.</p><p>In the G/L-mixed condition, the fixed option involved a 50% chance of winning +$0.50 and a 50% chance of losing -$0.25 while the variable gamble constituted a chance of winning or losing the following outcomes: +$0.25/-$0.15, +$0.50/-$0.25, +$0.90/-$0.45, +$1.70/-$0.85, +$3.25/-$1.65. Potential loss outcomes were half the magnitude of potential gain outcomes to account for the tendency for losses to be weighted as twice as much as equivalent gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>. This method has been employed in similar economic decision-making tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ernst et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>We counterbalanced the side on which the fixed and variable options were presented.</p><p>Presentation of the gamble pairs and selection of an urn was not limited by time. In addition to the guaranteed payment of $2.50, participants could receive a bonus ranging from $0 to $3.25 (up to an additional 130% of the guaranteed reimbursement), depending on their choices and simulated outcomes. Participants were informed that bonuses would be calculated by simulating two trials chosen at random. A random number was computed and compared to the probability of winning. If the participant won, the value was added to their total payment. If the amount was negative, no action was taken. Selecting a trial for implementation and using actual monetary payment ensured that participants treated every trial as if it were real, because they did not know which trial would be selected <ref type="bibr">(cf. Camerer &amp; Mobbs, 2017)</ref>. For participants allocated to the G/L-separate condition, one gain trial and one loss trial were simulated. The difference between the outcomes of the trials was calculated and added as a bonus if it was greater than 0. For participants allocated to the G/Lmixed or gain-only conditions, one trial was simulated, and the value of the outcome was added to their payment if it was greater than 0.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Screening</head><p>Several data cleaning procedures were applied following data collection. Based on the assumption that the questionnaires would take at least 1s to answer, and that the minimum amount of time the behavioral task could be completed in was 300 s (5 min), responses from participants who completed the study in 400 s or less were excluded. Further, an inconsistency score was calculated from DASS responses using a method analogous to the procedure employed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Conners et al. (1999)</ref>. In an independent dataset from n = 39,775 participants (OpenPsychometrics, 2019), responses for four item pairs were found to be highly correlated (r &gt; .6), indicating that the response to one question in the pair should be very similar to the response on the other question in the pair. The inconsistency index consisted of the sum of the absolute difference in responses within the item pairs. A simulation of 10000 random responses from 5000 participants each indicated that 95% of responses resulted in inconsistency scores of 5 or less (i.e., a score greater than 5 occurred only 5% of the time in random data). Accordingly, we excluded data from participants with scores exceeding this value. To examine whether participants were attentive during the risky choice task, we separately analyzed the choices in the subset of trials in which both the fixed and the variable gambles offered identical outcomes, but the probability of the variable option was less advantageous (i.e. the fixed gamble was the clear logical choice). Overall, there were six of these trials in the gain-only condition and 12 such trials in the other two conditions. The proportion of fixed gamble choices in the aforementioned trials represented a 'logic score'. Data from participants with a logic score at or below chance were excluded, consistent with decision quality analyses performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ruderman et al. (2016)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RISKY DECISION MAKING IN AFFECTIVE DISTRESS 14</head><p>As we anticipated high intercorrelations among the psychopathology variables, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the data. PCA indicated a single component (see Results), which was standardized and used in analyses to explore the influence of psychopathology on decision making (described below). Additionally, to determine whether individuals in our sample met diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression, clinical groups were created using established cut-off scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DART Performance</head><p>For the DART, we first calculated the expected value (EV) for each gamble. The EV was calculated drawing on Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref> and expected utility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1944)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ∑ = 1</formula><p>where is the probability of the outcome, and is the objective value of the outcome.</p><p>Further, we calculated the degree of risk for each option, defined as variance ( ) as per financial decision theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bossaerts, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Markowitz, 1952</ref> Model fit of the Null, Base and Psychopathology models were compared via evaluation of Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the percentage of variance explained by fixed and random effects given via pseudo 2 , calculated using the 'MuMIn' package <ref type="bibr">(Bartoń, 2022)</ref>. As lottery types were not ordinal, there was no logical reference point.</p><p>Accordingly, we identified significant effects via likelihood ratio tests and report statistics from estimated marginal means. Where there were significant main effects or interactions, we conducted post-hoc analyses. We implemented pairwise comparisons and linear trend analysis for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Where there were interactions, we used combinations of pairwise and linear contrasts, as appropriate. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to account for multiple comparisons.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>All sociodemographic data are described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Supplementary Table S1</ref>. Approximately 75% of the sample identified as Caucasian. Most of the sample (52.47%) had completed a college/university degree or higher education. Less than 25% of the sample had never been enrolled in a college course. More than 80% of the sample was employed and approximately 70% of participants earned between $25,001 and $100,000. Roughly 45% of participants were married and an additional 45% were single or had never been married. No significant differences by DART condition were found in these variables (p's ≤ .318).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychopathology Scales</head><p>We administered the GAD7, PHQ9, DASS, RNTQ and IUS. There were no differences in any of the questionnaire scales or subscales by DART condition (gain-only, G/L-separate, G/L-mixed), controlling for multiple comparisons. Descriptive statistics of questionnaires are provided in Supplemental Materials <ref type="table">(Table S2</ref>). All psychopathology questionnaires were moderately-to-highly intercorrelated (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S3</ref>). PCA with promax rotation indicated a single component that accounted for 69.31% of the variance. Inclusion of a second component accounted for an additional 9.52% of the variance, which did not meaningfully contribute to the total proportion of variance explained. As such, the single component solution was selected for analysis (see scree plot, Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure   S2</ref>). Scale loadings on the first component are provided in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S4</ref>. Given the high loading for all questionnaires, and that the contribution of depression and anxiety measures were equivalent, the component was labelled Affective Distress (AD).</p><p>Clinical cut-off scores on the GAD7, PHQ9 and DASS were used to categorize individuals as being in the range of a clinically relevant anxious or depressive disorder to assess the proportion of our sample that met criteria for clinical diagnosis. Approximately 30% of the sample was likely to have an anxiety disorder and approximately 40% of the sample was likely to have a depressive disorder (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Behavior</head><p>Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to estimate the likelihood of selecting the riskier gamble over the safer gamble. Using this method, we were able to analyze choice behavior in relation to both risk and the EV of the lotteries. In other words, we could assess participants' choices for the riskier gamble as a function of whether that choice was optimal in terms of EV. We compared the Null model (conceptually stating that no systematic effects were present), the Base model (including ∆ and the lottery types as fixed effects of interest), and the Psychopathology model (additionally including the PCAderived loadings on the affective distress factor as a main effect, as well as all possible interaction effects). Model comparisons using the AIC showed that the best-fitting model with the highest percentage of variance explained was the Psychopathology model (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S6</ref>). All main and interaction effects were significant in both the Base model and the Psychopathology model (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). We further confirmed that the interactions terms which were already present in the Base model were also significant in the Psychopathology model, and that parameter estimates were robust across these two models (see <ref type="table">Supplemental Table S7</ref>), showing that these were readily interpretable independent from psychopathology status. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DART Effects</head><p>First, we examined the general differences in participants' choices between the lottery types (gain only, G/L-mixed, G/L-reward and G/L-punishment). Because the AD model was the best fitting model, we examined marginal effects controlling for ∆ and AD, which revealed selection of the riskier gamble was least likely in G/L-punishment lotteries (M = 5.44%, SE = 0.58%), followed by G/L-mixed (M = 22.29%, SE = 1.62%), and most likely in gain-only (M = 65.57%, SE = 1.73%), and G/L-reward lotteries (M = 62.51%, SE = 1.76%).</p><p>The likelihood of selecting the riskier gamble was significantly different between each condition (all p's &lt; .001), except between gain-only and G/L-reward lotteries (p = .214).</p><p>The optimal gamble of a pair was represented by ∆ , with the magnitude of the value indicative of how strongly one gamble was favored over the other. When the riskier gamble was optimal, ∆ values were negative, while positive ∆ values indicated the safer gamble was optimal. Across all lottery types, as ∆ increased, shifting to favor the safer gamble, the log odds of selecting the riskier gamble decreased ( = -6.37, z = -34.47, p &lt; .001). The interaction effect between lottery type and ∆EV revealed that the impact of ∆EV was significantly larger for gambles with loss outcomes (G/L-mixed and G/L-punishment) than for gambles without loss outcomes (gain-only and G/L-reward; p's &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>Further, examination of the indifference points, the ∆ values at which participants were equally likely to choose safer or riskier gambles, revealed that in order to select the riskier gamble at a rate above chance, participants required the riskier gamble to be at least mildly favored when loss was possible. However, in lotteries without the potential for loss, participants were likely to select the risker gamble at a rate above chance even when the safer 0.08) was significantly lower than in conditions with reward-only lotteries (p's &lt; .001).</p><p>Additionally, there was a significant difference between the indifference points of G/Lreward (∆ = 0.27, SD = 0.12) and gain-only (∆ = 0.24, SD = 0.12) lotteries (p = .019).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Psychopathology and Interactions with the DART</head><p>With respect to the Psychopathology model, as AD increased, the odds of selecting the riskier gamble increased (β = 0.26, z = 5.22, p &lt; .001). Analyzing the interaction effect between AD and lottery type revealed that as AD increased, there was a significant increase in the odds of selecting the riskier option in G/L-mixed (β = 0.18, z = 2.00, p = .045) and</p><p>G/L-punishment lotteries (β = 0.91, z = 9.29, p &lt; .001), but not in gain-only (p = .107) or G/L-reward (p = .371) lotteries (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A)</ref>. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3B</ref>, the interaction between ∆EV and AD indicated that as AD increased, ∆EV had less impact on choice selection ( = 1.00, z = 5.75, p &lt; .001). In other words, while those with low AD showed relatively large shifts in choice preference with changes in the relative expected value, ∆EV, especially near ∆EV = 0 (where the EV of the riskier and safer gambles were equivalent),</p><p>indicating appropriate choice adjustments, those with high AD showed relatively small shifts in choice preference with changes in ∆EV, indicating poorer choice adjustments. Examination of the three-way interaction effect between ∆EV, lottery type and AD revealed that this decrease in magnitude was significant for G/L-punishment ( = 2.91, z = 8.97, p &lt; .001) and G/L-mixed ( = 0.62, z = 1.96 p = .050), but not for G/L-reward or gain-only (p's ≥ .132; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3C</ref>). This indicates that in relation to differences in AD, changes in choice preference were most sensitive to ∆EV in lotteries that included loss. . Panel A illustrates the interaction effect between AD and lottery type. A significant increase in the probability of selecting the riskier gamble was observed as AD increased in lottery types including loss outcomes (G/L-mixed and G/L-punishment) but not those without the potential for loss (gain-only and G/L-reward). Panel B demonstrates that effect of ∆ on gamble choice decreased as AD increased. Panel C displays the interaction effect between ∆ and AD by lottery type. A significant impact of Affective Distress was observed for lottery types including loss, particularly in G/L-punishment lotteries, but not those without loss outcomes. The point at which the dashed line intersects with a probabilistic curve represents the average ∆ at which participants were equally likely to choose either gamble. Shaded areas represent 95% Confidence Intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study investigated drivers of value-based decision-making under firstorder uncertainty, and examined whether psychopathology, in terms of affective distress symptoms, influenced how uncertainty and loss contributed to decision-making. We hypothesized that behavior driven by risk as defined in economic theory would result in participants avoiding riskier/high-variance gambles ( ), whereas behavior driven by risk as defined in psychological theory would result in participants avoiding negative outcomes and selecting optimal gambles as determined by EV ( ). We found evidence supporting the psychological theory of risk with choice behavior influenced more by whether an option was optimal in terms of EV rather than degree of uncertainty/variance. However, the ability of this risk framework to explain deviations by affective distress was limited. Increasing levels of affective distress showed attenuation in the extent to which optimal choice underpinned decisions. We found distinct deviations between lotteries with and without the potential for loss (i.e., punishment-only and mixed lotteries vs reward-only lotteries). In gambles without loss outcomes, individuals typically exhibited more risk tolerance with choice behavior being less reflective of gain-maximization, irrespective of individual differences in affective distress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RISKY DECISION MAKING IN AFFECTIVE DISTRESS 24</head><p>Participants generally demonstrated a preference for lower variance, safer gambles;</p><p>however, the likelihood of selecting an option corresponded with the degree to which the option was favored, suggesting that risk as defined in both economic and psychological theories contributed to gamble selection. Although selection of the riskier gamble was least likely when loss was present, gamble selection was closely governed by the EV of options with individuals being highly likely to choose the optimal choice. Such behavior is more consistent with loss minimization than avoidance of uncertainty. In contrast, in lotteries without loss outcomes, participants generally selected the riskier gamble, even when the safer option had a higher EV, indicative of a greater acceptance of uncertainty. The asymmetry in behavior between gambles with and without loss is consistent with the findings of Yechiam when loss is present <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Starcke &amp; Brand, 2012)</ref>. Interpretation of our findings is bolstered by the appraisal-tendency framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000)</ref> and the risk-as-feelings hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Loewenstein et al., 2001)</ref>. Both theories underscore the role of emotions in risk and decision-making, with appraisal-tendency-framework focusing on the effects of specific emotions and risk-as-feelings emphasizing the conflict between emotions and cognitive evaluation. Together, these theories highlight that uncertainty invokes an emotional reaction that is often at odds with, and can override, rational cognitive assessments. Our finding that non-decision-related affective distress was associated with shifts in choice behavior lends further support to the appraisal-tendency-framework hypothesis of incidental emotion, whereby emotional carryover occurs without conscious awareness of the decision maker.</p><p>With relevance to everyday life, our findings indicate a potential vulnerability for maladaptive decision making among individuals with affective distress, particularly when loss is possible. This is at odds with the theory of affect heuristics, which suggests our emotions are helpful for guiding our decisions, saving us time and effort. Our results instead indicate that, for individuals with higher levels of affective distress, incidental emotions cloud rational judgment about risk. The tendency for individuals with higher affective distress to make suboptimal decisions when faced with potential loss is critical for understanding real-life behavior. For example, base levels of affect could lead to poor investment choices and health decisions, where individuals ignore long-term risks in favor of immediate relief. In the real world, this means people under affective distress might be more prone to taking harmful risks or avoiding necessary risks, affecting their well-being, relationships, and economic stability. Underlying affect may have a potentially more persistent influence on decision making than decision-related components and may be particularly insidious when loss is possible.</p><p>Our dimension reduction of psychopathology measures resulted in one component, affective distress, that did not differentiate between anxiety and depression. This single component is congruent with the suggestion that common psychiatric disorders are characterized by an underlying General Psychopathology dimension, also referred to as the p factor, which is associated with symptom severity and functional impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Caspi et al., 2014)</ref>. More distinct patterns of behavior may have been found if comorbidity of disorders was accounted for; however, given the suggestion that concurrence of anxiety and depression RISKY DECISION MAKING IN AFFECTIVE DISTRESS 26 is more common than pure cases of each disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Preisig et al., 2001)</ref>. The use of an online, non-clinical sample resulted in access to a large sample for notable statistical power that was well suited for identification of individuals differences in symptomology and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gillan &amp; Daw, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kraemer et al., 2004)</ref>. Our findings have increased ecological validity as a result than clinically defined groupings.</p><p>Our findings should be interpreted in light of study limitations. Our gambles featured equivalent gamble outcomes across domains, but this resulted in an imbalanced range of EV and VAR values. Future research should implement standardized EV and VAR values across domains even though this may result in more variation in gamble outcomes. This approach may aid in directly comparing the contribution of risk as conceptualized by economic and psychological theories. Due to a programming error, participants allocated to the gain-only condition received half the number of trials as participants in the other conditions. They also were able to review their previous answers when making subsequent decisions. This may have led to inconsistencies in findings between the reward-only gambles. Alternatively, exposure to G/-punishment lotteries may have influenced subsequent choice behavior in G/L-reward lotteries contributing to inconsistencies with gain-only lotteries <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Schneider et al., 2016)</ref>; however, this could not be determined in the present study. Future research could investigate this further by controlling for order effects. Our examining was limited to economic choices, but it would be beneficial to expand examination of choice behavior to non-monetary domains such as social risk (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Moutoussis et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>This study advances the understanding of how affective distress influences decisionmaking under uncertainty. Using a data-driven dimension reduction approach, we uncovered variation in affective distress symptoms in the general population that were relevant for economic choice behavior. Although participants generally engaged in loss-minimizing choice, individuals with higher levels of affective distress made suboptimal decisions in the presence of loss. Our findings underscore the role of incidental emotions in shaping decisionmaking, aligning with psychological theories like the appraisal-tendency framework and the risk-as-feelings hypothesis, which highlight how emotions can override rational cognitive processes in risk assessment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc>MTurk) between 18 and 60 years old residing in the United States.
