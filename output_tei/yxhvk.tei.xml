			<abstract>
				<p>Computational theories of reinforcement learning suggest that two families of algorithm-&quot;model-based&quot; vs. &quot;model-free&quot;-tightly map onto the classic distinction between automatic and deliberate systems of control: Deliberate evaluative responses are thought to reflect model-based algorithms, which are accurate but computationally expensive, whereas automatic evaluative responses are thought to reflect model-free algorithms, which are error-prone but computationally cheap. This framework has animated research on psychological phenomena ranging from habit formation to social learning, and from moral decision-making to cognitive development. Here we propose that model-based and model-free algorithms may not be as aligned with deliberate and automatic evaluative processing as prevailing theories suggest. Across two preregistered behavioral experiments involving adult human participants (total n = 1,740), we show that modelbased algorithms shape not only deliberate but also automatic evaluations. Experiment 1 numerically replicates past findings suggesting that deliberate (but not automatic) evaluative responses are uniquely shaped by model-based algorithms but, critically, also reveals confounds that render interpretation of this evidence equivocal. Experiment 2 eliminates these confounds and reveals robust model-based contributions to automatic evaluative processing. Together, these results suggest that dominant frameworks may drastically underestimate both the ubiquity of model-based algorithms and the computational sophistication of automatic evaluative processing.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance Statement</head><p>One of the oldest and most influential views in psychology is that automatic and deliberate responses rely on qualitatively distinct algorithms. The most recent incarnation of this idea comes from computational reinforcement learning, which suggests that deliberate evaluative processing reflects accurate but computationally intensive "model-based" algorithms, whereas automatic evaluative processing reflects error-prone but computationally efficient "model-free" algorithms.</p><p>We challenge this framework by showing that model-based algorithms shape both deliberate and automatic evaluations. This discovery reveals that model-based algorithms are more pervasive, and automatic processes more computationally sophisticated, than previously thought. It also casts doubt on the dominant idea that automatic processes are inherently more error-prone than deliberate ones.</p><p>According to computational theories of reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, decision-makers rely on at least two types of algorithm to evaluate and choose between competing options. There are model-based algorithms, which use a representation of the environment's causal structure to determine which option best serves the decision-maker's current goals. Then there are model-free algorithms, which evaluate options based solely on how rewarding they have been in the past.</p><p>Model-free algorithms are computationally cheaper, but more rigid and error-prone. Their output can be changed in just two ways. The most well-known method involves choosing an option and experiencing different consequences. The other, less commonly discussed, method involves assigning an option to a new category with a different reward history <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. For example, if you learned that a wine you thought was Chardonnay was actually Riesling, your model-free evaluation of the wine would immediately shift to reflect your history with Rieslings. Beyond that, however, model-free algorithms have no means of rapid updating.</p><p>Model-based algorithms are far more flexible. They swiftly adapt to changing goals and environmental contingencies, often making them more accurate than their model-free counterparts. However, according to prevailing theories, model-based algorithms contribute only to a subset of the evaluations that guide people's decisions: those that are made deliberately rather than automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. By contrast, automatic evaluations are considered model-free.</p><p>To illustrate, imagine that when driving to refuel your car, you usually choose between two highway exits: Exit 1 and Exit 2. You prefer Exit 1 because it gets you to Gas Station 1, which almost always has the lowest prices. However, today you learned that the lowest prices are at Gas Station 2, which is located off Exit 2. Upon receiving this information, your model-based evaluations of the exits would immediately change in favor of Exit 2, whereas your model-free evaluations would remain the same. So, when deciding which exit to take, model-based algorithms would serve you best. However, leading theories suggest that to use model-based computations, you would need to evaluate the exits deliberately; if you relied on your automatic evaluations-those that spring to mind spontaneously-you would fall back on model-free computations and, in this scenario, take the suboptimal exit.</p><p>This standard portrayal of evaluative processing may need revising. We propose that model-based algorithms shape not only deliberate evaluations but automatic evaluations as well.</p><p>If this proposal is correct, then model-based algorithms are far more ubiquitous, and automatic evaluations considerably more computationally sophisticated, than previously thought.</p><p>Entrenched accounts of when and why decision-makers fail to use model-based algorithms would come under question, as would the influential view that model-based and model-free algorithms implement two distinct and competing systems of control, one automatic and the other deliberate <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</p><p>Though our hypothesis contradicts dominant theorizing, it is not entirely without support. For instance, model-based processing has been found to reduce self-reported reliance on mental effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, which could, in theory, result from model-based algorithms operating automatically.</p><p>Additionally, according to some perspectives, model-based and model-free algorithms do not compete for control over evaluative processing, as traditionally assumed, but instead collaborate in ways that could, in principle, allow model-based algorithms to shape automatic evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Still, the theoretical record overwhelmingly suggests that model-based algorithms only shape deliberate evaluative processing, and every direct test of this perspective has been interpreted as supporting it <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. First, we critically examine the evidence against our claim that model-based algorithms support automatic evaluation. Our analysis will reveal, perhaps surprisingly, that only one set of findings seriously challenges our hypothesis.</p><p>We meet this challenge by offering an alternative account of these findings, which we empirically verify. Finally, we directly support our hypothesis with experimental evidence that modelbased algorithms indeed shape automatic evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence Against Model-based Input to Automatic Evaluation</head><p>Here we present exhibits A and B in the case against model-based input to automatic evaluative processing. Exhibit A comprises work showing that model-based algorithms selectively fail when cognitive resources are constrained <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. Factors like working memory load and stress have been found to reduce or even eliminate model-based input to decision-making while leaving model-free input intact. Such findings have been taken to support two conclusions. One is that model-based algorithms demand more cognitive resources than model-free algorithms. This is not in question. The other conclusion is that model-based algorithms shape deliberate but not automatic evaluative processing. Of this, we are skeptical. The underlying assumption here is that cognitive constraints impair deliberate processes but not automatic processes. This assumption is not quite right: Cognitive constraints can selectively impair automatic processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</p><p>One of many examples comes from the Stroop task (23), the archetypical assay of automatic versus deliberate processing. In the Stroop task, the automatic process of word-reading interferes with the deliberate process of color-naming. However, working memory load can selectively impair the automatic word-reading process, eliminating the Stroop effect completely <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</p><p>The upshot: Deleterious effects of working memory load on model-based processing do not preclude model-based input to automatic evaluation. Whether a process is automatic, and whether it fails under working memory load, are separate issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. We can dismiss exhibit A.</p><p>Exhibit B poses a greater challenge. It comprises evidence from a series of studies (10) that combined classic reinforcement learning tasks with the implicit association test (IAT) (25)-a standard measure of automatic evaluations. To show how these studies might be reconciled with our hypothesis, we must describe them in some detail.</p><p>To start, participants repeatedly chose between members of two fictitious social groups:</p><p>Group A and Group B. Whenever participants chose Group A, they saw a shape-Shape A-and subsequently received points. Whenever participants chose Group B, they saw a different shape-Shape B-and subsequently lost points. Next, some participants learned that the transition structure had changed: Shape A now transitioned to losses, and Shape B to gains. This change meant that Group B would now yield gains, and Group A would now yield losses. The new contingencies between choice options and point outcomes were not experienced directlythey had to be inferred from the updated transition structure.</p><p>This type of manipulation, where a distal change in transition structure (e.g., from shapes to points) alters the value of proximal choice options (e.g., social groups), is called transition revaluation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). It is designed to dissociate model-free from model-based processing.</p><p>Model-based algorithms can immediately revaluate proximal choice options based on distal changes in transition structure, but model-free algorithms cannot. So, if model-based computations do not shape automatic evaluations, then automatic evaluations should not respond to transition revaluation. . Positive values are denoted by a star and negative value by a "no" symbol. A modelbased agent (red) uses a representation of the full transition structure to generate a preference for whichever initial state leads to its current goal. A model-free agent (blue) evaluates the initial states based on cached values from the initial learning phase, which could not be updated during the transition revaluation procedure. Accordingly, the model-free agent's evaluations are insensitive to the transition revaluation procedure as well as its motivational state. c, Model predictions for the model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) agent as a function of motivational state.  Model Predictions this learning did not affect automatic evaluations of the social groups as assessed by the IAT.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 -1 0 1 V(1) -V(2)</formula><p>IAT scores revealed an automatic preference for Group A, and the strength of this preference was unaltered by transition revaluation. A straightforward interpretation of these findings-and the one favored by the original authors-is that automatic evaluations receive no model-based input.</p><p>Here we offer a different interpretation. Recent work shows that transition revelation procedures can underestimate model-based processing, especially when participants interpret the procedure differently than intended <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>. Drawing on this work, we propose that participants interpreted the transitions from social groups to shapes as evidence of the groups' moral character. On our account, participants believed that Group A deliberately generated Shape A to confer gains, and that Group B deliberately generated Shape B to confer loses, which led participants to deem Group A morally superior to Group B <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. This inference, we suggest, persisted after transition revaluation because the transition structure was altered when neither group was present-behind their backs, so to speak-making the change appear nondiagnostic of the groups'</p><p>intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</p><p>If participants indeed considered Group A morally superior both before and after transition revaluation, the failure of transition revaluation to alter automatic evaluations is just as consistent with model-based processing as it is with model-free processing. Any plausible model of the social world would expect moral groups to yield far more value in the long run than immoral groups, producing a model-based preference for the former <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. This preference should be strong-strong enough to remain essentially unaltered by a manipulation that makes a moral group predictive of point gains and an immoral group predictive of point losses. Compared to the long-run value of moral character over immoral character, the value of meaningless points is negligible.</p><p>So, why did transition revaluation fail to alter automatic evaluations? Perhaps because automatic evaluations were based on a causal model that favors moral groups over immoral groups, and Group A was deemed morally superior before and after transition revaluation. Put another way, transition revaluations may have failed to alter automatic evaluations not because automatic evaluations lack model-based input, but because the model-based input was essentially the same across conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Project</head><p>We conducted two tests of the hypothesis that model-based algorithms shape automatic evaluations. Experiment 1 tested our alternative account of existing evidence that automatic evaluations are insensitive to transition revaluation. The results support our speculation that, in past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, transition revaluation failed to alter automatic evaluations not because automatic evaluations are model-free, but because participants drew unintended inferences about the experimental stimuli. In Experiment 2, we directly tested whether automatic evaluations reflect model-based processing using a new transition revaluation paradigm-one modified to prevent the sort of inferences that thwarted the original paradigm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>Experiment 1 replicated the transition revaluation paradigm that failed to alter automatic evaluations in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The only change was the addition of two dependent measures. One was a measure of moral judgements. We hypothesized that the group that initially predicted gains would be considered morally superior to the group that initially predicted losses, and that the strength of this effect would be unmoderated by transition revaluation.</p><p>The second addition was a self-report measure of deliberate evaluations. Since deliberate evaluations are largely model-based, we used them to test our assumption that model-based preferences in this paradigm reflect moral judgements. If our assumption is correct, deliberate evaluations should follow the same pattern as moral judgements.</p><p>The paradigm proceeded in two stages (for full details, see SI Appendix, SI Methods). In stage 1, participants learned the transition structure between two fictional social groups (Group A and Group B), two intervening stimuli (Shape A and Shape B), and two outcomes (+5 Points and -5 Points). Depending on condition, Group A was called either "Niffians" or "Laapians" (the alternative of the two names was used for Group B); Shape A was either a horizonal line or a vertical line (the alternative of the two shapes was used for Shape B). On each of 20 learning trials, participants chose one of the two social groups and then observed two transitions, the first to an intervening stimulus, and the second to an outcome. The transitions were deterministic. Group A always led to Shape A, which always led to +5 Points; Group B always led to Shape B, which always led to -5 Points. Participants were instructed to earn as many points as possible. They made their choices using the E and I keys of their keyboard; which key corresponded to which social group was randomized on each trial. Stage 1 concluded with four additional binary choices between the social groups, again aimed at earning points. Of these four choices, we used the total made in favor of Group A to assess whether participants learned the transition structure; those who had should choose Group A more often than not.    measures were collected once (at the end of the final learning phase) except for choices in the revaluation condition, which were measured twice: at the end of the final learning phase (T2) and at the end of the initial learning phrase (T1). BL = baseline learning; Reval = revaluation; n.s. = not significant; *** = P &lt; 0.001. To summarize, the current paradigm cannot rule out model-based input to automatic evaluation. Morality judgements consistently favored Group A, and were associated with a modelbased preference for Group A that was insensitive to transition revaluation. Accordingly, the failure of transition revaluation to shift automatic evaluations need not imply that automatic evaluations lack model-based input; it is just as consistent with model-based processing as it is with model-free processing. The possibility that model-based algorithms shape automatic evaluations is back in play.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model-based</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>If our hypothesis is correct, then transition revaluation should shift automatic evaluations, provided that participants refrain from drawing the sorts of character inferences documented in Experiment 1. We tested this prediction in Experiment 2. Specifically, we modified the original procedure by replacing the social groups with nonsocial stimuli to discourage attributions of mentalistic content <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3</ref>; for full details, see SI Appendix, SI Methods). The experiment proceeded as follows. To start, all participants learned that they would play a game called "Oink Fest," the goal of which was to win first prize in a pig growing contest.</p><p>To win, participants needed to help their "scrawny piglet" grow as large as possible.</p><p>The piglet was said to need one of two resources to grow: food (because it was hungry) or water (because it was thirsty). Participants learned that the piglet would grow (Outcome A) each time it received its required resource (Resource A), and that it would shrink (Outcome B) each time it received the other resource (Resource B). To deliver resources to the piglet, participants needed to activate a machine, which ran on two types of "energy sources": pinecones and seeds. Participants learned that one of the energy sources (Energy Source A) would cause the machine to dispense Resource A, and the other energy source (Energy Source B) would cause the machine to dispense Resource B. To summarize, Energy Source A (pinecones or seeds, depending on condition) transitioned to Resource A (food or water, depending on condition), which transitioned to Outcome A (grow); Energy Source B transitioned to Resource B, which transitioned to Outcome B (shrink).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants completed 20 trials of Oink Fest. On each trial, they chose between Energy</head><p>Sources A and B and observed the consequences of their choice: the machine dispensing Resource A or B followed by their piglet growing or shrinking. Participants made their choices using the E and I keys of their keyboard; which key corresponded to which energy source was randomized on each trial. After 20 trials, participants were informed that their pig got second prize.</p><p>It was then announced that participants would complete a second round of Oink Fest.</p><p>In the baseline learning condition, participants learned that the second round was identical to the first. In the motivation revaluation condition, participants learned that in the second round, they would pursue a different goal: to make their pig as small as possible, rather than as big as possible. Specifically, these participants learned that in the second round, first prize would go to the "tiniest piglet," making Energy Source B the most valuable energy source (because it would lead to Resource B, which would make the piglet shrink). Finally, in the transition revaluation condition, participants learned that the contingencies between resources (food and water) and outcomes (growing vs. shrinking) had reversed: Resource A would now lead to Outcome B and Resource B to Outcome A. This manipulation, like the motivation revaluation manipulation, reversed which energy source was most valuable from Energy Source A to Energy Source B.</p><p>In the two revaluation conditions, participants then passively observed 10 transitions from resources to outcomes. Specifically, participants in the transition revaluation condition observed the new contingencies; participants in the motivation revaluation condition observed the same contingences from the first round plus a message on each trial that communicated whether the specific outcome was desirable or not. During this phase, participants neither saw nor chose between energy sources.</p><p>Participants did not actually complete the second round of Oink Fest in any condition. Instead, they proceeded directly to the dependent measures, which included the same measures of automatic and deliberate evaluations of the proximal stimuli (pinecones vs. seeds) used in Experiment 1. The measure of morality judgments was omitted from this experiment (we assumed that pinecones and seeds were not regarded as moral agents), as was the behavioral measure of successful learning (we instead used self-report items to confirm that participants understood the transition structure and goal of each round).  . This preference was merely reduced in the two revaluation conditions, as was the deliberate preference. All results remained the same when analyses were repeated only using data from participants who passed all manipulation checks. These data unequivocally suggest that model-based algorithms shape automatic evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model-based Preferences</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>One of the most influential ideas in the psychological sciences is that behavior emerges from two types of processes: those that are automatic and those that are deliberate <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. This distinction is foundational to understanding phenomena ranging from reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref> to habit formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> to social cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>, and is thought to coincide with the algorithmic distinction between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning (2, 6). A major implication of this idea-one that has driven decades of research and theorizing-is that model-based algorithms shape deliberate evaluations, but not automatic evaluations. The present findings suggest otherwise: Model-based algorithms appear to shape both deliberate and automatic evaluations. Other influential ideas may also need revising. For instance, when a psychological phenomenon relies primarily on model-based or model-free processing, it is often assumed to be controlled or automatic, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54)</ref>. A case in point comes from research on moral behavior, where the process by which people learn to avoid harming others is thought to be primarily model-free. This finding has led to the conclusion that "[…] potentially harmful actions might be prioritized for automatic avoidance as a default" <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. However, the present work suggests that this conclusion may not be warranted-that the automaticity of a process cannot be reliably inferred from the algorithm that implements it. Similar implications extend to a range of topics where inferences about automaticity have been drawn from algorithmic insights, including the neural mechanisms of learning and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, human development <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, and clinical disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>.</p><p>The present findings also contribute to the growing body of evidence suggesting that standard reinforcement learning tasks often make human decisions appear more model-free than they really are. Participants often misconstrue these tasks in ways that make their model-based decisions seem model-free <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>. When disabused of their misconceptions, participants be- Emerging evidence supports DYNA as a theory of human reinforcement learning, pointing to offline simulation as a mechanism through which model-based algorithms might shape automatic evaluation.</p><p>However it arises, the link between model-based algorithms and automatic evaluations uncovered here sheds surprising new light on how decision-makers evaluate their options. Counterintuitive though it may seem, model-based algorithms shape not only the evaluations that decisionmakers deliberately generate, but also those that spring to mind spontaneously. The order of the two combined blocks was randomized such that some participants completed the Laapian/good (Niffian/bad) block first and the Niffian/good (Laapian/bad) block second, whereas for other participants the order was reversed. The IAT was scored using the improved scoring algorithm such that a positive score indicates a difference in favor of the initially rewarding over the initially nonrewarding group.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Participants</head><label></label><figDesc>Successfully Learned the Transition Structure. Participants successfully learned the initial contingencies between groups and outcomes (Figure 2): they systematically chose Group A at the end of stage 1, t(750) = 24.03, P &lt; 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.88, BF10 = 1.93 × 10 91 . When the contingencies changed, participants successfully updated their beliefs. After transition revaluation, participants chose Group A less than they did before transition revaluation, t(556.60) = 8.44, P &lt; 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.43, BF10 = 1.01 × 10 12 , and less than participants in the baseline learning condition, t(658.02) = 7.78, P &lt; 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.58, BF10 = 4.37 × 10 11 . Not unexpectedly, this effect was a partial one. After transition revaluation, participants still preferentially selected Group A, t(359) = 2.89, P = 0.004, Cohen's d = 0.15, BF10 = 3.58, but at a reduced rate. We return to this finding later. For now, what matters is that the transition revaluation manipulation served its purpose of shifting beliefs about the contingencies between social groups and outcomes. Did automatic evaluations change as a result? Automatic Evaluations Were Insensitive to Transition Revaluation. Replicating past work, transition revaluation had no effect on automatic evaluations (Figure 2), t(741.99) = -0.49, P = 0.621, Cohen's d = -0.04, BF01 = 10.88, which always favored Group A, t(750) = 6.33, P &lt; 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.23, BF10 = 1.12 × 10 7 . This might seem to suggest that model-based algorithms have little to no influence on automatic evaluations. However, further analyses cast doubt on this interpretation.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Input to Automatic Evaluation Cannot be Ruled Out. As we suspected, participants deemed Group A morally superior to Group B, t(734) = 2.57, P = 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.09, BF10 = 1.09 (Figure 2). The strength of this attribution was unrelated to condition, t(703.79) = 0.23, P = 0.818, Cohen's d = 0.02, BF01 = 11.81. According to our hypothesis, the belief in Group A's moral superiority produced a model-based preference for Group A that was insensitive to transition revaluation. Consistent with this idea, morality judgements had a significant, positive effect on deliberate evaluations (which are largely model-based), β = 0.62, t(730) = 21.46, P &lt; .0001. Moreover, deliberate evaluations followed the same qualitative pattern as morality judgments: They favored Group A, t(736) = 4.98, P &lt; 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.09, BF10 = 1.09, and the strength of this preference did not differ by condition, t(675.75) = -0.16, P = 0.87, Cohen's d = 0.01, BF10 = 11.99. These findings help explain why transition revaluation reduced, but did not reverse, participants' tendency to select Group A. Despite being instructed to choose the group that would lead to points, participants may have based their choices, to some extent, on their deliberate preferences and moral judgements. Exploratory analyses support this conjecture. The tendency to choose Group A was an increasing function of deliberate preferences for Group A, β = 0.09, t(735) = 2.33, P = .02, and the belief in Group A's moral superiority at the time of choice, β = 0.10, t(735) = 2.85, P = .005.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Schematics of the procedure of Experiment 2. In the initial learning phase (left panel), Stage 1 stimuli (seeds and pinecones) transitioned deterministically to Stage 2 stimuli (food and water), which transitioned deterministically to terminal outcomes (smaller pig or bigger pig). Pairings between State 1 stimuli and Stage 2 stimuli were randomized between subjects, as were pairings between Stage 2 stimuli and terminal outcomes. The goal in the learning phase was always to grow the pig as big as possible. In the transition revaluation condition (middle panel), the transitions between Stage 2 stimuli and terminal outcomes were reversed. In the motivation revaluation condition (right panel), the goal was changed. Experiment 2 also included an additional assay of model-based processing. Model-based algorithms can revaluate proximal stimuli not only in response to distal changes in transition structure, but also in response to changes in motivation(Figure 1). Therefore, in addition to a transition revaluation manipulation, we included a motivation revaluation condition, in which we that participants aimed to obtain. Both manipulations should shift automatic evaluations if automatic evaluations receive model-based input.In principle, automatic evaluations could shift in response to one manipulation but not the other. Such a result would imply that automatic evaluations are neither model-based nor modelfree, but instead emerge from an intermediate class of algorithm<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>. For instance, algorithms based on the so-called successor representation (SR) respond to motivation revaluation (making them more flexible than model-free algorithms) but not to transition revaluation (making them less flexible than model-based algorithms). However, we find no evidence of SR-based algorithms (or any other intermediate algorithm). Therefore, our discussion of this distinction ends here.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Were Successfully Manipulated. Both revaluation conditions succeeded at shifting model-based preferences as indexed by deliberate evaluations (Figure 4). Specifically, deliberate evaluations varied by condition, F(2, 962) = 37.17, P &lt; 0.0001, η 2 = 0.07, BF10 = 1.84 × 10 13 , such that they favored Energy Source A more in the baseline learning condition (M = 24.56, SD = 35.65) than in the motivation revaluation condition (M = 8.88, SD = 24.58), t(962) = 6.58, P &lt; 0.0001, and the transition revaluation condition (M = 5.77, SD = 28.49), t(962) = 8.01, P &lt; 0.0001. Deliberate evaluations did not differ across the two revaluation conditions, t(962) = 1.28, P = 0.201. In the revaluation conditions, deliberate preferences for Energy Source A were reduced, but not reversed. Across all three conditions, participants maintained a significant deliberate preference for Energy Source A, t(964) = 13.39, P &lt; 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.43, BF10 = 1.39 × 10 34 . This result could imply that deliberate evaluations were mixtures of model-based computations (making them sensitive to revaluation) and model-free computations (preventing their complete reversal); alternatively, it is possible that model-based preferences themselves did not completely reverse. Either way, Experiment 2 succeeded where Experiment 1 did not: model-based preferences were manipulated, allowing for a critical test of whether model-based algorithms shape automatic evaluations.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head>Experiment 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>showed that the evidence against model-based input to automatic evaluation is less decisive than previously thought; confounding factors preserve the possibility that automatic evaluations are model-based. Experiment 2 eliminated these factors and found clear support for model-based contributions to automatic evaluation. This discovery strains traditional accounts of when and why decision-makers err. Poor decisions are often blamed on automatic evaluative processing-a natural consequence of equating such processing with error-prone, model-free algorithms. By contesting this equivalence, the present work suggests that automatic evaluations may have surprisingly little to do with erroneous decision-making. People choose wrongly for many reasons<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>, but automatic evaluative processing may not be among the primary culprits.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_9"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>have in ways that reveal a more extensive role for model-based algorithms in decision-making than traditionally understood. In line with this idea, the present findings suggest that automatic evaluations have been incorrectly classified as purely model-free due to participants' misinterpretation of the original task design. When this misinterpretation is addressed, it becomes clear that model-based algorithms extend to automatic evaluative processing, indicating an even broader impact than previously recognized.The present results also address a longstanding mystery concerning how automatic evaluations change. While classic theories portray automatic evaluations as stable (55-57), a growing body of work suggests otherwise, showing that automatic evaluations can change completely in response to a single piece of new evidence (58-61). For example, in a paradigmatic study (58), participants read a single statement indicating that someone they believed was moral was, in fact, immoral. Automatic evaluations of the target person instantly inverted from positive to negative. This finding, and others like it (60-65), show that automatic evaluations can swiftly change. However, the algorithms underlying this flexibility have not been established. They could, in principle, be solely model-free. Learning that someone is immoral, for instance, may simply change which model-free representation is retrieved when that person is encountered. The present work supports a different conclusion: Automatic evaluations owe their flexibility in part to modelbased computations.How do model-based algorithms shape automatic evaluations in the first place? The most straightforward hypothesis is that model-based algorithms can operate automatically, and thus can directly implement automatic evaluative processing. There is, however, another possibility. Research has revealed similarities between human reinforcement learning and a computational architecture called DYNA<ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>, in which model-based algorithms play a strictly indirect role in evaluative processing<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. In DYNA, all evaluations-whether automatic or deliberate-are based solely on model-free value signals; model-based algorithms influence evaluations indirectly by shaping model-free value signals offline. Specifically, model-based algorithms are used to simulate trajectories through the environment; these trajectories are then fed into a model-free system, which computes new value signals as though the trajectories had been experienced first-hand.</figDesc></figure>

The project was granted ethical approval by the Yale University Institutional Review Board (protocol #2000029368, "Social Learning and Memory") and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Office for Protection of Research Subjects (protocol # IRB24-0118, "Measuring and shifting implicit attitudes"). Participants in both experiments provided informed consent.Open Science Practices. We report all manipulations, measures, and participant exclusions. The experiments were preregistered at https://aspredicted.org/9VB_MVJ for Experiment 1 and at https://aspredicted.org/QW4_L7D for Experiment 2. All materials, raw data (including trial-level IAT data), and analysis scripts are available for download from the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/c2zys/?view_only=3a67b821ff8c4442af96ca593a53bf97).Participants. Participants were adult volunteers recruited from the Project Implicit educational website (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/) who completed the experiments entirely online.819 participants were recruited to participate in Experiment 1; the final sample size following preregistered participant exclusions was 751 (508 women, 218 men, 13 participants of other genders, Mage = 40 years, SD = 15 years). 1,013 participants were recruited to participate in Experiment 2; the final sample size following preregistered exclusions was 989 (655 women, 299 men, 24 participants of other genders, Mage = 38 years, SD = 16 years). Further information on exclusion criteria and demographic variables is provided in SI Appendix. Analytic Strategy. Statistical analyses were performed in the R statistical computing environment (version 4.4.1) using RStudio (version 2024.04.2+764). No a priori power calculations were conducted. However, the final sample size in Experiment 1 provided adequate (0.80) power to detect a small difference of Cohen's d = 0.20 in a t test and in Experiment 2 an effect size of η 2 = 0.01 in a one-way ANOVA design with three groups. Analyses were conducted using standard linear models, with planned comparisons implemented using the emmeans package (67) and accompanying Bayes Factors calculated using the BayesFactor package (68). Dependent Measures. Following the learning phase of Experiment 1, participants first completed measures of (a) transition structure (4 items) and (b) choice (4 items), as well as (c) a standard 5-block Implicit Association Test (IAT) as a measure of automatic evaluations of the stage-1 stimuli (in the same fixed order). The transition structure and forced choice measures were structurally identical to the choice trials from the learning phase but involved no feedback. Each participant completed 4 transition structure and 4 forced choice trials following part 1 of the learning phase, and participants in the transition revaluation condition completed 4 additional trials of each kind following the revaluation manipulation. Following the IAT, participants completed two self-report measures of deliberate evaluation and four self-report measures of moral character judgements, in the same fixed order. In Experiment 2, participants completed a standard 5-block IAT as a measure of automatic evaluations of the stage-1 stimuli, followed by self-report measures of (a) deliberate evaluation (2 items) and (b) transition structure (5 items). Given the focus of the present work on automatic evaluation, the IAT was always administered first. Additional information on the dependent measures in both experiments, including the verbatim text of all items, is reported in the SI Appendix. Automatic Evaluations. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) used to measure automatic evaluations of Laapians and Niffians in both conditions of Experiment 1 consisted of five blocks. In the first block (category practice), participants made 20 speeded single categorization judgments of Laapian and Niffian stimuli. The category labels were Laapians and Niffians. The Laapian stimuli included Caalap, Feelslap, Gabeelap, Ineelap, and Maasolap; the Niffian stimuli included Ibbonif, Jabbunif, Lebbunif, Mettanif, and Oballnif. In the second block (attribute practice), participants made 20 speeded single categorization judgments of good and bad stimuli. The attribute labels were Good and Bad. The good stimuli included Love, Peace, Joy, Happy, Sweet, Glory, and Lucky; the bad stimuli included Hate, War, Devil, Bomb, Bitter, Agony, and Grief. In the third block (first combined block), participants made 40 speeded double categorization judgments on which Laapians and good stimuli were assigned to one response key and Niffians and bad stimuli were assigned to the other response key (or the opposite, depending on counterbalancing, see below). In the fourth block (second category practice), participants made 20 speeded single categorization judgments of Laapian and Niffian stimuli with the assignment to response keys reversed compared to the first block. Finally, in the fifth block (second combined block), participants made 40 speeded double categorization judgments on which the mapping of categories to attributes was reversed compared to the third block.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Stage 2 came next. What happened here depended on the condition to which participants were assigned: baseline learning or revaluation. In the baseline learning condition, participants immediately completed three dependent measures in the following order: (i) an IAT to probe automatic evaluations of the social groups, (ii) another measure of deliberate evaluations, and, finally, (iii) another measure of moral judgements.In the revaluation condition, participants passively observed a new transition structure between intermediate stimuli and outcomes (the social groups were not observed). In a complete reversal of the original contingency, Shape A now led to -5 Points and Shape B to +5 Points. After 20 trials of passive learning, participants made another four choices between the social groups to assess learning of the new transition structure. Then participants completed the same dependent measures from the baseline learning condition (IAT, deliberate evaluations, and moral judgements, in that order). At this point, readers might wonder why we included a separate measure of deliberate evaluations. Why not infer deliberate evaluations from the choices participants made between the social groups? After all, choices often reflect preferences, and these choices were made deliberately; they were even termed "explicit evaluations" by the researchers who developed this paradigm<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Our answer is that deliberate evaluations cannot be inferred from participants' choices because participants were instructed to choose the group that would lead to points-not the group they preferred. To comply with their instructions, participants may have chosen one group despite preferring the other. In fact, this is precisely what we expected to occur in the revaluation condition. Participants in this condition should, according to our hypothesis, consider Group A morally superior to Group B, and therefore preferable, but select Group B to fulfill the experimenter's request. Accordingly, deliberate evaluations were measured separately from participants' choices, which were used to confirm successful learning of the transition structure.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
