<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Standard models of economic decision-making generally assume a two-step decision process, where individuals identify and assign values to available options, and ultimately pick the option with the highest subjective value <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. The values attributed to individual options can derive from different sources.

Such explicit descriptions may take many different forms, including written language (from simple vignettes to fully specified numerical variables), a symbolic code communicating the decision variables (payoffs and probability) in an unambiguous manner, or a combination of the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>In the standard two-step model, the way option values are built (via experience or description) is only peripheral to the decision process itself, meaning that experiential and symbolic values converge to a central valuation and decision-making system <ref type="bibr">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><p>Thereby, choices between experiential and symbolic options should present no particular challenge, because their values are translated into an internal common currency, allowing an unbiased comparison between these differently generated option values. This normative point of view is indirectly supported by the fact that the neural correlates of experiential and symbolic values largely overlap in the so-called brain valuation system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</p><p>However, several lines of evidence in behavioral decision-making research question the idea of a central valuation system. In fact, it is now a very well established that, when studied separately, experience-based and description-based choices display different properties: a phenomenon referred to as the description-experience gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. This difference in the subjective valuation of experiential and symbolic options poses a direct, theoretical challenge to the idea of a central valuation system <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. This rather suggests the existence of modality-specific valuation systems, relying on distinct cognitive representations, which would hinder, if not impede, the comparison between experiential and symbolic options.</p><p>Strikingly, this key prediction has not been directly assessed, because studies usually consider separate sets of decision problems for experiential and symbolic options <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. Thereby, to date, very little experimental evidence has formally assessed the commensurability of experiential and symbolic option values, nor their mapping into a central or different valuation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>. This is particularly problematic considering that hybrid choices seem to be the norm rather than the exception in our modern societies where descriptive information is omnipresent. For example, everyday situations like choosing between our favorite restaurant (experience) and a new one with good review (description) is a prototypical example of such a hybrid decision.</p><p>To fill this gap and challenge the commensurability of experiential and symbolic values, we designed a new behavioral protocol. The experiment started with a learning phase during which human participants repeatedly faced abstract cues paired with probabilistic outcomes, thereby learned to associate experiential expected-values to the originally neutral symbols. After this phase, participants were asked to make hybrid choices between the experienced symbols and described lotteries visualized as colored pie-charts (a standard way to represent value symbolically) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. When making hybrid choices, participants treated the two kinds of options asymmetrically and, specifically, were neglecting experiential values. This asymmetry was robust across seven experiments, where we controlled for many possible alternative explanations, such as, insufficient learning, generalization issues or lack of incentives. Overall, the relative neglect of an option's value conditional on its source is consistent with the idea that different types of valuessuch as experiential and symbolicmay involve different representational systems, resulting in their incommensurability. The rightmost panel displays successive screens of a typical trials in the Experiential-Symbolic choice phase (ES). The ES-phase consists in binary choices between a lottery (standardly materialized as a piechart) and a symbol previously presented in LE-phase. In most experiments, the EE phase lasted 88 trials (8 E-options x 11 S-options). Durations are given in milliseconds. (B) The panels illustrate three possible hypotheses on how participants could make choices in the ES-phase. In each panel the probability of chosen the E-option is plotted against the value of the S-option (expressed as probability of winning a point). The insets represent the indifference points (where the curves cross 50%; of not unbiased indifference points should lay on the diagonal). The color of the curves indicates the value of the E-option (lowest: light orange; highest: dark orange). The leftmost panel illustrate the default hypotheses according to which E-options and S-options are fully commensurable and therefore the curves cross 50% (indifference point) at exactly the value of the E-option. The central panel illustrates experiential value neglect scenario according to which ES-choices are determined (almost) uniquely by the value of the S-options. Finally, the rightmost panel illustrates the symbolic value neglect scenario, accordingly to which ES-choices are determined (almost) uniquely the value of the E-options. (C) The panel displays the options values. The topmost part shows how E-option were organized in learning contexts (in all experiment except Exp. 4 and 7; of note, the attribution of the value to the symbols was randomized across participants). The bottommost part shows the lotteries used in the ES phase (in all experiment except Exp. 7). (D) The experiments were structured as follows: they all started with a learning phase (LE), where participants made choices between abstract symbols and received feedback information. After the LE phase, participants were asked to make repeated choices between each E-option and several lotteries (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1C</ref>). From Experiment 5 on, participants were also asked to make choice between E-options that were not necessarily presented together. Finally, we assessed the stated probability (SP) of winning for each symbol by asking participants to explicitly rate each E-option, following a probability matching procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We conducted a series of experiments structured in two main phases, one allowing the formation of subjective values from the experience of past outcomes, and a second where these experiential options (E-options) were presented against options whose subjective values were described by symbolic means (S-options) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A)</ref>. During the first (or learning: LE) phase, E-options were materialized by abstract shapes that provided no explicit information concerning the expected value (EV) of the option. During the LE choices, E-option values could therefore only be inferred from the history of gains (+1 point) and losses (-1 point) associated to a specific cue. E-options were presented in four fixed pairs, each featuring an EV-maximizing and an EV-minimizing option.</p><p>Subsequently, in the Experiential-Symbolic (ES) phase, participants were asked to make choices between the very same E-options of the previous phase and pie-charts explicitly describing the associated probabilities of gain and loss. As these ES, "hybrid" choices are the main focus of this paper, we thereafter delineate three plausible hypotheses concerning the behavioral output of this phase.</p><p>First, assuming that the subjective values of the E-and S-options are mapped into a common scale (common currency hypothesis), participants should make unbiased decisions in the ES phase. Accordingly, the probability of choosing, say, the E-option, will be jointly determined by the EV of the E-and the S-option ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B: left)</ref>. In other terms, for a given E-option the inferred indifference point will precisely correspond to S-options with equal EV.</p><p>Alternatively, the possibility that subjective values are constructed and represented in a modality-specific way (representational gap hypothesis) entails that E-and S-options are not readily commensurable. This situation could lead to two possible scenarios. In one of them, participants make random choices in the ES-phase. In the other scenario participants could prioritize one of the two sources of information. Within this scenario, participants could resolve the tension between E-and S-options basing their choices primarily on the explicit symbolic values provided by the lotteries. In other terms, participants would pick the lottery, when positive, and reject it when negative, as if the Eoption values were neglected and regressed to zero (experiential value neglect; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B:</ref> mid). In the other case, participants would present an over-reliance on experiential values and would display the opposite pattern: accept or reject an E-option without considering the S-option value (symbolic value neglect; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B: right)</ref>. Crucially, the ES phase of our experiments allows to tease apart these different scenarios by analyzing the probability of choosing an E-option as a function of the S-option being presented. More precisely, taking each E-option separately and uncovering the S-option (value) at which a preference shifts from the former to the latter provides us with an estimate of how much a participant values an E-option. Quantifying the relation between E-options and Soptions boils down to inferring indifference points (i.e., when the probability of choosing one option over the other is 50%) which acts as proxies of participant E-option values ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B: insets)</ref>. dark orange).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First evidence for the experiential value neglect scenario</head><p>In the LE phase of the first experiment (N=76), we presented pairs of E-options in an interleaved manner (i.e., E-option pairs are distributed randomly in the sequence of trials) and we displayed only the outcome of the chosen option (partial feedback) ( <ref type="figure">Fig</ref> Regarding analysis of the ES phase, the probability of choosing an E-option in an ES decision was largely determined by the S-option EV-value and the preference shift abruptly occurred around S-option EV equal to zero (i.e., P(+1) = P(-1) = 0.5). Despite clear proofs of successful value learning and encoding during the LE phase, ES phasechoice pattern was clearly consistent with the experiential value neglect scenario. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.   2B</ref>: left).</p><p>To quantify and statistically compare the differences in preferences observed in the LE and the ES phase, we first estimated the theoretical subjective value of each E-option separately for the two choice types, proxied by its probability of winning a point: p(win) (remind that the outcomes are fixed, so the expected value of different options only depend on their probabilities to win). Concerning the LE phase, we leveraged on a classical associative learning approach, where we assumed p(win) to be iteratively updated as a function of a prediction error-minimizing learning rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr">6)</ref>. We were able to infer p(win) attributed to each E-option at the end of the learning process by fitting this, rather parsimonious and standard, model. Concerning the ES phase, subjective p(win) estimates were inferred using the following method: the probability of choosing a specific E-option over a S-option of various expected values was assumed to take the form of a logistic sigmoid function. We fitted those logistic functions to each E-option and individual, and used them to extrapolate the indifference points indexing E-options' subjective p(win).</p><p>Finally, to compare the overall valuation of the E-options in the LE and the ES phases, we computed a measure of how well the subjective p(win) estimates from each phase matched the objective underlying probabilities, using slopes estimates from linear regressions.</p><p>At this aggregate level, a slope equal to 1 corresponds to an unbiased representation of E-options' p(win), whereas a slope equal to 0 corresponds to random representations. In our data, the slopes estimated from the LE phase were significantly higher and closer to 1 compared to those estimated from ES-choices (T(75)=6.53, P &lt; .001) ( We ruled out a first trivial interpretation for this result, by only including in the analyses participants that performed at 100% of correct response in catch trials (i.e. trials involving choices between two S-options; see Supplementary Materials), disseminated across the ES phase to ensure the participants' capacity to understand the symbolic representation of the probabilities.</p><p>In the following sections of the paper, we provide additional evidence in favor of the experiential neglect hypothesis by progressively ruling out alternative interpretations via additional measures and experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ruling out insufficient learning and forgetting</head><p>While the experiential neglect pattern observed in the ES phase is consistent with the idea that E-options and S-options are not equally considered in the decision process, it is also consistent with a much more trivial hypothesis: insufficient learning. Despite reinforcement learning model fitting suggesting otherwise (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2C</ref>: left), it is indeed possible that the neglect of E-option in the decision is caused by an imperfect and noisy E-option value representations at the end of the learning phase. To rule out this alternative interpretation, we devised a series of experiments where we changed the LE phase in order to improve learning, while keeping the (average) option values the same. In a second experiment (Exp. 2; N=71), we therefore presented decision problems as blocks (rather than interleaved as in Exp. 1), so as to improve performance and option identification by preventing the saturation of working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. In a third experiment (Exp. 3; N=83), we additionally provided the outcome information concerning the unchosen optiona manipulation known for increasing accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>. Finally, on top of these variations, in a fourth experiment (Exp. 4; N=88) we also reduced the number of decision problems of the LE phase to two, such that each decision problem was presented for twice as many trials as in experiments 1-3, thereby reducing the uncertainty about the options' outcomes. These manipulations were successful in significantly increasing decision accuracy in the LE phase (Exp. 1: 0.66±0.01; Exp. 2: 0.71±0.01, β=0.05, T(314)=2.28, P &lt; 0.05; Exp. 3: 0.82±0.01, β=0.16, T(314)=7.17, P &lt; 0.001; Exp. 4: 0.79±0.01; β=0.13, T(314)=5.8, P &lt; 0.001), while avoiding ceiling performance issues.</p><p>Indeed, even in the easiest experiments, accuracy was still significantly modulated by the decision values; for instance, the accuracy in the more difficult decision problem <ref type="bibr">(60/40)</ref> was always lower compared to the easiest one ('90/10') (T=5.81, P&lt;0.001; T=8.81, P&lt;0.001).</p><p>Crucially, the remarkable increase in the LE phase accuracy of the new experiments (107% -124% of Exp. 1) was not paralleled by detectable qualitative differences in ES phase choice patterns <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig 2B)</ref>. In other terms, the experiential value neglect persists despite the uncertainty concerning the E-options' values being considerably reduced (via blocked design, complete feedback and increasing the number of trials per decision problem).</p><p>To quantitatively characterize this claim, we estimated the subjective p(win) for each Eoption separately for the LE and the ES phases and fitted a linear regression between the estimated subjective p(win) and their true values (as described above). Confirming the efficiency of our manipulations in increasing learning performance, the LE-inferred slopes The comparison between the first four experiments suggests that experiential value neglect is not a mere effect of insufficient learning. We indeed observe that an improved performance in the learning phase does not translate into a similar decrease of the experiential value neglect effect. However, independently of the quality of learning, it is also theoretically possible that participants forgot the E-option values when entering the ES hybrid choice phase, although the fact that the ES phase directly succeeded the LE phases within a matter of seconds makes it improbable. To rule out this possibility, in Exp. 1-4, we asked participants to evaluate the E-options' p(win) just after the ES phase, by implementing a fully incentivized stated probability (SP) procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. More precisely, participants were explicitly asked to rate the probability of winning a point they attribute to an E-option, by means of a numerical rating scale <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1D)</ref>.</p><p>We then evaluated the quality of the E-option memory retention by regression these stated probabilities against their true values. Note that because this elicitation happens after the ES phase, this SP-inferred slopes constitutes a lower bound of how well E-option values are learned and could be recovered during the ES phase. Yet, the SP-inferred slopes were systematically higher than the ES-inferred slopes and significantly so in Exp. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ruling out generalization issues and assessing the robustness to practice</head><p>The above-reported results from 4 experiments and 3 preference elicitation methods indicate that the experiential value neglect phenomenon cannot be accounted for by insufficient learning nor by mere forgetting. In the present section we rule out two additional alternative explanations. First, it should be noted that the ES phase involves a generalization process, because the E-options are extrapolated from the decision context where their subjective values are originally learned. It is therefore conceivable that the apparent experiential value neglect is spuriously created by a generalization problem.</p><p>Second, in the previously reported experiments, participants went through the different phases (LE, ES and SP) only once: perhaps participants were somehow taken by surprise by the ES phase. In that case, presenting them different phases of the experiment twice will possibly allow them to improve their decisions by anticipating the ES-phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</p><p>To control for generalization and practice, we run two additional experiments. In Exp. 5</p><p>and Exp. 6 (N=71 and N=66), after the learning phase, we interleaved the ES-choices with choices involving E-options presented in all possible combinations (referred to as EE-choices). Thus, in all cases except one, EE-choices required being able to generalize their value to new decision problems. As in ES-choices, we plotted the probability of choosing a given E-option as a function of the alternative E-option ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3B)</ref>. To check whether experiential value neglect disappears if participants are given the opportunity to learn how to make ES decisions, Exp. 6 included a second session where we repeated all phases (LE, ES, ES and SP). Of note, E-options in the second sessions were materialized by a new set of symbols. presented the same characteristics as that of Exp. 3: complete feedback and block design) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 3A)</ref>.</p><p>To formally assess the difference between EE-and ES-choices, we calculated for each participant their option-specific indifference points, following the same procedure used for ES-choices and we compared the inferred slopes across decision modalities. EE-inferred slopes were consistently significantly higher than ES slopes in both Exp. 5 and Exp. 6 (Exp. 5: T(70)=4.5, P &lt; 0.001; Exp. 6.1: T(65)=4.08, P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Being presented with the whole experiment a second time had no detectable effect in choice behavior in neither the EE-or the ES-phase. Indeed, we observe no significant increase in the slopes in neither ES-(β=0.04, T(260)=0.84, P=0.4) nor EE-choices (β=0.1, T(260)=1.59, P=0.11) and the ES-inferred slopes were still significantly smaller compared to EE-ones (Exp. 6.2: T(65)=5, P &lt; 0.001). This suggests that being exposed with the whole experiment one time and, by doing so giving participants the possibility to adjust the decision strategy does not affect the main results. information is considered a hallmark of normative behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>. However, if E-option information processing (e.g. memory access/retrieval) is costly or if neglecting E-options does not hinders decision performance dramatically, it may become rational to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</p><p>To evaluate this possibility, we simulated choices based on an extreme version of the experiential neglect rule: if an S-option has positive expected value, choose it, otherwise choose the E-option. These simulations show that, applied to the decision problems of the ES phase from experiments 1-to-6, extreme experiential neglect still generates 77% of expected-value maximizing choices. This result is actually not as counterintuitive as it initially appears: by design, a positive lottery is the most advantageous option in ≥50% of the decision problems in which it appears, and the converse is true for the negative expected value lotteries. These considerations suggest that, instead of representing an intrinsic cognitive limitation of value-based decision-making, the experiential value neglect is a rational heuristic strategy deployed by efficient (or lazy) decision-makers maximizing an accuracy-effort trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</p><p>In order to test this new interpretation of the results, we designed a new experiment (Exp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7)</head><p>where we reorganized E-and S-options probabilities in a way that makes neglecting experiential values economically disadvantageous <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 4A)</ref>. In this new configuration, the narrower range of S-option values are nested within the broader E-option values, so that any given S-option has a higher expected value compared to the 4 negative Eoptions, and a lower expected value compared to the 4 positive E-options. Such configuration guarantees that participants neglecting E-option values in the ES-phase will exhibit a chance-level choice accuracy (50% of expected value maximizing choices).</p><p>Except for the modification of the lotteries, Exp. 6 present the exact number of trials.</p><p>Despite this stronger economic incentive, the behavioral pattern in ES-phase remained consistent with the experiential value neglect scenario <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 4B)</ref>. The significant difference between ES and EE slopes persisted in Exp. 7 (T(70)=5.12, P&lt;0.001), suggesting that despite the reorganization of probabilities, we were still able to elicit more accurate E-option values from EE-choices <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig.4F, Fig. 4G</ref>). As a consequence, compared to Exp. 6, the accuracy in the ES-choices significantly dropped in Exp. 7 by approximately 20% (T(94.97)=11.01, P &lt; .001, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig 4C)</ref>. Of note, the accuracy in the EEchoices remained the same <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 4D, Fig. 4E)</ref>, with no significant difference between the two experiments (T(131.77)=0.38, P=1, BF¹⁰=0.19).</p><p>These findings indicate that experience values are neglected even when it involves an (economic) cost. Therefore, the results are consistent with the idea that the experiential value neglect reflects a hard-coded feature of hybrid choices between experiential and symbolic option, rather than being strategically deployed by the relative lack of incentive in Exp. 1-6.</p></div>

The results (presented in the Supplementary Materials and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>) indicate that ambiguity aversion was not detectable in our set up and that it could therefore not contribute to explain the observed pattern of behavior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reaction times analysis: a tale of two systems?</head><p>Choice behavior differ across the ES-and the EE-choices. In the ES-phase, participants neglect the experiential option value and to make choices only based on the symbolic option value, so that, if the S-option is positive, it is chosen, otherwise it is rejected <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig.   5A</ref>). On the other hand, EE-choices are based on the retrieval from memory of the experiential values of both options. Thus, one decision process (ES-choices) seems to involve the processing and representation of only one option value (the lottery), while the other process (EE-choices) seems to involve the processing and the representation of two option values. We hypothesized that these different processes translate into different reaction times between the two choice modalities. To test this prediction, we compared the reaction times in EE and ES-choices, while including only decisions with similar objective value difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. Indeed, we found that ES decisions were faster compared to EE decisions, both when the S-option is chosen -(ESs) and when the E-option is chosen -(ESe) (T(136)=6.02, P &lt; 0.001; T(136)=3.98, P &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 5B and Fig. 5C</ref>).</p><p>Of note, within ES decisions, ESe choices were also slightly but significantly slower the ESs choices (~50ms; T(136)=4.35, P &lt; 0.001), which may indicate that choosing the Eoption requires additional processing to retrieve and represent the value of the E-option.</p><p>To confirm this intuition, we considered two categories of ES-choices: choices exclusively consistent with the participant choosing using the estimates inferred from the LE phase, on one side, and choices consistent with a full experiential value neglect, on the other side <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. S5)</ref>. We observed that, in conformity with previous results, ES-choices that are consistent with a full experiential value neglect are significantly faster than choices that can only be explained taking into account the E-option values estimated from the LEphase (T(386)= 2.27, P&lt;0.05) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 5D)</ref>. Overall, the RT analyses support the idea that We suggest two not-mutually exclusive explanations. One possibility is that experiential value estimates are perceived as less precise. Note here that precision represents the uncertainty about the value estimate itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. Indeed, assuming imperfect memory storage and retrieval, it is conceivable that experiential values are less precise compared to symbolic ones that can be perfectly calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77)</ref>. According to this interpretation, participants would quasi-systemically prioritize the more precise source of information for their choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78)</ref>. Another possibility is that participants prefer discarding experiential information not to incur the cost associated with the cost of memory retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80)</ref>. Reaction times analysis was overall consistent with this idea, because choices involving the processing of the experiential values were generally slower compared to those involving symbolic ones, even if balanced in objective difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. This latter interpretation leaves open the possibility that if one makes memory retrieval less costly, the behavioral pattern could be reversed (i.e., we would witness symbolic value neglect). This could be possible for example after extensive training, once experience-based choices are routinized <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(81)</ref> or, conversely, by making symbolic information harder to decode. These are interesting possibilities to be explored by future studies.</p><p>Finally, we speculate on the possible cognitive mechanisms underlying the experiential value neglect phenomenon and we identify two plausible candidates. The first mechanism involves 'bottom-up' attentional processes. It is well-documented that attentional focus biases evidence accumulation in value based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83)</ref>. It is therefore conceivable that an attentional bias toward symbolic options may result in prioritizing described information and neglecting experiential one. The second possible mechanism involves a 'top-down' heuristic process, according to which the calculation of individual option values is hijacked by a deterministic decision rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. Of note, even if we managed to demonstrate experiential value neglect in situations where it is disadvantageous (experiment 7), it can nonetheless be argued that this decision rule is overall adaptive, because computationally cheap and satisfying in most situations (see experiments 1-6).</p><p>To conclude, our results add to the collection of behavioral anomalies showing that values representations are inherently dependent on the way they are built, as it is postulated by the 'construction of preference' framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85)</ref> </p></div>

'LE' refers to the learning phase. 'ES' stands for Experiential-Symbolic phase. 'EE' stands for Experiential-Experiential phase (performed after learning with no feedback). 'SP' stands for Stated Probability phase. 'EA/SA' stands for Experiential-Ambiguous and Symbolic-Ambiguous. The 'Sessions' column provides the number of sessions, i.e., how many times we repeated the sequence of phases with a different set of E-options. The 'N' column refers to the number of participants included in the experiment after exclusion of those displaying &gt;100% correct response rate in the ES catch trials.</p><p>The research was carried out following the principles and guidelines for experiments including human participants provided in the declaration of Helsinki (1964, revised in 2013). The INSERM Ethical Committee approved the study and participants provided written informed consent prior to their inclusion. To sustain motivation throughout the experiment, the tasks were economically incentivized. Specifically, in addition to a showup fee, participants were initially endowed with £2.5, and according to their choices, they could reach a maximum £5. The conversation rate was around 1pt = 1 cent and they were explained that all points won across the different phases were summed up. The average final bonus was £4.05 ± 0.72, which was significantly higher compared to what they would have got in average following random choices (T(615) = 52.58, P &lt; 0.001).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E-option probabilities inference in ES and EE phases</head><p>To infer a probability estimate (or indifference point) for each E-option from EE and ES choices we proceeded as follows. In those phases, an E-option was assessed relatively to other cues (either S-options, either other E-options). In the ES phase 11 S-options were presented against each E-option. In the EE phase 7 E-options were presented against each E-option. Choosing the E-option that was currently assessed is always coded as 1,</p><p>whereas choosing the cue presented against (an S-option in ES, or an E-option in EE) is always coded as 0.</p><p>We note ∈ {0, 1} the choice of a participant at trial . Thus, for each E-option we obtain a vector of choices = ( 1 , 2 , 3 , … ) , with = 11 in the ES phase, and = 7</p><p>in the EE phase. We then fit the following logistic function (2, 3):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) = 1 1 + ( − )</formula><p>With &gt; 0 (which controls the slope of the function) being a free parameter unique to each individual , while ∈ [0, 1] (the function midpoint) is a free parameter that is estimated for each E-option and individual . The indifference point represents here the probability where a preference shift (from one cue to another) occurs, and is thus a subjective probability (or value) estimate for the E-option and participant . Both parameters were estimated through minimum negative log-likelihood estimation, using matlab's fmincon function.</p><p>With &gt; 0 being the temperature parameter, that implements choice stochasticity. As decreases, the events of choosing or tend to become equi-probable. As increases, the difference between ( , ) and ( , ) is amplified, and the choice becomes more and more deterministic (until the function almost acts as an argmax policy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fitting</head><p>Learning rate and temperature parameters (here denoted ) involved in the reinforcement learning model were estimated by finding values that minimized the negative logarithm of the posterior probability over the free parameters (− ( ( | )), which was computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">− ( ( | )) ∝ − ( ( | )) − ( ( ))</formula><p>Where ( | ) is likelihood of the data (i.e., the observed choices during the LE phase)</p><p>given certain parameter values, and ( ) is the prior probability of those parameter values.</p><p>The prior probability distribution over the learning rates was assumed as beta distributed and quasi-uniform (betapdf(1.1, 1.1)). The softmax temperature was for its part assumed to be gamma distributed (gampdf(1.2, 5)).</p><p>The optimization procedure was again performed using Matlab's fmincon function and previously described in Lebreton et al., 2019.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter and choice recovery in EE and ES phases</head><p>To quantify and statistically compare the differences in preferences observed in the ES and EE phase, we estimated for each E-option its theoretical subjective value (expressed in terms of probability of winning a point). This value is itself inferred in term of indifference points. For instance, in ES choices, one E-option with 80% chance of winning will be compared to range of S-options (going from 0% to 100% chance of winning a point). The indifference point for the E-option considered is then the S-option value at which a preference shift occurs between the two kinds of options (let's say, when the S-option is above 80%, considering the decision-maker is rational). To infer those indifference points, we fitted a logistic function to each subject choice history for each E-options in both EE and ES phases (see the methods section). We treated these indifference points as proxies for subjective values, i.e., E-option value estimates (or probability estimates, as in the numerical space considered they are equivalent).</p><p>To assert that this fitting procedure is robust, and that we do not elicit random subjective values, we followed a parameter recovery procedure <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>.</p><p>We simulated EE and ES choices based on the (EE and ES) E-option value estimated from experiment 1 to 6.</p><p>More precisely, for each subject, we simulated an agent going through its choice history, and we used the 8 inferred estimates (one for each E-option, each subject having its own 8 indifferent points) to simulate new choices.</p><p>We generate these choices using an argmax decision rule, meaning that the agent systematically selects the option with the highest value. Of note, in the simulated ES phase, we do not suppose any subjective deformation regarding S-options, such that the agent is directly informed of the objective expected-value to make its decision.</p><p>At this point of the procedure, simulated choices can be compared to choices from behavioral data. By doing so, we can see how well they match, and therefore whether our value estimates allow us to correctly recover the choices actually made by our participants. EE choices are recovered up to 83%, whereas ES choices are almost perfectly recovered, with a score of 96%. The fact that EE choices are less recovered is not surprising, as the E-option estimates results from the comparison of one option against 7 others, when in the ES phase an E-option is presented against a wider range of alternative options (11), hence allowing better precision in the fitting of E-option value estimates.</p><p>We then generate new E-option value estimates, by applying our initial logistic fitting procedure (see methods section) to this newly simulated data. We observe that E-option value estimates are almost perfectly recovered, both in the ES <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S2)</ref> and EE <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. S3)</ref> phase, with a spearman that is systematically higher than .97. .</p></div>

Thus, E-values inferred from ES-choices are consistent with the dual process model of Fig. 5A.DiscussionOur results clearly indicate that the experiential and symbolic option values are not treated symmetrically when making hybrid choices and speak against the idea of a central valuation system that encodes option values in a common currency, regardless of the way they are built(3,<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>. The key finding supporting this claim is provided by the analysis of hybrid decision problems between experiential and symbolic cues, where choices appeared to be made by largely neglecting value information acquired during the learningphase. Crucially, by running several experiments and including multiple control measures, we ruled out several alternative explanations for the experiential value neglect: this decision-making pattern is not due to insufficient learning, forgetting, generalization issue, or a lack of incentive. Finally, reaction time analyses are consistent with different processing of experiential and symbolic values and with the idea of an additional cognitive cost associated with the memory retrieval of learned values. It seems that past experiences and symbolic descriptions of possible outcomes ultimately generate value representations different enough to make them largely incommensurable and that the tension between the two is resolved by overweighting (or prioritizing) symbolic information. In the following paragraphs we try to provide plausible reasons why these values representations radically differ, why symbolic information is favored in hybrid choices and which cognitive mechanisms could underlie the behavioral pattern observed. Symbolic descriptions of lotteries in our task (and in general) involve separate information about at least two different features of outcomes: payoffs (i.e., the amount of reward to be won or lost) and their probability (50). Models of decision-making designed to explain behavior in this kind of paradigms frequently assume that probability and payoffs are processed individually. For instance, in prospect theory and its extensions, different subjective weighting functions are supposed to apply to these variables (51-53, 14, 54). A separate representation of payoffs and probabilities is also assumed by models that do not suppose the calculation of a multiplicative expected utility (55) and by models supposing that decisions are underpinned by feature-by-feature comparisons (56-60). On the contrary, experience-based choices, as instantiated by simple reinforcement learning tasks, are usually modeled assuming that the decision-makers represents a unique numeric value for each state-action pair. The decision-maker can 'look-up' in this value matrix before making their choice and, once an outcome is obtained it partially overwrites the 'cached' values previously stored in memory, so that they approximate the average outcome (61). Option value representation is therefore structurally very different from that of description-based choices, because the relevant features (payoffs and probabilities) are never explicitly represented as separate attributes of the outcomes. Furthermore, some authors even suggest that reinforcement-based choices may bypass the calculation of reward-based option-specific values, and is underpinned by what is called direct policy learning (62-65). Our results seem to reject an extremely orthodox interpretation of direct policy learning (accuracy in the learning phase was sensitive to the value difference between options and experiential values were successfully generalized to new combinations). It is nonetheless plausible to conceive that -at least to some extent -reinforcement-based decisions involve a value-free (policy-based) component that can be hardly compared with the subjective extracted from explicit payoffs and probabilities. Functional neuroimaging investigations of experiential and symbolic decision-making may also shed light on the debate about value representation across modalities. While functional meta-analyses identified overlapping correlates of experiential and symbolic values (17-20), the putative neural mechanisms of reinforcement-based and descriptionbased decisions differ in many crucial respects. First of all, the most influential and consensual neural models of reinforcement-based leaning and decision-making give a preponderant role to dopamine-induced neural plasticity circuits (66-68). More specifically dopamine-dependent plasticity is supposed to drive action selection by shaping the strength of the synapses between the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia (69, 70). Current neural models do not attribute to dopamine-driven processes and the basal ganglia a prominent role in description-based choices. Rather, they suppose that the decision process is solved by cortical circuits (71-74), following an evidence accumulation process similar to that observed for perceptual decisions (75, 76). Thus, structural differences in the neural mechanisms of choices across modalities may represent a biologically grounded bases of the representational difference between experiential and symbolic values. The representational tension of hybrid choices is solved by participants by neglecting the experiential values and basing their choices on the symbolic value. Several control analyses allowed us to formally exclude the possibility that this effect merely arise from insufficient knowledge of the experiential values. Why is the symbolic information preferred?</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_10"><head>.</head><label></label><figDesc>More specifically, our findings pose serious challenges to the default assumption that values representations are shared across different decision-making modalities, traditionally referred to as experience-and description-based. The incommensurability between experiential and symbolic values results in behaving as if discarding acquired information and consequently entails suboptimal decisions. These findings are worth exploring outside the experimental setting because many real-life decisions involve a tension between an experiential and a symbolic component.</figDesc></figure>

Participants were recruited via Prolific, a platform dedicated to online research participants recruitment (https://prolific.co/). To assess participants' engagement in the different tasks and their understanding of probability representation, we inserted catch trials consisting in choices between two lotteries (S-options), with one of the two cues being obviously better in terms of expected value maximization. In all analyses we only retained the participants displaying 100% of correct choices in these catch trials. In total 599 participants were included. Experiment 1 to 7 included the following numbers of participants: 76,71, 83, 88, 71, 66, 71, 73 (see</figDesc></figure>

From experiment 1 to 5, participants performed only one learning session. Experiment 6, 7 and 8 for their part include 2 learning sessions. From experiment 1 to 7, each learning session contained four pairs of experiential cues (E-options), apart from experiment 4, which contained 2 (but featured proportionally twice more trials). Each pair was fixed, so that a given cue was always presented against the same other cue. Thus, within learning sessions, pairs of cues represented stable choice contexts. Within each pair, the two cues were associated to two outcomes; either winning a point (+1) either losing one (-1). The four (two in experiment 4) cue pairs corresponded to four contexts of varying difficulty, indexed by the difference in the probability of winning a point between the two cues. On each trial, one pair was randomly presented with one cue on the right and the other on left side of the screen. Participants were required to select, without time-limit, between the two cues by left-clicking. After the choice, the selected cue was highlighted with a black border while a transition effect was activated. The transition effect lasted approximately 1000 ms and revealed the outcome of the choice. The outcome was then displayed during approximately 1500 ms. In experiments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, the four pair of cues were presented 30 times each, for a total of 120 trials within sessions. In experiment 4, the two pairs were presented 60 times each, to maintain an identical number of trials. In experiment 1, pairs of cues were presented in an interleaved manner, meaning they were distributed randomly across the 120 trials. From experiment 2 to 7, pairs were presented in a blocked manner, meaning they were stacked in sequences of 30 choices.</figDesc></figure>
