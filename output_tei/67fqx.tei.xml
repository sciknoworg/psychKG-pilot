<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dominance Complementarity in Childhood</head><p>Around the world, narcissistic leaders are on the rise <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Sedikides &amp; Campbell, 2017)</ref>. Although much is known about the harmful effects of narcissistic leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">O'Boyle et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">O'Reilly et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Tokarev et al., 2017)</ref>, little is known about the interplay between narcissistic leaders and their followers. Are there individuals who thrive under narcissistic leaders? And do narcissistic leaders benefit from leading them? According to dominance-complementarity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Grijalva &amp; Harms, 2014)</ref>, the dominance and confidence of narcissistic leaders may provide a good match with the submissiveness and insecurity of followers with low self-esteem, for both parties.</p><p>We theorize that this may be observable in childhood, when narcissism first develops and children start forming leader-follower relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brummelman et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Tackett et al., 2022)</ref>. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a large observational-experimental test in children. We combined self-reports, informant reports, and observer-coded behaviors to provide a rigorous test of our hypotheses. Observing such dynamics already in childhood would suggest that they are fundamental to human social interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Narcissistic Leaders</head><p>Narcissism is an everyday personality trait characterized by a sense of being more important and deserving than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brummelman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Krizan &amp; Herlache, 2018)</ref>. Narcissism is not a personality disorder but a continuous personality trait, with individuals ranging from lower to higher levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Back &amp; Morf, 2018)</ref>. We focus on grandiose narcissism (hereafter: narcissism), which is characterized by agentic tendencies, such as self-confidence and a sense of superiority, as well as by antagonistic tendencies, such as arrogance and disdain for others <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Back et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Crowe et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Miller et al., 2017)</ref>. Due to their need for power and status <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Grapsas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Mahadevan &amp; Jordan, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Zeigler-Hill et al., 2019)</ref>, individuals with high levels of narcissism (i.e., narcissistic individuals) are eager to obtain leadership positions in groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(Zitek &amp; Jordan, 2016)</ref>. Others may select narcissistic individuals into leadership positions because several narcissistic characteristics-DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 5 such as dominance, confidence, and extraversion-match onto people's implicit leadership schemas <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Lord et al., 1984)</ref>. Unsurprisingly, then, narcissistic individuals tend to emerge as leaders in groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brunell et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Grijalva et al., 2015;</ref>, already in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brummelman et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>How do narcissistic leaders influence their followers? Research in adults has revealed that narcissistic leaders have both bright and dark sides (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braun, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fatfouta, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Grapsas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Rosenthal &amp; Pittinsky, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Sedikides &amp; Campbell, 2017)</ref>. On their bright side, narcissistic leaders are charming and assertive <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Goncalo et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Leckelt et al., 2015)</ref>, expound charismatic vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Galvin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Nevicka, Van Vianen, et al., 2018)</ref>, inspire innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Gerstner et al., 2013)</ref>, and make followers feel more secure in times of turmoil <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Nevicka et al., 2013)</ref>. On their dark side, narcissistic leaders often show unethical behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blair et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">O'Reilly et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Watts et al., 2013)</ref>, reduce collaboration and integrity in groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(O'Reilly et al., 2021)</ref>, disregard advice of experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Kausel et al., 2015)</ref>, respond aggressively to criticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Kjaervik &amp; Bushman, 2021)</ref>, and stifle employee voice <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Huang et al., 2020)</ref>. Unfortunately, to date, little is known about the conditions under which narcissistic leaders show their bright or dark sides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leader-Follower Compatibility in Groups</head><p>Scholars have called for research on contexts that bring out the different sides of leader narcissism <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Braun, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Campbell et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fatfouta, 2019)</ref>. We theorize that an important factor is leader-follower compatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Grijalva &amp; Harms, 2014)</ref>. According to dominance-complementarity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carson, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Grijalva &amp; Harms, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Kiesler, 1983)</ref>, matching the dominance and assertiveness of one interaction partner with submissiveness and compliance of another will result in greater harmony, reduced friction, more optimal leader-follower interactions, and higher leadership effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Grant et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Grijalva &amp; Harms, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Hu &amp; Judge, 2017)</ref>. We propose that low trait self-esteem is a well-compatible follower characteristic for narcissistic leaders.</p><p>Followers with low self-esteem may perceive narcissistic leaders positively, because these leaders complement their insecurity, submissiveness, and need for acceptance. Narcissistic leaders may DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD behave more positively when leading followers with low self-esteem, because these followers complement their self-confidence, dominance, and need for admiration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Through the Eyes of Followers</head><p>How do followers with low self-esteem feel when they have a narcissistic leader? Individuals with low self-esteem feel unsatisfied with themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brummelman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Leary &amp; Baumeister, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Orth &amp; Robins, 2014)</ref>. They often have a history of rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Leary &amp; Baumeister, 2000)</ref>, so it is not surprising that they tend to be shy, lonely, and socially anxious <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Karababa, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Leary &amp; Kowalski, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Orth et al., 2008)</ref>, while exhibiting a strong need for social acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Harter et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Leary, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Rudich et al., 2007)</ref>. They also tend to be self-protective in an attempt to stave off social rejection; for example, they often avoid the limelight, behave submissively, and eagerly conform to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Josephs et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Leary, 2005)</ref>. Consequently, they may look toward their leaders for approval, validation, and belonging, and they may be particularly drawn to narcissistic individuals, who can offer them guidance, security, a sense of community, and belonging through their charismatic collective vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Den Hartog et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Padilla et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Rogoza &amp; Fatfouta, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Schoel et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Thoroughgood et al., 2012)</ref>. Consequently, narcissistic leaders may enable individuals with low self-esteem to establish a shared identity with the group (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, 2019)</ref>. Indeed, when their need for social acceptance is satisfied, individuals with low self-esteem are expected to feel better, experience more inclusion and group cohesion, and even behave more positively toward others <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Buckley et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Friedkin, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Leary, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Schutte et al., 2002)</ref>. Hence, when followers with low self-esteem have narcissistic leaders, they may not only perceive these leaders as more effective but also experience greater wellbeing, perceive more group cohesion, and show more positive social behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Through the Eyes of Leaders</head><p>How do narcissistic leaders behave when their followers have low self-esteem? Narcissistic leaders can behave in antagonistically-they may be aggressive, hostile, and derogating toward their followers-especially when they feel threatened <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Grapsas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kjaervik &amp; Bushman, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 7</head><p>Followers with low self-esteem are unlikely to activate these rivalrous tendencies, because they typically behave submissively, compliantly, and agreeably. Rather than threatening the narcissistic leaders' position, they may follow the narcissistic leader's directions and let them take center stage.</p><p>As a result, when leading followers with low self-esteem, narcissistic leaders may behave in less antagonistic ways, showing less direct aggression (i.e., verbal bullying, overt aggressive behavior) and less indirect aggression (i.e., social exclusion; <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Wyckoff &amp; Kirkpatrick, 2016)</ref>. Also, as narcissistic leaders feel secure of their low self-esteem followers' respect, they may behave less arrogantly, as the arrogance mainly serves to secure others' respect and to uphold one's grandiose image <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Horvath &amp; Morf, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Morf &amp; Rhodewalt, 2001</ref>). Thus, when leading followers with low self-esteem, more narcissistic leaders may show less antagonistic and less arrogant behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leaders and Followers in Childhood</head><p>We studied leader-follower compatibility in childhood. Children already become aware of social hierarchies in infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Thomsen et al., 2011)</ref>. As they develop, children proceed to form expectations about the asymmetrical organization of relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hawley, 2015)</ref>, become more sensitive to markers of social rank, and form schemas about which characteristics constitute leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Heck et al., 2022)</ref>. Unsurprisingly, then, leadership commences in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Day et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Escobar Vega et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Eva et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Guerin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Z. Liu et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Z. Liu et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Murphy &amp; Johnson, 2011)</ref>. In late childhood and early adolescence, children spend most of their free time at school in groups of three or more peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Coplan et al., 2015)</ref>, which makes leadership skills increasingly relevant. Collaborative tasks enable children to adopt leader and follower roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Sun et al., 2017)</ref>. Children who emerge as leaders tend to lead subsequent tasks, while others assume the role of followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Li et al., 2007)</ref>. Thus, childhood is a critical and sensitive developmental period to study leader-follower relationships. Research in childhood may also help inform interventions when leadership identity is still malleable <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Tackett et al., 2022)</ref>, with the aim of improving leadership across the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Day et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Z. Liu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Murphy &amp; Johnson, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Around the time leader-follower relationships emerge, individual differences in narcissism DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD and self-esteem tend to crystallize <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Thomaes &amp; Brummelman, 2016)</ref>. Narcissism and self-esteem can be measured reliably from age 7, when children acquire two critical abilities. First, children become able to make global self-evaluations (e.g., "I'm a worthy person" <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Harter, 1988)</ref>. Younger children tend to evaluate themselves within specific domains, and they rarely spontaneously aggregate across these domain-specific self-evaluations to evaluate their overall worth. Second, children make social comparisons in the service of self-evaluation (e.g., "I'm better than others"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Lapan &amp; Boseovski, 2017)</ref>. Younger children can make social comparisons, but they often evaluate themselves unrealistically positively, even when they perceive others as better than them. Once narcissism and self-esteem have emerged, they tend to remain relatively stable over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(De Clercq et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Trzesniewski et al., 2003)</ref>. Like their adult counterparts, narcissistic children see themselves as great leaders and tend to emerge as leaders in their classrooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brummelman et al., 2021)</ref>, while children with low self-esteem tend to be more withdrawn and submissive <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Harter, 2015)</ref>. By focusing on the symbiosis between leader narcissism and follower self-esteem, we highlight the importance of children's personality traits for life outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Soto &amp; Tackett, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Contributions</head><p>Our work bridges insights from social, organizational, personality, and developmental psychology to understand leader-follower dynamics in childhood, thereby making critical contributions. First, by studying the interdependence of leaders and followers (rather than studying them as isolated actors), we demonstrate the potential functionality of a seemingly harmful leadership trait-narcissism-for followers with low self-esteem. Second, this study extends the applicability of dominance-complementarity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carson, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Grijalva &amp; Harms, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Kiesler, 1983)</ref> to childhood, and thereby demonstrates the importance of examining social dynamics and group processes in childhood using theories from social and organizational psychology. Third, we respond to calls for studying earlier stages in the developmental trajectory of leadership, which are pivotal for the development of leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Escobar Vega et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Tackett et al., 2022)</ref>. We focus on ages 7-14, a critical phase when collaboration becomes increasingly important and children DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 9 develop fine-grained communicative skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Liu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Murphy &amp; Johnson, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Overview</head><p>Our experimental-observational study provides the first empirical test of the complementarity of leader narcissism and follower self-esteem in children. We recruited a large sample of children (N = 332) ages 7-14. Our study combines self-reports, informant reports, and observer-coded behaviors to provide a rigorous test of our hypotheses. We measured children's narcissism and self-esteem levels. We then randomly assigned them to three-person groups. In these groups, children performed a collaborative task where one child was randomly assigned as leader, who was in charge of the group discussion and decision, and the other two children were assigned the role of followers. Afterwards, we measured the followers' evaluations of the leader (i.e., perceived leader effectiveness and future leader preference), followers' well-being (i.e., state self-esteem, state positive affect, and perceived inclusion), and followers' perceived group cohesion.</p><p>Based on video recordings of the collaborative task, we coded the leaders' and followers' behavior.</p><p>We coded the extent to which followers and leaders excluded others during the task, as well as the extent to which leaders displayed aggression and arrogance. We tested two sets of hypotheses:</p><p>First, we examined how leader-follower combability affects followers. We hypothesized that followers with low (vs. high) self-esteem would perceive more narcissistic leaders as more effective and preferred leaders (Hypothesis 1a), experience higher well-being under more narcissistic leaders (Hypothesis 1b), feel more group cohesion under more narcissistic leaders (Hypothesis 1c), and engage in less antagonistic behavior under more narcissistic leaders (Hypothesis 1d). Second, we examined how leader-follower combability affects leaders. We hypothesized that, when leading followers with low (vs. high) self-esteem, more narcissistic leaders would show less antagonistic behaviors (Hypothesis 2a) and show less arrogant behavior (Hypothesis 2b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency and Openness</head><p>We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD and all measures in the study. The study was not preregistered. All de-identified data, research materials and measures (including the full study protocol) and analysis code are available on OSF at https://osf.io/2ts5u/?view_only=c2b509e43513496383edd16390432485.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were 332 children (46.4% boys; 96.4% born in the Netherlands), ages 7 to 14 (M = 11.58 years, SD = 1.98), recruited from elementary and secondary schools in The Netherlands for the Childhood Leadership Study. We approached schools in socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods throughout the Netherlands. We collected data between February 2017 and May 2017. We recruited as many participants as possible throughout the semester, aiming for at least 300 children. We did not inspect or analyze the data before terminating data collection, so our decision to terminate data collection could not have been influenced by our results. We did not preregister the study design or hypotheses. The Ethics Review Board [masked] approved the present study. Children received parental consent and provided their own assent prior to participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>All participants were randomly assigned to a three-person group. In each group, one child was randomly selected as leader. From the original 332 participants, 11 children did not participate in the experimental session. There were 107 groups in total, totaling 321 children (45.8% boys;</p><p>96.6% of Dutch origin; mean age of 11.58 years, SD = 1.98). Our sample size exceeded the power recommendations for multi-level modelling, with more than 50 level-2 (i.e., group-level) observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Kachanoff et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Maas &amp; Hox, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Participants first completed narcissism and self-esteem personality questionnaires in their classrooms. One child did not complete the narcissism questionnaire. Several days later (M = 3.00 days, SD = 2.49), children were randomly assigned, within their classrooms, to three-person groups and participated in a group-decision making task in a separate room. We used a hidden-profile task which we developed and piloted extensively for use with children (for a complete overview of the pilot and task materials, see DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 11 https://osf.io/2ts5u/?view_only=c2b509e43513496383edd16390432485). This is a three-person collaborative task in which information is distributed among group members so that the optimal decision remains hidden unless group members exchange information. The task was to select the best police officer from 3 candidates. Each child received a profile of each candidate. Unbeknownst to them, children received different information in the profiles. Only by exchanging information could children identify the best candidate. Such tasks have been successfully used in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gummerum et al., 2014)</ref>. In each group, one child was randomly assigned to be the leader. The other two children were followers. The leader sat at the head of the table. All group members were told that it was the leader's responsibility to guide the discussion and make the final group decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>All self-report items were rated along a 4-point scale (0 = not at all true, 3 = completely true).</p><p>This study was part of a larger study that also included measures that were not relevant to our research questions (for a complete overview of materials and measures, see OSF link).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Narcissistic individuals tend to emerge as leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Grijalva et al., 2015)</ref> and may thus become central and influential figures in social groups, already in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brummelman et al., 2021)</ref>. It is pivotal to examine how narcissistic leaders affect their followers, and how their followers affect them. Our observational-experimental study, which combined detailed behavioral observations with self-reports and informant reports, enabled us to examine these leader-follower dynamics in childhood. Our findings provide converging evidence for leader-follower compatibility.</p><p>First, followers with low self-esteem benefited from having narcissistic leaders. If their leaders had higher narcissism, followers with low self-esteem perceived these leaders as more effective, endorsed them more strongly for future leadership roles, perceived more group cohesion, felt more included by them, experienced less bullying from them, and felt better about themselves. Second, narcissistic leaders benefited from having followers with low self-esteem. If their followers had lower self-esteem, narcissistic leaders showed less aggression and social exclusion toward their followers. In line with dominance-complementarity theory, the match between narcissistic leaders' dominance and their followers' submissiveness meant that both parties experienced the interaction as more comfortable and harmonious <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Grijalva &amp; Harms, 2014)</ref>. Our findings reveal an earlyemerging symbiosis between narcissistic leaders and low self-esteem followers in groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Our research demonstrates that childhood is a critical period to study leader-follower dynamics. To our knowledge, such dynamics have been studied exclusively in adulthood. This is unfortunate because leader-follower roles already emerge in childhood . We contribute to theories on leadership identity development (DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010), which posit that leadership identity is DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD formed when children claim and are granted leadership positions. Prior work has shown narcissistic children tend to claim leadership positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brummelman et al., 2021)</ref>. We extend this work by showing that leadership is also being granted to narcissistic children by followers with low selfesteem, who acknowledge them as effective leaders and show a preference for them as future leaders. Over time, these processes of claiming and granting leadership positions may mutually reinforce each other, leading narcissistic children to see themselves as leaders.</p><p>Our research demonstrates leader-follower compatibility in childhood. This has implications for multiple theories in personality, social, and organizational psychology. Our findings are consistent with person-environment fit research <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Denissen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Kristof-Brown et al., 2005)</ref>, showing that a good match between individuals and their environments-including team membersgenerate positive consequences for the individual. We extend this work by showing that these benefits extend beyond the individual to the group as a whole. Also, our findings align with uncertainty identity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hogg, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hogg, , 2021</ref>, which holds that individuals are motivated to reduce uncertainty about who they are, in order to feel more certain about their place in the world. To do so, they may endorse more dominant or even autocratic leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hogg, 2021)</ref>. We extend this work by showing that this process applies especially to children with low self-esteem, who show support for narcissistic leaders and endorse them as leaders, perhaps as means of reducing their own insecurities. This concurs with research showing that people perceive overconfident and dominant individuals as competent, granting them power and status <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson &amp; Kilduff, 2009)</ref>. Accordingly, the allure of narcissistic leaders for children with low self-esteem may stem from the reassurance these children find in the leaders' apparent competence.</p><p>Our research contributes to our understanding of the bright and dark sides of narcissism in groups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braun, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fatfouta, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Grapsas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Rosenthal &amp; Pittinsky, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Sedikides &amp; Campbell, 2017)</ref>. Our findings indicate that low self-esteem individuals thrive under narcissistic leaders; to them, narcissistic leadership does seem to have an apparent "bright side" despite the fact that narcissism sits under the umbrella of dark triad personalities including Machiavellianism and psychopathy, which are considered antithetical to effective leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Braun, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fatfouta, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, our findings suggest that, in some cases, group functioning can be enhanced by improving leader-follower compatibility, rather than targeting leaders or follower individually, particularly because leadership is a bidirectional collaborative process <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Reicher et al., 2005)</ref>. For example, when creating teams, one can consider the selfesteem and narcissism levels of the members. When low self-esteem individuals accumulate positive social experiences under narcissistic leaders, they may come to see themselves more positively and improve their functioning in social contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Hosogi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Orth &amp; Robins, 2014)</ref>. Conversely, when narcissistic leaders accumulate positive social experiences with low self-esteem followers, they may develop a more functional leader identity, curbing their self-protective antagonistic behaviors and engaging their "bright side." Future work should test these possibilities.</p><p>One might expect that the very personality features that prompt low self-esteem individuals to follow narcissistic leaders-their insecurity, submissiveness, and compliance-make them more vulnerable to narcissistic leaders' potential toxic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Grijalva &amp; Harms, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Padilla et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Thoroughgood et al., 2012)</ref>. Research with adults in an organizational context showed that followers with lower self-esteem experienced more abusive leadership under a narcissistic leader . However, this may be less of an issue in children, as prior research suggests that the more toxic aspects of narcissistic leadership seem to be tempered in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brummelman et al., 2021)</ref>. One reason for this could be the absence of a conducive environment in enabling destructive or toxic leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Grijalva &amp; Harms, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Padilla et al., 2007)</ref>. Specifically, the power differential between children (even for those children in a leadership position such as team captains) is smaller than between organizational leaders and their subordinates. The power and authority of organizational leaders is more formalized and more encompassing. Indeed, in children, leadership functions tend to be more widely shared among group members, even if the formal leader is dominant <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Li et al., 2007)</ref>. Given that power can amplify socially toxic components of narcissism <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Mead et al., 2018)</ref>, the lower power distance among children may prevent narcissistic children in DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD positions of power from manifesting their potentially toxic behaviors.</p><p>Our findings reveal a symbiosis between narcissistic leaders and low self-esteem followers.</p><p>We borrowed the term symbiosis from psychoanalysis and biology, referring to "a close functional association of two organisms to their mutual advantage" <ref type="bibr">(Mahler, 1967, p. 740</ref>). Yet, it is important to consider the possibility that these advantages are limited to one-shot or short-term group interactions. When low self-esteem followers work with a narcissistic leader over extended periods of time, they may develop codependency: low self-esteem followers may enable the narcissistic leader to become increasingly dominant, whereas the narcissistic leader may enable low self-esteem followers to become increasingly submissive. As such, dominance complementarity may lead to symbiotic relationships that enable unsafe leader-follower interactions (e.g., where followers lose power to exchange information or influence group decisions; <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Nevicka, Ten Velden, et al., 2011)</ref>. This aligns with research showing that narcissistic individuals are initially well-liked but show more and more antagonistic behavior over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Back et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Leckelt et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Ong et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constraints on Generality</head><p>Because we conducted an ecologically valid experiment with behavioral observations in a sample of children from public schools, we believe our findings are generalizable to school children aged 7-14. However, one important constraint on generality is culture. We conducted our research in the Netherlands, a prototypically individualistic country. Although narcissism tends to be higher in individualistic than collectivistic cultures, it appears to predict leadership emergence similarly across cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Liu et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Nuzulia &amp; Why, 2020)</ref>. Nonetheless, we encourage researchers to pilot the experimental materials and coding of leadership behavior in their local contexts, ensuring that they are culturally appropriate and reveal leader-follower dynamics. The materials and coding protocol can easily be adapted to different contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths, Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Our study has several strengths, including its experimental design, its multisource and multimethod approach, and use of an ecologically valid group decision-making task. Our study also has DOMINANCE COMPLEMENTARITY IN CHILDHOOD 21 limitations. First, our study focused on children ages 7-14, a critical age for leadership development.</p><p>Future research should examine how leader-follower compatibility extends to late adolescents, where greater participation in extracurricular group activities and an expanding social network play an increasingly important role for social learning about leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Liu et al., 2021)</ref>. Second, our study used the most extensively validated measure of narcissism in children, which assesses narcissism as a unified personality trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Thomaes &amp; Brummelman, 2016)</ref>. Research in adults suggests that narcissism can have both agentic and antagonistic features <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Back &amp; Morf, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Krizan &amp; Herlache, 2018)</ref>. Given that the agentic features include vision, charisma, and self-confidence, it is possible that low self-esteem followers benefit mainly from leaders who show agentic features.</p><p>Future research should explore this possibility. Another question pertains to interventions. Our work suggests that two seemingly maladaptive traits-narcissism and low self-esteem-can jointly generate positive consequences, at least in the short run. Interventions can focus on improving the compatibility between leaders and followers as a means of enhancing group functioning, while being mindful of the possible long-term risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Narcissistic individuals are more likely to rise to leadership positions, even in childhood. We show that complementing narcissistic leaders with low self-esteem followers seems to strike a symbiosis. Not only do followers with lower self-esteem seem to thrive under narcissistic leadership but the leaders themselves behave more positively. This shows that, from a young age, leaderfollower compatibility is critical for understanding the allure of narcissistic leaders. Note. Nwithin = 210-212 followers; Nbetween = 107 leaders. Follower SE = Follower Self-Esteem. The total variance explained by the models is given by the conditional R 2 , and the total variance explained by the fixed effects is given by the marginal R 2 (Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth, 2013).
