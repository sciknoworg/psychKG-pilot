			<abstract>
				<p>Young adulthood is a developmental phase where individuals must navigate a changing social milieu that involves considering how their decisions affect close others such as parents and peers. To date, no empirical work has directly evaluated how young adults weigh these relationships against one another. We conducted a pre-registered experiment where we pit outcomes for parents against outcomes for friends. Participants (N = 174, Ages 18-30) played two runs of the Columbia Card Task-one where gains benefited a parent and losses were incurred by a friend, and another where the opposite was true. We also tested whether age, relationship quality, and reward type earned for parents and friends (simulated v real) acted as moderating influences on parent-friend prioritization. Results showed individuals were more likely to make decisions that benefited a parent at the expense of a friend. Relationship quality and reward type moderated this effect whereas age did not.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parents versus Peers: Assessing the Impact of Social Agents on Decision Making in Young Adulthood</head><p>As social creatures, humans must often consider how their decisions will impact close others. While psychologists have typically studied this phenomenon by comparing decision making when it impacts a close other (e.g., parent, friend, or partner) versus when it does not, individuals in the real world often must make decisions that differentially impact multiple close others. The present study sought to model these trade-offs by pitting opposing outcomes for parents and friends to understand how individuals prioritize these close others when making decisions. We conducted this research in young adults because they still display peer-oriented characteristics of adolescence while being required to adapt to novel adult roles and situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, 2014)</ref>, making them an ideal population in which to study other-oriented decision making. In this pre-registered study, we tested whether young adults prioritize parents or friends during decision making. Because there exists considerable heterogeneity in behavior during the young adult years <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, 2014)</ref>, we also considered the role of key moderating factors such as age and relationship quality with parents and friends. Finally, to further examine boundary conditions on decision making, we explored whether young adults made different decision when presented with the chance to earn real versus simulated rewards for close others.</p><p>Young Adulthood is Marked by a Unique Social Ecology. Psychological science has attempted to characterize young adulthood for several decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gould, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Levinson, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Though debate exists on whether young adulthood is best defined as the half decade following adolescence, or a more protracted period occupying the entire third decade of life, most scholars generally agree that young adulthood is a unique transitory period unlike any other during the lifespan. During this period, individuals face newfound responsibilities and a shifting social milieu <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnett, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, , 2014</ref>. At the center of these changes lie the relationship dynamics between young adults and their parents and peers. Young adults are similar to adolescents in that they remain highly oriented to peers but they are also often dependent on their parents in both the financial, emotional, and social domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>. Research to date points to young adulthood as a unique developmental phase during which both parents and peers play important roles.</p><p>Peers, especially friends, affect the way young adults construe their identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hopmeyer &amp; Medovoy, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roisman, Masten, Coatsworth, &amp; Tellegen, 2004)</ref>, construct appraisals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Knoll, Magis-Weinberg, Speekenbrink, &amp; Blakemore, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Welborn et al., 2015)</ref>, and make decisions under uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fromme, Corbin, &amp; Kruse, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hopmeyer &amp; Medovoy, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ohannessian, Vannucci, Flannery, &amp; Khan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Riedijk &amp; Harakeh, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Silva et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">White et al., 2006)</ref>. Despite the seemingly monolithic importance of friends, parents also remain important in the lives of their young adult offspring. Like friends, parents also impact how young adults engage in real world risk taking behaviors and make decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abaied &amp; Emond, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carlson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Guassi Moreira &amp; Telzer, 2018)</ref>, refine existing identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kaniušonytė &amp; Žukauskienė, 2018)</ref>, and maintain mental wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Guassi Moreira &amp; Telzer, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lucas-Thompson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Needham, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In fact, as individuals transition from adolescence to young adulthood, parents appear to become more, rather than less, central in their lives. Relative to adolescents, young adults report higher levels of cohesiveness and obligation towards parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tsai, Telzer, &amp; Fuligni, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Whiteman, McHale, &amp; Crouter, 2011)</ref> while becoming increasingly receptive to their advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carlson, 2014)</ref>, perhaps in part because young adulthood is a time of high 'turnover' among friendships <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>. In other words, parent-child relationships can be an important source of stability for young adults during a time of social instability. Together, these pieces of evidence demonstrate that both parents and peers play crucial roles in the lives of young adults but it is unknown how young adults prioritize these two important relationships.</p><p>The Moderating Roles of Age and Relationship Quality. Since evidence suggests that age and relationship quality influence the extent to which young adults value their parents and friends, it follows that these variables likely moderate decision making about parents and friends.</p><p>With regards to age, we anticipated that older individuals would be more likely to favor parents over friends. This prediction was informed by findings that show parent-child relationship quality increases throughout young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tsai et al., 2013)</ref> and that young adults experience high friendship 'turnover' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnett, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, , 2014</ref>, which may cause them to weigh parent relationships more heavily during this developmental phase. With regard to relationship quality, we predicted that participants who reported better relationship quality with parents would weigh parents more heavily than those with worse relationship quality and that the same would be true for friendship quality. Close relationships in young adulthood are rich with heterogeneity and the quality of such relationships has been shown to affect other types of decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Guassi Moreira &amp; Telzer, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Boundary Conditions of Reward Type on Decision Making. Extant evidence indicates that simulated and real rewards can differentially influence decision making. While reward type has not been examined in the context of other-oriented decision making, it is possible that reward type influences other-oriented decisions just as it does for self-oriented decision making.</p><p>Scenarios with real rewards-compared to simulated ones-recruit different neural systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bray, Shimojo, &amp; O'Doherty, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kang, Rangel, Camus, &amp; Camerer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Miyapuram, Tobler, Gregorios-Pippas, &amp; Schultz, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Scholl et al., 2015)</ref> and elicit different patterns of decision making behavior <ref type="bibr">(Hinvest &amp; Anderson, 2010)</ref>. Although some research suggests simulated and real rewards are equivalent <ref type="bibr">(Locey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madden et al., 2003)</ref>, these studies have largely been conducted on a narrow set of economic tasks and in largely asocial contexts.</p><p>Studies that use different tasks or vary the social implications of decisions find that real and simulated scenarios bias decision-making in different ways <ref type="bibr">(FeldmanHall et al., 2012a</ref><ref type="bibr">(FeldmanHall et al., , 2012b</ref><ref type="bibr">Pronin et al., 2007)</ref>. Though we had no directional hypotheses about how real versus simulated rewards might influence decisions in the current study, the prior literature suggests this is nevertheless an important variable to consider.</p><p>Current Study. We investigated how young adults made decisions that had opposing consequences for a parent versus a friend. Across two samples, as part of a pre-registered study, participants played one round of a decision-making task in which they chose between making a decision that benefited their parent while risking a loss for their friend or avoiding a loss for their friend while forgoing a benefit for their parent. The opposite was true for a second round (counterbalanced order). This manipulation is well-suited to address how individuals make decisions about parents versus friends because (i) it directly pits parents and friends against one another, modeling real-world dilemmas, (ii) these types of decisions involving risk are highly salient to young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Duell et al., 2017)</ref>, and (iii) most importantly, in everyday life, decisions containing elements of risk tend to be highly consequential. In addition to measuring age and relationship quality to test for moderating influences, we also sought to better understand the generalizability of any observed effect. To this end, we manipulated the reward types that participants could gain for parents and friends (i.e., simulated versus real rewards).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Experiment Overview. Our aforementioned research questions were investigated in an experiment conducted across two samples. Although both samples were pre-registered as independent studies, we are reporting them in one pooled, aggregate sample here for clarity and ease of interpretability. These two samples differed primarily based on the type of reward that could be won for parents and peers (simulated vs real). Our primary hypotheses and analyses did not differ between studies and sample-specific results can be accessed in the Supplemental</p><p>Material.</p><p>We used a novel variant of the Columbia Card Task to probe whether young adults exhibited a preference when making decisions that had opposing consequences for a parent and a friend. Our key aims were to test whether participants would prioritize parents or friends (Hypothesis 1). Our secondary aims were to test whether individual differences of age (Hypothesis 2) and relationship quality (Hypothesis 3), in addition to reward type (Exploratory Research Question 1), moderated the extent to which individuals prioritized parents or peers during decision making. We also administered a supplemental experimental task to determine how the effects here might generalize to other forms of decision making (e.g., certain decisions).</p><p>Though the certain-decision task results are beyond the scope of our primary research questions, we report them in the Supplementary Material and reference them briefly in the results.</p><p>Hypotheses. Our a priori hypotheses and exploratory research questions, listed below, were preregistered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) prior to data collection (osf.io/5tm48).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary hypothesis.</head><p>Hypothesis 1: There is ample evidence to suggest that parents and peers each play crucial roles in the social ecology of young adulthood. However, prior work has not tested whether parents or peers are more influential than the other in shaping decision making for young adults. If parents are more central than peers, participants would be more inclined to make decisions that benefit a parent at the expense of a peer. However, if peers are more important than parents, then 8 Trade-Offs in Other-Oriented Risk Taking individuals would be more likely to make decisions that benefit a peer at the expense of a parent.</p><p>We note here that because extant evidence highlights how both parents and peers exert strong pulls over behavior, it is appropriate to formulate a competing hypothesis such as this one. This hypothesis was pre-registered a priori.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Hypotheses</head><p>Hypothesis 2: Since existing literature suggests closeness and identity with parents increases during late adolescence and young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tsai et al., 2013)</ref>, we hypothesized that older participants, compared to younger participants, would be more likely to make decisions that would benefit a parent at the expense of a friend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 3:</head><p>We hypothesized that participants with better relationship quality with their parent would be more likely to make decisions that benefit that parent at the expense of a friend (moderation). Similarly, we hypothesized that participants with greater relationship quality with their friend would be more likely to make decisions that benefit that friend at the expense of a parent (moderation). This hypothesis was pre-registered as an exploratory analysis in our first sample and as a hypothesis in the second sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Research Question 1:</head><p>Prior work has demonstrated that reward type (real v simulated) can potentially affect decision making behavior. Here, we examined whether young adults prioritized parents and peers differently in conditions of real and simulated rewards for parents and friends. This manipulation was specified a priori, but directional hypotheses about it were not.</p><p>Lastly, in an effort to understand potential motivations for parent-peer prioritization during decision making, we also tested a supplemental hypothesis related to perceived levels of obligation towards family and friends. For purposes of brevity and clarity, it, along with its accompanying analyses, is described in the supplementary material. Hypotheses regarding both relationship quality and obligation were registered as exploratory research questions for one sample (osf.io/5tm48) and hypotheses for another (osf.io/4pvxb).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Participants. Participants were young adults belonging to two samples recruited from the West Los Angeles area in the United States. Prior to data collection, we set each of the two sample sizes at 90 participants in order to be comparable to, or larger than, other similar studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Botdorf, Rosenbaum, Patrianakos, Steinberg, &amp; Chein, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Van Hoorn, Crone, &amp; Van Leijenhorst, 2017)</ref>. In the first sample, parents and friends were compensated with simulated rewards, whereas in the second sample parents and friends were compensated with real rewards (more information below). Participants in sample 1 were recruited from the psychology subject pool at UCLA and were compensated with course credit while participants in sample 2 were compensated with $20.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Armsden &amp; Greenberg, 1987)</ref>. The IPPA has been frequently used as a metric of subjective relationship quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Branje, Hale, Frijns, &amp; Meeus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fanti, Henrich, Brookmeyer, &amp; Kuperminc, 2008)</ref> and was initially developed for use in young adult populations. Participants used a five-point scale (1 = "Almost never or never" to 5 = "Almost always or always") to answer 28 items about their relationship quality with their parent and 25 items about their relationship quality with their friend. Sample item for parent relationship quality: "My parent respects my feelings". Sample item for friend relationship quality: "When we discuss things, my friend considers my point of view". Responses were reverse-scored where appropriate and averaged to yield a single mean score for both parent relationship quality and friend relationship quality (Sample 1: Parent α = .94; Friend α = .91; Sample 2: Parent α = .95;</p><p>Friend α = .90). A self-report measure assessing self-reported perceived obligation to parents and friends was also collected in Sample 2 (real rewards) and is discussed in the supplement.</p><p>Additional self-report measures assessing other constructs such as sensation seeking and realword risk-taking (listed in the Supplementary Materials) were also collected but not analyzed.</p><p>Decision-Making Task. We used a modified version of the "hot" Columbia Card Task to assess how participants weighed parents and friends during decision making (CCT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Figner, Mackinlay, Wilkening, &amp; Weber, 2009)</ref>. The "hot" CCT is a widely used experimental paradigm that measures risky decision making in an incremental, step-wise fashion. During the experimental session, participants performed two runs of the CCT (1 run = 24 game rounds, 3 repetitions of each deck type). During each round, participants were shown 16 overturned cards and were told that they could win points by turning over gain cards or lose points by turning over a loss card <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Above the set of cards was a header that contained information about (i) the total number of loss cards (either 1 or 2) in the deck, (ii) the point value (either -30 or -60) of each loss card, (iii) the point value (either 10 or 20) of each gain card, (iv) and a running total tracking the points they earned for that deck. The different possibilities in the number of loss cards, point value of loss cards, and point value of gain cards yielded 8 total distinct types of game rounds. At the bottom of the screen, participants were reminded of the CCT condition (e.g., 'Parent Gain | Friend Lose'; 'Parent Lose | Friend Gain'). Each round began with a score of 0 and all the cards face down. Participants were required to choose between turning over a card (risky choice) or not turning over a card ("passing"; safe choice). Choosing to pass meant that a participant was finished with the round; they would not lose any points for that round but could not gain any additional points. If a participant chose to turn over a card, the computer selected a card and flipped it over. Although participants were informed the computer selected a card at random, the first three risky choices a participant made were 'rigged' so as to always yield a gain card. This was done in order to ensure that participants would not turn over loss cards too early in a given round and feel disproportionately discouraged from flipping cards <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McCormick &amp; Telzer, 2017)</ref>. A game round continued until participants decided to pass to the next round, or until they flipped over a loss card. The task was self-paced and programmed in PsychoPy (version 1.82.01; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Peirce, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Prior to beginning the experimental task, participants completed four practice rounds of the CCT in order to ensure they properly understood the task.</p><p>We used a novel variant of the CCT to assess how young adults prioritized parents versus friends when making decisions. During one run of the task, participants were told all the points associated with gain cards would be gained for their parent, whereas all the losses from a loss card would be incurred by their friend. During another run of the task, participants were told the opposite was true: all the points associated with gain cards would be gained for their friend,</p><p>whereas all the losses from a loss card would be incurred by their parent. The run order between these two conditions was counterbalanced. The manipulation modeled real world trade-offs in decision making by assessing how individuals make decisions that stand to benefit one close other at the risk of harming a second close other. That is, each decision was always associated with a gain for one close other at the potential expense of another close other-there were no trials in which only one close other was affected and the other was not. For example, during the parent-gain/friend-lose run, turning over a card allowed participants to gain points for their parent at the potential expense of their friend. Alternatively, if they chose to pass, participants were guaranteed to avoid a loss for their friend but gave up the chance to obtain a gain for their parent. This manipulation ensured there would always be a tradeoff for prioritizing one close other over the other.</p><p>Manipulating Reward Type: Real vs Simulated Rewards. We manipulated reward type to assess its impact on other-oriented decision making in young adults. In sample 1, participants were told to play as if the points could be redeemed for a tangible good or service but were notified that their parent or friend would not actually receive any such rewards. Specifically, participants were asked to imagine that the points won for their parent and friend respectively during the task could be used to benefit them in some material way. For this reason, rewards are said to be simulated.</p><p>In sample 2, participants began the experiment with a $5 endowment for both their parent and friend and were told that their task decisions would result in them gaining or losing actual money for their close others. Thus, the rewards for parents and friends were real and outcomes were received immediately. The following refers to only the participants in sample 2. To keep the task in sample 2 (real) as consistent with sample 1, participants from the former were told that their decisions would also earn or lose points for their parent and friend, but that the outcome for one deck from each run of the task would be chosen at random, converted to dollars, and then added to or subtracted from the initial endowments. Participants were told that 10 points were equivalent to $1 (USD). In order to ensure participants believed the rewards in the concrete condition were not fixed, we told participants a computer script would be run immediately following the session to determine the amount won/lost for parents and friends. A dummy script was run after the session run to give the appearance that actual calculations were being made.</p><p>After the session, participants were told they had won an additional $2 for their friend and an additional $1 for their parent. Unbeknownst to participants, these values were fixed. Participants in the real rewards sample were shown envelopes for each close other with the $5 endowment prior to playing the CCT. These envelopes were addressed with addresses provided by the participants for their parent and friend, respectively, and the earnings were mailed following the session. These participants were debriefed as to the fixed reward amounts after the session.  Risk was operationalized as the standard deviation (SD) of the possible outcomes associated with a given decision: SD = √(gain probability × (gain amount − EV) 2 + loss probability × (loss amount − EV) 2 )</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic Approach &amp; Decision</head><p>Because the decision to pass did not result in the addition or loss of points, the SD and EV for choosing to pass were both zero. Based on the combination of parameters for each possible game round (number of loss cards, value of loss cards, value of gain cards), the SD values ranged from 9.68 to 40 2 and EV ranged from -37.67 to 16.88.</p><p>Within-person models. We sought to understand the extent to which our experimental condition manipulation (whether a parent stood to gain and a friend to lose, or vice versa) Level 2 (between-participants):</p><p>(2) π0i(intercept) = γ00 + γ01(Age) + γ02(Sex) + γ03(PRQ) + γ04(FRQ) + γ05(RT) + u0i</p><p>(3) π1i(Condition) = γ10 + γ11(Age) + γ12(Sex) + γ13(PRQ) + γ14(FRQ) + γ15(RT) + u1i</p><p>(4) π2i(Return) = γ20 + γ21(Age) + γ22(Sex) + γ23(PRQ) + γ24(FRQ) + γ25(RT) + u2i</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(5) π3i(Risk) = γ30 + γ31(Age) + γ32(Sex) + γ33(PRQ) + γ34(FRQ) + γ35(RT) + u3i</formula><p>The intercept (π0i) and trial-by-trial associations between Condition (π1i), Return (π2i),</p><p>and Risk (π3i) represent participant-specific parameters that were allowed to vary randomly across participants. Each were modeled as fixed effects in addition to cross-level interactions with age (continuous), sex (binary), parent relationship quality (PRQ; continuous), friend relationship quality (FRQ; continuous), and reward type (RT; simulated vs real; binary) (e.g., the γj-s). Age and relationship quality variables were centered using the grand mean. Sex and reward type were dummy coded (0 = male, 1 = female; 0 = simulated, 1 = real). The uj-s represent random error terms that were allowed to vary between participants. That is, they are the error terms in predicting each participant's level 1 coefficients from a constant and effects of age, sex, relationship quality, and reward type. Fixed effects are averaged across values of the uj-s.</p><p>Additional supplemental models with parent/friend obligation were run by swapping out measures of relationship quality for measures of parent/friend obligation (see Supplemental</p><p>Materials for more information about the measure). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision making as a function of Condition.</head><p>First, we examined the Level 1 model described in Equation 1 to test whether decision making varied as a function of Condition. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref>, we found significant associations between decision making and all three predictor variables: Condition (i.e., who gains/loses as a result of the decision), Return (EV), and Risk (SD). Participants were more likely to turn over a card when their parent stood to benefit at the expense of their friend.</p><p>Consistent with prior work (e.g., van Duijvenvoorde et al., 2015), participants were more likely to turn over a card if Return values were high and if Risk values were low. Importantly, this effect remained significant (or marginally significant) when adding sex, age, reward type, and parent/friend relationship quality terms to the model (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> below). Thus, we caution against strong interpretation of age effects and ultimately consider them to be inconclusive. These analyses were confirmatory, as opposed to exploratory, because they were testing an a priori hypothesis (Hypothesis 2). with a close friend, they were still overall more likely to make choices that benefited a parent at the expense of their friend. These were pre-planned exploratory analyses for our first sample and confirmatory analyses for the second sample.</p><p>To further probe the interactions, we tested the highest (n = 55; Mean = 4.40) and lowest (n = 58; Mean = 2.97) thirds of our sample in terms of parent relationship quality and re-ran the full model (excluding parent relationship quality scores from level 2) in these subsets. Results</p><p>showed that individuals reporting the highest parent relationship quality had a positive association between Condition and decision making (γ = .424, SE = .125, p =.002), whereas those with the lowest parent relationship quality did not show a significant relationship between Condition and decision making (γ = -.035, SE = .113, p &gt;.250). These results suggest that those with relatively higher parent relationship quality were more likely to prioritize their parents compared to friends when making decisions. We used the same process to interrogate the friend relationship quality interactions: We conducted a separate analysis in which we split the sample into groups based on the highest (n = 54; Mean = 4.68) and lowest (n = 61; Mean = 3.70) thirds of friend relationship quality and re-ran the full model, excluding friend relationship quality from the model. A trend similar to the parent relationship quality results emerged. Individuals with the highest friend relationship quality were likely to prioritize neither parents or friends, whereas those with the lowest friend relationship quality prioritized parents over friends (High: γ = .157, SE = .180, p &gt;.250; Low: γ = .251, SE = .108, p = .023). Relatively speaking, these results show those with high friendship relationship quality tend to prioritize friends more than parents, compared to those with low friend relationship quality.</p><p>To determine whether another measure of relationship quality would yield similar results, we examined the valence of the words and phrases that participants used to describe their parents and friends during the salience manipulation as an "implicit" measure of relationship quality (see Supplemental Materials for more details). These adjectives were rated with a sample of participants via Amazon's Mechanical Turk and the resulting valence ratings were entered into our Level 2 equations in place of self-report measures of relationship quality and yielded very similar results (See Supplemental Materials).</p><p>Reward type affects parent-peer prioritization. Interestingly, reward type significantly moderated other-oriented decision making (Table 2, Panel B) such that participants were more likely to favor their parents at the expense of their friends when rewards were simulated (fixed effect of Condition from abstract reward sample: γ = 0.219, SE = .035, p &lt; .001). By contrast, when rewards for close others were real, the fixed effect of Condition was not significantly different from zero (γ = 0.019, SE = .041, p &gt; .250), meaning that participants did not favor parents or friends over the other <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). Reward type moderated several other aspects of decision making. For example, individuals were more likely to flip a card at higher EV values when rewards were real (i.e., interacted with Return), and to flip a card at lower SD values when rewards were real rather than simulated (i.e., interacted with Risk).</p><p>Searching for motivational causes. Post-hoc (i.e., not preregistered) analyses were conducted to infer what motivated participants to, on average, weigh parents more heavily than friends.</p><p>Most notably, we tested whether the effects of return and risk differentially affected decisionmaking behavior across our two experimental conditions. To this end, we created Condition X Return and Condition X Risk interaction terms by multiplying Condition with Reward and Risk respectively. These were entered into the first level of the model described in the prior section (i.e., equations 1-5; all Level 2 variables from the final model were also included). These interaction terms did not yield significant results, implying that Return and Risk did not motivate individuals differentially across conditions. Additional, results testing the effect of perceived obligation to parents and friends on our rewards are detailed in the Supplemental Materials. The results of said analyses were inconclusive. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The likelihood of turning over a card ("risky" choice) broken down by Reward Type (i.e., simulated, real).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Young adulthood is a transitional phase of development in which individuals juggle new roles and encounter novel scenarios while trying to adapt to an evolving social landscape. To date, no prior studies had investigated how young adults make decisions that entail opposing outcomes for close others. In the present study, we found evidence suggesting young adults are overall more likely to prioritize parents over a close friend. Self-reported relationship quality affected the extent to which individuals prioritized parents and friends, as higher relationship quality with a particular close other was associated with prioritizing that close other during decision making. Lastly, we found that young adults appear to show no preference between parents and friends (i.e., equal prioritization) when rewards are real, compared to simulated.</p><p>Together, these results suggest that parents play a significant role in the lives of young adults, helping clarify the whom and the when of other-oriented decision-making in young adults.</p><p>Overall, young adults in our sample were more likely to make decisions during the CCT that benefitted their parents at the expense of their friend. This was the case despite the fact that participants reported significantly greater levels of self-reported relationship quality with friends compared to parents. Bucking popular lay theories of young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>, this result is consistent with recent work showing that individuals begin to identify more with their parents and report better cohesion with them during the transition to young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tsai et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings expand upon this work by suggesting parent relationships are so important that young adults are willing to incur losses for their friends in order to benefit their parents. One explanation for this is that parent relationships embody stability at a time in the lifespan when it is difficult to obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett, 2014)</ref>. Another explanation is that participants' tendency to prioritize parents over peers was due to differences in perceived obligation, defined as feeling as though one ought to support, assist and respect the wishes of close others <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fuligni &amp; Pedersen, 2002)</ref>. Simply put, parents typically invest more emotionally and financially into their children than friends do into their peers. Recognizing this, young adults may feel indebted to their parents and subsequently desire to help them more than friends. Though supplemental analyses did not find evidence for this explanation, it nevertheless merits consideration in future studies. These findings will aid subsequent investigations of whom young adults prioritize and may eventually inform work focused on understanding why.</p><p>Relationship quality was a key moderating influence on how young adults prioritized parents and peers during the task. These results are noteworthy because they highlight that the extent to which one may favor a parent or friend is limited by the nature of their relationships.</p><p>For instance, one may realize that their friend could benefit more from money than a parent, but if they do not like their friend very much (relatively speaking), they will not prioritize them during decision making. These results contribute to a broader, increasingly recognized trend in psychological science that underscores how social decision-making across development is modulated by a myriad of additional social variables whose moderating interactions are almost as important as the main effects themselves (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Guassi Moreira &amp; Telzer, 2017)</ref>. Surprisingly, we did not find strong evidence to support our hypothesis that older participants weigh their parents more heavily than younger ones. This finding warrants at least two potential explanations. The first is methodological-it may be that to properly observe such an effect, we would need a broader age range that included adolescents, as has been used in prior studies finding significant age differences on related phenomena <ref type="bibr">(Braams &amp; Crone, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steinberg et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">van Duijvenvoorde et al., 2015)</ref>. The other explanation is that this is a true null finding and that across age, individuals prioritize their parents over their friends when making decisions that affect both. One of the most intriguing findings in our study was that the type of rewards participants could gain for their parents and friends (simulated vs real) affected their prioritization of these close others during decision making. Earning simulated rewards for a parent and friend was related to greater parent-over-friend prioritization during the CCT. By contrast, earning real rewards was tied to showing neither a preference for parents or friends. Simulated rewards could result in individuals pursuing idealized representations of goal structures-or, the intrinsic arrangement of how various goals are prioritized arranged in relation to one another; real rewards force individuals to modulate their goal structures according to reality's demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Freitas, Gollwitzer, &amp; Trope, 2004)</ref>. It follows that the young adults in the simulated rewards condition could have been making decisions according to an ideal goal structure in which their parents were more important than friends. After all, prioritizing a parent is easier when one's friends do not actually incur any losses. However, once rewards become real, young adults were forced to face the reality that losses were no longer immaterial and may have had difficulty making decisions that rigidly favored an ideal goal structure. Alternatively, it is possible that earning real rewards elicited greater emotional salience, perhaps causing individuals to behave more impulsively and discount long-term goals in favor of short-term ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Freitas, Gollwitzer, &amp; Trope, 2004)</ref> Additional research is needed to address the limitations of the current study. First, future work should explicitly examine whether financial obligations moderate the extent to which individuals in this age range prioritize parents versus peers. Second, this study tested one class of rewards and losses and it is presently unknown whether these results would generalize to other kinds of reward (e.g., social). Using easily quantified rewards (e.g., money, points, etc.) is a common first step for new research questions because they allow for a "clean" operationalization of mathematic reward and risk probabilities. However, future work could nevertheless benefit from employing a greater diversity of risks and rewards. Lastly, follow-up studies could seek to probe whether specific decision-making processes (e.g., loss aversion) are affected disproportionately by the opportunity to win for parents while losing for friends compared to the opposite.</p><p>The present study presents several constraints on generalizability <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Simons, Shoda, &amp; Lindsay, 2017)</ref>. First, participants were exclusively recruited and tested in the western United States. It is possible that a different pattern of results would be observed elsewhere due to cultural differences surrounding parent-child relationships. Second, our nomination procedure involved each participant nominating just one parent and one friend. If we repeated the study with a different parent and close friend in the same participants, it is possible that the results would differ due to qualitative differences in relationship dynamics between the original and novel set of parents and friends. Lastly, because parts of our study used monetary rewards, the economic climate may have swayed decision-making behavior. Future replications taking place during an economic recession/depression may produce different results because of different financial pressures that individuals may be currently facing. We have no reason to believe that our results depend on other characteristics of the participants, materials, or context.</p><p>In sum, the present study makes a novel contribution by examining how young adults make decisions that pit rewards for a parent against rewards for a friend. Here, we show that individuals prioritize their parents over their friends when winning simulated rewards on their behalf. Together, these results contribute towards a nuanced understanding of how close others affect decision making processes during young adulthood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental Materials</head><p>Overview. The following materials touch upon a number of auxiliary features to our study.</p><p>First (1), we describe two additional supplemental procedures to verify the robustness of our results and verify the boundary conditions of the effects reported in the main document. The first of these procedures describes using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to obtain normative ratings of the phrases and adjectives participants described their nominees as in the parent and friend salience measure. Such data were used to create relatively objective measures of relationship quality and test the robustness of the moderating effects of relationship quality observed in the main document. This procedure was employed for both samples of the main study. The other procedure describes an additional experimental task administered in Sample 2 (real reward sample) to determine whether the effects in the main study generalized to decisions that were characterized by certainty, rather than uncertainty. This experimental task was administered as part of the overall procedure for Sample 2 and shared the same, pre-registered hypotheses as the CCT task (they are not listed here to avoid redundancy but interested readers can view them at osf.io/4pvxb).</p><p>Second (2), these materials list the supplementary hypothesis related to family obligation that was briefly mentioned in the beginning of the methods section of the main document.</p><p>Third <ref type="formula">3</ref>, the materials here contain results from the main analysis broken down by sample. That is, the same analyses run in the main study are repeated here separately for each of the two samples (the sample that received simulated rewards for parent/friend (Sample 1) and the sample that received real rewards for parent/friend (Sample 2)). There is also a breakdown of how the association between decision make and return, and decision making and risk differ as a function of reward type (e.g., when rewards to parent/friend were simulated vs real).</p><p>Fourth (4), because approximately 95% of our sample was comprised of individuals aged 18-24.99, we ran re-ran our final model to verify our results were not disproportionately influenced by the oldest participants (25+ <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">; Table S7</ref>).</p><p>Lastly (5), we disclose the entire list of self-reported measures that were collected in this study. Notably, no analyses were run with self-report measures other than those referenced in the main document. Thus, as of this submission, data from these additional measures have not been analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental Hypothesis</head><p>Supplemental Hypothesis 1. Participants who perceive greater obligation to their parent will be more likely to make decisions that benefit a parent at the expense of a friend (moderation). Similarly, participants who perceive greater obligation to their friend will be more likely to make decisions that benefit a friend at the expense of a parent (moderation). This was a post-hoc exploratory question in our first sample and a pre-registered hypothesis in the second sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental Methods for Data Collection with Amazon's Mechanical Turk</head><p>Participants. Participants were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk by a study advertisement asking them to rate adjectives and phrases used to describe individuals. This was done separately by sample. For Sample 1 adjective/phrases, we constrained our participants to individuals who were of college-age, and thus only allowed individuals between the ages of 18-22 to participate. We arbitrarily decided to collect data on 60 participants (19 Female, Mage = 21.03). For Sample 2 adjectives/phrases, we decided to collect a similar number of participants (n = 50; 21 Female, Mage = 26.32) while widening the eligible age range to be more consistent with the population sample recruited from the general West Los Angeles area.</p><p>Procedure. Participants responded to a HIT request asking individuals to "rate traits and phrases commonly used to describe individuals on how positive or negative they are." Individuals then rated adjectives/phrases (Sample 1 n = 412; Sample 2 n = 435) according to the following prompt "These are words and phrases that have been used by individuals to describe close others. Please rate the following words/phrases on a scale of 1 to 7 based on what you think about the word/phrase." The anchors on the likert scale were 1 = extremely negative, 4 = neutral, 7 = extremely positive. All adjectives/phrases in both were presented in alphabetical order across many pages on a survey administered via Qualtrics. A very small number (less than 10) of items participants provided were either not rated or not included in final analyses because they were deemed to be inappropriate descriptors of others (e.g., "chocolate" or "glasses").</p><p>In addition to rating these traits, MTurk participants for Sample 1 adjectives/phrases also completed two modified versions of the Respect for Family Subscale of the Family Obligation Scale <ref type="bibr">(Fuligni &amp; Tseng, 2008)</ref>. Typically, participants are asked to rate how important they regard a set of behaviors that indicate obligation for one's family. For the first version, we modified the subscale by changing all items to ask about parents (as opposed to other family members) and subsequently omitting redundant items, yielding a five-item measure. A sample item includes "How important is it to you that you to make sacrifices for your parents?" The second version was identical to the first version except all items were changed to ask about friends (instead of parents) and one item was omitted ("Follow your parents' advice about choosing friends."), producing a four-item measure. A sample item is "How important is it to you that you treat your friends with great respect?" Thus, there were two separate scales, one tapping obligation to one's friends and the other measured obligation to one's parents. A single score for each scale was calculated by averaging items. Both versions are available with the rest of the study materials on the OSF. Due to experimenter error, one item of the friend obligation scale was worded incorrectly when collecting data via MTurk. Though the corrected version of the item is listed on OSF, all analyses with this measure reported here reflect scores calculated without this item. Both measures displayed adequate to good reliability (Parent α = 0.88, Friend α = 0.65).</p><p>The rationale for choosing the Respect for Family Subscale instead of using the full measure or other subscales was because the other subscales (i) did not contain items that were easily adapted to ask about friends and (ii) tended to assess obligation in scenarios that one typically encounters with family but not friends, potentially biasing reports of obligation.</p><p>The measure was not collected on the Sample 2 MTurk participants because it was instead administered to the main study participants with the intention of testing whether family/parent obligation scores moderated the trial-level association between Condition and decision making, thereby lending insight into potential motivational causes behind decision making behaviors.</p><p>Supplemental Self-Report Measures. The following measures were collected on main study participants (both samples) for the possibility of running additional, exploratory analyses or to test future research questions orthogonal to the ones presented in the main study. The health and social subscales of the adolescent version of the Domain Specific Risk Taking Scale <ref type="bibr">(DOSPERT;</ref><ref type="bibr">Blais &amp; Weber, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figner &amp; Weber, 2011)</ref> and the 8-item Brief Sensation Seeking Scale <ref type="bibr">(BSSS-8;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hoyle et al., 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental Methods for Other-Oriented Decision Making Under Conditions of Certainty.</head><p>As noted in the main document, an additional, less imminent aim of our study was to also characterize how young adults prioritized parents and peers in trade-offs that were certain in nature (as opposed to uncertain). To this end, Sample 2 participants also completed an adapted version of a family assistance task <ref type="bibr">(Telzer, Masten, Berkman, Lieberman, &amp; Fuligni, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moll et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In our version of the task (referred to as the Donations Task), individuals were instructed to make choices about point allocation proposals that had conflicting outcomes for their nominated parent and friend. Specifically, on each trial, one individual (parent or friend) would stand to gain a given number of points while the other would be poised to lose a number of points. Individuals were instructed to either reject or accept each proposal. The gain amounts for each proposal could vary between +70, +60, +50, +40, while the loss amounts could vary between -70, -60, -50, -40, -30, -20, -10. Each gain value was paired with loss values whose absolute values were at most equivalent and at least no lower than 30 points less e.g., +70 was always paired with either -70, -60, -50, -40. This configuration is in line with previous versions of the task <ref type="bibr">(Telzer et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Telzer, Fuligni, Lieberman, &amp; Galvan, 2014)</ref>, and yielded 16 distinct trial types, each of which were repeated 8 times for a total task length of 128 trials. Participants were told their decisions during the task would also affect the initial $5 endowment their parent and friend received at the start of the study.</p><p>We opted to analyze the task in the same fashion as the CCT. The following HLM models were used to analyze the Donations Task in manner that was analogous to the CCT analyses.</p><p>Level 1 (within-participant):</p><p>(1) Logit(Decisionit) = π0i + π1i(Condition) + π2i(Gain Amt) + π3i(Loss Amt) + ɛit Level 2 (between-participants):</p><p>(2) π0i(intercept) = γ00 + γ01(Age) + γ02(Sex) γ03(PRQ) + γ04(FRQ) + u0i</p><p>(3) π1i(Condition) = γ10 + γ11(Age) + γ12(Sex) + γ13(PRQ) + γ14(FRQ) + u1i</p><p>(4) π2i(Gain Amt) = γ20 + γ21(Age) + γ22(Sex) + γ23(PRQ) + γ24(FRQ) + u2i</p><p>(5) π3i(Loss Amt) = γ30 + γ31(Age) + γ32(Sex) + γ33(PRQ) + γ34(FRQ) + u3i</p><p>In these equations, Decision refers to the tth decision for the ith individual during the Donations task (0 = reject proposal; 1 accept proposal). Condition still denotes whether a friend stood to gain at the expense of a parent (0) or if a parent stood to gain at the expense of the friend (1), but now does so for certain decisions. Thus, a positive association between Condition and logit(Decision) would mean that individuals were more likely to accept allocation proposals if a parent benefitted over a friend whereas a negative association would indicate the opposite. These models control for the amount a given target (parent/friend) was poised to receive on a given trial (Gain Amt) and the absolute value that the other target stood to lose (Loss Amount). As was the case with the CCT data in the main document, we first ran only the Level 1 model. Afterward, we added age and sex as covariates to level 2. Finally, we added additional scores of selfreported parent and friend relationship. Reward Type was not a covariate in this analysis since this task was only collected on the sample who could earn real rewards for parents and friends. All aforementioned analyses were pre-registered prior to collection of data for Sample 2 and are available on the OSF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental Results</head><p>Independent ratings of parent and friend traits replicate findings with relationship quality. After obtaining the MTurk ratings for each adjective/phrase, we averaged the ratings for each participant's adjectives/phrases describing their parent and friend into separate single scores (e.g., 1 average rating of all parent descriptors, 1 average rating of all friend descriptors). Next, we entered these scores in our previous hierarchical linear model in place of the IPPA (relationship quality) scores. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S1</ref>, Panel A, these analyses yielded results that replicated the prior finding with self-report scores of relationship quality in Sample 1, thereby providing converging evidence for our initial effect. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S1</ref>, Panel B depicts results for Sample 2 that yielded highly similar parameter estimates of the moderation effect that trended towards significance.</p><p>Family obligation as a motivator. After obtaining our results, we suspected they may be due to the fact that our participants may have relied on their parents for critical types of support that they do not receive from their friends (e.g., financial support). Thus, they may have felt more indebted towards their parents and felt obligated to prioritize them while completing the task. Since we did not collect measures of parent or friend obligation on sample in Sample 1 (i.e., subject pool), we opted to collect it as part of our follow-up MTurk study for Sample 1 to determine whether college-aged individuals evince self-reported differences in perceived obligation to parents or friends. A paired samples t-test revealed no significant differences between levels of perceived obligation towards parents and friends (MParent Obligation = 3.37, MFriend Obligation = 3.42; t(59) = -0.54, p &gt; .250). Consequently, although results to this follow-up analysis do not entirely rule out the possibility that differences obligation are driving our primary findings, they are ultimately inconclusive. Neither parent obligation nor friend obligation were significantly correlated with age (rs = .05, .17 respectively), though both were highly correlated with each other (r = .71, p &lt; .001).</p><p>The relationship between Condition and decision making for certain choices. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table S2</ref>, there were also no significant associations between Condition and decision making during instances of certain decision making. This suggests that the prioritization of individuals' parents vs friends when making decisions that have conflicting outcomes for each is invariant to certainty/uncertainty. Curiously, we observed a marginally significant moderating effect of age on the association between Condition and decision making in the anticipated direction (e.g., older individuals tend to favor parents over friends). This could suggest the presence of an age x decision setting (certain/uncertain) x Condition interaction such that older individuals (i.e., young adults) only favor their parents as the decision making setting becomes increasingly certain. With that said, this was the only model that showed an effect of age in the expected direction out of several similar analyses and therefore significant caution is required when interpreting these results. Lastly, we replicated the main document's findings with respect to the relationship quality. Though not depicted in the table, similar results (both in terms of parameter estimates and statistical significance) are obtained when swapping self-reported relationship quality with self-reported perceived obligation scores. These results further underscore the notion that individual differences in relationship quality with ones parents and friends may be the greatest determinant in how one chooses prioritize said social agents.</p><p>Results Split by Sample. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table S3</ref> depicts the results of the unconstrainted (Level 1 only) model for Sample 1. <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> shows results for testing Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3 (Panels A and B, respectively). <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table S5</ref> depicts the results of the unconstrained model for sample 2. <ref type="table">Table S6</ref> shows results for testing Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3 (Panels A and B, respectively). The fixed effect for Condition is positive and significant for the Sample 1 (simulated) but not for Sample 2 (real).</p><p>Additionally, splitting the results up by sample served as a way to follow-up on the significant interaction between Reward Type and Return and Risk (respectively, reported in the main document). Although the interaction term was significant, the effect of Return on decision making was identical in the two samples (.055 for sample 1 (simulated), .055 for sample 2 (real)). There was a similar trend for the effect of Risk (-.052 for sample 1 (simulated), -.066 for sample 2 (real)). Thus, although there was a statistically significant interaction between Reward Type and Return in addition to Reward Type and Risk, follow-up analyses reveal that reward type appeared to have a negligible impact on Return and Risk sensitivities during the performance on the CCT.

One such technique, known as a risk-return decomposition, involves explicitly partitioning risky scenarios into components of true reward and true risk(van Duijvenvoorde,   Blankenstein, Crone, &amp; Figner, 2017). We conducted a risk-return decomposition to dissociate the effect of Return (i.e., earnings) and the effect of Risk (i.e., outcome variability) on our participants decision making. By running a risk-return decomposition, we were able to test how participants use information about Risk and Return distinct from who stands to gain or lose</figDesc><table /><note>-Making Model.

As specified in our pre-registration document, the Level 1 model was first run with no predictors entered at Level 2. Next, age and sex were entered as the first level 2 predictors. Afterwards, we included relationship quality (parent and friend) and reward type. This means three models were run: (i) a model with no between-participant predictors (i.e., no Level 2 predictors); (ii) a model that only contained age and sex as between-participant predictors; (iii) a full model that included the aforementioned variables in addition to relationship quality and reward type.

As shown in Table 2 (Panel A), age moderated the trial-level association between decision making and Condition, such that older individuals were more likely to favor their friends, instead of parents, contrary to what we expected in Hypothesis 2. Age did not interact with either Return or Risk. Despite the significant effect of age in the first model, it was no longer significant when adding the other moderating terms to the model (Table 2, Panel B).</note></figure>

Hypothesis 2 We found that both parent and friend relationship quality significantly moderated the effect of Condition on decision making (Table 2, Panel B). Specifically, the continuous measures of parent and friend relationship quality entered at Level 2 moderated Level 1 associations. To follow-up and unpack these interactions, we first conducted a paired-samples t-test to compare relationship quality for parents and friends. Although parent and friend relationship quality were correlated (r = .229, p = .002), participants reported greater levels of relationship quality with their friend, compared to their parent (Parent mean = 3.72, Friend mean</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>A</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>B</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Predictor</cell><cell>γ</cell><cell>SE</cell><cell>p</cell><cell>γ</cell><cell>SE</cell><cell>p</cell></row><row><cell>Intercept</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Intercept</cell><cell>2.496</cell><cell>.092</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell><cell>2.416</cell><cell>.100</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Sex</cell><cell>0.130</cell><cell>.108</cell><cell>.229</cell><cell>0.130</cell><cell>.108</cell><cell>.233</cell></row><row><cell>Age</cell><cell>-0.001</cell><cell>.020</cell><cell>.949</cell><cell>-0.013</cell><cell>.020</cell><cell>.536</cell></row><row><cell>Parent RQ</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-0.294</cell><cell>.057</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Friend RQ</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.321</cell><cell>.081</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Reward Type</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.215</cell><cell>.086</cell><cell>.014</cell></row><row><cell>Condition</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Intercept</cell><cell>0.112</cell><cell>.067</cell><cell>.098</cell><cell>0.225</cell><cell>.063</cell><cell>.001</cell></row><row><cell>Sex</cell><cell>0.015</cell><cell>.076</cell><cell>.844</cell><cell>0.034</cell><cell>.070</cell><cell>.624</cell></row><row><cell>Age</cell><cell>-0.023</cell><cell>.012</cell><cell>.049</cell><cell>-0.006</cell><cell>.011</cell><cell>.599</cell></row><row><cell>Parent RQ</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.181</cell><cell>.044</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Friend RQ</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-0.297</cell><cell>.062</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Reward Type</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-0.283</cell><cell>.053</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Return</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Intercept</cell><cell>0.070</cell><cell>.006</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell><cell>0.057</cell><cell>.005</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Sex</cell><cell>-0.034</cell><cell>.006</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell><cell>-0.031</cell><cell>.006</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Age</cell><cell>-0.002</cell><cell>.001</cell><cell>.155</cell><cell>-0.003</cell><cell>.001</cell><cell>.011</cell></row><row><cell>Parent RQ</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.000</cell><cell>.003</cell><cell>.922</cell></row><row><cell>Friend RQ</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-0.011</cell><cell>.005</cell><cell>.025</cell></row><row><cell>Reward Type</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.024</cell><cell>.005</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Risk</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Intercept</cell><cell>-0.058</cell><cell>.004</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell><cell>-0.051</cell><cell>.004</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Sex</cell><cell>0.004</cell><cell>.004</cell><cell>.371</cell><cell>0.003</cell><cell>.004</cell><cell>.531</cell></row><row><cell>Age</cell><cell>0.000</cell><cell>.001</cell><cell>.825</cell><cell>0.001</cell><cell>.001</cell><cell>.523</cell></row><row><cell>Parent RQ</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>0.005</cell><cell>.002</cell><cell>.029</cell></row><row><cell>Friend RQ</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-0.003</cell><cell>.004</cell><cell>.455</cell></row><row><cell>Reward Type</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-0.014</cell><cell>.004</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row></table><note>predicted age effects such that individuals would be more likely to prioritize parents over peers with age.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">This was initially termed as 'Context' in our pre-registration document but has since been changed to 'Condition' for clarity.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">Technically, zero was the lowest value Risk SD one could take, provided one has flipped all of a given deck's gain cards and only loss cards remain. However, because this event was probabilistically unlikely, we included the next lowest possible value to give a more realistic range of what our participants encountered. Similarly, the lowest possible minimum for EV was -60, but the lowest the participants actually encountered is what is listed in the text.</note>
