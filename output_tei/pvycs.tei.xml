				<p>Recent evidence indicates that reward value encoding in humans is highly context-dependent, leading to suboptimal decisions in some cases. But whether this computational constraint on valuation is a shared feature of human cognition remains unknown. To address this question, we studied the behavior of individuals from across 11 countries of markedly different socioeconomic and cultural makeup using an experimental approach that reliably captures context effects in reinforcement learning. Our findings show that all samples presented evidence of similar sensitivity to context. Crucially, suboptimal decisions generated by context manipulation were not explained by risk aversion, as estimated through a separate description-based choice task (i.e., lotteries) consisting of matched decision offers. Conversely, risk aversion significantly differed across countries. Overall, our findings suggest that context-dependent reward value encoding is a hardcoded feature of human cognition, while description-based decision-making is significantly sensitive to cultural factors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction (917/750-1000)</head><p>Cross-cultural differences in economic decision-making processes have been investigated in several domains, such as risk preference and behavioural game theory. Although several qualitative features seem to be preserved (such as prospect theory-like preferences and delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2</ref> ), evidence has repeatedly shown culturally-driven differences in many decisionmaking traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5</ref> .</p><p>To date, efforts to assess the cross-cultural stability of decision-making processes have mainly (if not only) focused on what can be defined as "description-based" paradigms, i.e., using tasks where all the decision-relevant information such as prospective outcomes and their "costs" can be inferred from explicit cues or instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8</ref> .</p><p>However, little is known concerning the cross-cultural stability (or the lack thereof) of experiencebased decisions, which encompass all situations where the decision-making variables have to be inferred from past experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">10</ref> . One prominent conceptual framework to investigate experience-based decision processes is reinforcement learning (RL), whose empirical and experimental foundations span multiple disciplines from neuroscience to artificial intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">11</ref> .</p><p>The lack of cross-cultural investigation of human RL processes is particularly problematic, given that RL is a pervasive cognitive process, with many important implications for mental health, education and economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">15</ref> . Despite its general adaptive value (seek rewards and avoid punishments) laboratory-based research has illustrated that RL processes in many circumstances deviate from a statistical and normative standpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">17</ref> , Determining whether such RL reinforcement learning biases are cultural artefacts, or rather stable components of human decision processes, can provide additional fundamental hints to understand the computational constraints of bounded rationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19</ref> .</p><p>Among several features characterizing human RL, the notion of outcome (or reward) contextdependence has recently risen to prominence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">16</ref> . More specifically, a series of studies conducted mostly with Western, Educated, Industrialized and Democratic (WEIRD) populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">20</ref> have shown that in many RL tasks, participants encode outcomes (i.e., rewards and punishments) in a context-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">24</ref> . While there may not be a consensus yet concerning the exact functional form of such context-dependency, the available findings overwhelmingly favour the idea that subjective outcomes are calculated relatively, following some form of range normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">27</ref> . Such context-dependence-induced rescaling of subjective outcomes is often interpreted as a consequence of efficient information coding in the human brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">29</ref> . According to this hypothesis, this feature can be understood as the result of fundamental neurocomputational constraints akin to those observable in perceptual decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">32</ref> . In accordance with this proposal of outcome context-dependence in RL as a form of efficient coding, multiple studies using similar tasks in different species have consistently found evidence of rangevalue adaptation, which suggests that this may be an evolutionary stable, "hard coded", principle of brain functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">38</ref> .</p><p>One well-known consequence of context-dependence in RL is that, in some cases, it can induce suboptimal decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">27</ref> . In particular learning contexts, individuals mistakenly attribute higher subjective values to objectively worse options because of how these options are appraised in relation to the local reward distribution, resulting in choices that fail to maximize reward. If indeed there exists such a fundamental computational constraint in the human brain, the behavioural signatures of context-dependence should be a stable feature of decision-making, and thus persist across different populations and cultures. In the present work, we set out to test this hypothesis by leveraging a task capable of eliciting context-dependent RL behaviours, and deploying it across eleven countries of remarkably different socio-economic and cultural makeup (Argentina, Iran, Russia, Japan, China, India, Israel, Chile, Morocco, France and the United States).</p><p>This allowed us to test the cross-cultural stability of context-dependent value encoding in human RL, and thus assess for the first time its putative role as a core computational process of experience-based decision-making.</p><p>In addition, we also administered to our participants a description-based decision-making task that included the same decision contexts as the RL task. The rationale behind this second task was two-fold. First, it allowed us to determine to which extent choice behavior measured in the RL task can be explained by risk aversion, using standard procedures in behavioural economics.</p><p>Second, it gave us the opportunity to compare for the first time the variability of experiencebased and description-based decision-making processes across countries.</p><p>Our results indicate a remarkable similarity in how context effects manifest in decisions from experience and suboptimal choice across countries, consistent with the idea that outcome representation in human RL behaviours may reflect conserved constraints on cognition. Our results also showed that risk aversion inferred from the description-based lottery task could not account for these effects. Interestingly, description-based decisions were also found to be highly variable across countries, further confirming the functional dissociation between the behaviour elicited by the two modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">33</ref> . Exploratory analyses using independent socio-economic, cultural and cognitive measures taken from our samples further showed that the origin of crosscountry differences in description-based decisions is multifactorial, as previously found for risk and other cognitive domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">35</ref> . Overall, our results suggest that reinforcement (experiencebased) decision processes are much more culturally stable than description-based ones and have important implications for theories of bounded rationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19</ref> . We conclude this work by discussing the possible implications of these results for the current implementation of policies and interventions aimed at contrasting the burden of biased decision-making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">6</ref> Anllo et al.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural protocol</head><p>Our behavioural protocol consisted of a reinforcement learning (RL; i.e. experience-based) task, in the form of a previously validated two-armed bandit task <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> , followed by a description-based decision-making task consisting of choices between lotteries <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. Both decision-making tasks were preceded by dedicated instructions and a short training session, and succeeded by a series of questionnaires directed at obtaining information on participants' socioeconomic, cultural, and cognitive features, as well as general demographics (Supplementary Materials - <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig   S1)</ref>. The RL task consisted of two phases: a Learning phase and a Transfer phase. Its design and implementation reproduced that of Bavard et al., 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> . During the Learning phase, participants were presented with eight abstract icon cues, each representing a lottery of non-disclosed expected value, paired in four stable decision contexts. In the Learning phase, each decision context featured only two possible outcomes: either 10/0 points or 1/0 points. The outcomes were probabilistic (75% or 25%). For convenience, contexts were labelled by taking into account the difference in expected value between the most and the least rewarding option, i.e. the expected value-maximizing ("correct") and the expected value-minimizing ("wrong") options <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. In the ensuing Transfer phase, these same eight lotteries were rearranged into new decision contexts [as previously done in similar designs for humans and birds <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">38 ]</ref>. In addition to the change in decision contexts, the key difference between the Learning and the Transfer phases was that, while during the former participants were presented with complete feedback, in the latter no feedback was provided, so that choices could only be based on values learned during the Learning phase ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1B)</ref>. Finally, we conducted an additional task, which we identified as the Lottery task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1C)</ref>. There, the values (magnitudes and probabilities) of the options were explicitly disclosed. The Lottery task featured the same decision contexts used in the Transfer phase, and four additional contexts designed to better assess risk preferences. These last contexts consisted of choices comparing varying probabilities of winning 10 points (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%) against the certainty of winning 1 point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population Demographics</head><p>Our main goal was to test the replicability of context-dependence in RL across countries (while disentangling it from risk aversion as standardly assessed in economic value-based decisionmaking tasks). Thus, our final sample included 11 countries (USA, Israel, Japan, France, Chile, Argentina, Russia, Iran, China, Morocco, India), covering a total of 5 continents and 10 languages ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1D)</ref>. Country selection was aimed at portraying a gradual spread across the United Nations'</p><p>Human Development Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">39</ref> . This coefficient is built with many metrics, such as GDP, industrialization, mean education level, income inequality, and liberty indexes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1E, left)</ref>. To assess the cultural spread of the selected countries, we used the 1981-2014 dataset of Anllo et al.</p><p>Muthukrishna and colleagues' cultural distance metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">40</ref> , to estimate the cultural difference between each of the selected countries with respect to the USA and India, which represented the higher and lower HDI values in our sample <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1E, right)</ref>.</p><p>In order to ensure that our samples would adequately represent the culture of the country to which they belonged, inclusion criteria required that participants: (1) had the target country nationality, (2) resided in the target country, (3) had completed at least the full basic education cycle in the target country, and (4) spoke the country's official language as their native language. These criteria were assessed for each participant during a video meeting prior to launching the experiment. The meeting, task instructions, and questionnaires were delivered in each country's official language, by local researchers.</p><p>Additionally, to confirm the diversity of the sample beyond country macrometrics, participants completed individual questionnaires on socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">41</ref> , individualistic/collectivistic tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">42</ref> , centrality of religiosity in their social environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">43</ref> , and a cognitive reflection test <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">44</ref> (see Methods for a detailed description of each metric).</p><p>Sample sizes for each country were set based on a power analysis conducted based on the online results of Bavard et al., 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> (n = 46 per country, see Methods). After exclusions (failure to complete the task n = 43; troubleshooting/translation issues during task rollout n = 19), a remainder of n = 561 participants (342 female; mean age(SD) = 24.4(4.6)) composed the final sample (n = 51 on average per country). Separate linear regressions, using each of the demographic and sociocultural indexes as predictors of nationality, confirmed that country samples were significantly different in many respects. A summary of these differences, demographic information, sample sizes and exclusions can be found in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Detailed results of the regressions can be found in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcement learning task (experience-based)</head><p>We first looked at performance in both RL phases. We focused on correct responses (i.e., probability of picking the expected value-maximizing choice) as the behavioural dependent variable. Correct response rate was analysed separately in each RL phase (i.e. Learning and Transfer), as a function of decision context (within-subjects variable) and country (betweensubjects variable). We also compared the correct response rate against chance level (0.5) to assess learning and preferences. As in previous studies using the same or similar designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> , of particular relevance for the demonstration of outcome context-dependence were: i) the Results showed that the average correct response rate for the Learning phase was significantly different from chance level 0.5 for all countries and decision contexts ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 2A)</ref>  <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> for full regression results). While we found significant differences in aggregate performance between countries (Country main effect: χ2 = 58, DF = 10, p = &lt;.0001), learning and above-chance performance levels were observable in all samples and contexts ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. S2)</ref>.</p><p>Importantly, we did not find evidence for any magnitude effects in any of the country samples, meaning that the learning performance was the same in the ∆EV = 5 and the ∆EV = 0.5 in all countries (Decision context main effect: χ2 = 2, DF = 1, p = 0.14; Decision context x Country interaction: χ2 = 12, DF = 10, p = 0.29). Further AICc weight ratio analysis confirmed a lack of magnitude effect (i.e., a model including Decision Context as a regressor was 0.01 times as likely to predict accuracy as the same model without it).</p><p>We then turned to the analysis of the Transfer phase <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. In this case, correct choice rates were strongly modulated across decision contexts (Decision Context main effect: χ2 = 326, DF = 3, p = &lt;.0001). Here, we did not find evidence for any country effects (Country main effect: χ2 = 18, DF = 10, p = 0.05; Decision context x Country interaction: χ2 = 41, DF = 30, p = 0.09). Further  <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>). Once again, while significant differences in aggregate performance between samples were found (Country main effect: χ2 = 19, DF = 10, p = .04), the evidence did not indicate any interaction between country and decision contexts (Country x Decision context interaction: χ2 = 40, DF = 30, p = 0.1). Crucially, the presence of suboptimal behaviour in the ∆EV = 1.75 context was observable in every country (see Supplementary Materials -Table S5), with no significant differences between countries <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig 2.E, left;</ref> see Supplementary Materials - <ref type="table">Table   S6</ref> for post-hoc pairwise contrasts).</p><p>These results replicated previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> , and showed that the behavioural signatures of outcome context-dependence were cross-culturally stable in the RL task. Contrary to what a model encoding values on an absolute scale would have predicted, performance was not affected by the outcome magnitude during the Learning phase: this constitutes a positive manifestation of context-dependent adaptive coding . Additionally, preferences were globally below chance in the ∆EV = 1.75 condition. Namely, a previously optimal option (EV = 0.75) was preferred to a previously suboptimal option (EV = 2.5) despite its expected value being higher in the new decision context. This illustrated the already-known negative side of outcome context dependence in the context of RL: suboptimal decisions may arise when options are extrapolated from their original context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lottery task (description-based)</head><p>We then analysed participants' preferences in the description-based Lottery task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Figs. 2C, 2D</ref>).</p><p>We first considered choices in the decision problems aimed at benchmarking risk preferences, where a sure small payoff (1pt) was presented against risky options with varying probabilities of delivering a bigger payoff (10pts). These four decision problems allowed us to estimate risk preference, quantified as the decrease in expected value-maximizing choice rates as the probability for obtaining the larger payoff decreased (i.e. propensity to choose the objectively higher value option as the levels of risk for that option increased). Results showed a coherent modulation of decision context on choice behaviour: as the risk involved increased, choice ratios for the objectively higher value offers decreased for all countries (pooled sample: ∆EV = 9, 0.94  <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> for model selection, <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> for full regression results). Interestingly, while risk affected performance for all country samples, it did so differently across countries (Country main effect: χ2 = 57, DF = 10, p = &lt;.0001; Country x Decision Context interaction: χ2 = 100, DF = 30, p = &lt;.0001; see Supplementary Materials - <ref type="table">Table S5</ref> for per-country T-test analyses). This indicated that preferences expressed in the description-based task were not cross-culturally stable, unlike behaviour observed in the RL task.</p><p>After assessing the detectability of risk aversion in the benchmark decision contexts of the Lottery task, we analysed preferences in the decision contexts homologous to those of the Transfer phase in RL <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 2D)</ref>. This allowed us to directly compare between experience-based and description-based preferences. We focused mainly on the behaviour expressed at the ∆EV = 1.75 decision context, where a tendency to significantly choose suboptimal choices can be interpreted as a sign of context dependence in the RL task. Crucially, and contrary to RL behavior, results</p><p>showed that in all countries correct choice rate was significantly above chance for this decision problem in the description-based task (pooled sample: ∆EV = 7.25, 0.9 ± 0.1, t(560) = 58, p &lt;  <ref type="table">Table S6</ref> for post-hoc pairwise contrasts). In order to directly compare between descriptive and experiential choices at the ∆EV = 1.75 context, we modelled preferences in this decision context by including an additional regressor (Decision Type; levels: RL, Lottery). Results indicated a significant Decision Modality effect (χ2 = 216, DF = 1, p = &lt;.0001) that confirmed the difference between the two tasks.</p><p>Overall, results from the Lottery task illustrated two important points. First, we were able to detect significant across country behavioural differences in our sample. This excludes that absence of effect in the RL task can thus not be ascribed to a general inability of detecting behavioural differences with our protocol. Second, these findings showed that risk aversion, as inferred from preferences expressed in the Lottery task, could not account for preferences in the RL task. This was specifically true for the key ∆EV=1.75 decision context, where we observed a clear case of preference reversal when comparing the two decision modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">45</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational results</head><p>To quantify the observed decision-making strategies in a systematic manner that encompassed all decision contexts across all tasks, we formalized choice behaviour using simple models built around the notion of subjective outcome scaling. This choice was motivated by the fact that this outcome scaling process, described below, could satisfactorily and parsimoniously capture the behavioural consequences of both context-dependent outcomes (in RL) and decreasing marginal utility (in Lottery). In both tasks, the subjective value of a given outcome or payoff was adjusted through the implementation of a free parameter (0 ≤ ≤ 1) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">, = { 10 * , , = 10 , ℎ</formula><p>where Rscaled,t represented the scaled subjective outcome and Robj,t the objective unscaled outcome at trial t. For RL trials, we embedded the scaling process within a fully-parameterized version of the standard Q-learning algorithm, where option-dependent Q-values were learnt from the range-adapted reward term Rscaled. The algorithm also included free "temperature" [ ], As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 3A</ref>, scaling patterns conformed to these hypotheses. First, we found minimal evidence for differences between countries in νRL (νRL ~ Country; SS = 0.98, DF = 10, p = 0.07). We  <ref type="table">Table S7</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">"</formula><p>In sum, our computational approach confirmed strong evidence for stable cross-country outcome context-dependence in the RL task using a compact computational measure. A similar analysis performed in the Lottery task, confirmed that the preferences in the RL task could not be accounted for risk aversion inferred from the Lottery task. Crucially, these results also confirmed a difference in the stability of experience-and description-based processes across countries.</p><p>In order to discard that the differences found in scaling between phases could be confounded by differences in task performance (i.e., lack of learning, inattention), we reanalysed and refitted the data after excluding all participants who had less than 100% accuracy in choices involving fully-dominated options in the Lottery task (as seen in previous studies on economic preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">48</ref> ). In such contexts (i.e. ∆EV = 7.25 and ∆EV = 9), suboptimal choices can be ascribed to general inattention, or the use of task-irrelevant heuristics (e.g. basing choices on a cue's visual features, etc). These analyses, available in the Supplementary Materials section, confirmed that this strict elimination criterion improved overall performance (and resulted in less stochastic choices as proxied by the increase of both RL and LOT). However, even after exclusion of these participants (n = 124 Total remaining n = 437), we were still able to replicate all behavioural and computational patterns of results presented thus far (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary   Materials -Figs S5-S8</ref>). intercultural risk preferences, which show that individual differences rarely inform risk preferences, but country-level macrometric indexes are marginally better <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">35</ref> . It should be noted however that even when significant, the correlation magnitudes were considerably small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drivers of risk aversion differences</head><p>Nonetheless, it should be noted that cultural metrics generally predicted changes in νLOT , but not RL, which was consistent with the robustness of RL biases to cultural factors, as well as the gap between experiential and descriptive choices found in our main results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present work, we sought to assess the cross-cultural stability of a recently discovered but well-documented feature of human behaviour: context-dependent value encoding. It is important to underscore that however robust, the vast majority of the results concerning context effects in human RL come to date from WEIRD samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">49</ref> . This . In addition to our RL task, we also administered a description-based task featuring the same decision contexts. This allowed us to demonstrate for the first time that risk aversion (as standardly inferred in behavioural economics from lottery tasks) could not account for behavioural signatures of context-dependence in the RL task (especially suboptimal preferences).</p><p>Further, we have also shown that while experience-based processes and preferences were remarkably stable across the included countries, description-based processes were not.</p><p>By replicating the finding of value context-dependence outside the WEIRD space, our work shows that this cognitive process is not likely to be a simple cultural artefact <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">51</ref> . Of course, we acknowledge that our current sample is not diverse enough to argue for a definitive universality of contextual value encoding in RL. We also acknowledge that our samples may be neglecting within-country variations (some of the included countries contain within themselves very different ethnic and linguistic communities that we did not cover). However, the fact that our results would show this bias consistently throughout samples constitutes strong evidence in that direction, particularly since our samples were distinct enough to elicit between-country differences in explicit value-based choices. Future research efforts seeking to extend the present findings should consider testing in rural vs urban population setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">52</ref> , and across different social layers within the same societies 2 .</p><p>The presence of context-dependent value learning across such a diverse sample falls in line with numerous prior findings pointing to the reliability of the phenomenon. Multiple studies have shown the flexibility of context dependence across different contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">36</ref> , its validity for non-binary outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">24</ref> and non-binary decision spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">53</ref> , and different temporal learning dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">54</ref> .</p><p>Furthermore, instances of context-dependent value learning have also been observed reliably in a wide range of non-human animals, as diverse as mammals, birds and insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">55</ref> . The coincidence between our present cross-cultural results and the ample array of cross-species prior findings, reinforces the notion that RL processes may be largely hard-coded and evolutionary stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">56</ref> . Indeed, despite the incidental generation of suboptimal preferences (e.g., in the Anllo et al.</p><p>Transfer phase), context-dependent value learning likely presents an overall adaptive value.</p><p>Theoretical propositions suggest that the normativity of context-dependent value learning can be traced to at least two, not mutually-exclusive sources. First, it is possible that outcome-context dependence in RL may constitute just another manifestation of the adaptive coding phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">29</ref> . In adaptive coding theory, the neural representations of objective variables are transformed as a function of their underlying distribution, as a means to adjust to neural constraints in information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">58</ref> . Second, it is also possible that context-dependent value learning serves the purpose of maximizing performance (i.e., "fitness") in many ecological foraging situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">59</ref> . Namely, encoding the convenience of a choice with respect to its alternatives in context (i.e. storing the result of a computation rather than all of its components)</p><p>would be much less resource-intensive and ecological than committing to memory large repertoires of absolute values dissociated from their contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">60</ref> .</p><p>A crucial contribution of the present work is the analysis of behavioural performance in a description-based decision-making task featuring the same decision problems as in the Transfer phase (in addition to other benchmark decision problems). This allowed us, first and foremost, to rule out the possibility that an absence of cross-cultural variation in context-dependent value learning could be merely due to our inability to detect any cross-cultural differences in choice behaviour in our sample. This was not the case, as we observed that behavioural preferences elicited during the Lottery task were significantly different across countries, and in line with each sample's risk preferences. As with previous cross-cultural studies on decision-making, differences in lottery-elicited risk preferences were found to be multicausal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">35</ref> . Possible causes for this lack of clarity in the etiology of risk preferences can be traced to the diversity of methods used to quantify risk aversion across studies, and to the fact that most of the tested predictors evaluated so far have been shown to account for only small fractions of the total variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">35</ref> . As stated, pinpointing the cultural drivers of differences in risk preferences across countries was beyond the scope of the present work. Given their effect size and exploratory nature, these results can not be interpreted at the moment as anything more than venues for future research. Still, our findings highlight the necessity of developing a unified strategy for quantifying risk preferences, that may take into account the socio-economic, demographic and cognitive characteristics of intercultural samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">61</ref> .</p><p>Importantly, the addition of an explicit set of decision problems homologous to those of the RL task allowed us to compare experience-based and description-based choice behaviour. This led us to show, to the best of our knowledge for the very first time, that in otherwise comparable decision contexts, risk aversion as inferred from a standard lottery task does not explain preferences in the Transfer phase of a RL task. This was particularly noteworthy for the ∆EV = 1.75 decision context, in which suboptimal choice preferences are customarily considered a hallmark of context-dependence in value learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">38</ref> . Indeed, in the present work, preference reversal in this context was observable for all countries during RL, and shown to be different from risk-driven choice behaviour, thus calling for an alternative explanation.</p><p>These differences between the RL and Lottery tasks, concerning both subjective outcome encoding and cross-cultural stability, were well recapitulated by our modelling approach. We devised a simple parsimonious outcome-scaling process, that fitted to both experiential and described versions of our decision problems, leading to the emergence of two clearly showing that preferences for the same decision problems are strongly affected by the modality in which the problems are presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">62</ref> . This begs the question of whether or not differences in probability weighting, which are robustly reported between experience-based and descriptionbased decisions, could explain the observed discrepancy, and more specifically, the preference reversal in the ∆EV = 1.75 decision context 8 . Prima facie, the fact that the "1 point with 75%</p><p>chance" option would be preferred to the "10 points at 25% chance" option, is compatible with the traditional experienced-based pattern of underweighting rare events <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">63</ref> . However, it should be noted that for the preference reversal to derive solely from different probability weightings it would require a probability distortion much larger than what has commonly been observed in experiments and meta-analysis to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">64</ref> . Furthermore, the Learning phase of our experiencebased task featured complete feedback, a manipulation that makes feedback information independent from choice, and thus reduces or even eliminates insufficient probability sampling (which is the traditional explanation for the classical probability weighting of experience-based choices   <ref type="table">Table S2</ref> for average bonuses in local currencies).</p><p>Behavioural task: there were two behavioural tasks, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) task and the Lottery task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig 1.A)</ref>. The RL task was a direct reproduction of the probabilistic instrumental learning task performed in Experiment 7 of Bavard et al.,, 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> . Participants were asked to choose on a trial basis between the undisclosed lotteries of different 2-armed bandit problems, with the goal of maximizing overall reward. The Lottery task consisted of a standard economic decision-making task, where participants had to choose on a trial basis between two lotteries of known expected value, again with the intention of maximizing overall reward.</p><p>In the RL task, the lotteries for each decision context were represented by abstract stimuli (cues)</p><p>taken from randomly generated identicons. Identicons were generated so that hue and saturation had similar values within the HSLUV colour scheme (www.hsluv.org). In the Lottery task, cue cards displaying the reward and probability values for each option were used instead.</p><p>For all tasks, each decision context was formed by two cues, one at each side of the screen, equidistant to the screen centre. Each trial consisted of a single decision context. Stimulus location was pseudo-randomized, so that every cue would appear an equal number of times on each side of the screen.</p><p>In the RL task, participants had to complete a Learning phase, and then a Transfer phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">49</ref> . In the Learning phase <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1B, upper)</ref> 1.75). Crucially, the probability of obtaining a specific outcome from each cue remained the same as in the Learning phase <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1B, lower)</ref>. In the Lottery task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1C)</ref>, participants had to choose between explicit cue cards, which were paired reproducing the 4 decision contexts of the Transfer phase, and another 4 decision contexts comparing varying probabilities of winning 10 points (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%) versus the certainty of winning 1 point (∆EV = 9, ∆EV = 6.5, ∆EV = 4, ∆EV = 1.5). Neither Transfer phase nor the Lottery task presented any post-choice feedback:</p><p>choices were followed by a fixed 500 ms delay interval, after which "???" cue cards were displayed for 1000 ms. Each decision context of the RL task (4 in Learning phase, 4 in Transfer phase) was presented 30 times, for a total of 240 trials. Decision contexts of the Lottery task (4 reproducing Transfer, 4 benchmarking risk aversion) were presented 4 times each, for a total of 32 trials. Presentation order of decision contexts was pseudo-randomized within each phase, so that all trials of a given decision context would be cr lustered (i.e., "blocked" stimuli presentation).</p><p>Questionnaires: after completing the behavioural experiment, participants were required to complete several psychometric and socioeconomic questionnaires. Socioeconomic questionnaires included the Individualistic and collectivistic tendencies inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">42</ref> , the perceived Socioeconomic status in childhood, adulthood and social hierarchy questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">41</ref> , and the Centrality of religiosity questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">43</ref>  Procedure: Testing was conducted in a hybrid face-to-face/online format, where participants met a local experimenter for an online live debrief held in their local language to verify identity and cultural affiliation. After the interview, participants received a personalized link to a Gorilla server (www.gorilla.sc) where the experiment was hosted. After clicking on the link, participants were sent to a consent form, which they had to complete in order to access the actual experiment. The experiment started by providing written instructions on how to perform the task. It was explained to participants that they would have to choose between two different options over several trials, with the goal of maximizing overall point reward. It was told to them that they would have to make this decision without necessarily knowing the probability and magnitude of rewards for each option at first. Finally, it was explained at length that their final payoff would be affected by their choices, as rewards were convertible to actual currency. The possible outcomes in points (0, 1, and 10 points) were explicitly shown, as well as the point-currency conversion rate for their country (e.g. 1 point = 0.005 euros in France; see Supplementary Materials - <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>).</p><p>Instructions were followed by a short training session of 12 trials, designed to familiarize participants with response modality. Participants could decide to repeat the training session up to two times prior to starting the actual experiment. After finishing the training session, participants had to complete the RL task (Learning and Transfer), the Lottery task and the sociocultural questionnaires, in that order. The existence of the Transfer phase was not disclosed until the end of the Learning phase, to prevent the use of alternative strategies. Crucially, before starting the Transfer phase, participants were made explicitly aware of the fact that they would be presented with the same cues they had seen during the Learning phase, but combined in different pairs. Before starting the Lottery task, participants were shown an example of a cue card with its explicit reward probability and magnitude written on it, and were again instructed to choose the option that they thought would maximize overall point reward. in parameter values across countries), statistical significance was evaluated through standard linear models using country as a categorical predictor (e.g., νRL ~ Country). For those analyses, we reported F-statistic, Sum of Squares, P-value and Cohen's F. Post-hoc contrasts were calculated with their respective confidence intervals, through estimated marginal means analysis, and Pvalues were Benjamini-Hochberg corrected. In particular, whenever we had to assess whether choice rate performances were significantly different from chance, we performed additional ttests against chance level (0.5). In those cases, we reported the t-statistic, P-value, and Cohen's d to estimate effect size. The significant association between continuous quantities (e.g. between parameter value and performance at a given decision context) was tested through correlation analysis, where we reported T-statistic, degrees of freedom, P-values, and R-coefficient as effect size. To prove lack of effect, we conducted AICc weight ratio analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">74</ref> using a model containing the tested predictor (full) and its equivalent minus said predictor (null). </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( ) +1 = ( ) + * ( ( ) , − ( ) )</formula><p>where c is the learning rate for the chosen option, which, multiplied by the differecence between the Rscaled,t and Qt is the prediction error term. We then modelled participants' choice behaviour using a softmax decision rule that yielded the probability that for a state s a participant would choose, say, option a over option b according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( ) = 1 1 + * ( ( ) − ( ) )</formula><p>where β is the inverse temperature parameter. Low inverse temperatures (β → 0) cause the action to be stochastically equiprobable. High inverse temperatures (β → +∞) result in choices deterministically determined by the difference betwee the Q-values 11 . Our algorithm also included a forgetfulness parameter (0 ≤ ≤ 1) that allowed us to account for the possibility of forgetting the option values when moving from the Learning to the Transfer phases of the RL task. The Q-values used to fit (and simulate) the Transfer phase choices ( (: ) ) were calculated from the Q-values of the Learning phase (: )</p><p>as follows:</p><p>(: ) = (: ) * For Lottery task, expected utilities of individual lotteries were calculated based on the described probability ( ) its non-zero outcome and the subjective rescaled rewards ( , , calculated as for the Learning task).

Finally, in the Supplementary Materials -Alternative Models section we compared SCALING to three alternative computational models to discard other possible interpretations of our data. These included the ABSOLUTE model, which encoded outcomes on an absolute scale independently of the decision context in which they were presented; the ABSOLUTE-RISK model, which rescaled rewards for the RL task trials using the νLOT parameter fitted on Lottery task trials, in order to evaluate whether risk aversion predicted preference reversal; and the NEGLECT model, which assumed participants only learned the probabilities behind each choice, but ignored reward magnitude.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>comparison of accuracies between the ∆EV = 5.0 and the ∆EV = 0.5 decision contexts in the Learning phase (where absence of difference -magnitude effect -is taken as a sign of relative value learning) and ii) the preference expressed in the ∆EV = 1.75 decision context of the Transfer test (where below-chance accuracy is taken as an indicator of context-dependent value rescaling).</figDesc></figure>

Results strongly disfavoured Country as a relevant predictor of νRL in terms of information loss (i.e. full model having 0.23 times the strength of the null model). Second, evidence showed that νLOT differed significantly across country samples (νLOT ~ Country; SS = 3, DF = 10, p &lt; 0.01). Here, AICc weight ratio strongly favoured the Country effect model (full model being 16.65 times stronger than the null model). Finally, as seen in Fig. 3B, between-country pairwise contrasts revealed significant differences in νLOT (see Supplementary Materials -Table S9 for post-hoc pairwise contrasts). Indeed, νLOT differed substantially across countries, from quite substantial risk aversion (median νLOT = 0.28 in the Chilean sample) to moderate-high (median νLOT = 0.62 in the Israeli sample).Crucially, νLOT values were highly correlated with the risk aversion behavioural patterns previously observed in the ∆EV = 1.5 and ∆EV = 1.75 Lottery trials (R = 0.84 (95% CI = 0.81, 0.86) and p &lt; .0001; R = 0.64 (95% CI = 0.59, 0.69) and p &lt; .0001), and decorrelated from νRL (R = 0.08 (95% CI = 0, 0.16) and p = 0.24) (seeSupplementary Materials -Fig. S4,</figDesc></figure>

Sample size was determined through a power analysis based on the behavioural results of Bavard et al., 2021 online experiment 26 . In the ∆EV = 1.75 context of said experiment (blocked trials, complete feedback version), online participants reached a difference between choice rate and chance (0.5) of 0.27 ± 0.30 (mean ± SD). To obtain the same difference with a power of 0.95, the MATLAB function "samsizepwr.m" indicated that 46 participants per country were needed. Samples were allowed to exceed this limit by up to 20%, to ensure the desired power would be achieved regardless of potential participant exclusions. Exclusion criteria consisted of failure to complete the task (n = 43) and troubleshooting/translation issues during the online task rollout (n = 19). A remainder of n = 561 participants (342 female; mean age(SD) = 24.4(4.6)) composed the final sample. Ethics: research was carried out following the principles and guidelines for human experimentation provided in the Declaration of Helsinki (1964, revised in 2013). This study belongs to a series of experiments approved by the INSERM Ethical Review Committee/IRB00003888 on 13 November 2018. Wherever needed, this ethical authorization was seconded with further authorizations at the local level at the behest of each participating institution. All participants provided written informed consent before their inclusion.Payment: To sustain motivation throughout the experiment, participants were given a bonus depending on the number of points won in each task. To ensure motivation would be even across countries, each participating institution calculated the average cost of a local university lunch (inter-country average cost in euros: 5.8 ± 2.82), and divided it by the total amount of points to be potentially won throughout the experiment (i.e. 1275 points for a perfect run; average value of point in euros: 0.0045 ± 0.002; average bonus reward obtained in euros: 5.4±1.53). In addition to the bonus accrued through point accumulation, all participants received a flat participation rate equivalent to an additional student lunch (seeSupplementary Materials -</figDesc></figure>

Within pairs, each cue would lead to possible zero and nonzero outcomes with reciprocal probabilities (0.75/0.25 and 0.25/0.75). Each decision context featured only two possible outcomes: either 10/0 points or 1/0 points. Contexts were labeled by taking into account the difference in expected value between options (i.e., two ∆EV = 5 and two ∆EV = 0.5 decision contexts). Once a choice was made by clicking on a cue, a fixed 500 ms delay ensued, after which factual and counterfactual choice feedback was displayed for 1000 ms in the form of "10," "1," or "0" points cue cards. After Learning phase completion, the subtotal of points earned was displayed, together with its monetary equivalent in local currency.

Once finished with the experiment, participants were given a personalized completion code, and were tasked with sending this code to the experimenter by email to signal completion and trigger payment. The online debrief, task instructions, and questionnaires were all delivered in each country's official language, by local researchers. Statistical analyses: All statistical analyses were performed and visualized using R 69,70,71 . The main dependent variable was the correct choice rate, i.e., choices directed toward the option with the highest expected value.

For the Lottery task trials, we formalized choice behaviour based on the subjective expected value that participants attributed to each choice as a function of its inherent risk, by multiplying Rscaled,t by reward probability (as customarily done in standard linear utility models<ref type="bibr" target="#b53">46</ref> ). While we did retain choice temperature [ ] for this instance of the model, no memory actualization or learning processes were expected to take place during Lottery, which rendered and unnecessary. We differentiated between scaling and temperature in RL and Lottery decision contexts by fitting specific parameters as RL, RL and νLOT, LOT, respectively. We made sure that our fitting procedure allowed us to correctly recover the parameters in simulated datasets, as well as produce simulations that would closely replicate the observed behavioural data (see Supplementary Materials for procedure and results of simulations and parameter recovery).Utilizing the same scaling parameter [ ] in both models was a crucial step in the formalization, as it allowed us to compare experiential and descriptive adaptation mechanisms in the same terms, while integrating all the possible decision contexts. We expected νRL to reflect context-dependent range-value adaptation in the RL task, and νLOT to capture marginally decreasing utility (and therefore risk aversion) in the Lottery task. It follows that νRL was expected to remain invariant across country samples, confirming that relative value-encoding occurred universally, and independently of risk preferences. Conversely, we expected ν LOT to differ significantly between countries, in line with the observed risk aversion behaviours for each country sample, and to be decorrelated from νRL.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

It is important to underscore that, while for parsimony and commensurability purposes, we modelled preferences in RL and Lottery tasks with the same outcome-scaling model, this does not imply the assumption that both tasks share similar computational processes. Indeed, based on the present and other behavioural findings<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> it is likely these different value scaling schemes arise from different underlying computations altogether, respectively, outcome range-adaptation in RL and diminishing marginal</figDesc><table /><note>utility in Lottery (see Supplementary Materials for further considerations). It is nonetheless important to note that here we are not claiming that context-dependent valuation is exclusivity of experience (or reinforcement) based choices. In fact, many contextual effects have been documented in descriptive choices (such as the decoy effect). Further studies should determine whether such effects of description-based choices are cross-culturally stable. The present results broadly fit within the larger framework of the experience-description gap, by</note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>). Finally, the underweighting of rare events would not explain the absence of a magnitude effect during the RL Learning phase. Conversely, outcome context-dependence does provide a satisfactorily and parsimonious explanation for the observed choice patterns in both the Learning and Transfer phases.Anllo et al.    designing better decision architectures (bottom up) has gained traction<ref type="bibr" target="#b74">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">67</ref> . In the long-term, this approach may help improve both individual and collective decision-making in domains where biases and suboptimal decision-making represent key bottlenecks (e.g., issues such as choice of vaccination, or behaviours favouring environmental protection). Historically, decision models in (behavioural) economics, nudging and behaviourally-inspired policies have been based on description-based choice behaviour. Our results show that, compared to description-based processes, experience-based decision models are much more stable on a cross-cultural level, possibly capturing deep and preserved features of human cognition. We therefore believe that, especially if this pattern is confirmed and generalized to other tasks and processes, the present work calls for a better consideration of experience-based decision models in designing behavioural science-informed public policies in general.</figDesc><table /><note>Finally, we offer some reflection on the implications of our findings for behavioural science- inspired interventions in policy-making.
