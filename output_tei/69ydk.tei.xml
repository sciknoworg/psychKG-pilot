			<abstract>
				<p>Do we preferentially learn from positive rather than negative decision outcomes? Previous studies indicated that such bias characterises learning during simple reward learning tasks. However, no research has yet confirmed whether learning bias is also present during sequential decision making under uncertainty. To fill this gap, we utilised a complex yet ecologically valid paradigm, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), which measures risk-taking propensity under uncertainty in everyday decision making. Comparing learning from positive and negative outcomes in the BART has been made possible by the Scaled Target Learning model, which characterises both risk-taking propensity and sensitivity to wins and losses. For the first time, we applied this model to a modified BART paradigm with different levels of perceived uncertainty. Crucially, our analyses revealed learning bias during high levels of uncertainty, under which condition bias was negatively tied to task performance. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to wins compared to losses was linked to more risk-seeking behaviour across all conditions, suggesting that learning bias could mediate risky behaviour. Overall, our results contribute to a more accurate characterisation of reward learning behaviour and suggest that learning bias arises when the level of perceived uncertainty surges.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Despite abundant evidence exists in support of differential learning from positive and negative decision outcomes, the exact behavioural processes linked to such differential learning, including the potential modulatory role of uncertainty, are yet unclear.</p><p>Optimism bias, whereby people overestimate the probability of positive future events and underestimate the probability of negative future events, has been demonstrated in different walks of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kuzmanovic &amp; Rigoux, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sharot et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shepherd et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Weinstein, 1980)</ref> and is considered to originate from an asymmetry in belief updating. Evidence from simple instrumental learning tasks with <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(den Ouden et al., 2013;</ref> and without reversals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Frank et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lefebvre et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Niv et al., 2012)</ref> demonstrated that this asymmetry also characterises basic reinforcement learning, as indicated by higher positive compared to negative learning rates. Additionally, a recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Palminteri (2023)</ref> revealed learning bias to be present in 9 different two-armed bandit tasks with binary probabilistic outcomes and feedback, further suggesting that learning bias is a universal phenomenon in reinforcement learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Harada (2020)</ref> also revealed such a learning bias in the Iowa Gambling Task, a more complex and ecologically valid paradigm compared to the more abstract instrumental learning tasks used in the above studies. However, this bias disappeared with the introduction of dynamic, trial-wise learning rates in their reinforcement learning model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Harada, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, no studies yet reported whether this positivity bias in learning also exists during sequential decision making under uncertainty. To fill this gap, we utilised the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lejuez et al., 2002)</ref>, a popular and intuitive paradigm that measures risk-taking propensity by emulating an uncertain decision context with probabilistic rewards. In each experimental trial, participants are presented with a sequence of virtual balloons and have to repeatedly decide whether to take a risk by "pumping up" the balloon and potentially burst the balloon or collect the already accumulated sum. Each successful pump increases the amount of reward in the temporary bank but also the probability of a balloon to burst. A trial ends either by a balloon burst, in which case the temporary bank gets emptied and participants lose their earnings from the trial, or if participants choose to collect and transfer their earnings from the temporary to a permanent bank. The goal for participants is to maximise the reward earned by the end of the experiment. A major advantage of the BART lies in its external validity; the adjusted score (mean number of pumps for unexploded balloons) has been repeatedly associated with real life risk-taking behaviours such as smoking or substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aklin et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lejuez et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wallsten et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Until recently, there was no model to reliably estimate differential learning rates in the BART. The Bayesian Sequential Risk-Taking (BSR) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pleskac, 2008)</ref>, originally referred to as "model 3" by <ref type="bibr">Wallsten and colleagues (2005)</ref>, has been the most prominent model for the BART. Although the original, four-parameter BSR model incorporates learning, its parameters representing initial belief and updating of subjective burst probability were found to be unreliable estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pleskac, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2011)</ref>. This led to a simplification of the model, dubbed BSR-2, with only two parameters indexing the decision maker's risk-taking propensity and behavioural consistency. Although these two parameters can be recovered reliably, the BSR-2 (and the original BSR model) makes two simplifying assumptions that limit its applicability to a variety of BART paradigms. First, it presumes that burst probabilities are constant across all steps of balloon inflation, suggesting that the model may not generalise well to paradigms with gradually increasing burst probabilities across pumps. Second, participants are assumed to be informed about burst probability, which is incompatible with both real life decision making and most studies where participants are expected to learn through trial and error. As a final drawback, whilst the risk-taking propensity parameter in the BSR model showed good external validity against real-life risk-taking measures, it provided little information about risk-taking propensity beyond that of the adjusted score, which is significantly easier to derive <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Wallsten et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>To capture differential learning in the BART, <ref type="bibr">Zhou and colleagues (2021)</ref> developed the hierarchical Scaled Target Learning (STL) model, which characterises both participants' risk-taking propensity and the extent to which they learn from past experiences. The model encompasses four parameters, which estimate participants' target number of pumps, behavioural consistency, and the degree to which they adjust their target number of pumps in response to positive and negative feedback.</p><p>The extension of STL, the Scaled Target Learning model with Decay (STL-D), includes an additional decay parameter that estimates how fast participants' adjustments of their target number of pumps decay across trials.</p><p>Zhou and colleagues found both their models to have satisfactory parameter recovery and predictive accuracy, with STL-D outperforming STL in most data sets.</p><p>Furthermore, STL and STL-D's parameter estimate for the target number of pumps and behavioural consistency showed improved external validity compared to the adjusted BART score and the corresponding parameters in the BSR and BSR-2 models, suggesting an improved ability to capture individual differences in risk-taking propensity. Crucially, both learning parameters in the STL(-D) showed good external validity, implying that they adequately characterise learning from one trial to the next. When comparing the STL(-D) against the BSR and BSR-2 models, the former outperformed both models in terms of parameter recovery, predictive accuracy, and external validity. With improved model performance compared to the prominent BSR models, STL(-D) seems a promising tool for improving our understanding of the complex psychological processes underlying the BART, including both risk-taking propensity and differential learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current study</head><p>In this study, we fit hierarchical STL and STL-D models to a modified version of the BART paradigm to investigate the degree to which learning bias characterises sequential decision making under different levels of uncertainty. Each participant completed three phases of the BART, characterised by different levels of burst probabilities leading to variable levels of perceived uncertainty across observers. To increase ecological validity, burst probabilities exponentially increased across pumps, mirroring real balloons that are more likely to explode with more and more inflation.</p><p>First, all participants completed a baseline phase, characterised by an intermediate level of balloon burst probability function, followed by a lucky or an unlucky phase.</p><p>The lucky phase had a more moderate and the unlucky phase had a steeper increase in their respective balloon burst probability functions compared to the baseline phase. To measure potential order effects that may have confounded behaviour, the order of the lucky and unlucky phases was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>Since human participants flexibly adapt their decision making under different levels of risk and uncertainty in the BART <ref type="bibr">(Kóbor et al., 2023)</ref>, we did not expect significant differences in participants' risk-taking propensity or learning between the order in which each phase was completed. Given the well-established phenomenon whereby learning rates surge with increasing levels of environmental uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Browning et al., 2015;</ref>, we expected the learning rates in the unlucky phase to exceed those in the lucky condition. Crucially, evidence for this effect would provide further support that the learning parameters in STL <ref type="bibr">(-D)</ref> accurately capture learning in the BART, which was the motivation for developing these models. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first application of these models to a modified BART paradigm.</p><p>In line with results indicating a learning bias in instrumental learning tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(den Ouden et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Frank et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Harada, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lefebvre et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Niv et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Palminteri, 2023;</ref>, we expected that a learning bias would also characterise behaviour in the BART. Additionally, we were also interested in how learning bias is related to risk-taking propensity and performance, i.e., the amount of points earned during the experiment. Given that increased learning from positive compared to negative outcomes has been associated with overestimating the value of the riskier decision alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Niv et al., 2012)</ref>, we hypothesised that the magnitude of learning rate bias would be positively associated with risk-taking propensity. However, results regarding the relationship between learning rate bias and performance have been mixed. Whilst <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Harada (2020)</ref> found a negative association between these measures, <ref type="bibr">Lefebvre and colleagues (2017)</ref> reported no difference in performance between participants with and without a learning bias. At the same time,  reported a negative association between learning bias and performance only following reversals in reward contingencies but not during a stable period of a two-armed bandit task. By investigating how learning bias is linked to performance under different levels of uncertainty, we aim to clarify the conditions under which learning bias affects performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of N =50 student participants (age: M = 21.3 years, SD = 2.5 years) took part in the experiment, who were recruited from university courses (for a priori power analysis, see the supplementary methods &amp; results section). Participants were randomly assigned to either of the order conditions (Order 1: 6 males, 19 females, Order 2: 4 males, 21 females, Order 1: M = 21.6 years, SD = 2.8 years, Order 2: M = 21 years, SD = 2.2 years). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, reported no existing psychiatric or neurological conditions, and were not taking psychoactive medication at the time of the experiment. Before enrollment in the study, all participants provided written informed consent. The experiment was approved by the United Ethical Review Committee for Research in Psychology <ref type="bibr">(EPKEB)</ref> in Hungary, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Participants received course credits in exchange for participation as well as a supermarket voucher. Whilst participants were told that the value of this voucher would vary between 1000-2000 HUF (the equivalent of €2.5 -€5) depending on their performance in the task, all participants received a voucher worth 2000 HUF at the end of the study. All participants were retained in all of our analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and task</head><p>We utilised a modified version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fein &amp; Chang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kóbor et al., 2015;</ref> to explore whether a learning bias characterises behaviour during sequential decision making under uncertainty. The BART was first proposed by <ref type="bibr">Lejuez and colleges (2002)</ref> and has since been established as a widely used and well-validated measure of risk-taking propensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aklin et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lejuez et al., 2003)</ref>. The modified version of the task allowed for shorter trial lengths, which kept the duration of the experiment within a reasonable time range. Furthermore, the implementation of incremental potential reward values allowed for a more 8 accurate assessment of individual differences in risk-taking propensity <ref type="bibr">(Éltető et al., 2019)</ref>. The task was implemented in Presentation (Version 21.1, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA) and responses were recorded via a Cedrus RB-540 response device (Cedrus Corporation, San Pedro, CA).</p><p>During the task, participants had to repeatedly decide whether to continue <ref type="bibr">("pump")</ref> or stop inflating a virtual balloon that could either increase in size or explode following each inflation step. Successful balloon pumps increased the size of the balloon as well as the reward, but also the likelihood of a balloon burst. Participants used two response keys of the response device to indicate their decision to further pump a balloon or finish the trial and collect their accumulated score from the trial (cash-out). A balloon inflation could result in two outcomes; the balloon would increase in size together with the accumulated score (positive feedback) or the balloon would burst (negative feedback). In case participants decided to stop inflating the balloon, their score earnt in the trial would be transferred to a virtual permanent bank. If a balloon burst ended the trial, the accumulated score in that trial was lost without a decrease in the participant's score in the permanent bank. Participants were instructed to maximise their total score in the task, reflected by the accumulated score in their virtual permanent bank.</p><p>During the task, participants could continuously see their accumulated score in the current trial, which was displayed in the middle of the balloon. The accumulated score in the permanent bank, the score collected in the previous trial, and the response key options for inflating the balloon and collecting the accumulated score were also displayed throughout the experiment. The feedback of a balloon burst was represented by a fragmented balloon and the cash-out screen informed participants about the score they earnt in the trial <ref type="figure">( Fig.1</ref> ). Each feedback screen was presented for 3000 ms and participants' responses were not limited in time.</p><p>Participants completed a total of 270 trials in the experiment, divided into three 90-trial phases, each characterised by different balloon burst probabilities. The baseline phase was characterised by an intermediate level of balloon burst probability, which probability increased in the unlucky phase and decreased in the lucky phase. Each participant started the task with a baseline phase, after which half of the participants first completed the lucky phase followed by the unlucky phase (Order 1) or continued with the unlucky phase and finished the task with the lucky phase (Order 2). In the baseline and lucky phases, the maximum number of balloon inflation steps was 20, whilst this was limited to in the unlucky phase. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. An example trial of the modified BART. Participants had to repeatedly decide whether to continue inflating a virtual balloon, which could either increase in size or explode, or stop inflating and cash out their accumulated score from the trial. Each inflation step increased the balloon's size and the reward as well as the likelihood of a balloon burst (Eq.1). Participants could see their score accumulated in the current trial in the balloon and had no time limit to respond.</p><p>The balloon would not explode following the first two inflations in any of the phases, after which point the probability of balloon burst increased. The burst probabilities for each inflation steps were determined according to </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) = 1 , =<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P(e k ) is the probability that the balloon explodes on the k th inflation step, and npump k represents the pump (i.e., inflation) number within trial k . Thus, the balloon would explode on the 20th pump in the baseline and lucky phases and on the 10th pump in the unlucky phase ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.2 )</ref>. As a result of the distinct burst probabilities in the different phases of the experiment, the optimal number of pumps differed in each phase. For baseline balloons, it was most advantageous to inflate the balloon 13 times, whilst the highest expected return was associated with 19 and 6 pumps in the lucky and unlucky phases, respectively (for more details, see the Supplementary Methods in <ref type="bibr">Kóbor et al., 2023)</ref>. Participants were naïve regarding the burst probabilities in the experiment, including the zero probability of balloon burst in the first two inflation opportunities. Participants were also unaware that burst probabilities would change during the experiment, and the beginning of a new phase was not signalled to participants. . Experimental design a, Illustration of the balloon burst probabilities in each phase of the experiment. Balloon bursts were disabled for the first two balloon pumps in each phase, after which burst probability was controlled by a separate truncated power function for each phase (Eq.1). The balloon was certain to explode on the 20th pump in the baseline and lucky phases and on the 10th pump in the unlucky phase. b, Representation of the two experimental groups. In both groups, participants first completed trials of baseline balloons. After these, participants in Order 1 faced 90 lucky balloons, followed by 90 unlucky balloons. Order 2 counterbalanced the order of the lucky and unlucky balloons; baseline balloons were succeeded by a set of 90 unlucky balloons, then a set of 90 lucky balloons.</p><p>For each successful balloon inflation within trial k , the number of points participants earned equaled the latest pump number npump k . Thus, participants could gain one point for the first successful balloon inflation, two for the second successful inflation (with an accumulated score of 3 in the trial), three for the third successful inflation (with an accumulated score of 6 in the trial), and so on. Participants' overall score was calculated as the sum of points earned in each trial of the experiment.</p><p>Participants could freely decide whether to inflate the balloon or collect their accumulated score in 80 trials in each phase. In the remaining 10 trials of each phase, participants were instructed to either inflate the balloon to a predetermined point or until it exploded. These forced-choice trials were included in the experiment to guide participants towards the optimal number of pumps in each phase, and were presented in the same predetermined trial positions to all participants in order to control for across-participant variance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>During recruitment, participants took part in a neuropsychological assessment in order to evaluate potential factors that could alter their performance in the BART, including impulsivity, depression, or anxiety. Selected participants took part in two separate experimental sessions. On the first day, participants were asked about any existing medical conditions and medication regimens, their consumption of cognitive performance enhancing drugs, and their motor skills and alertness levels were evaluated. Participants' emotional affect and cognitive performance such as executive functions and working memory were also evaluated. These measurements were collected to pursue hypotheses not explored in this work.</p><p>On the second day, participants were questioned about factors that could affect their cognitive performance such as sleep quality, mood, alertness, and whether they consumed cognitive performance enhancing drugs. Additionally, participants' emotional affect was also evaluated. Before beginning the BART, participants had the chance to practise the task with the experimenter, which included six forced-choice balloon trials. During the main task, participants could take predetermined short breaks every 20-25 trials, and there was an additional larger break halfway through the experiment. The BART was followed by a short verbal interview to assess participants' strategies throughout the task and the degree to which they had awareness of the presence of the different phases in the experiment. These results are not described in this study. During the task, continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) data were also recorded. As the analysis of electrophysiological data is outside the scope of this study, details on the recording and analysis of the EEG data are omitted. Altogether, the second experimental session took approximately 2-2.5 hours.</p></div>

In STL, k is scaled by the design parameter nmax, representing the maximum pump number possible in each trial , so that the value of k falls between 0 and 1. This was implemented in order to account for two phenomena observed in the BART. First, participants tend to increase their pumps following a win with a larger compared to a smaller reward value. Second, participants tend to pump <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">14   2     2     2     2     2     2     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3     3</ref> more following a loss with a higher compared to a lower reward that could have been obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Schmitz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning bias</head><p>We utilised both individual-and group-level (see Supplementary section) analyses to determine whether learning bias is present in the BART under varying levels of uncertainty. First, we carried out one-tailed, undirected t-tests assessing whether the participant-wise normalised learning rate difference (Eq.5) is significantly different from zero in each phase of the experiment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">( Fig.6a )</ref> To examine the link between learning bias and risk-taking propensity as well as performance, we established Pearson correlations across participants. To measure risk-taking propensity, we utilised the adjusted score, i.e., the mean number of pumps in trials with unexploded balloons. We quantified participants' performance as the number of points earned in each phase. We correlated the participant-specific adjusted score and the number of points earned with individual-level estimates of the normalised learning rate difference (learning rate bias, Eq.5) in each phase.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.6b</ref> , we found that the magnitude of the learning bias was positively associated with the adjusted score in all phases ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.6b</ref> ; baseline: r (48) = .53 , p &lt; .001, lucky: r (48) = .35 , p = .01, unlucky: r (48) = .47, p &lt; .001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We provide evidence for learning bias in sequential decision making under uncertainty, which appears to be dependent on increased levels of perceived uncertainty. Moreover, learning bias was negatively associated with performance only under the highest level of uncertainty, further implying the important modulatory role of uncertainty. Additionally, learning bias and risk-taking propensity were positively associated in all conditions, implying that the degree of learning bias may universally shape risk-taking preferences. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first application of the STL and STL-D models since their original development <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>, with both models appearing to accurately capture both risk-taking propensity and the learning process in a modified version of the BART.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning bias</head><p>The presence of learning rate bias under increased uncertainty is consistent with previous studies reporting learning bias during instrumental learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(den Ouden et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Frank et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lefebvre et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Niv et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Palminteri, 2023;</ref>. Whilst <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Harada (2020)</ref> found learning bias in the Iowa Gambling Task, a similar paradigm to the BART compared to two-armed bandit tasks, when estimating static learning rates, this bias disappeared with the introduction of time-varying learning rates in their Q-learning model. Although STL-D does not estimate learning rates for each trial, it models learning as a non-stationary, decaying process with linearly decreasing learning rates across trials. Consequently, our results provide evidence that learning bias is not merely a by-product of static learning rates.</p><p>Overall, results from both the current and previous <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(den Ouden et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Frank et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Harada, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lefebvre et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Niv et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Palminteri, 2023;</ref>  Both our Bayesian analyses at the group-level ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig.1</ref> ) and our frequentist analyses at the individual-level ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.6</ref> ) implicated learning bias in the unlucky but not in the lucky condition. The two lines of analyses diverged when it comes to the baseline phase; the individual-level analysis suggested that learning bias was present in this phase, whilst the group-level analysis could not credibly confirm this. It is worth noting that group-level comparison is inherently more conservative as it reflects the behaviour of an entire group, including participants with both low and high bias. At the same time, although drawn from a population distribution, participant-specific parameters can accommodate individual differences in behaviour.</p><p>As such, individual-level analyses may be more accurate in capturing participants' underlying behaviour, implying that learning bias was indeed present in the baseline phase.</p><p>Despite learning bias appearing as a robust phenomenon across different instrumental learning tasks, its purpose and behavioural implications have remained elusive.</p><p>Palminteri et al. <ref type="formula">2017</ref>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Palminteri's (2023)</ref> meta-analysis showed that learning bias in two-armed bandit tasks arises from a confirmation bias, rather than a positivity bias. In other words, participants seemed to preferentially learn from positive outcomes because the outcome confirms their choice strategy, not on the grounds that they are positively valenced. However, these studies utilised cognitive models with static learning rates, which may not be perfectly suited to account for the stationary reward contingencies of the task. As current BART models do not allow for the differentiation of confirmation or valence-induced bias, meaningful assessment awaits the development of further paradigms and cognitive models.</p><p>In line with the account that reinforcement learning is inherently related to risk-sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Niv et al., 2012)</ref>, our results indicate a consistent positive association between the adjusted score, used to index risk-taking propensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aklin et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lejuez et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wallsten et al., 2005)</ref>, and learning bias across all experimental conditions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">( Fig.6 b)</ref>. At the same time, both learning rates showed a negative relationship with the adjusted score ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Supplementary Fig.2</ref> ). These results are consistent with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Niv et al., 2002;</ref> and can be explained within 28 reinforcement learning theory. Specifically, higher learning rates cause more fluctuation in estimated value and therefore lead to more risk-aversion. If positive feedback increases stimulus value more than negative feedback decreases it, then stimulus value will be higher than the mean nominal outcome, leading to increased risk-seeking. Consequently, biassed learning towards positive outcomes leads to an overestimation of values, resulting in a higher target number of pumps, as borne out by our results. Our results also indicated that compared to vwin , vloss is more consistently and more strongly linked to risk-taking propensity. If learning bias indeed arises from reduced negative feedback processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lefebvre et al., 2017)</ref>, it is plausible that the inverse relationship between vloss and risk-aversion on the one hand, and learning bias and risk-aversion on the other hand, represent the same cognitive process. Thus, although our study provides evidence that learning bias may underlie risky behaviour, future research should confirm whether this association exists beyond the increased risk-aversion resulting from reduced negative outcome processing.</p><p>Our results also confirm previously reported associations between reward learning and performance. First, we found that increased learning from positive and negative feedback (except in the unlucky phase) was associated with lower performance across the different experimental phases ( <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig.3</ref> ). This is consistent with the notion that a slower integration of outcomes is necessary for the generalisation of probabilistic reward values <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Frank et al., 2007)</ref>. We speculate that increased learning from negative feedback did not remain maladaptive in the unlucky phase as the change in reward contingencies in this condition was indicated by balloon bursts, requiring adaptation that is primarily based on negative feedback.</p><p>Additionally, we found that learning bias was only significantly related to performance in the unlucky phase ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.6c</ref> ), where increased bias was associated with reduced performance. This reflects the contradictory results across previous studies whereby learning bias was found to be maladaptive by Harada (2020) but not by <ref type="bibr">Lefebvre and colleagues (2017)</ref>. Our results exhibit a strikingly similar pattern to those by <ref type="bibr">Palminteri and colleagues (2017)</ref> in that higher learning bias was only found to be 29 maladaptive with the introduction of increased environmental uncertainty (reversals).</p><p>Palminteri and colleagues also showed that this decreased ability to flexibly adapt to changing, uncertain environments results from confirmation bias, whereby participants showed increased perseveration despite obtaining new information from negative feedback. Simulations by Caze and van der Meer (2013) also suggested that the (mal)adaptiveness of learning bias (either in favour of positive or negative feedback processing) depends on environmental attributes such as the rate of reward.</p><p>Considering these results, it is likely that both the presence and maladaptiveness of learning bias is contingent on environmental features (i.e., uncertainty), perhaps as a means to flexibly adjust one's exploration-exploitation strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Harada, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, even if undue optimism has a net negative impact on learning, it may still be a "self-serving" feature of human cognition that promotes self-esteem and confidence, both of which are related to positive life outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carver et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Weinstein et al., 1980)</ref>.</p></div>

Unlike the BSR models, STL(-D) can be applied to paradigms with gradually increasing burst probabilities and does not require participants to be aware of the underlying burst probabilities, and can be consequently applied to a greater variety of experimental paradigms.</p><p>Consistent with <ref type="bibr">Zhou and colleagues' (2021)</ref> findings, the STL model appears to be improved on by its extension, STL-D, implying that in contrast to assuming constant learning, a linearly decaying learning process better characterises behaviour in the BART. These results parallel other findings in the reinforcement learning literature that indicate improved model fit for Q-learning models including decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Geana et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Radulescu et al., 2016;</ref>. The decay parameter in STL-D indicates how fast adjustments in pumping behaviour decline with experience (Eq.4). That is, higher decay reflects a larger weight of past experiences as participants change their pumping behaviour the most in the beginning of the experiment and adjust their behaviour progressively less across trials. Indeed, given that reward contingencies changed with the introduction of a new experimental phase and each phase is modelled separately, it is adaptive to integrate feedback information over a longer period of time to avoid behaviour being overly influenced by the most recent outcomes throughout the experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Frank et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, the higher decay in the unlucky compared to the lucky phase suggests increased emphasis on learning in the beginning of the phase. Considering that higher decay is adaptive with the introduction of a larger change in reward contingencies (i.e., in the unlucky phase), the decay parameter in STL-D appears to constitute a meaningful addition to modelling the learning process in the BART. In line with our initial expectation that humans flexibly adapt their decision making in response to the level of environmental uncertainty <ref type="bibr">(Kóbor et al., 2023)</ref>, we did not find significant differences in the STL-D parameters reflecting participants' target level of pumps, learning rates, or decay across the two orders. Whilst we observed a significant order effect in the behavioural consistency parameter, this was largely driven by three outliers in the lucky phase of Order 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">( Fig.6b )</ref>, which questions the generality of this effect. Furthermore, our results suggest increased behavioural consistency and target level of pumps in the unlucky compared to the lucky phase.</p><p>Although this may seem counterintuitive, both parameters are proportional to the maximum number of pumps, which differed across the two conditions. Despite participants pumped less in the unlucky compared to the lucky phase, the lower number of possible pumps in the unlucky phase generated higher parameter estimates for the target number of pumps and behavioural consistency.</p><p>This counter-intuitive conclusion likely stems from modifications to the original BART paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lejuez et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wallsten et al., 2005)</ref>, which had a substantially higher maximum burst point as well as constant burst probabilities across balloons. In fact, STL and STL-D are applicable to paradigms with gradually increasing burst probabilities and meaningful comparison across conditions with different maximum burst probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>. However, it appears that simultaneous adjustments in these aspects of the task, including large differences in maximum burst points across conditions, may result in a biassed comparison across conditions or experiments. To reliably compare participants' behavioural consistency and target number of pumps, future studies should implement similar maximum burst points across conditions or utilise cognitive models without a scaling property.</p><p>It is also worth bearing in mind that the current version of the BART included forced choice trials to guide participants towards the optimising number of pumps in each phase. This manipulation was systematic; all participants followed the same instructions in the same trials throughout the experiment. Reassuringly, modelling only free choice or both free and forced-choice trials resulted in similar STL <ref type="bibr">(-D)</ref> parameters estimates, suggesting that the inclusion of forced-choice trials did not 32 from other BART studies.</p></div>

Moreover, recent work from our lab <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ban, 2024)</ref> suggests that the early system is linked to uncertainty processing as well as the locus-coeruleus noradrenergic system (LC-NA), which implies the potential modulatory role of these networks in partly generating learning bias.</p><p>Even though we collected EEG data during the experiment, the paradigm was not originally designed for exploring the neural signatures of learning bias.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size calculations</head><p>To test whether a learning bias (calculated as the normalised difference in differential learning rates; Eq.5) characterises behaviour in the BART, we planned to carry out undirected t -tests for each phase. We conducted an a priori power analysis in G*Power <ref type="bibr">(version, ref)</ref> for sample size estimation. Our effect size was determined to be .5</p><p>based on a calculation including a null hypothesis mean of 0, an alternative hypothesis mean of .2, and a standard deviation of .4. We selected a conservative value of .2 for the difference in learning bias means, which was previously indicated to lie near .4 . Given the lack of existing results indicating the standard deviation of normalised learning rate bias in a full sample of participants, we opted to estimate our effect size based on the conservative estimate of SD = .4.</p><p>With a significance criterion of = .05 and power = .9, the minimum sample size required for our determined effect size was N = 44. Our obtained sample size of N = 50 should thus be appropriate for testing our central hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian analysis of learning bias</head><p>To confirm our results regarding the presence of learning bias in each experimental condition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.6a</ref> ), we compared group-level estimates of vwin and vloss from STL-D within the Bayesian framework. Specifically, we calculated the 95% highest density intervals (HDIs) to assess the group-level difference in learning rates, quantified by subtracting the group-level estimates of vloss from the group-level estimates of vwin .</p><p>We considered the difference in the group-level learning rates to be credible if the 95% HDIs did not contain zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kruschke, 2014)</ref>. We carried out this analysis separately for each experimental phase. We found the learning rate difference to be Learning rates and risk-taking propensity</p><p>To evaluate the degree of association between individual-level learning rates vwin as well as vloss and risk-taking propensity, we employed across-participant Pearson's correlations. We utilised the adjusted score (mean number of pumps across unexploded balloons) as a proxy for risk-taking propensity. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Supplementary Figure 2</ref> shows, the adjusted score significantly and negatively correlated with vloss in all phases (baseline: r (48) = -.64 , p &lt; .001, lucky: r (48) = -.47 , p &lt; .001, unlucky: r (48) = -.66 , p &lt; .001). Similarly, we found a significant negative correlation between the adjusted score and vwin in the baseline ( r (48) = -.36, p = .01) and lucky ( r (48) = -.28, p = .045) phases, but not in the unlucky phase ( r (48) = -.22, p = .11). These results are consistent with previous findings that indicated a negative association between risk-taking propensity and learning rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Niv et al., 2012;</ref>),</p><p>suggesting that elevated learning rates are linked to more risk-averse behaviour. </p></div>
