			<abstract>
				<p>Humans have a fascination with quantifying behaviors. While numbers can provide intriguing insights, they can also distort public perceptions and misguide policy design. This article deconstructs the popular belief that individuals make 200 mindless food-related decisions a day, offering alternative perspectives on the conceptualization and measurement of food decisions. Specifically, we argue that existing decision-making theories offer limited guidance in defining and measuring such decisions, and advocate for more precise operationalizations. We emphasize the need for contextual understanding over simplistic numerical representations, propose a comprehensive working definition of food decisions, and consider alternative methods that may be better suited to capturing the complexity and nuance of food decisions. To conclude, we advocate for methodological pluralism in studying food decisions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Numbers are fascinating. They shape people's understanding of the world and give the impression of precision, knowledge, and control <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lupton, 2016)</ref>. From the controversial p value of 0.05 to the undisputed speed of light of 299,792,458 m/s, humans rely on numbers as guideposts in an otherwise uncertain and complex world. Numbers that quantify individual behaviors hold a particular appeal, especially in the context of health and fitness, with people using digital technologies to track metrics such as daily calorie intake, step count, hours slept, and time spent on social media platforms. While this "self-quantification" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lupton, 2016)</ref> can foster goal attainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Harvey et al., 2019)</ref> and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Stiglbauer et al., 2019)</ref>, the sometimes arbitrary nature of the benchmarks or targets set, which may then gain normative status, is often overlooked. Yet reliance on inaccurate or inappropriate benchmarks can be a reason for concern, especially when they permeate public consciousness or guide policy.</p><p>Take, for example, the common belief that walking 10,000 steps a day is the key to better health. This benchmark originated from a Japanese pedometer marketed in the mid-1960s as the "Manpo-Kei," which translates as "10,000 step meter" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Raichlen &amp; Lieberman, 2022)</ref>. Countless health resources have since endorsed this arbitrary figure, with studies proposing ways to reach it <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Choi et al., 2007)</ref>. While physical activity is undoubtedly beneficial, repeated failure to meet this specific and ambitious goal can result in people abandoning the goal to increase their daily step count altogether <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Wu et al., 2008)</ref>. This would be unfortunate, as prospective studies demonstrate that 6,000 steps per day can already be enough to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Paluch et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>We focus here on another magic number that has gained considerable traction in Western science and society: the idea that people make over 200 food-related decisions per day, most of them mindless <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wansink &amp; Sobal, 2007)</ref>. Undoubtedly, food decisions are key to individual and public health. Every single decision may offer a point of intervention to 4 promote healthier choices and behaviors, thus helping to curb the global obesity epidemic.</p><p>Estimating the number of food decisions people make on a day-to-day basis can therefore be informative. But how exactly did the figure of over 200 daily food decisions come about?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Magic numbers in mindless eating</head><p>In their article "Mindless Eating: The 200 Daily Food Decisions We Overlook," <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wansink and Sobal (2007)</ref> sought to substantiate <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wansink's (2006)</ref> concept of mindless eating-the idea that people are only aware of a small proportion of the food decisions they make and often overlook or deny the environmental factors influencing those decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wansink and Sobal (2007)</ref> used two estimation methods to quantify individuals' food-related decisions in a sample of 154 U.S. college students and adults. Participants first provided an overall, global estimate of their daily food and beverage decisions, yielding an average of 14.4 decisions. Next, they were asked to estimate the number of "when," "what," "how much," "where," and "with whom" decisions they made for a typical meal, snack, and beverage. These estimates were multiplied by the number of meals, snacks, and beverages they reported consuming in a typical day and summed, yielding a much higher average of 226.7 decisions. The difference between the two estimates, 212.3, was interpreted as representing the number of overlooked-dubbed "mindless"-decisions made each day, hence the title of the article. A major problem with this estimate, however, was that the method employed introduced what cognitive psychologists have termed the subadditivity effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Support theory and the subadditivity effect: Unpacking increases frequency estimates</head><p>Since Tversky and colleagues' work on support theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rottenstreich &amp; Tversky, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tversky &amp; Koehler, 1994)</ref>, it has been established that different descriptions of the same event can result in different probability and frequency judgments. Specifically, the 5 judged probability (or frequency) of an event increases when its description is broken down into disjoint components, a regularity termed implicit subadditivity. For example, people may be asked to assess the probability of an event such as a movie winning an Academy Award or of the same event unpacked into disjoint components (e.g., a movie winning an Academy award for the best director, original screenplay, or costume design). The key assumption of support theory is that unpacking the description of an event generally increases support for that event in terms of the estimated probability or frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rottenstreich &amp; Tversky, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>One rationale for this empirically demonstrated effect is that unpacking an event may remind people of possibilities they previously overlooked.</p><p>The critical point is that overlooking a subordinate component (e.g., "where" food decisions) in the process of estimating the frequency of the superordinate class (all food-related decisions) is not the same as making mindless food decisions. Rather, the process of estimation and the resulting probability or frequency estimate depends on the explicitness of an event's description or of the questions asked. In other words, the elicitation method is crucial and shapes the results. For example, the decision to have a salad for lunch may be perceived as a single decision. It is only when specifically asked to consider "when," "where," and "with whom" decisions that a person will take into account time, place, and presence of others as distinct components of the decision to eat at noon, in the canteen, and with their team. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates how summing the individual component estimates for each decision category results in a higher estimate than the global estimate. Had <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wansink and Sobal (2007)</ref> further unpacked the question by including components such as "how long" and "why," the sum total they arrived at would likely be even higher, and the inferred degree of mindless eating even more pronounced. For this reason, their estimate of 200 food decisions cannot be taken as any sort of ground truth, and certainly not as hard evidence of ubiquitous mindless eating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6</head><p>Importantly, the discrepancy between a global estimate and the sum of disjoint individual estimates is a robust finding in support theory research. By the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wansink and Sobal (2007)</ref> published their findings, this regularity in human intuitive probability (and frequency) judgments was well established. Framing their finding in terms of the loaded concept of mindless eating seems, at the very least, imprudent-such a claim requires more and different kinds of evidence.</p><p>Before we discuss the measurement of daily food decisions further, let us consider an To find out, we conducted a citation context analysis and found that one of these messages has proved more sticky-that is, easier to remember, more engaging, and more likely to be shared: The number 200 has generated more attention in terms of citations than the concept of mindless eating (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Material)</ref>. The number is cited as a stylized fact in both academic and non-academic sources, often simply to claim that people make a lot of food decisions; only half as many citations referred to mindless eating (see <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref> in Supplementary Material). Despite the popularity of the article, we found no efforts to replicate its findings, and none of the citing publications pointed out the methodological issue we have outlined above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Arbitrary and imprecise estimates can incur costs</head><p>Arbitrary and imprecise estimates can have significant public health repercussions by misleading health policy and distorting public perceptions. The claim that people overlook more than 200 food decisions per day characterizes them as mindless eaters, thus undermining feelings of agency, competence, and self-efficacy over food decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dean, 2021)</ref>. Such feelings may lead people to abandon attempts to monitor their food choices, in the same way that the unrealistic benchmark of 10,000 steps a day can discourage people from trying to increase their daily step count.</p><p>Perpetuating this figure without validating or reviewing its accuracy or methodological basis is, in our view, unacceptable. In the next section, we discuss what is, perhaps, the major difficulty in quantifying the total number of food-related decisions and explore how examining more nuanced estimates can help to rethink the nature of food decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Let's rethink the way food decisions are measured</head><p>A major hurdle in quantifying food decisions is to define what exactly qualifies as one. This includes determining when a decision begins and ends, considering whether decisions must be conscious or can be habitual, and distinguishing between thoughts and actions. To our knowledge, there is no all-encompassing framework that proposes necessary and sufficient conditions for defining, classifying, and quantifying a food-related decision.</p><p>Granted, decision-making theories-often also called choice theories-abound. Theories of preferential choice (e.g., "Do I want tiramisu or an apple for dessert?") come in many forms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rieskamp et al., 2006)</ref>; the same holds for evidence accumulation models (e.g., drift diffusion models; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ratcliff et al., 2016</ref>, for a review). Heuristic models of decision making represent another important class of decision processes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011</ref>, for a review). Yet these decision-making theories offer limited guidance in defining and measuring food-related decisions.</p><p>The problem is this: However sophisticated the conceptual and mathematical modelling of processes in these frameworks, they say little about the stimuli processed by the mind's decision machine. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ratcliff et al.'s (2016)</ref> review of diffusion decision models, for example, the input to the standard model is simply called a "stimulus." But what exactly should be considered a stimulus in the context of food decisions? For example, do a dish of tiramisu and an apple each count as one stimulus, and does the decision to choose the tiramisu over the apple therefore count as one decision? Or is each spoonful of tiramisu a distinct stimulus that requires a distinct decision: to indulge in its calorie-rich delight or to exercise restraint? And what about the decision to save the treat for later, share it with your partner, or enjoy it with an espresso? The one decision to choose the tiramisu becomes many more decisions as the process is broken down further (not to mention the difficulties that arise from the bundling, overlapping, or substitution of decisions; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Doucerain &amp; Fellows, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hogarth, 1981)</ref>. Without a precise operationalization of what it is trying to capture, any measure runs the risk of being arbitrary.</p><p>One possible solution, which we illustrate next, is to operationalize the unit of measurement-the decision-precisely and then probe it using methodologies that are less subject to measurement bias. This approach will admittedly lead to local rather than global</p><p>estimates. Yet such local estimates can provide insights into ways of defining and gauging food-related decisions while shining a light on the pitfalls of focusing on an aggregate, potentially arbitrary number. We illustrate this approach with three different analyses, none of which was originally conducted with the explicit purpose of enumerating food decisions. and found that children consumed more fruits and vegetables during longer meals than during meals with a regular duration (25 vs. 18 pieces or fruit-and-vegetable-related decisions)-but not more bread, cold cuts, and desserts (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 2A)</ref>. Moving from the individual to the household level, the USDA Economic Research Service (2019) assessed household food purchases and acquisitions over a one-week period <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2B</ref>) and found three times as many decisions related to food and beverages consumed at home (36 decisions) than away from 10 home (12 decisions). Moving to still a higher level of temporal aggregation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Elias et al. (2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Elias et al. ( , 2009</ref> videotaped fridge door openings in a student house over a 2-week period <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.   2C</ref>). They identified and coded fridge door openings and the decision taken (e.g., taking something out of the fridge). The insight from this analysis is that food-related decisions also include decisions not to consume (in 16 cases, the students closed the door again after looking, searching, or sorting, but without taking anything out).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Beyond magic numbers</head><p>The approaches outlined above do not provide a single magic number such as the 200 daily food decisions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wansink and Sobal (2007)</ref>. Although it would be possible to extrapolate a global estimate of food decisions from a defined reference class of precise, local assessments, we believe that it is important to go beyond mere quantification and consider the underlying rationale for such measurements.</p><p>The examples above illustrate how different operationalizations yield different estimates depending on the context and level of aggregation of the analysis-demonstrating that food-related decisions must be interpreted within their respective contexts, accounting for aspects such as the specificity of the decision unit (e.g., from individual bites to comprehensive calorie counts), whether the time frame considered is today's lunch or an annual meal plan, and whether the decision is personal, delegated, or collective. Crucially, when estimating the number of decisions, the precise definition and level of operationalization must align with the objective of the analysis.</p><p>Consider, for example, the collective context of a household, where (as shown in (2023) found, increasing the length of family meals by an average of 10 minutes can lead to an average increase of 7 bite-sized pieces of fruits and vegetables consumed by children (equivalent to one extra 100g serving). On the other hand, for people struggling with an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa, meals or servings may be too big a unit of decision.</p><p>Rather, each bite of food becomes a significant choice, so understanding (or intervening in) decisions at the level of individual pieces or bites of food could make a big difference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">A first working definition of food-related decisions</head><p>To facilitate the consideration of such contextual influences on food decisions, we propose the following working definition that is, of course, open to further refinement:</p><p>Food-related decisions are all thoughts, choices, and actions made by individuals or groups about what, how much, how, and why to eat and drink, as well as decisions not to eat and drink or to stop eating and drinking. This broad definition incorporates the nuances and multidimensionality of food-related decision-making processes, covers both deliberate and automatic processes, and considers specific decision contexts such as time and social and decision units; "how to eat and drink" includes the decision categories "when," "where,"</p><p>"with whom," and "how long."</p><p>How best to define and measure food decisions parallels other challenges in psychology, such as how best to capture emotions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Scherer (2005)</ref>, for example, defined emotions as comprising five components: appraisal, bodily symptoms, action tendencies, facial and vocal expression, and emotional experience. Although he noted that a comprehensive measure covering all these components is unlikely to be developed in the near future, significant progress has been made in measuring individual components. Likewise, (food) decision-making involves multiple components and processes, from reflexive actions (e.g., snatching your hand away from a hot surface) to deliberate planning (e.g., following a diet plan; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Redish, 2013)</ref>. Measuring all of these components comprehensively and simultaneously is likely beyond current feasibility, but individual components can be effectively captured through precise, local estimates, as illustrated by the examples outlined in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>One step toward more comprehensive, contextualized measurement of food-related decisions could be mobile sensing. This approach uses devices like smartphones, wearables, and smart home technologies to gather precise behavioral and contextual data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Harari &amp; Gosling, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mehl et al., 2024)</ref>. For instance, wearable image and chewing sensors can detect food intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ghosh et al., 2024)</ref>, GPS-enabled smartphones can examine how proximity to unhealthy food outlets influences purchases <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sadler et al., 2016)</ref>, and smart devices can track family mealtime practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bi et al., 2019)</ref>. However, translating raw sensor data into meaningful insights is challenging, requiring careful interpretation of signals like GPS or activity data, especially given cultural and contextual influences on decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Harari &amp; Gosling, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum lies a qualitative research approach. This can be particularly valuable in contexts involving participants from non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries and cultures with differing levels of technological infrastructure. Diet-related values, norms, food availability, and the structure of family and peer networks vary across cultures, and such differences are likely to affect the number and nature of food decisions. Consequently, standard quantitative tools validated in WEIRD research environments may not be appropriate or effective for studying food decisions in more diverse cultural contexts. For example, in populations facing food scarcity, fewer daily food decisions are made than in populations with abundant access to food. In communities without refrigerators, the concept of fridge door openings is irrelevant.</p><p>Fielding-Singh's interviews and ethnographic work highlight how socioeconomic and cultural contexts shape the meanings that parents attach to food (2017) and adolescent beliefs about healthy eating (2019). Similarly, Grønhøj's work demonstrates how vignettes-short, descriptive scenarios-can be used to reveal decision-making dynamics within families <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Grønhøj, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Grønhøj &amp; Bech-Larsen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Grønhøj &amp; Ölander, 2007)</ref>. These methods provide valuable tools for contextualizing and operationalizing food decisions for quantitative analysis across different contexts.</p><p>To conclude, we advocate for methodological pluralism in studying food decisions.</p><p>For instance, combining qualitative methods with mobile sensing can enhance models of food decision-making by bridging subjective and behavioral dimensions. Our working definition is meant as an initial step toward a robust and productive definition of food decisions, as our</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>provides several local measures of food and drink decisions obtained using survey and observational methods that demonstrate how the level of aggregation of time, individuals, and decision unit-that is, the decision context-matters. At the individual and mealtime level, Dallacker et al. (2023) investigated how the length of family mealtimes affects the foods consumed. They operationalized decisions as bite-sized pieces of food eaten</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 2B) intervening in decisions made at the point of purchase may influence an average of 36 purchases, which in turn establish the options available for future consumption decisions made at home (USDA Economic Research Service, 2019). But what is the point of buying healthy foods if they are not eaten? Observing the context can help to better understand the conditions needed for families to actually eat healthy foods-for example, as Dallacker et al.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>important aspect of Wansink's work. In 2018, Cornell University determined that Wansink had committed scientific misconduct and removed him from his position (Cornell<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chronicle, 2018</ref>). Furthermore, 18 of his publications have been retracted, one of them twice (Retraction Watch, 2024). The "200 Daily Food Decisions" article was not among the retracted publications. And indeed, our point here is not that this estimate is in any way fraudulent-but that it is essentially meaningless. In our view, this matters because the<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wansink and Sobal (2007)</ref> article has attracted widespread interest, with over 7,000 views and downloads, 419 academic citations in Scopus, 1,110 citations in Google Scholar, and 200 citations in nonacademic sources documented by Sage Altmetric (as of December 31, 2024).<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wansink and Sobal (2007)</ref> had two main messages, namely, that people make over 200 food decisions daily, and that most of those decisions are mindless. Both are trenchant messages. But have they captured our collective attention and memory to the same degree?</figDesc><table><row><cell>2.3.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">research review did not identify any clearly defined alternatives. In time, a better construct may emerge from the variety of local measures capturing the multiple dimensions of food decisions. Until then, a working definition can serve several important purposes: it can highlight the absence of a fully satisfying definition, inspire and orchestrate relevant research questions, and caution against reliance on arbitrary or oversimplified magic numbers.</note>
