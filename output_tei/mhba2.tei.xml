				<p>Factors such as time pressure and psychosocial stress may increase or decrease prosocial behavior, depending on a number of factors. One factor that consistently positively impacts prosocial behavior is relationship status: prosocial behavior is more likely toward kin than toward strangers. The interactions among stress, kin relationships, and prosocial behavior were examined in two separate experiments. In Study 1, 79 university students were asked to decide how much money to donate to family members, friends, or strangers, either under time pressure or with no time constraints. Participants donated more to close kin and friends than to strangers, but time pressure did not increase prosocial behavior. In Study 2, 94 university students completed the Trier Social Stress Task for Groups (TSST-G) or a control task, followed by a similar donation task as used in Study 1. Participants donated more to close kin and friends than to strangers, but stress did not influence donation amounts. These results do not support the hypothesis that stress due to time pressure or psychosocial factors increase prosocial behavior.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Prosocial behaviors are intentional actions to help others, including comforting, sharing, and cooperating <ref type="bibr">(Jensen, 2016)</ref>. Such behaviors occur across animal species and have long puzzled scientists and philosophers because they make little sense from an evolutionary perspective. Why should one yield their own resources for the benefit of another, especially to non-kin? The ultimate cause of prosocial behavior is thought to be to increase one's inclusive fitness-helping kin carries with it a benefit to one's own genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hamilton, 1964)</ref>. Further, even helping a stranger may benefit one's reputation via indirect reciprocity (see <ref type="bibr">Rand &amp; Nowak,</ref> 2013 for review). The proximate causes for prosocial behavior relate to an individual's motivation. A host of psychological factors, including time pressure and psychosocial stress also impact prosocial behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time Pressure and Prosocial Behavior</head><p>The prevalence of prosocial behavior in humans is demonstrated by the early onset of such behaviors during development and the large amount of both time and money donated to charitable organizations around the world (see <ref type="bibr">Zaki &amp; Mitchell, 2014 for review)</ref>. Recent work has suggested that prosociality represents the default state in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rand et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Preston, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marsh, 2019)</ref>. When time constraints or cognitive load reduces one's cognitive resources, people fall back on default processing and behave in a more prosocial manner. In one example of default prosocial behavior, participants in a Public Goods Game are tasked with deciding how much money to share with a group (donated money is doubled and shared among all participants while kept money is not doubled and stays with the original participant) either under strict time constraints (less than seven seconds) or after waiting 10 seconds to make their decision. Those in the time pressure condition contributed more money to the group fund compared to those in the no time-pressure group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nishi et al. (2015)</ref> combined data from four independent studies including nearly 56,000 decisions, showing that cooperation is faster than defection in cooperative environments and the opposite is true in non-cooperative environments.</p><p>The Social Heuristics Hypothesis purports that humans' typical, intuitive response is prosocial, leading to cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Rand et al., 2014)</ref>. Individuals who are forced to make a decision quickly are more likely to rely on intuitive thinking, which favors prosocial responding (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rand et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zaki &amp; Mitchell, 2013</ref> for review, though see Bouwmeester and colleagues, 2017 for a challenge to this view).</p><p>In addition to the Social Heuristics Hypothesis, several other mechanisms that are key for prosocial behavior to take place: Direct reciprocity, Indirect reciprocity, Spatial selection, Multilevel selection, and Kin selection (see <ref type="bibr">Rand &amp; Nowak, 2013 for review)</ref>. Direct reciprocity only truly arises when two individuals meet multiple times and can expect to meet again in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Trivers, 1971)</ref>. This pattern prioritizes cooperation in the present, with high expectations for reciprocity in the future when the two individuals meet again. Indirect reciprocity focuses on repeated prosocial actions that may be communicated to a third party <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nowak &amp; Sigmund, 2005</ref>). Spatial selection focuses on an individual making a prosocial decision within a group to get ahead for themselves making it more likely to only deal with those who make prosocial decisions in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rand &amp; Nowak, 2013)</ref>. Multilevel selection occurs if there is competition between both individuals within a group, and within groups themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wilson, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Traulsen &amp; Nowak, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Kin selection is closely related to inclusive fitness theory first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamilton (1964)</ref>. This theory states that altruistic or prosocial actions will be favored when br &gt; c, with c being the cost and b being the benefit to the individual and the recipient and r is the relatedness between the individual and the recipient. When two individuals are more related, inclusive fitness theory states that they will be more prosocial toward each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Foster, Wenseleers, &amp; Ratnieks, 2006)</ref>. People are also more likely to help those that they feel closer to, i.e., friends, as opposed to mere acquaintances. Furthermore, as the cost of helping increases (requiring more time or money), the gap between helping kin more than non-kin widens <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Stewart-Williams, 2007</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stress and Prosocial Behavior</head><p>Acute stress exerts widespread effects on behavior. Recent work has focused on how individuals who are under acute stress may make more prosocial decisions such as deciding to trust or cooperate with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buchanan &amp; Preston, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">von Dawans, Fischbacher, Kirschbaum, Fehr, &amp; Heinrichs, 2012)</ref>. One potential mechanism for the effects of stress on prosociality has been highlighted by the tend-and-befriend hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Taylor et al. 2000)</ref>. This hypothesis describes a secondary behavioral stress response that follows the initial fight or flight response. The tend-and-befriend hypothesis postulates a mechanism to mitigate the negative effects of the stressor through enhancing social bonds. Tending involves nurturant activities that protect the individual and offspring, while reducing stress. The befriend component deals with the creation and subsequent maintenance of social networks to help deal with a stressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Taylor et al., 2000)</ref>. These affiliative actions, in particular befriending, could have evolved as a type of coping mechanism to help accelerate recovery from stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Floyd et al., 2007)</ref>. This secondary stress response allows greater flexibility in determining the best course of action when making a decision under stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Taylor, 2006)</ref>. Although this hypothesis initially focused on females, more recent work suggests that both sexes may show this tend-and-befriend pattern after the initial stress response <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Geary &amp; Flinn, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Taylor, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>One study in particular, demonstrated that when faced with an acute stressor, individuals engaged in more social approach behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(von Dawans et al., 2012)</ref>. After completing a stressful task (the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups; TSST-G), or a control task, participants took part in social interaction games in which real monetary rewards were at stake. Stressed participants were more prone to trusting and sharing with their game partner than those in the control group <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(von Dawans et al. 2012)</ref>. Importantly, these results were found in an all-male group of participants, suggesting that the tend-and-befriend pattern is not specific to stressed females (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Geary &amp; Flinn, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Taylor, 2006)</ref>. Other studies have shown similar prosocial effects of stress <ref type="bibr">(Singer et al., 2017)</ref> or cortisol administration <ref type="bibr">(Margittai et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>These findings support the validity of the tend-and-befriend hypothesis as a secondary behavioral stress response (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nickels, Kubicki, &amp; Maestripieri, 2017</ref>, who showed such a pattern only in women, but not in men).</p><p>Research in this area has been equivocal, however as several studies have documented an 'anti-social' pattern of behavior in response to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bendahan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">FeldmanHall et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Potts et al., 2019)</ref>. In a social version of the trust game in which participants could either 'trust' a partner with a monetary investment or 'defect' and not share any money with a partner, FeldmanHall and colleagues (2015) found that stress reduced trusting behavior. Similarly, other groups have reported reduced trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Potts et al., 2019)</ref> and reduced donation behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bendahan et al., 2017)</ref> immediately after a stressor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Investigation</head><p>Several studies have shown that stress and time pressure can function similarly in affecting decision making performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Svenson &amp; Benson, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Edland &amp; Svenson, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>These similarities between time pressure and stress made using them interchangeably across studies a logical choice to address the similarities and differences between how these two factors influence prosocial behavior. We examined the potential effects of time pressure (Study 1) and psychosocial stress (Study 2) on prosocial behavior using a newly developed economic game. In the game, participants were asked to donate hypothetical money ranging from $0 to $100 to different target individuals in need of medical care for the treatment of diabetes. Because we were interested in the effect of kin and friendship on donation amounts, targets included participants' family members (mothers, cousins) as well as non-family members (friends, strangers). In Study 1, we used Time Pressure as a between-subjects factor: one group was required to make their decision within seven seconds, another group was required to wait 10 seconds before making their decision, and a third group was given no information about timing.</p><p>We predicted that donations would be greater to kin than non kin targets and that time pressure would increase donation amounts to more distant relatives (cousins) and non-kin targets (strangers), but not to close relatives (mothers) because donation amounts should be at maximum for mothers due to kin selection factors. In Study 2, we tested the effects of stress, rather than time pressure, on donation behavior. Participants in a stress group completed the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G; von Dawans et al., 2011) or a non-stressful task before completing the economic donation game. We predicted that those in the stress group would donate more money to more distant targets compared to those in the non-stress group, but that donations to closer targets would be unaffected by stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1 Method</head><p>Participants. Participants were 90 university students (Mean age = 19.1, range: 18-24) who received course credit for participation; participants were randomly assigned to the Time Pressure or No Time Pressure. Eleven participants were excluded for failing to complete the survey in its entirety, specifically, failing to answer donation items in the "Pressure" condition in the allotted time or simply not answering any of the questions. This resulted in a sample size of 79 for data analysis (n = 31 in Time Pressure group and n = 48 in No Time Pressure). Of these 79 participants, 56 identified as female and 23 as male.</p><p>After a review of prior research, we estimated a small effect size (r = .20) of time pressure for this mixed 2 (Time Pressure or No Time Pressure) 3 Target (mother, friend, stranger) design, with Time Pressure as a between subjects factor and Target as a within subjects factor. An a priori power analysis in G*Power version 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Faul et al., 2007)</ref> using an effect size estimate of r = .20, at α = .05 and β = .80, suggested that 75 participants would be necessary to test our hypothesis, which we exceeded in the current investigation.</p><p>Procedure. Both studies were approved by Saint Louis University's Institutional Review Board. Participants were randomly assigned to complete one of two conditions of a donation game implemented in Qualtrics Survey Software (Provo, UT, USA): Time Pressure (decisions must be made in under 7 seconds) or No Time Pressure (allowed to take as much or as little time as they want). Participants were asked to imagine how much money, up to $100, they would donate to a target individual who needs medical care for diabetes. Targets included their mother, a friend, and a stranger, presented individually to each participant in a random order (a withinsubjects factor). In the time pressure condition, if a participant did not respond in the allotted seven seconds, the survey automatically advanced to the next page; these participants' data were excluded from that Target donation condition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Our main hypothesis was tested with a 2 (Time Pressure or No Time Pressure) 3 Target (Mother, Friend, Stranger) repeated measures ANOVA. Greenhouse-Geisser corrected degrees of freedom are reported for all repeated measures analyses to control for the violation of the sphericity assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Greenhouse &amp; Geisser, 1959)</ref>. As expected, participants donated more money to individuals with whom they shared a closer relationship, with the pattern mother &gt; friend &gt; stranger (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>; main effect of Target closeness: F(1.74,125.6) = 111.45, p &lt; .001, partial η 2 = .61). We did not find a significant main effect of Time Pressure (F(1,72) = 1.32, p = .27, partial η 2 = .02) nor an interaction between Time Pressure and Closeness: F(1.74,125.6) &lt; .8, p = .4, partial η 2 = .01, demonstrating that time pressure did not significantly affect donation amounts across donation targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Study 1 showed that individuals tend to donate more money to those in need to whom they feel closer compared to those to whom they feel more distant. We did not, however, find support for the positive effects of time pressure on prosocial behavior. These results are counter to previous findings on time pressure and prosocial behavior. In Study 2, we aimed to determine whether psychosocial stress impacts prosocial behavior across donation targets who differ in closeness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. Ninety-four university students were recruited (Mean age = 19.5, range:</p><p>18-26). Exclusion criteria included taking any psychiatric, neurological, or corticosteroid-based medications. Of these 94 participants, 51 identified as female and as male. Females taking any type of steroidal contraceptives were excluded, and the remaining females were tested only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (days 14-25) due to the effects of menstrual cycle phase on cortisol reactivity to stress (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kudielka &amp; Kirschbaum, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kirschbaum et al., 1999</ref>).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kirschbaum, &amp; Heinrichs, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kirschbaum, Pirke, &amp; Hellhammer, 1993)</ref> or a placebo version of the TSST adapted for use with groups (see detailed description below; Het, Rohleder, Schoofs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kirschbaum, &amp; Wolf, 2009)</ref>. The TSST-G follows the same procedure as the original TSST, but allows for more participants to be run at the same time. The TSST is a commonly used and well-validated method of inducing stress in the laboratory. Our laboratory has successfully implemented the TSST in the study of the physiology of stress and social cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buchanan et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>The TSST-G consisted of a 10-minute anticipation period, followed by a test period of 12 minutes total, including 3 minutes during which each participant delivered a speech and performed mental arithmetic in front of an "audience" of two experimenters while also being videorecorded. At the beginning of the anticipation period, participants were presented with a scenario which formed the basis of their speech. The participants were asked to imagine a hypothetical situation in which s/he is interviewing for a job; the participant was asked to construct an argument as to why s/he deserves the job over the other interviewees. The threeminute speech, without the use of notes, occurred while standing. After the speech, the participant performed a two-minute mental arithmetic task: serial subtraction of the number 16 from a four-digit number beginning in the 4000 range as quickly and as accurately as possible.</p><p>The exact starting number varied between participants to avoid practice and learning effects.</p><p>to return to the original number and continue.</p><p>The TSST-G Control condition was modeled after the TSST-placebo task <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Het et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berger et al., 2016)</ref> and required participants to complete the TSST-G, but without any of the stressful components of social evaluation and uncontrollability (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dickerson &amp; Kemeny, 2004)</ref>. Participants in the control condition were asked to read aloud a simple text in a low voice, then follow-up with a simple counting task. Participants were explicitly told that they will not be judged on their reading performance. Next, they were instructed to enumerate a series of numbers in increments of 2, 5, 10, or 20 for 8 minutes. They were watched during this phase by two individuals who did not wear lab coats, and who did not interrupt at any point. Furthermore, no video recorder was present throughout the task.</p><p>Participants also completed the Subjective Ratings of Stress Scale (SRSS). The SRSS is a four-item scale designed to measure an individual's subjective reports of stress after completing a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gaab, Rohleder, Nater, &amp; Ehlert, 2005)</ref>. The following 4 statements were rated on a scale of 1, indicating strong disagreement, to 6, indicating strong agreement: 1) This task was stressful for me. 2) I found the task to be a challenge. 3) I knew what I had to do to perform well on the task. And 4) I was able to do something to influence the outcome of the task.</p><p>Physiological stress responses were assessed by measuring cortisol and salivary alpha amylase (sAA) from saliva. Saliva was collected at four time points using Salivette collection devices (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany): 1) two minutes before the end of the preparation phase, 2) at the end of the public speaking, 3) at the end of the mental arithmetic, and 4) ten minutes after the conclusion of the TSST-G procedure. After the TSST, participants completed a similar donation task described in Study 1.</p><p>After each session, saliva samples were stored in a freezer at -20 C until assayed. Cortisol samples were measured with an immunoassay kit with chemiluminescence detection (CLIA; IBL Hamburg, Germany), and sAA was measured by the quantitative enzyme kinetic method (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Granger et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nater &amp; Rohleder, 2009)</ref>. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were less than 10%. The lower sensitivity for cortisol is 0.5 nmol/L, for sAA, 1.5 U/ml. response. For cortisol, there were significant main effects of both Time (F(1.54, 135.9) = 30.3, p &lt; .001, partial η 2 = .26) and Group (F(1, 88) = 23.3, p &lt; .001, partial η 2 = .21), as well as a significant interaction between Time and Group (F(1.54, 135.9) = 24.7, p &lt; .001, partial η 2 = .22; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>). These results demonstrate that our stress manipulation was effective at impacting cortisol response. For sAA, the stress group showed significantly greater sAA levels in response to the task compared to the no stress group. There was a significant main effect of Time, F(2.44, 215.0) = 5.6, p = .002, partial η 2 = .06 and a significant main effect of Group, (F(1, 88) = 4.19, p = .04, partial η 2 = .05). There was also a significant interaction between Time and Group (F(2.44, 215.0) = 3.28, p = .03, partial η 2 = .04; See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3)</ref>, demonstrating different patterns of sAA activity between groups across the TSST. These results conform with previous work showing the typical dynamics of sAA to stress manipulations.</p></div>

Nor did we find a significant main effect of stress on prosocial behavior (no main effect of Group: F(1, 92) &lt; 1, p &gt; .4, partial η 2 = .005).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Counter to our hypothesis, participants in the Stress group did not donate more money to any of the targets compared to those in the No Stress group. Our manipulation checks show that there was a clear difference in psychological and physiological stress responses between the stress and no-stress groups. These responses, however, were not associated with donation behavior. Relational closeness, by contrast, was associated with donation amount, as observed in Study 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>These studies were designed to examine the relationship between time pressure and stress on prosocial decision making. Contrary to our predictions, neither time pressure nor stress impacted behavior on our task of prosocial decision making. Relational proximity to the targets, defined as either kinship or friendship, was a much stronger predictor of prosocial behavior than either time pressure or stress. Ensuring the success of kin is vital to the concept of inclusive fitness, which suggests that any group-living species will have developed mechanisms to allow for the detection of costs and benefits of interacting with a conspecific and securing the success of offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burnstein, Crandall, &amp; Kitayama, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Foster et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Contrary to previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rand et al., 2012)</ref>, we found no influence of time pressure on prosocial donation behavior in our first study. The primary studies demonstrating the positive impact of time pressure has focused specifically on pure cooperation, in which there is little opportunity for future consequences for the non-cooperator (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rand, 2016</ref> for meta-analytic review of pure cooperation). By contrast, time pressure exerts no effect when cooperation is strategic, such as when a cooperator can expect a benefit from cooperating from future interactions with a target. Our index of prosocial behavior is focused on making a decision regarding a monetary donation to family, friends, or strangers in need. Such a monetary decision is quite different from measures of either pure or strategic cooperation. The current findings demonstrate that our task may operate more like a 'strategic' task, such that donators would most likely interact with the recipients after donation opportunity. Such constraints may shift the decision from an intuitive response to more of a deliberation, negating any effect that time pressure may have on the behavior.</p><p>Similarly, our results demonstrate no effect of psychosocial stress on prosocial behavior.</p><p>Manipulation checks such as self-reported stress and increases in cortisol and sAA demonstrate that our stress manipulation was effective. However, the experience of stress exerted no effect on our measure of prosocial decision making in the current study. A number of previous studies have demonstrated the impact of stress on financial <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Schwabe &amp; Wolf, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Starcke et al. 2011)</ref> and social decision making <ref type="bibr">(van Dawans et al., 2012)</ref>. The current findings do not support the tend-and-befriend hypothesis <ref type="bibr">(Taylor et al., ????)</ref>, which suggests that stress may lead to increased prosocial behavior. The index of prosocial behavior employed in the current investigation focuses on an indirect behavior: the expenditure of hypothetical money to alleviate the suffering of another person. Although this task demonstrated effects of social proximity, in that more money was donated to socially closer targets, neither stress nor time pressure altered behavior. We <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buchanan &amp; Preston, 2014)</ref> have proposed that the positive impact of stress on behavior may be limited to situations in which a known, vulnerable target is in direct need of help and when it is obvious how that help may be delivered. The current task, by contrast, may have been too artificial and the prosocial behavior too abstract to be influenced by stress or time pressure. Future work should address such limitations to better understand the state influences on prosocial behaviors.</p><p>Another limitation of these studies is the use of three donation targets. This choice allowed for experimental brevity but, by only including three categories of social proximity, it does not allow for the results to indicate the construct of "family" or "non-family" and how that construct plays into the decision making process. While the effect of social proximity on donation behavior was documented, the current experimental setup does not help distinguish between closeness more generally and kin specifically. The use of only undergraduate students as participants does not allow for the assessment of decision making differences across younger and older adults as well as in other socioeconomic groups. It could be that older adults or those in a different socioeconomic group, may show different patterns of social and financial decision making that may well be affected by stress or time pressure.</p><p>The results from these experiments lead to a number of questions for future research. For instance, the use of a repeated interaction decision making tasks could provide more avenues for examining the potential effects of stress and time pressure across different prosocial and cooperative situations. By comparing the differences between repeated and one-shot games, where repeated involves multiple donation trials and decisions between individuals over a course of time and where one-shot involves one donation trial and decision between individuals that occurs in an instant. Most time-pressure effects have been seen using one-shot games. These findings, coupled with the pattern of results in the current study, suggest that it would be interesting to directly compare the prosocial decision making in those who interact with other participants in a one-shot situation, versus those who make repeated decisions with others in repeated games. Future work should also examine how time pressure and stress affect actual prosocial behavior rather than the artificial situations that have more typically been assessed in this line of work.          </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Sample size determination was based on von Dawans et al. (2012) and FeldmanHall et al. (2015), who each showed an equivalent (Cohen's d = .6) main effect of stress on prosocial behavior (importantly, von Dawans et al. showed that stress increased prosocial behavior, and FeldmanHall et al. showed that stress decreased prosocial behavior), we conducted a power analysis using the following parameters: effect size of d = .6, α = .05 and β = .80, which demonstrated that 90 participants would be necessary to test our hypothesis. The final sample size for Study 2 is N = 94 for behavioral data (randomly assigned to the in the Stress group; n = 41, or the No Stress group; n = 53); however, physiological data from 4 participants in the Stress group are missing due to experimenter error. Procedure. Study 2 followed a similar pattern as Study 1, with the exception of Stress replacing Time Pressure as the primary independent variable and 'cousin' replacing 'friend' as the intermediate donation target. This change was motivated by our interest in addressing the kin selection hypothesis by including two different kin relatives that varied in the closeness of the relationship (mother versus cousin). The study design was a 2 (Stress or No Stress) 3 (Target: Mother, Cousin, and Stranger) design with Stress as a between subjects factor and Target as a within subjects factor.
