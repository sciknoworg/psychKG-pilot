			<abstract>
				<p>Should we keep doing what we know works for us or should we risk trying something new as it could work even better? The exploration-exploitation dilemma is ubiquitous in daily life decision-making, and balancing between the two is crucial for adaptive behavior. Yet, we only have started to unravel the neurocognitive mechanisms that help us to find this balance in practice. Analyzing BOLD-signals of healthy young adults during virtual foraging, we could show that a behavioral tendency for prolonged exploitation was associated with weakened signaling during exploration in central node points of the fronto-parietal attention network, plus the frontopolar cortex. These results provide an important link between behavioral heuristics that we use to balance between exploitation and exploration and the brain function that supports shifts from one tendency to the other. Importantly, they stress that inter-individual differences in behavioral strategies are reflected in differences in brain activity during exploration and should thus be more in the focus of basic research that aims at delineating general laws governing visual attention.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In everyday life, we are constantly confronted with the need to observe our own action strategies and decisions and to readjust them to changing contexts. One example is to flexibly switch between a state of exploitation, in which we hold on to the same, known, strategy and exploration, that allows us to turn away from our previous strategy and examine alternative choices. A central question in cognitive neuroscience is how the brain balances between these two states for an optimal behavioral outcome.</p><p>Here, we report results from an fMRI study in which we tested 20 human young adults in a probabilistic foraging task based on the visual search paradigm and recorded the task-related BOLD-signal. The aim was to identify the neural correlates supporting exploratory shifts of attention during a visual foraging paradigm and to link brain activity related to exploration to behavioral parameters indexing rules of thumbs the participants used to make exploratory foraging decisions (specifically patch-leaving decisions). During a 60 minute search participants 'foraged' in search displays (i.e., patches) for target items among distractors. They earned a monetary reward each time they located a target item using an MR-compatible PC-mouse inside the scanner. Importantly, with each new reward capture, the remaining reward probability in the current display decreased exponentially. Thus, foraging became less rewarding the longer participants kept searching in the same display. To compensate for this, participants could switch by mouse-click to a new display at any time. Previous neuroimaging studies examining the exploration-exploitation dilemma typically employed variants of the n-armed bandit gambling task stemming from the principles of a casino's slot-machine (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jones, 1975)</ref>. In the non-stationary version, the reward probabilities of the arms to be pulled change unpredictably (i.e., restless bandit; i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Daw, O'doherty, Dayan, Seymour &amp; Dolan, 2006)</ref>. Due to this unpredictability, this version requires constant balancing between exploitation and exploration. Similar to this, we introduced random and unpredictable variations of the initial reward probability. This should prevent participants from using a simple stopping rule where they always capture a fixed number of rewards, e.g., 5 rewards, and leave the patch once that number is reached (i.e., the 'fixed-N' rule; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wilke, Hutchinson &amp; Todd, 2009)</ref>. Instead, due to the quick reward depletion, participants in our task were similarly required to constantly balance their search behavior between exploiting the current or exploring a new display.</p><p>Animals as well as our ancestors who lived as hunter-gatherers would typically face foraging environments structured in patches that are allocated in space and time (e.g., meadows or forest districts differing in their richness of prey at different locations that vary in their distance within one habitat). Foraging thus becomes a rather serial stopping-or-switching task entailing temporal traveling costs that result from roaming in the environment from patch to patch. This characteristic is not very well captured in bandit-like gambling tasks in which the decision problem equals a decision between simultaneous choices. Importantly, evidence suggests that the brain mechanisms that are involved in solving these two types of problems (serial versus simultaneous) may differ to some extent <ref type="bibr">(Constantino &amp; Daw, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kolling, Behrens, Mars &amp; Rushworth, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rushworth, Kolling, Sallet, &amp; Mars, 2012)</ref>. While there is a large body of research reporting on the neural structures involved in the exploration-exploitation dilemma in bandit-like tasks, less evidence exists reporting on the functional brain anatomy supporting exploratory decisions making in patch-foraging tasks. At the same time, choosing the patch-based serial stopping-or-switching task may increase the ecological validity facilitating the translation to ethological studies in other species <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mobbs et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The frontopolar cortex (FPC) capitalizes a key role in supporting exploratory shifts of visual attention (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pollmann &amp; Manginelli, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Güldener, Jüllig, Sotto &amp; Pollmann, 2022)</ref>. Importantly, FPC activity is also consistently linked to exploratory decisions in probabilistic gambling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boorman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Daw et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laureiro-Martínez et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zajkowski et al., 2017)</ref>. Also subregions within the parietal cortex such as the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) as well as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and the insula (IC) were reportedly related to attentional exploration during gambling <ref type="bibr">(Addicott et al.., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blanchard &amp; Gershman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chakroun et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Daw et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laureiro-Martínez et al.,, 2015)</ref> Thus, the FPC appears to be a crucial node within a neurocognitive circuit containing regions of the ventral and dorsal attention network that allows subjects to explore alternative sources of reward in the environment by disengaging attentional resources from the current focus <ref type="bibr">(Mansouri, Koechlin, Rosa &amp; Buckley, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, we expected to observe a spatially similar pattern of positive BOLD signal changes when our subjects decided to explore a new display. These decisions obey so-called 'patch-leaving rules', behavioral heuristics or rules of thumb subjects may use to determine the optimal time point for exploring a new patch <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Charnov, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Krebs, et al., 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McNair, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wilke et al., 2009)</ref>. We were particularly interested in the participants' giving-up times (GUT). They are defined as the time since the last reward capture and leaving the current patch. The 'GUT rule' states that a patch is left once the time, since the last capture, exceeds a certain subjective threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McNair, 1982)</ref>. Intriguingly, elderlies' declining tendency to explore is associated with increased GUTs during foraging <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mata et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus, GUTs may serve as an index of behavioral exploitation. Due to the quick depletion of reward in a given display, subjects with a bias towards longer exploitation indexed by relatively longer GUTs should yield less monetary earnings. At the same time we expected a reduced signaling on the brain level during exploration in exploitation-biased participants. Conversely, stronger positive BOLD-signal changes during exploration, particularly in FPC, were expected to be found in subjects with higher behavioral propensity to explore, indexed by short GUTs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Participants</head><p>20 native Germans (8 male) participated in the experiment. All volunteers were between 19 and 37 years old (M = 26,5 years), right-handed by self-report, had normal or corrected to normal vision, and no history of mental illness. They all gave written consent in accordance with the local ethics committee of the Otto-von-Guericke University and received the earnings they made in the foraging task as reimbursement. The sample size was calculated using the R library WebPower <ref type="bibr">(Zhang &amp; Yuan, 2018)</ref>. Assuming an effect size of Cohen's f = 1.31 <ref type="bibr">(Wolfe, 2013, experiment 5)</ref>, and one independent variable with three levels (patch quality, i.e., initial reward probability), a minimum of 9 participants was required to be able to detect a true effect of patch-quality on the participants' foraging behavior tested in a single-factor repeated measure ANOVA with a power of 90%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Stimuli</head><p>We used the Python toolbox "PsychoPy 3" (Peirce, 2019; Python 3.6) to control the stimulus presentation and response collection. In the fMRI scanning sessions the stimuli were back-projected onto an 18-inch screen placed in the bore of the magnet just behind the participant's head. The projector had a resolution of 1920:1080 pixels with a 60 Hz refresh rate. Viewing of the display was enabled via a mirror placed on top of the head coil. For navigation participants used a MR-compatible Fiber Optic Mouse with two standard buttons (left and right; FOM-2B-10B fMRI Mouse System, Nata Technologies Inc.). The mouse was placed on a 1800dpi Mouse pad (8.5 x 8.5 inch) that rested on participants' upper body roughly above waist level. The stimuli consisted of geometrical squares or circles of the color blue and green. Training stimuli were red and yellow. A single stimulus subtended 0.59°v isual angle. One stimulus type (e.g., all blue circles) was randomly assigned as the target type while the three remaining stimulus types served as distractors. A search display consistent of 40 target stimuli and 120 distractors. The spatial locations were randomly assigned on a spatial grid spanning a rectangle field of 12.9°* 14°visual angle. As the reward indication, we used an image of a 5 Euro Cent subtending 0.70°visual angle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Procedure</head><p>The experimental task was based on a visual search paradigm. Participants were required to search for multiple targets randomly located in the search display among distractor stimuli. Since the target object was defined by color and shape, subjects performed a feature conjunct search. At the beginning of the experimental session, after the training, they were shown the target item they had to look out for in the subsequent search (i.e., all blue circles occurring next to blue squares, green circles, and green squares). Participants used a MR-compatible PC-mouse to search through the display. To obtain a reward, they merely navigated the mouse point to a target. Once a target had been fixated for 300 ms, the target turned into a reward indicator (i.e., 1 Euro Cent) and then returned to its previous appearance. This served as the feedback that the target had been "foraged", and a reward had been received. The participants could then continue the search for the next target in the display. Each target item could be collected only once and it was deactivated following its detection so that a second fixation of the very same target would remain unrewarded. With each collected target item, an additional number of targets was deactivated too. These targets remained in the display but would not result in a reward following a fixation. The number of these additional deactivations was determined by an exponential decay function mimicking a quickly depleting food source ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure.1)</ref>. In addition, the entire spatial configuration of target and distractor locations changed randomly following a reward capture. This hindered participants from building any kind of search memory for old target locations and the search became increasingly difficult and quickly inefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Horowitz &amp; Thornton, 2008)</ref>. To compensate for this, participants could choose to switch to a new display by pressing the right mouse button at any time (i.e., patch leaving). The countdown did not pause when volunteers switched to the next display. The time needed to move to the next patch (i.e., display), known as the 'travel time', was set to a minimum of 2 s (central fixation cross for 1 s followed by a 1 s blank). Because of the time required to save data and calculate the next display, measured travel time between the last collection in a patch and the appearance of the next patch averaged approximately 5 s. We did not manipulate travel time as a dependent variable and kept it short to support exploratory foraging choices (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wolfe, 2013)</ref>. In the control condition the search in the current display ended automatically after two to four reward earnings. Each new trial had a 25% probability to end automatically.</p><p>At the display's left bottom corner, the participants were able to constantly track the total number of rewards they had already earned. At the bottom's right corner the countdown timer was displayed allowing participants to track their remaining search time. All participants performed six runs of a 10 minute search. Between runs they were able to take short breaks. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a trial sequence of the visual search task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Design</head><p>As we aimed to yield a high number of trials in which volunteers performed self-initiated patch leaving behavior we introduced the exponential decay of the reward probability adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lottem, Banerjee, Vertechi, Sarra, Lohuis &amp; Mainen (2018)</ref>. It ensured that the number of remaining rewards rapidly decreased within a short amount of time. Due to the time constraint, participants should decide to switch to a new display instead of wasting time in the current display in which a further reward capture quickly becomes very unlikely. We also varied the initial reward probabilities by applying three conditions from high (100% reward probability, i.e., all targets were active), middle (75%) to low probabilities (50%). The initial reward probability was not cued and changed randomly from trial to trial creating a foraging environment with an unpredictable underlying reward structure consistent with the condition of restless 'n'-armed bandit task (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Daw et al, 2006)</ref>. We used following decay function that was used to determine the number of remaining targets after each new reward capture <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lottem et al., 2018)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1) P(o n = 1 | t i ) = A i e (-(n-1))/5</formula><p>here t i is the ith trial type, i.e., low-, medium-, and high-quality trials. These trial types had different exponential scaling factors A1 = 0.5, A2 = 0.75, A3 = 1. N indicates the number of already yielded reward captures (previous target fixations that resulted in an earning) within a trial. O n is the positive outcome of the nth target fixation (1 for reward). The decaying reward probabilities as a function of target captures are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for all three patch qualities. At the beginning of a session, the target object (here a blue circle) was introduced. The beginning of a trial was cued by a central fixation (1 s) followed by a blank (1 s). Next, the search display (i.e., a patch) appeared. By navigating the mouse cursor to a target (red square with red dot at center in lower left), participants yielded a reward capture. Upon such a capture, the collected target turned into a reward for 500 ms (5 euro-cent image) and then changed back into its previous appearance. An already collected target would not turn into a reward again if fixated again. With each reward capture, all items changed positions randomly. At any time, participants were able to switch to a new display by button-press. In the control condition, these cancellations occurred automatically after a random number of targets had been captured. The graph in the box in the figure's top shows the exponential decay function of the reward probability for the three patch qualities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Behavioral data</head><p>Custom-written code in Python (version 3.6) was used to analyze participants' behavioral data. The behavioral data obtained in the control condition (automated search cancellations) were excluded from the behavioral analysis as we were interested in analyzing the self-initiated patch-leaving behavior. Single factor repeated-measures ANOVAs with patch quality (i.e., the start reward probability) as the single repeated-measures factor and twosided post-hoc t-tests with Tukey HSD correction for multiple comparisons using the Python package "pingouin" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Vallat, 2018)</ref> were used to test for differences between the patch qualities. QQ-Plots served for screening for violations of normality. In case of violations non-parametric alternatives were used for significance testing. We applied Greenhouse-Geiser corrections in case of non-sphericity. Linear regressions were used for within-subject analyses using the linregress function of python's stats library (Version 1.10.1) In all analyses, the averaged individual medians were used with no outlier correction to report descriptive statistics as well as for statistical testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">FMRI Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Image acquisition</head><p>To obtain the functional magnetic resonance imaging data (fMRI), all participants were scanned on a MAGNETOM Prisma (Siemens) 3 T whole body magnetic resonance imaging scanner at the campus of the University Clinic Magdeburg. The fMRI data was sampled using a standard head coil and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR, 2000 ms; TE, 30 ms; flip angle, 90; epi factor, 80; echo time, .49 ms; matrix size, 80x80; FOV, 240 mm; 36 slices with interleaved acquisition; 3 mm isotropic voxels; 0.3 mm interslice gap). The first three dummy scans were always excluded prior to analysis. For the anatomical T1-weighted MPRAGE scans were collected (TR, 2500 ms; TE, 2.82 ms; flip angle, 7; matrix size, 256 256; FOV, 256 mm; 192 slices, 1 mm isotropic resolution).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Pre-processing</head><p>A single scanning session was split into ten runs of 600 s each and 300 volumes were sampled per run. The imaging data was pre-processed and analyzed by means of tools of the FSL package <ref type="bibr">(Jenkinson, Beckmann, Behrens, Woolrich, &amp; Smith, 2012)</ref>. The anatomical scans underwent a non-brain removal with BET (Brain Extraction tool; Smith, 2002) in preparation for the realignment. The functional images were motion-corrected to an image in the middle of each run with a normalized correlation ratio (MCFLIRT; FMRIB's Linear Image Registration; Tool, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, &amp; Smith, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jenkinson &amp; Smith, 2001</ref>) and slice time corrected (temporally aligned to the middle slice of the 3D volume). To ensure the validity of Gaussian random field theory, the functional data was spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a size matching the double of the voxel dimensions (FWHM = 6 mm). To remove low-frequency drifts (Smith et al., 1999), we temporally filtered the data using a highpass filter with a cutoff value of 90 sec. Prior to the mass-univariate analysis, run 1, 2, and 3 as well as run 4, 5, and 6 were merged into two epochs 1 and 2 using fslmerge. This was done to ensure sufficient numbers of experimental and control trials for statistical analysis and was carried out after motion and slice time correction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">GLM-analysis</head><p>For statistical analyses of the functional brain scans, we defined the onsets of the experimental events as explaining variables (EV) to model the BOLD response by means of a general linear model. To be able to test for BOLD-signal changes specific to patch-leaving decisions, we added the onsets of the end of search for patch-leaving and control trials (i.e., the onsets when the current display was aborted) as the first two regressors to the linear model. To contrast BOLD-signal changes associated with patch-leaving with search-related activity, the onset of all target detections that occurred during the search phase of patch-leaving and control trials were also added to the model. For convolution we used a hemodynamic response function (double gamma HRF). To all six regressors a temporal derivative allowing for temporal flexibility was added. Serial voxel-wise autocorrelations were controlled with prewhitening by the FSL tool FILM <ref type="bibr">(Monti, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Woolrich, Ripley, Brady, &amp; Smith, 2001</ref>).</p><p>In the first-level analysis, all contrasts of interest were tested for significance under mixed-effect assumptions and contrast images were processed for each participant (voxelwise Z threshold of 2.3 and a cluster significance threshold of p = .05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected). Next, the resulting images containing the lower-level contrast of parameter estimates (COPEs) were used in the second-level analysis estimating individual mean contrasts for the parameters across all runs using a fixed-effect model with the same voxelwise and cluster significance threshold (Z = 2.3, p FWE = .05). In a two-step post-statistical normalization, prior to group analysis, the functional data was firstly co-registered to the individual, anatomical scan using boundary-based registration (BBR), and secondly normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space (MNI 152 2mm). Thus, statistical modeling on the subject level was carried out in native space. The statistical modeling at the group level was performed using FLAME 1+2 (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) as implemented in FSL's FEAT (Version 6.00). Results are given by means of whole-brain statistical z-maps on group-level thresholded at z &gt; 2.3 and corrected for multiple comparisons on a cluster level at p FWE &lt; 0.01 <ref type="bibr">(Worsley, 2001</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Participants adapted to changing patch qualities</head><p>Figure 2 a) shows dotplots of the number of obtained rewards as a function of patch quality. The single factor repeated measure ANOVA revealed a main effect of patch quality, F(2,38) = 220.90, p &lt; .001. As expected, the most rewards were obtained in the high quality patches with an average of 52 ± 13 cents. Compared to this participants earned on average 28 ± 4 cents less in low quality patches, t(18) = -8.185, p Tuckey = .001, and 13 ± 4 cents less in medium quality patches, t(18) = -3.538, p Tuckey = .003. Earnings in low quality patches were also on average 15 ± 3 cents less compared to medium quality patches, t(18) = -4.648, p Tuckey = .001. The same pattern of results we observed for the residence times (i.e, search times spent per display). The higher the patch quality, the longer the participants spent foraging in it, Friedman F(1.9,36.1) = 18.811, p &lt; .001, with longest average residence times of 48.364 ± 18.487 s in the high quality patches, followed by 42.623 ± 16.592 s in medium-quality, and 34.990 ± 18.768 in low-quality patches. Performing post-hoc contrasts with p-value correction (Tukey) showed that residence times in low-quality patches were significantly shorter compared to medium-, and high-quality patches, Nemenyi post-hoc, p = .019, and p = 001. Residence times as a function of patch quality are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2 b</ref>). Analyzing participants' residence times showed considerable variations across subjects. Given the underlying reward structure of the task, spending too much time searching in the current display instead of switching to a new one should be detrimental to overall earnings. Residence times averaged across patch types indeed correlated negatively with the averaged total earnings in Euros (€) demonstrating that the more participants tended to overexploit the current display, the less earnings they made in the total search time of 60 minutes, r pearson = -0.653, p = .002 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2 c</ref>). This confirmed that optimal performance under the given task depended on a readiness to switch displays quickly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Reward captures increased residence times incrementally</head><p>To test what could have driven participants to extend their residence times, we next regressed individuals' residence times on target captures to model participants' foraging strategies <ref type="bibr">(Wilke, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hutchinson, Wilke &amp; Todd, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mata, Wilke &amp; Czienskowski, 2009)</ref>. This way we obtained a slope and intercept for each participant, where the intercept represented the initial time spent in the current display without a reward detection while the slope indexed the increase in the residence time with each new reward capture. All slopes were positive and significantly above zero on group level, mean slope = 0.175, t(18) = 12,321, p &lt; .001, indicating that participants incrementally extended their stay with each new target detection (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2 d)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Prolonged giving-up times negatively impacted search performance</head><p>Considerable variation in participants' GUTs suggested that the participants differed in their behavioral tendency to either explore or exploit. Similar to the residence times, GUTs were negatively correlated with the task performance, measured by monetary earnings, r Pearson = -0.676, p = .001, <ref type="figure">(Figure 3 a)</ref>). The GUT can serve as a rather simple heuristic for participants to time their patch-leaving decisions. According to an optimal GUT rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McNair, 1982)</ref>, GUTs should be adjusted depending on patch quality with longer GUTs in patches of higher quality. We, however, observed the opposite: the average GUTs were 7.927 ± 3.250 s in high-quality patches, 8.531 ± 3.660 s in medium-quality patches, and 9.062 ± 4.025 s in low-quality patches, Friedman F(1.9 , 36.1) = 6.083, p = .006 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3 b)</ref>). Post-hoc contrasts confirmed that GUTs increased with decreasing patch quality at least between high-and medium-quality patches, p = .007, [high -low, p = .067, medium-low, p = .691]. Participants thus appeared to adjust their GUTs but in a non-optimal fashion. Plotting GUTs against the residence times <ref type="figure">(Figure 3 b)</ref>) also showed that GUTs were positively correlated with the residence times, r pearson = 0.63, p = .002. This finding, we followed up by regressing the GUTs averaged across patch qualities on the averaged residence times on a trial-by-trial basis within each subject. The resulting intercepts indexed the minimum GUT individuals accepted and the slopes represented the increment added to the GUT with each second more spent in the given display. We observed positive slopes for all participants [t(18) = 5.656, p &lt; .001] suggesting that the longer participants had already searched in the current display, the more likely they to invest even more time consistent with a sunk-cost effect ( see <ref type="figure">Figure 3 c)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Still optimal timing for patch-leaving on group level</head><p>Lastly, we analyzed participants' collection rate, that is, at what speed target detections occurred. The marginal value theorem (MVT) states that optimal foragers time their patch-leaving to the moment at which the instantaneous collection rate (ICR) approximates the average collection rate of the entire environment. The ICRs as a function of number of reward earnings for the last seven rewards for each patch quality are depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 3 d</ref>). They are given by the inverse of the time that passed between two consecutive target captures. To test the MVT prediction, we estimated the ICR at the moment of patch leaving by dividing 1 by the GUT instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McNair, 1982)</ref>. To obtain individuals' MCRs, we divided the total number of rewards received across the entire experimental session by the 60 minutes of total search time (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wolfe, 2013)</ref>. Note that this way the MCR also included the travel time during which the collection rate equals zero. Consistent with the MVT, Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests showed that ICRs, i.e., reward earnings per second, of 0.158 ± 0.1/s (SD) in high-quality patches did not differ statistically from the average rate of 0.164 ± 0.02/s, z = 63.0, p = .126. The same was true for medium quality patches, ICR = 0.152 ± 0.09/s, z = 70.0, p = .202, and in low-quality patches, ICR = 0.145 ± 0.09/s, z = 62.0, p = .114.</p><p>In summary, the incremental relationship between individual reward captures and residence times suggested that single reward events were read as cues indicating that it was worthwhile to continue searching the current display. Thus, subjects adapted their foraging to the changing reward probabilities and spent more time foraging in high-quality patches. Residence times as well as GUTs varied greatly across subjects implying that they differed in their behavioral tendency to explore. In contradiction with an optimal GUT rule, the participants tended to prolong their GUTs with decreasing patch quality and depending on sunk costs. Despite this, patch departures were still optimally timed according to the MVT.</p></div>

The number of rewards increased significantly with increasing patch quality. Trial durations indicated the same trend but only low-and high-quality patches differed significantly. In c) the regression plot shows the relation between the total earnings in € participants achieved in the entire experiment and residence times, both averaged across all patch-qualities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Positive BOLD-signal changes associated with patch leaving decisions</head><p>To test for brain regions particularly responsive to self-initiated switches between displays (i.e., patch-leaving), we contrasted these trials against those in which the search in the current display was automatically canceled (patch-leaving -control). This resulted in a single large cluster with 4853 voxels located in the medial frontal cortex, spanning bilaterally from the supplementary motor cortex (SMC) over the precentral to the postcentral gyrus. Left-laterally in the rostral direction the cluster extended ventrally to the anterior division of the cingulate cortex (dACC). Dorsally it reached up to the posterior parts of the superior frontal gyrus. Posteriorly, also in the left hemisphere, it included parts of the anterior division of the supramarginal gyrus. A second small cluster containing 760 voxel was located in the right temporo-occipital fusiform cortex (TOFC) reaching ventrally into the right cerebellum. The reverse contrast (control -patch-leaving) did not yield any significant results. The statistical z-map mapped on an MNI152 template are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4 a)</ref>. Voxel locations of maximum z-values are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Next, we contrasted the onsets at the moment of patch-leaving against the onsets of the target detections of both patch-leaving and control trials to identify brain areas being more responsive during patch-leaving compared to visual search (patch-leaving -target detections). The average time between the last target detection and the moment of patch-leaving was 7.5 s. This relatively large time window between the onsets of these regressors of interest, and the random temporal variations in their onsets precluded concerns about collinearity between patch leaving decisions and those target detections that had preceded the patch-leaving decision in the same trial. Also the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between two to target detections was on average about 3 s so that the regressors were sufficiently spaced in time. This contrast revealed three clusters in the frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex. Located in the prefrontal cortex, the smallest cluster of the three with 1474 voxels bordered dorsally into the right lateral FPC (latFPC). Ventrally, the cluster extended bilaterally along the paracingulate gyrus (PCG) down to the anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), i.e., the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ). More posteriorly another cluster with a size of 1558 voxels was located predominantly in the left parietal cortex. Its anterior borders resided in the left precentral gyrus (preCG). From there it spanned posteriorly over the angular gyrus (AG), to the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) where it reached ventrally to the temporo-occipital part of the left middle temporal gyrus. Posteriorly from the left SMG, it also extended to the superior division of the left occipital cortex. In addition, it also included voxels located in the left posterior insular and central opercular cortex (OPC). The largest cluster comprising 3603 voxels spanned parts of the posterior parietal cortex up to the anterior parts of the occipital cortex. It reached bilaterally from the precuneus (Pcu ) to the cuneus where it extended ventrally to the lingual gyrus (LG), also in both hemispheres. Neither the inverse contrast (control -detections) nor the interactions (patch-leaving -detection) -(control -detection) and (control -detection) -(patch-leaving -detections) yielded significant activation clusters. The statistical z-map for patch-leaving -detections mapped on an MNI152 template is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4 b</ref>). Individuals' parameter estimates retrieved from significant activation clusters are reported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> c) for both contrasts. Again, the beta weights indicated on average a positive signal change similar to the beta weights that resulted from the patch-leavingcontrol contrast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Brain signals of exploration correlate negatively with behavioral giving-up times</head><p>In keeping with our expectations we found activations, time-locked to self-initiated patch-leaving decisions, in the dACC, in parts of the dorsal (AIC and OPC) as well as in parts of the ventral attention network (left TPJ). While one cluster extended with a few voxels to the right lateral FPC (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16 b</ref>), transverse slice z = 16 and sagittal slice x = 32), the activation in this area during exploratory decision-making was less pronounced than anticipated. Yet, intriguingly, beta weights derived from the patch-leaving -detections contrast correlated, as expected, negatively with the participants' GUTs, r Pearson = -0.539, t(18) = 1.405, one-sided p = .007 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 4 d)</ref>). This suggested that those participants with a higher behavioral tendency to exploit the current display showed weaker signaling in the fronto-pariteal attention network during exploratory decision making. We followed this analysis up by calculating a two-sample t-test on the patch-leaving -detections contrast between those subjects with GUTs below the median GUT (8.9 s) (short-GUT) and those subjects with GUTs above the median (long-GUT). Testing short-GUT -long-GUT yielded cluster activations in brain regions responding more strongly during exploration in the short-GUT group compared to the long-GUT group. Z-maps of cluster activation of this analysis are reported in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. The analysis resulted in three clusters of which the largest with 2985 voxels was located in the anterior prefrontal cortex with its maximum z-scores located in the medial FPC. It spanned bilaterally over the medial and lateral FPC where parts of it matched the location in the right lateral FPC which had previously been observed in the patch-leaving -detections contrast in the within-subject analysis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4 b)</ref>). Yet, this time, the cluster extended even further rostrally where it reached bilaterally also into the medial FPC. Its ventral borders tapped into parts of ACC while its center mostly spanned from FPC over the PCG dorsal posteriorly to the SFG. The second cluster comprising 1646 voxels was located in the parietal cortex with its center spanning bilaterally along the IPS. Ventrally it reached into the posterior division of the cingulate cortex (DCC). Dorsally with significant contrast activation were also located in the right superior parietal lobule (SPL). The third cluster with a size of 902 voxels spanned parts of the left SMG and AG containing the TPJ matching locations previously detected in the within-subject analysis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4  b</ref>). The findings are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Calculating the same two-sample t-test on the patch-leaving -control contrast did not yield any results.</p><p>If the SOAs between targets varied significantly between the short-and the long-GUT group, it is possible that successive BOLD responses for single target detections could be more or less overlapping. A higher degree of overlap due to shorter SOAs in the short-GUT group could increase the activity strength in the moment of patch-leaving, thus confounding the between-group effect. In the low-quality patches SOAs of long-GUT subjects were on average 6.196 ± 1.002 s and 5.442 ± 1.036 s in short-GUT subjects, with anecdotal evidence comparable SOA lengths between the two groups, Bayes Factor 10 = 0.733 (BF 10 ). In medium-quality patches SOAs were on average 4.881 ± 0.509 s in long-and 4.297 ± 0.656 s in short-GUT subjects with anecdotal evidence for equal SOAs, BF 10 = 0.919. Only in high-quality patches the analysis provided anecdotal evidence for the longer SOAs in long-[4.383 ± 0.492 s] compared to short-GUT subjects [3.770 ± 0.629 s], BF 10 = 1.239. Given these results, it is rather unlikely that the observed group-difference in the BOLD signals during patch-leaving was driven by a difference in the degree of overlap of the BOLD responses building up in the search period.    <ref type="figure">5</ref>: Differential activations during patch-leaving between short-and long-GUT subjects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>We investigated the neural correlates of exploratory patch-leaving decisions during foraging in a human. To this end we designed a novel visual search paradigm that allowed us to study visual foraging behavior of human participants inside the MR scanner. Of particular interest were the time points in which the participants performed self-initiated switches to a new search display. In line with our predictions, the analysis of participants' BOLD signal during exploratory foraging choices (patch-leaving) revealed brain clusters with positive signal changes across both the dorsal and ventral attention networks including the right lateral FPC which confirms findings from bandit-like gambling tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Daw et al, 2006)</ref>. Remarkably, the strength of the positive signal strength in these areas correlated negatively with behavioral exploration bias. A follow-up analysis provided further insights showing that the BOLD-signal in medial and lateral FPC, SFG, TPJ and Pcu was more strongly modulated during patch-leaving in participants with below median GUTs compared to participants with above median GUTs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Relating behavioral signs of exploitation to signals of exploration</head><p>Our key aim was to identify possible links between participants' internal rules guiding patch-leaving decisions and brain activity. In keeping with previous gambling studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Daw et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laureiro-Martínez et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chakroun et al., 2020)</ref>, we could show that the right lateral FPC together with dACC and left TPJ was active when participants made patch-leaving decisions during foraging in a visual search task. The signal strength in the right lateral FPC reportedly correlates positively with attentional control and decision making during gambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Daw et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laureiro-Martínez et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zajkowski, Kossut &amp; Wilson, 2017)</ref> and is known to serve shifts of visual attention in non-foraging tasks ( e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pollmann &amp; Manginelli, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Extending this, we provide new evidence that participants who differ in their readiness to explore, indexed by different giving-up time durations, can also be distinguished by the degree to which lateral FPC, among other regions of the fronto-parietal attention network, is active at the moment participants decide to leave the patch. It was expected that participants with a higher readiness to make exploratory decisions also showed stronger FPC activations during patch leaving, because this region is known to be central for exploration, specifically the assessment of the potential value of alternative strategies and for the consequent re-distribution of cognitive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Badre, Doll, Long &amp; Frank., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boorman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boorman, Behrens, &amp; Rushworth, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cavanagh, Zambrano-Vazquez &amp; Allen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mansouri et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, heightened FPC activation may play a central role in facilitating the decision to leave a current patch. Thus, FPC may serve as a central hub in redistributing attentional resources by evaluating the potential benefits of staying versus leaving a patch <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mansouri, Rosa, Koechlin &amp; Buckley, 2017)</ref>. It may be that individuals with stronger FPC activation at the moment of patch-leaving have enhanced cognitive flexibility, allowing them to quickly weigh competing values of the current behavioral choice versus foregone alternatives and make more efficient decisions about exploration. This interpretation finds support from studies in elderly who show a decline in cognitive flexibility (e.g., Giller &amp; Beste 2019) as well as prolonged GUTs during foraging <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mata et al., 2013)</ref>. Other functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated age-related changes in activation patterns within the prefrontal cortex during working memory and attention tasks, often with less activity in elderly compared with young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Milham et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Reuter-Lorenz, 2002)</ref>. These age-related changes in brain activity are associated with changes in the dopaminergic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berry et al., 2016)</ref> and anatomical changes of the prefrontal surface area and thickness <ref type="bibr">(Dotson et al., 2016)</ref>. Similarly, it may be that already young adults show subtle neurofunctional or even anatomical differences resulting in a stronger or weakened activity in the brain network supporting attention and cognitive control. Clearly, our finding strongly suggests that FPC is involved in regulating the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. Individuals with higher FPC activation may have a greater inclination towards exploration, leading to shorter GUTs times. On the other hand, it may be that participants with prolonged GUTs merely adopted a suboptimal exploitative foraging strategy which could have led to a suppression of brain regions related to attentional exploration. By instructing a specific patch-leaving rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wilke et al., 2009)</ref>, it is possible that their behavior as well as the signaling in the FPC may change accordingly. More research will be needed to test these hypotheses. Yet another explanation could be that participants differ in their sensitivity to prediction errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chowdhury et al., 2013)</ref>: subjects may differ in how strongly they judge accumulating reward omissions so that its decreasing effect on the value of the current behavioral choice may be more or less strong. If reward omissions are judged less negatively, the value attributed to the current behavioral choice (i.e., exploitation) would then remain relatively high, while the assessment of the potential value of alternative choices (in our case exploring a new display), on the other hand, would be relatively suppressed. This could explain later patch-leaving decisions and decrease brain signals of attentional control in the moment of patch-leaving. It will be highly interesting to focus more on reward omission during the giving-up time phase and further examine the dopaminergic system using PET imaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Exploratory foraging choices rely on an interplay of different neural correlates</head><p>The decision to switch to a new display in our experiment certainly entailed a computational process in which the value of forgone options (i.e., exploring a new display) most likely represented by the FPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boorman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Manouri et al. et al., 2017)</ref> must be compared to and contrasted against the value of the current choice, supposedly represented and updated during performance monitoring executed by the dACC (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Daw et al 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ridderinkhof et al., 2004)</ref>. Consistent with this, dACC was shown to encode both the average value of the foraging environment and the costs of foraging <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kolling et al., 2012)</ref>. The activity we observed in dACC during patch-leaving decision may also be related to the evaluation of the unrewarded target fixations preceding the actual patch-leaving that may have led to a prediction error due to increasing number of omissions of expected rewards in the giving-up time phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rushworth &amp; Behrens, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Silvetti, Seurinck &amp; Verguts, 2011)</ref>. This notion is bolstered by evidence showing that neural firing rates in dACC of monkeys ramp up with the gradually depleting reward up to the point of patch-leaving <ref type="bibr">(Hayden, Pearson &amp; Platt, 2011)</ref>. Co-activation together with the dACC we also observed in the left anterior insular (AIC) which corresponds with other studies reporting co-activity of these areas arose such as during conflict or pain processing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Craig 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Medford &amp; Critchley 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Patch-leaving not only relies on reallocating attentional resources, but also requires disengaging from the existing attentional focus. Thus, in line with our predictions, we also found positive signal changes in the left TPJ: suppressed during visual search (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Shulman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Shulman, Astafiev, McAvoy, d'Avossa &amp; Corbetta, 2007)</ref>, the region is thought to be as a "circuit breaker" supporting the disengagement of attention from the current focus of attention, e.g., in response to an unforeseen and surprising event <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Corbetta, Patel &amp; Shulman, 2008)</ref>. Thus, the activity in the left TPJ during patch-leaving decisions may have served the disengagement from the current display which is in keeping with the idea that that the ventral attention network sends such reorienting signals to the dorsal attention network <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Corbetta et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Japee, Holiday, Satyshur, Mukai, &amp; Ungerleider, 2015</ref>). Yet the largest cluster that we observed to be active during patch-leaving decisions was bilaterally in the Pcu extending into the occipital cortex. We did not have particular hypotheses about Pcu activity during exploratory foraging choices but it may be that the activity we observed was related to attention shifting. A transient increase of neural activity in the Pcu time locked with attentional shifting was reported in a study in which subjects performed a card sorting task <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nagahama et al., 1999)</ref>. More recently, Li et al. (2020) showed a decrease in the functional connectivity between the right Pcu and MFG related to attentional decline in response to acute sleep deprivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Behavioral mechanisms driving patch-leaving decisions.</head><p>The large variation in GUTs showed that subjects differed in their GUT threshold with longer GUTs indexing a behavioral bias towards exploitation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mata et al., 2013)</ref> which had a negative impact on task performance. Although not optimal, the participants prolonged their GUTs with decreasing patch quality (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McNair, 1982)</ref>, and extended them depending on the time they had already invested in the current display, consistent with a sunk cost effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arkes &amp; Ayton, 1999)</ref>. Such fallacy during patch-based foraging was reported before (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hutchinson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Redish et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sweis et al., 2018a)</ref> and is reflected in the increased propensity of individuals to keep investing resources into a current endeavor that has already incurred significant costs even if that endeavor is unlikely to succeed or was already doomed to fail in the beginning. Marginal costs and benefits, but not past costs, should drive the decision making, which is why the fallacy is maladaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Navarro &amp; Fantino, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, participants' behavioral data showed that subjects increased their residence time in a current display incrementally in response to a new reward capture. This is consistent with the incremental rule of patch leaving. It assumes that once a patch is entered, the tendency to stay steadily declines with time. Each reward encounter, however, increments the current staying tendency, but if the decreasing tendency to stay crosses a lower threshold, the current patch is left (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wajnberg, Fauvergue &amp; Pons, 2000)</ref>. Thus, residence times in poor-quality patches remain short compared to the time spent in patches of higher quality, consistent with our data. Moreover, the incremental rule is well suited in environments with an aggregate reward structure in which the reward structure is difficult to assess before entering the patch (Hutchison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wilke &amp; Todd, 2008)</ref>. Such an environment would offer a few really good patches with very high but rare reward probabilities (i.e., most of the reward accumulates in a few patches). The argument would then be that a random encounter of a reward in the current patch could be used as a cue indicating that the forager may have hit one of the few rich patches, and, thus, should stay in it. In contrast, in a poor patch, the tendency to stay would decrease rapidly until the lower threshold for patch-leaving is met. This would result in longer residence times in high-compared to low-quality patches as well as to an incremental relationship between single rewards encounters and residence times consistent with our data. For our participants the rule worked well given the near optimal time points of patch-leaving according to the MVT (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lottem et al. (2018)</ref> designed a probabilistic foraging task from which we copied the underlying reward structure. Intriguingly, their study also showed that foraging mice behaved in keeping with the incremental rule. The mices' tendency to stay also decreased as a function of time and was incremented again with each reward capture, creating a step-wise trajectory of the probability to reside in the current patch as a function of residence time similar to the behavior of our human participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Concluding remarks</head><p>Tying in with previous studies examining the neural substrates of exploratory choices in the exploration-exploitation dilemma, FPC along with regions of the fronto-parietal attention network were implicated in behavioral exploration tested in a foraging paradigm. The association between behavioral giving-up times and frontopolar BOLD signal suggests that the FPC plays a central role in decision-making during attentional exploration. Individuals with higher FPC activation at the moment of patch-leaving exhibited shorter giving-up times, implying a stronger bias towards exploration and more efficient attentional control. The use of a foraging paradigm may enable comparisons with foraging tasks in other species.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The probabilistic visual search task.
