			<abstract>
				<p>Victims and witnesses are regularly intoxicated with alcohol during crimes and jurors must evaluate their testimony when making decisions. The current study investigated the effect of the crime role of a testimony-giver (victim or witness), their intoxication level during the crime, and jurors&apos; personal characteristics on mock jury decision-making. Participants (N = 181) read a trial transcript and completed a survey assessing trial-related judgements, demographics, and expectations about and experiences with alcohol. Lower victim/witness intoxication was associated with higher credibility ratings, lower cognitive impairment ratings, and more convictions. Crime role did not impact dependent variables and jurors&apos; characteristics had a limited influence: only alcohol-related work experience and the perceived gender of the victim/witness predicted a minority of decision types. The current study asserts the need for evidence-based jury education about alcohol and eyewitness memory with a focus on delivery via familiar metrics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Juror Characteristics</head><p>Criminal justice systems often lack consistent, evidence-based guidelines for the assessment of intoxicated people <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Evans et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hagsand et al., 2022b)</ref>. For example, Australia does not legally define intoxication outside driving-related cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. This produces substantial variation in trial discussions about alcohol, which is compounded by judges' reluctance to consult medical/psychological experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. Intoxicated is instead framed as a common knowledge matter, highlighting a critical assumption that jurors can accurately resolve complex intoxicationrelated debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. It is therefore necessary to understand how jurors' beliefs about alcohol intoxication influence their decision-making.</p><p>Alcohol expectancies are assumptions about the consequences of alcohol consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Connors &amp; Maisto, 1988)</ref>. For example, alcohol is believed to boost sociability, sexual interest, and aggression <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Crawford, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Critchlow, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Quigley &amp; Leonard., 2006)</ref>. It is also expected to damage cognitive functions including memory, information-processing, and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goldman et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Leigh, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Monds et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>There is a dearth of research exploring the impact of alcohol expectancies on jury decision-making. Nonetheless, <ref type="bibr">Thorley et al. (2016)</ref> offers valuable insight into alcohol expectancy effects in a forensic context. Participants were less likely to accept misinformation when they believed a co-witness was intoxicated during an event compared to sober (in fact the co-witness was always sober). The 'intoxicated' co-witness was also rated as less accurate, credible, and trustworthy than the sober co-witness. In short, participants adjusted credibility judgements according to expectations about alcohol-induced memory impairment, reducing the flow of misinformation.</p><p>Jurors are often asked to imagine themselves as the intoxicated person when evaluating their credibility, emphasising the need to consider a broader range of juror characteristics (e.g., age, gender, drinking habits; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Martin and Monds (2023)</ref> found that heavier drinkers rated an intoxicated victim as less credible compared to less frequent drinkers, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Evans and Schreiber Compo (2010)</ref> observed that heavier drinkers perceived a witness as more impaired -but only when that witness was sober. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Martin et al. (2023b)</ref> documented a significant influence of personal characteristics (e.g., age, drinking habits, alcohol-related training) on laypeople's definitions of low, moderate, and severe intoxication, and their perceived threshold for alcohol-induced memory impairment.</p><p>These findings indicate that juror characteristics warrant further investigation. The current study aimed to clarify mixed results and achieve a more complete estimation of jury decision-making in intoxication-related cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Study</head><p>This study used a trial simulation to examine the impact of (1) witness/victim intoxication status during a crime and (2) crime role, on mock jurors' evaluations of testimony credibility, cognitive impairment, and verdict decisions. We also investigated the contribution of mock jurors' alcohol expectancies and personal characteristics to these outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Aims</head><p>H1A: Guilty verdicts will be fewer, and victims/witnesses rated as less credible and more cognitively impaired when they were intoxicated compared to sober. H1B: Mock jurors will not differentiate between low, moderate, and severe intoxication when assessing credibility, cognitive impairment, and verdict. H2: Guilty verdicts will be fewer, credibility ratings lower, and cognitive impairment ratings higher in cases with victim testimony compared to witness testimony. H3: H3: The negative effect of intoxication on jury decision-making will be stronger when mock jurors read testimony from a victim compared to a witness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Aims</head><p>The influence of the following juror characteristics on decision-making were also explored: alcohol expectancies, personal alcohol consumption, age, gender, alcohol-related work and training experiences, and the perceived gender of the victim/witness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>This study was approved by the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee <ref type="bibr">[REF: 2023/441</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>An a priori power analysis in G*Power indicated that a sample of 179 would be sufficient to detect an effect size f = .25 with power = .80 given the planned analyses.</p><p>Participants were recruited via Prolific and received £4.50 upon completion. They were required to be at least eighteen years of age; Australian citizens or living in Australia; and fluent in English, based on Australian jury eligibility. 1</p><p>All participants responded correctly to attention check questions. In total, nineteen participants did not correctly recall the victim/witness' intoxication status or the individual who provided testimony at trial. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cullen and Monds (2020)</ref> endorse retaining these participants to improve ecological validity because real jurors often forget trial information.</p><p>We made a pre-registered decision not to exclude these participants based on this recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Martin et al., 2023a)</ref>.</p><p>The sample comprised 181 participants (96 males, 82 females, 3 gender diverse). The average age was 35.4 years (SD = 11.7; ranging from 18 -73 years). The following ethnic backgrounds were present: European/Caucasian (71.8%); Asian (20.4%); Other (3.3%); Indigenous Australian or Torres Strait Islander (1.1%); Middle Eastern (1.1%); Pacific Islander (1.1%); African (.6%); and Hispanic (.6%). In total, 25.4% of participants had worked in a role where they served alcohol, and 26.7% had received training for this purpose.</p><p>Most participants (32.6%) consumed alcohol 'monthly or less', followed by '2 -4 times a month' (31.5%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The study employed a 4 (victim/witness intoxication status: sober, low, moderate, severe) x 2 (crime role: victim, witness) between-subjects design. Juror characteristics (e.g., alcohol expectancies, personal alcohol consumption, alcohol-related work experience, demographic factors) were also explored as predictors. Key dependent variables included verdict, victim/witness credibility, and victim/witness cognitive impairment during the crime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus Materials</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial Transcripts</head><p>The trial transcripts included judicial instructions, prosecution and defence statements, and victim/witness testimony and cross-examination. Opening and closing judicial instructions were modelled from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book (2021).</p><p>All transcripts described a robbery case adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Martin and Monds (2023)</ref>. The victim/witness reported they had been walking home from dinner when they experienced or witnessed a robbery outside their apartment building. The gender of the victim/witness was deliberately left ambiguous. Participants were informed they would be acting as jurors and instructed to read all materials carefully. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intoxication Status Manipulation</head><p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of four victim/witness intoxication conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Martin et al. (2023b)</ref> surveyed Australian adults to establish common definitions of low, moderate, and severe intoxication in terms of standard drinks, symptoms, and language. We used this data to inform an evidence-based intoxication manipulation and ensure intoxication status was communicated using metrics familiar to mock jurors. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarises the four intoxication conditions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crime Role Manipulation</head><p>Half the sample (n = 91) read a transcript containing testimony from the victim, while the remaining half (n = 90) read a version with testimony from a witness. The events of the robbery remained consistent across crime role conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>Participants reported their age, gender, ethnicity, first/preferred language, and Australian citizenship and residency status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alcohol Expectancies</head><p>The Brief Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Questionnaire (B-CEOA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ham et al., 2005</ref>) is a fifteen-item measure of alcohol outcome expectancies and valuations. Participants rated their agreement with statements describing a possible consequence of alcohol consumption (e.g., 'They would feel dizzy') on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = disagree, 4 = agree). Total positive and negative expectancy scores were calculated, where higher scores indicated more positive and negative valuations of alcohol consequences, respectively. 3 The B-CEOA possessed acceptable reliability (Cronbach's = .71).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceptions of Police</head><p>The Perceptions of Police Scale (POPS; Nadal &amp; Davidoff, 2015) was included as a distractor task. Participants rated their agreement with twelve statements about police on a 5point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Higher scores indicated more positive perceptions of police.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verdict</head><p>Participants delivered a dichotomous verdict (i.e., 'guilty' or 'not guilty') and rated the probability that the defendant committed the crime on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not likely at all, 7 = very likely). Higher scores indicated stronger belief in defendant guilt.</p><p>Participants also explained their verdict in response to the following: 'Please provide a brief justification of your verdict decision'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Credibility</head><p>A seven-item measure adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berman &amp; Cutler (1996)</ref> assessed the perceived credibility of the victim/witness at trial. Items measured perceptions of the victim/witness' honesty, accuracy, overall credibility, cognitive competence, likeability, trustworthiness, and consistency. Ratings were provided on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very), where higher scores indicated greater perceived credibility. Individual item responses were added to create a total victim/witness credibility score. The instrument possessed acceptable reliability consistent with prior research (victim Cronbach's = .91; witness Cronbach's = .91).</p><p>3 Items 1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, and 15 were added to generate a total positive expectancy score. Items 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 14 were added to generate a total negative expectancy score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Impairment</head><p>A single 7-point Likert scale assessed the perceived cognitive impairment of the victim/witness during the crime (1 = not at all, 7 = very). Higher scores indicated greater perceived cognitive impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal Alcohol Consumption</head><p>The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test -Consumption (AUDIT-C; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bush et al., 1998</ref>) measured participants' personal alcohol consumption. The AUDIT-C is a three-item multiple choice screening tool for hazardous alcohol use. Higher total scores indicated greater personal alcohol consumption. The scale demonstrated acceptable reliability (Cronbach's = .72).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alcohol-Related Work and Training Experiences</head><p>Participants reported whether they had worked in alcohol service and completed training for this purpose via two items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Monds et al. (2022)</ref>. Those who responded 'yes' to the second item were asked to provide the name of the training and the country it was completed in.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions to Decision-Making</head><p>Participants reported whether the type of drink consumed by the victim/witness before the crime affected the credibility of their testimony. They also reported whether they would have delivered the same verdict if the victim/witness was sober/intoxicated (i.e., the inverse of the intoxication condition they were assigned to). Responses were delivered via yes/no items.</p><p>Participants also provided any extra information that would have benefited their assessment of how intoxicated the victim/witness was during the crime. Participants also reported the gender of the victim/witness via a multiple-choice item.</p><p>The 'don't know' and 'gender diverse' options were collapsed as text responses indicated the latter was used as a substitute for 'don't know'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation Checks</head><p>Participants reported (1) how the victim/witness described their intoxication level during the crime, (2) how intoxicated they thought the victim/witness was during the crime, and (3) who provided testimony at trial, via multiple-choice items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention Checks</head><p>Attention check questions (e.g., 'Select [5] here') were added to the POPS and victim/witness credibility measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study was hosted online via Qualtrics and took approximately thirty minutes to complete. Participants provided informed consent, then completed the demographic questionnaire, B-CEOA, and POPS. They were randomly assigned to read one of eight trial transcripts. Participants delivered a dichotomous verdict, rated the likelihood of defendant guilt, and justified their verdict decision after reviewing the case. They then rated the credibility of the victim/witness at trial and their degree of cognitive impairment during the crime. Participants completed the AUDIT-C and reported their alcohol-related work and training experiences. They answered questions about the contribution of drink type to their verdict and further intoxication information required, then reported the gender of the victim/witness. Finally, participants completed manipulation checks, and were debriefed and paid for their time. We did not observe a significant main effect of crime role or an interaction effect, F(1, 173) =</p></div>

" = .03.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Impairment</head><p>The single item 7-point cognitive impairment scale was collapsed into three categories due to low cell counts: 'not/slightly impaired' (1 -3), 'moderately impaired' (4), and 'highly impaired' (5 -7). <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> presents the distribution of collapsed cognitive impairment ratings across conditions. Finally, intoxicated victims/witnesses were rated as 'highly impaired' more often than sober victims/witnesses, p &lt; .05. More specifically, sober victims/witness were rated as 'highly impaired' less frequently than those intoxicated to a low degree, p &lt; .05. Additionally, those who were intoxicated to a low degree were rated as 'highly impaired' less frequently than those who were moderately/severely intoxicated, p &lt; .05. Mock jurors did not distinguish between moderate and severe intoxication when rating a victim/witness as 'highly impaired', p &gt; .05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verdict</head><p>Dichotomous Verdict. In total, 29.3% of mock jurors convicted the defendant and 70.7% favoured acquittal. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> presents the distribution of dichotomous verdicts across conditions. Intoxication status was significantly associated with dichotomous verdicts according to a chi-square analysis, χ " (3, N = 181) = 14.73, p = .002, c = .285. Crime role was not significantly associated with dichotomous verdicts, χ " (1, N = 181) = .29 p = .591. Verdict Ratings. The single item 7-point verdict rating scale was collapsed into three categories due to low cell counts: 'unlikely' (1 -3), 'neither likely nor unlikely' (4), and 'likely' (5 -7). <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> provides the distribution of collapsed verdict ratings across conditions. Chi-square analyses indicated that intoxication status was significantly associated with verdict rating, χ " (6, N = 181) = 18.05, p = .006, c = .223. Crime role was not significantly associated with verdict rating, χ " (2, N = 181) = .94, p = .625. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Analyses: Quantitative</head><p>The effects of the following juror characteristics were explored alongside intoxication status to achieve a more complete approximation of jury decision-making: alcohol expectancies, age, gender, personal alcohol consumption, alcohol-related work, and perceived gender of the victim/witness.</p><p>Two alcohol expectancy scores were generated per participant: a total positive alcohol expectancy score (PAE) and a total negative alcohol expectancy score (NAE). Average PAE and NAE scores were 21.6 (SD = 3.1) and 21.1 (SD = 2.8), respectively. The average AUDIT-C score was 3.1 (SD = 2.4), indicating 'non-hazardous' levels of alcohol consumption.</p><p>Alcohol-related work and training experiences were highly positively correlated, (r = .604, p &lt; .001). Therefore, alcohol-related work was used a proxy for both variables.</p><p>Victim/witness intoxication, ethnicity, and perceived gender of the victim/witness were dummy coded with sober, European/Caucasian, and male as reference groups. Crime role was omitted from the following analyses based on consistent non-significant findings observed in primary analyses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Impairment</head><p>An ordinal logistic regression explored the effect of victim/witness intoxication status and juror characteristics on perceptions of cognitive impairment during the crime. As before, the collapsed impairment rating was used as the dependent variable.</p><p>Mock jurors were less likely to rate the victim as cognitively impaired when they were sober compared to intoxicated. These odds decreased by 94.4%, 99.5%, and 99.8%</p><p>when the victim/witness was intoxicated to a low, moderate, and severe degree, respectively, b = -b, p &lt; .001; b = -5.395 p &lt; .001; estimate = -6.490, p &lt; .001.</p><p>Additionally, mock jurors with alcohol-related work experience were 169.1% more likely to rate the victim/witness as cognitively impaired compared to those without this experience, b = .990, p = .040. No other predictors were significant, all p ≥ .095.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verdict</head><p>Dichotomous Verdict. A binary logistic regression investigated the impact of victim/witness intoxication status and juror characteristics on dichotomous verdicts. The odds of acquittal increased by 280.0% when the victim/witness was moderately intoxicated compared to sober, b = 1.335, OR = 3.798, p = .009. Likewise, these odds increased by 302.7% when the victim/witness was severely intoxicated compared to sober, b = 1.393, OR = 4.028, p = .006. No other predictors were significant, all p ≥ .128.</p><p>Verdict Ratings. An ordinal logistic regression assessed the effect of victim/witness intoxication status and juror characteristics on collapsed verdict ratings. Mock jurors were more likely to rate the defendant as guilty when the victim/witness was sober compared to moderately or severely intoxicated. These odds increased by 248.7% and 299.1%, respectively, b = 1.249, p = .005; b = 1.384, p = .001.</p><p>Additionally, mock jurors were 57.7% less likely to rate the defendant as guilty when they perceived the victim/witness as male compared to when they were unsure of the victim/witness' gender, b = -.860, p = .014. No other predictors were significant, all p ≥ .328.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions to Decision-Making</head><p>Mock jurors reported that the type of drink consumed by the victim/witness (i.e., lemonade or wine) affected their credibility in 26.7% of cases when the victim/witness was sober and 64.0% of cases when they were intoxicated. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> presents the distribution of these decisions across conditions. Additionally, 60.3% of mock jurors exposed to an intoxicated victim/witness reported they would change their verdict had the victim/witness been sober during the crime.</p><p>Alternatively, 42.2% of mock jurors exposed to a sober victim/witness would have changed their verdict if the victim/witness had been intoxicated. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref> presents the distribution of these verdict changes across crime role conditions. Note: The 'Hypothetical Intoxication Status' column refers to the opposite of the victim/witness intoxication status the participant was exposed to in the trial transcript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Analyses: Qualitative</head><p>Participants provided a brief justification for their verdict decision and reported any further information they required to accurately assess the victim/witness' level of intoxication during the crime. The first author reviewed all verdict justifications to conduct a qualitative description analysis informed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sandelowski (2000)</ref>. Next, content-based categories were developed iteratively based on conceptual similarities in the data. Each category then received a code. Codes were applied to verdict justification data and responses could receive multiple codes (i.e., contain multiple justifications). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> This process was replicated to develop codes for the intoxication assessment responses. A second independent rater applied these coding systems to 25% of written responses to ensure that the codes logically followed from the data. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref> provides the most frequent justifications for mock jurors' verdict decisions, separated by verdict type. 3 The environmental circumstances of the crime as described by the victim/witness (e.g., darkness, briefness of interaction, distance between perpetrator and victim/witness).</p></div>

Contrary to hypotheses, mock jurors were able to distinguish between intoxication levels across each dependent variable: in general, greater</p><p>intoxication was associated with lower credibility ratings, higher cognitive impairment ratings, and fewer convictions. Crime role did not impact evaluations of credibility, cognitive impairment, or verdicts.</p><p>Victim/witness intoxication status retained its significant effect on all dependent variables when considered alongside juror characteristics. Additionally, alcohol-related work experience predicted cognitive impairment ratings, and the perceived gender of the victim/witness informed verdict ratings. Alcohol expectancies notably failed to influence any dependent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Victim/Witness Intoxication Status</head><p>The current study replicated the finding that intoxicated victims/witness are evaluated less favourably than their sober counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Crossland et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Evans &amp; Schreiber Compo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Martin &amp; Monds, 2023)</ref>. However, past research has not detected differences between specific intoxication levels: low, moderate, and severe intoxication were seen as equally detrimental to a victim/witness' testimony or line-up identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Crossland et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Evans &amp; Schreiber Compo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Martin &amp; Monds, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The current study diverged from this established pattern of results. Mock jurors differentiated between intoxication levels -or at least the upper and lower limits of intoxication -across assessments of credibility, cognitive impairment, and verdicts. This promising recognition of the dose-specific effect of alcohol on memory may be driven by the communication of intoxication information in this study. Our manipulation was informed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Martin et al. (2023b)</ref>: we used Australian adults' definitions of low, moderate, and severe intoxication across language, standard drinks, and symptoms to construct each condition.</p><p>Therefore, our results suggest that discussing intoxication using familiar descriptions can facilitate jurors' understanding of dose-specific effects of alcohol on recall, benefitting their assessment of a victim/witness and verdict decisions.</p><p>However, we should not overstate the success of these findings. Almost all mock jurors wanted more information to accurately identify intoxication status -with many desiring 'objective' evidence (e.g., blood alcohol concentration) or a second opinion (e.g., testimony from others who interacted with the victim/witness). This implies (a) jurors' lack of confidence when interpreting intoxication without support, and (b) the need for detailed trial discussion of intoxication using a variety of assessment tools.</p><p>Additionally, mock jurors did not always differentiate between every intoxication level. For example, mock jurors did not distinguish between moderate and severe intoxication when judging a victim/witness as 'highly impaired', or when delivering verdicts. This suggests there is room to fine-tune jurors' assessment of intoxication evidence because alcohol affects people differently at moderate and severe levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jores et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Otgaar et al., 2022)</ref>. Expert testimony offers a promising solution by dramatically increasing the role of evidence-based information about alcohol in the courtroom -especially if experts discuss intoxication using metrics familiar to jurors <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crime Role</head><p>Contrary to hypotheses, crime role did not influence assessments of credibility, cognitive impairment, or verdict decisions -and did not interact with intoxication status. This Additionally, only a minority of mock jurors perceived the robbery victim/witness as female. More pronounced crime role differences may emerge in scenarios that activate unique negative female intoxication and victimisation stereotypes (e.g., sexual assault; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blume, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">George et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lynch et al., 2013)</ref>. Nonetheless, the current study offered further support for the conclusion that victims and witnesses can be treated as equivalent in this research area and when implementing jury education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Juror Characteristics</head><p>The general absence of juror characteristic effects reinforces the need to optimise jurors' evaluation of dose-specific intoxication evidence, as this appears to drive their decision-making. However, the limited influence of alcohol-related work experience and the perceived gender of the victim/witness suggests we should not disregard juror characteristics completely. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Martin et al. (2023b)</ref> observed that age, personal alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related training shaped how laypeople described intoxication levels and their perceived thresholds for alcohol-induced memory impairment. These characteristics could become more influential in real trials involving greater detail, as jurors might favour heuristic over deliberative information-processing to manage complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kunda, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lieberman, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The unexpected lack of alcohol expectancy effects could be a product of their measurement. The B-CEOA may lack sensitivity to expectancy-related issues specific to trial contexts. The B-CEOA measures expectations about risk and aggression, liquid courage, cognitive and behavioural impairment, tension reduction, self-perception, sexuality, and sociability <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ham et al., 2005</ref>). An alcohol-expectancy measure more focused on cognition and memory may draw out expectancy effects given the focus on capacity for accurate recall at trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>This research provides valuable insight into how jurors evaluate victims/witnesses at varying levels of intoxication, but several limitations are acknowledged. We utilised a brief trial transcript without deliberation like most mock juror studies <ref type="bibr">(Bornstein, 1999)</ref>. However, a detailed trial simulation with analysis of jurors' group deliberations is essential to understand how jurors conceptualise intoxication evidence and its explicit role in their decision-making. Additionally, videotaped court proceedings offer a more complete investigation of jurors' evaluation of victim/witness credibility than written transcripts.</p><p>Victim/witness' mannerisms and demeanour are important factors affecting credibility assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McKimmie et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Future research should examine the efficacy of expert testimony in intoxicationrelated cases. Although valuable recommendations about the content and boundaries of such testimony exist (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Connell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Otgaar et al., 2022)</ref>, research is yet to determine whether jurors effectively apply this information -especially at the dose-specific level. The current study asserts the way intoxication is discussed matters: experts must use descriptions and metrics familiar to jurors to facilitate their understanding.</p><p>Further research is also required to establish whether victim/witness equivalence extends to intoxicated suspects. Suspect intoxication is associated with perceptions of a suspect as more cognitively impaired and likely to self-incriminate, and fewer convictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hagsand et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mindthoff et al., 2020)</ref>. A comparison of intoxicated suspects, victims, and witnesses may parse unique effects given the contradictory legal outcomes of discrediting these individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The current study asserts that the framing of intoxication evidence is crucial at trial.</p><p>Familiar metrics can improve jurors' sensitivity to dose-specific effects of alcohol intoxication on recall, benefiting their decision-making. Nonetheless, alcohol intoxication cannot be dismissed as merely common knowledge; jurors appear unable to consistently interpret the complexities of intoxication without evidence-based support. Future research must investigate the specific legal tools available to assist jury decision-making in intoxication-related cases (e.g., expert testimony), with a focus on improved ecological validity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>CredibilityA</head><label></label><figDesc>linear regression assessed the influence of victim/witness intoxication status and juror characteristics on perceived credibility.
