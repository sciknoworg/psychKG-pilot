			<abstract>
				<p>This study examines how individual differences in Pavlovian learning profiles-specifically between sign-trackers and goal-trackers-shape maladaptive decision-making. Using a modified version of the Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm, we tested 60 participants to investigate whether sign-trackers display a stronger maladaptive Pavlovian bias in decision-making compared to goal-trackers. Both groups successfully learned optimal decision-making strategies, but signtrackers deviated more frequently when presented with task-irrelevant, outcome-predictive cues, showing a pronounced reliance on suboptimal strategies. Computational modeling revealed that this maladaptive bias stems from slower Pavlovian cue value updating (Pavlovian α) among sign-trackers, a process further linked to their heightened incentive value attribution to cues (measured via pupil dilation). These findings provide critical insights into the computational and motivational mechanisms underlying maladaptive decision-making and support the presence of a link between sign-trackers and cognitive vulnerabilities. The results carry significant implications for understanding susceptibility to addictive behaviors and other pathologies involving maladaptive cue-driven decisions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In a typical autoshaping procedure of Pavlovian learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown &amp; Jenkins, 1968)</ref>, an environmental cue (conditioned stimulus) predicts a reward delivered in a different location <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berridge, 2000)</ref>. Individuals vary significantly in how they learn from and respond to these environmental cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Garofalo et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garofalo &amp; di Pellegrino, 2015)</ref>. Specifically, two distinct learning profiles have been identified in non-human animals based on their conditioned responses to the cue: sign-trackers and goal-trackers. Upon presentation of the Pavlovian cue, sign-trackers approach the reward-predictive cue itself (the "sign") and only afterward approach the reward's location, while goal-trackers move directly to the location of the reward (the "goal") <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Colaizzi et al., 2020)</ref>. Notably, sign-trackers persist in approaching the cue even when doing so delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Breland &amp; Breland, 1961)</ref> or prevents them from retrieving the reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chang &amp; Smith, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hearst &amp; Jenkins, 1974)</ref>. This seemingly maladaptive behavior is thought to occur because, although the cue predicts the reward for both groups equally, it acquires a higher incentive value for sign-trackers. Furthermore, the acquisition of incentive value has been demonstrated to directly influence ongoing instrumental actions (i.e., Pavlovian bias on decision-making), generally favoring reward-seeking behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Marzuki et al., 2024;</ref>. Supporting this view, sign-trackers exhibit maladaptive behaviors typically linked to higher incentive value attribution, such as increased impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Flagel et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Saunders &amp; Robinson, 2010)</ref>, larger deficit in attentional control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cherian et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Paolone et al., 2013)</ref>, and propensity to develop addictive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Tomie &amp; Morrow, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The distinction between sign-trackers and goal-trackers has been extended to humans by measuring oculomotor responses during Pavlovian tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cherkasova et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Colaizzi et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cope et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dinu et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garofalo &amp; di Pellegrino, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Joyner et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Le Pelley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pearce et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schad et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Versace et al., 2019)</ref>, revealing similar differences than those found in non-human animals (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Colaizzi et al., 2020 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Heck et al., 2024)</ref>. This research has been crucial in advancing our understanding of individual differences in decisionmaking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garofalo and di Pellegrino (2015)</ref> first found that Pavlovian cues influence decision-making more strongly in human sign-trackers than in goal-trackers (but see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cherkasova et al., 2024)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schad et al. (2020)</ref> later replicated these findings, using psychophysiological measures to confirm that sign-trackers, consistent with the animal model, attribute higher incentive value to the reward cue, with changes in pupil dilation reflecting cue value in sign-but not goal-trackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Garofalo &amp; di Pellegrino, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schad et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>However, two important questions remain in the literature on human sign-and goal-tracking behavior. First, despite the putative relation between sign-tracking and maladaptive behaviors a direct connection between the two in humans is yet to be demonstrated. Second, the computational and motivational mechanisms underlying maladaptive Pavlovian biases is not yet clear. In fact, previous studies have shown that conditioned responses in sign-trackers tend to be more resistant to extinction than in goal-trackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahrens et al., 2016)</ref> and that sign-tracking is linked to increased salience in response to reward cues but not to reward feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Duckworth et al., 2022)</ref>. In light of this evidence, we hypothesize two possible mechanisms through which incentive salience can favor the maladaptive Pavlovian bias in sign-trackers: it may be due to the value that sign-trackers attribute to the reward cue per se, rather than to the instrumental actions, or alternatively, it may be due to an inability to update the value of the cue based on reward expectancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ostlund &amp; Marshall, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Building on this background, the present work directly tests the extent to which sign-trackers, as opposed to goal-trackers, exhibit a maladaptive Pavlovian bias in decision-making and the computational mechanisms underlying such bias. Specifically, we first investigate whether human sign-trackers, as compared to goal-trackers, exhibit higher suboptimal choices when presented with a Pavlovian cue that predicts a poor option as compared to a rich option (i.e., a maladaptive Pavlovian bias). To test this hypothesis, we implement a modified version of the Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Badioli et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cartoni et al., 2016)</ref> which allowed to test optimal and suboptimal strategies of decision-making . Then, we employ a computational model to estimate: the relative weight of the reward cue value versus response value in decision-making ( ), and the rate of reward cue value updating (Pavlovian α). A difference between sign-trackers and goal-trackers in would support a difference in the weight attributed to the reward cue, while a difference in Pavlovian α would suggest differences in value updating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The number of participants was established based on a power analysis conducted on MorePower 6.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Campbell &amp; Thompson, 2012)</ref> for the planned 4x2 mixed-measures ANOVAs. Specifically, the following parameters were used: Repeated Measures design factors = 1 factor (conditioned stimulus, CS) with 4 levels (CS+1, CS+2, CS-, No CS); Independent Measures design factors = 1 factor (Group) with 2 levels (sign-trackers, goal-trackers); effect size (ηp 2 ) = 0.08; significance level = 0.05; power = 0.9. The effect size was estimated based on the minimum effect size (ηp 2 ) obtained by previous studies conducted with a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer task <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Degni et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Garofalo et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Garofalo et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Garofalo et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garofalo &amp; di Pellegrino, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Garofalo &amp; Robbins, 2017)</ref>. A-priori power analysis resulted in a minimum sample of 56. Here, the additional manipulation of the instrumental learning phase suggested a smaller effect size <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lakens, 2013)</ref>. Hence, 60 volunteers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases were recruited. Data from four participants were unusable due to technical issues during eyetracking recording. Two more participants did not provide usable eye-tracking data for classification as sign-trackers or goal-trackers because they did not reach the minimum fixation threshold (80% of the fixation time on the regions of interest; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cherkasova et al., 2024)</ref>. Six additional participants were recruited to reach the planned sample size of 60 participants (30 females, mean age = 24.2; sd = 4.34 years; mean education = 16.4; sd = 1.9 years). The study was conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Bologna (Prot. 201070, 24/09/2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Task</head><p>The task was adapted from . It was structured as a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm divided into 3 consecutive phases: Pavlovian learning phase, in which participants learned CS-outcome associations; Instrumental learning phase, in which participants learned response-outcome associations; Transfer phase, in which Pavlovian bias on instrumental responses was tested.</p><p>An image of a slot-machine on a grey background was presented during all task phases, composed of two displays on the top and bottom and a fixation cross in the centre <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). During the instrumental and transfer phases, two levers appeared, respectively on the right and left of the slotmachine, to represent the two available instrumental actions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The task was programmed and run on OpenSesame v3.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mathôt et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pavlovian learning phase</head><p>In the Pavlovian learning phase, participants learned the associations between three CSs (i.e., fractal images balanced for luminance, complexity, and colour saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Finke et al., 2021)</ref> and three corresponding outcomes. Two CSs were used as CSs+ (CS+1 and CS+2). In 80% of the trials, these CSs were respectively associated with two different rewarding outcomes (O1 and O2), which were highly and equally desirable food snacks tailored to each participant <ref type="bibr">(Garofalo et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garofalo &amp; di Pellegrino, 2015)</ref>. In the remaining 20% of the trials, these CSs were associated with a non-rewarding outcome ("X"). The third CS served as CS-, associated with the non-rewarding outcome ("X") in all trials. The association between CSs and outcomes was counterbalanced across subjects. On each trial <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1a</ref>), an empty slot-machine was presented in the centre of the screen (Intertrial Interval, ITI, 5000 ms). Then, one of the three CSs appeared on its upper display for 5000 ms, followed by the image of the corresponding outcome (1000 ms) in the lower display, while the CS remained stable on the upper display. No levers were presented during this phase.</p><p>A series of blocks, each composed of 30 trials (i.e., 10 trials for each CSs), were repeated until a learning criterion was achieved. Each block had an average duration of 6 minutes, followed by multiple-choice questions presented on the display to ensure that all CS-outcome associations were correctly established (i.e., "What food did you earn with this stimulus?", repeated for each CS). The learning criterion consisted of correctly reporting the association between the three CSs and the three outcomes two times in a row. If the learning criterion was achieved, the participant moved on to the following phase; otherwise, the task was aborted after 4 wrong answers (i.e., from a minimum of 2 blocks to a maximum of 8).</p><p>Before this phase, a liking Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 9 (very much) was presented on the display to ensure comparable motivational value of the outcomes previously chosen by the participant, with two questions for each food snack: "How much do you usually enjoy eating it?" (i.e., general liking) and "How much would you like to eat it now?" (i.e., current wanting). Before and after this phase, the same liking 9-point Likert scale was presented for each of the three CSs, with the question "How much do you like this stimulus?" to ensure (a) that the CSs had comparable at the beginning of the experiment, and (b) that the acquisition of Pavlovian learning was effective at the end of the phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrumental learning phase</head><p>In the Instrumental learning phase, participants learned the association between two responses (R1 or R2) and two corresponding rewarding outcomes (O1 and O2). Crucially, the task was structured such that participant had to learn an optimal decision-making strategy, i.e. the strategy that allowed maximizing the amount of reward earned.</p><p>On each trial <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1b)</ref>, an empty slot-machine was presented in the centre of the display (ITI, 500-1500 ms). Then, two levers appeared respectively on the left and right side of the slot-machine, until participant's response. The responses consisted of choosing one of the two levers presented on the display, that could be selected through two computer keys (i.e., "z" for the left and "m" for the right lever of the slot-machine). To avoid distraction and provide time pressure, participants were told to choose quickly after the appearance of the levers (which served as a "go" signal), otherwise, no outcome would appear, and the trial was terminated. If participants chose within 2000 ms, the selected lever lowered and the image of the corresponding outcome appeared in the lower display (1000 ms). For each response (R1 and R2, left or right buttons counterbalanced between participants), the rewarding outcomes were the same O1 and O2 rewards used in the Pavlovian learning phase, respectively. In the non-reinforced trials, a non-rewarding outcome ("X") was presented. Crucially, an imbalance in the probability of obtaining the two outcomes was introduced: choosing R1 (rich option) allowed to obtain O1 with a 70% probability, whereas choosing R2 (poor option) allowed to obtain O2 with a 30% probability. Moreover, a "baiting rule" was inserted <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bari &amp; Gershman, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rudebeck et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Sugrue et al., 2004)</ref>, such that the longer an agent abstained from choosing a particular option, the greater the probability of receiving a reward for that option. In other words, if an unchosen option would have been rewarded in that trial, the next time that option was selected the reward probability was 100%. Under these circumstances, the probabilistic strategy (or, optimal decision-making strategy) that allowed to maximize rewards consisted of pressing R1 in 70% of trials and R2 in 30% of trials. Moving away from this strategy would constitute suboptimal behaviour.</p><p>A series of blocks composed of 50 trials were structured to be repeated until a learning criterion was achieved. Each block had an average duration of 3 minutes, followed by multiple-choice questions presented on the display to ensure that all response-outcome associations were correctly established (i.e., "What food did you earn by pressing this lever?", repeated for each lever). The learning criterion consisted of correctly reporting the association between the two responses and the two outcomes two times in a row. If the learning criterion was achieved, the participant moved on to the following phase; otherwise, the task was aborted after four wrong answers (i.e., from a minimum of 2 blocks and a maximum of 8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer phase</head><p>The transfer phase enabled to test the influence of the CSs on decision-making. As in the previous phase, on each trial, an empty slot-machine ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1c</ref>) was presented (ITI 500-1500 ms), and the appearance of the two levers served as "go-signal" to choose quickly (within 2000 ms). Simultaneously with the appearance of the levers, one of the three CSs previously shown during the Pavlovian learning phase could be presented in the upper display of the slot machine.</p><p>After each choice, the corresponding outcome appeared on the lower display of the slot machine. Importantly, the probability of obtaining rewards was exactly the same as the instrumental learning phase (i.e., 70% by choosing R1, 30% by choosing R2, with the insertion of the same baiting rule), and the CSs were irrelevant for the task. Hence, the optimal decision-making strategy still consisted of pressing R1 in the 70% of trials and R2 in the 30% of trials, independently of the CSs. The transfer phase consisted of a single block composed of 30 trials for each CSs and 30 trials for the "No cue" condition (i.e., no CSs appear simultaneously with levers, equal to the instrumental learning phase), for a total of 120 trials. Participants underwent a series of trials where, following a 5000 ms intertrial interval (ITI), one of three conditioned stimuli (CSs) was displayed in the upper display of the slot-machine. Subsequently, the associated outcomes were presented in the lower display. Of the three CSs, two were linked to distinct rewarding outcomes (O1 and O2), while the third control CS (CS-) was paired with a non-rewarding outcome ("X"). Participants had to learn the CS-outcome associations. (b) Instrumental learning phase. Following an intertrial interval (ITI) ranging from 500 to 1500 ms, two levers appeared on either side of the slot-machine (R1 and R2), and participants had the opportunity to obtain two outcomes (O1 and O2) by pressing respectively R1 or R2. R1 led to O1 with a 70% chance, while R2 led to O2 with a 30% chance. The optimal decisionmaking strategy consisted in pressing more R1 than R2, because of the insertion of a "baiting rule", such that the longer the participant abstained from choosing a particular option, the greater the probability of receiving a reward for that option. (c) Transfer phase. Following an intertrial interval (ITI) of 500-1500 ms, one of the three conditioned stimuli (CSs) was presented alongside two levers on the left and right sides of the slot machine. Participants could collect two different outcomes (O1 and O2) by pressing these levers (R1 and R2). The outcomes remained visible for 1000 ms. The probability of obtaining the two outcomes remained the same as the instrumental learning phase (R1 = 70%; R2 = 30%, with the baiting rule), independently of the cue presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants were instructed to refrain from eating for 3 hours prior to the experiment. Upon arriving at the laboratory, they signed the informed consent form. Subsequently, two rewarding outcomes were tailored for each participant evaluating their subjective liking for 9 different foods (4 savory foods and 5 sweet foods) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Two foods equally valued were then selected as rewards and the same images were used as outcomes in the experiment. Participants were also asked to rate the current level of hunger from 0 (not at all) to 9 (very much), to ensure a high hunger state (30 Sign-trackers: M = 5.5, SD = 1.9; 30 Goal-trackers: M = 6.6, SD = 1.6). Following this, participants were comfortably seated in a quiet room, positioned centrally in front of a computer screen at 60 cm viewing distance. The foods previously selected were placed on the table to guarantee high motivation throughout the task. Then, the eye-tracker was head-mounted on the participant, ensuring a comfortable position and stability during the task through a forehead-chin support placed on the table.</p><p>Participants were informed that the number of food pictures visualized during the entire task would be proportional to the amount of food that they would receive after the experiment. They were required to pay attention and follow the instructions reported on the screen. Additionally, they were informed that their responses to the questions presented at the end of each block should be verbalized and selected by the experimenter to ensure the stability of the eye-tracker, which could partially obstruct the keyboard from view.</p><p>The entire experimental session lasted approximately 1 hour, the experimenter remained in the room to monitor the participant's performance and check for the correct eye-tracker position throughout the experiment. Furthermore, although the instructions were displayed at the beginning of each phase, the experimenter also provided a brief summary to ensure participants fully understood the task. Before the Pavlovian and instrumental learning phases, four example trials were conducted to further ensure comprehension. At the end of the experiment, participants were provided with at least one of each previously selected reward (i.e., at least two distinct rewards).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye-tracking analysis</head><p>Eye movements and pupil diameter were recorded with a 2D Eye-Tracker device (Chronos Vision GmbH, Berlin, Germany) at a sampling rate of 200 Hz during the Pavlovian learning phase. The system allows measuring horizontal and vertical movements and consists of two remote cameras that trace the outline of the pupil by means of digital image processing (online 2D, 11 bit output range) of the eyes that are illuminated by infrared LEDs (940 nm). The measurement range, both horizontal and vertical, is between −40° and +40°, with a resolution of &lt; 0.05° and a measurement error minor than 0.2°. This device delivers binocular data. Since eyes move together under most circumstances, we selected for each participant the signal from the eye that delivered the best accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carter &amp; Luke, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hooge et al., 2019)</ref>, i.e. the eye with the minor number of missing data (left eye: N = 34; right eye: N = 26). The 5-point calibration of the eye-tracker was performed after the Pavlovian learning phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hooge et al., 2019)</ref>. Before the Pavlovian learning phase, participants were instructed to fixate a central fixation cross when no stimuli were presented on the screen (ITI), in order to guarantee a correct classification in sign-and goal-trackers by avoiding initial shifts of attention towards sign or goal. For the analysis, the raw signal from the Pavlovian learning phase was segmented into epochs of 10 seconds centered around the moment of CS appearance (5 seconds of ITI and 5 seconds of CS presentation). The first second after the presentation of the CS was excluded from each trial to exclude the orienting response and pupil light reflex <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gottlieb, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pietrock et al., 2019)</ref>. Then, the dwell time during the remaining 4 seconds of CS presentation was used for both the pupil dilation analysis and the classification in sign-and goal-trackers. Importantly, during these seconds only the CS (and not the corresponding reward) was presented on the screen. Three Areas of Interest (AoI) were considered (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>): two of them were equivalent to the 5 cm upper and lower displays of the slot-machine, respectively reflecting the location of the CS and the location in which the reward would subsequently appear ; the third AoI corresponded to the background, i.e., the rest of the screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Schad et al., 2020)</ref>. Trials in which participants did not look at the fixation cross during ITI, or at the AoI during CS presentation, were excluded from eye-tracking analysis (number of trials excluded: M = 3.43; SD = 6.04). Dwell time was defined as the amount of time spent within each AoI.</p></div>

Our purpose was to assess only the phasic response of the pupil <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calignano et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mathôt et al., 2018)</ref>.

We hypothesized that this acquisition should be selective for sign-trackers, as previously demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Schad et al., 2020)</ref>. For data preprocessing, we followed a specific pipeline provided by <ref type="bibr">Calignano and colleagues (2024)</ref>, who adopted a multiverse approach to pupillometry data analysis to explore the role of the preprocessing phase. We started our data processing by excluding missing data points (M = 0.07%, SD = 0.17), resulting from blink artifacts and invalid data during recording. In addition, participants with more than 30% missing data from the total registration were excluded from further analysis. In this case, all participants were included in subsequent analysis. Afterward, we selected only the data within the three AoIs described above. Additionally, trials in which data were not recorded for at least 200ms consecutively were discarded (M = 13.3% of total trials, SD = 15.5%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Mathôt, 2018)</ref>. As a further step, the trial-by-trial data were baseline-corrected by taking the median pupil value during the 200ms before the stimulus onset and subtracting this value from the raw data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calignano et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mathôt et al., 2018)</ref>. Finally, extreme data, namely those over 2 standard deviations above and below the mean, were excluded (M = 3,8% of total data). Participants with more than 30% extreme values were excluded. As a result, 2 participants were excluded. Thus, the pupil dilation analysis concerns a sample of 58 participants.</p><p>Gaze index analysis and sign-trackers/goal-trackers categorization Participants were categorized into sign-trackers and goal-trackers based on the time allocated towards the location of the CS and the location of the reward during the CS presentation in the Pavlovian learning phase.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational model</head><p>Data from all three phases of the experiment were collectively fitted to the responses observed in the transfer phase. This approach allowed for the estimation of the most suitable parameters, as well as the incorporation of CS and response values from the preceding two phases, to explain the choices made in the final phase. The Rescorla-Wagner model [Equation 2 and 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wagner &amp; Rescorla, 1972)</ref>] was utilized to compute the associations between CSs, responses, and rewards. Equation 2 was used to compute trial-by-trial prediction error:</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2) = −</formula><p>where PE is the prediction error, Ot is the outcome at trial t and Vt is the CS or response associative value at trial t. If the reward was delivered on the current trial t, O(t) = 1, else O(t) = 0. Equation 3 was used to estimate the CS or response associative value updating:</p><p>(3) +1 = + *</p><p>where Vt+1 represents the updated CS or response associative value and α is a free parameter for learning rate, computed separately for CSs and responses.</p><p>During the Pavlovian learning phase, the value of each CS (V0) started from 0 and was updated separately: CS+1 with O1, CS+2 with O2, and CS-with nothing. The values were computed based on the sequence of rewards received on a trial-by-trial basis during Pavlovian and instrumental learning phases to obtain the most realistic values at the start of the transfer phase. During the instrumental learning phase, the values of responses R1 and R2 were updated similarly, with R1 associated with O1 and R2 associated with O2. In the transfer phase, when a reward was (or was not) obtained, the values of both the response and the CS were updated accordingly. Crucially, in this phase, each CS could be associated with the value of either O1 or O2, based on the response provided. Equation 4 was used to compute the weighted sum of the instrumental and the Pavlovian values in the current trial:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(4) = ( * (1 − )) + ( * )</formula><p>where WR represents the weighted value of the response (computed separately for R1 and R2), VR the value of the response (R1 or R2), VCSc the value of the current CS for the same outcome of the response (O1 for R1 and O2 for R2), and a free parameter which weights CS versus response associative value. The likelihood was calculated through the softmax function [Equation 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Luce, 1959)</ref>] which normalizes stimulus and response values into stochastic choice probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(5) ( ) = exp( * ) exp( * 1 )+exp( * 2 )</formula><p>where p(Rc) represents the probability of choosing the current response (R1 or R2), WRc is the weighted value of the current response (WR1 or WR2), WR1 is the weighted value of R1, WR2 is the weighted value of R2 and β a free parameter standing for the inverse temperature, i.e. the exploitation/exploration balance.</p><p>Different reinforcement learning models were fitted and compared through Akaike and Bayesian information criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Vrieze, 2012)</ref> to identify the model that best explains our data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Correlations between real and simulated data for every free parameter</head><p>This model enabled the estimation of two parameters crucial to test our hypotheses, namely:</p><p>• Pavlovian α -the learning rate for CSs value update • -the weight of the CSs value with respect to the response value In addition, Instrumental α (learning rate for response value update) and (inverse temperature, i.e. the trade-off between exploitation and exploration) were also estimated to optimize the model's fit to the observed data and account for variability in behavioral responses, though they were not directly related to our primary hypotheses. These free parameters were fitted to the trial-by-trial responses of each participant and optimized using maximum posterior estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Gershman, 2016)</ref>. This procedure involved finding the set of parameters that maximized the likelihood of each participant's trial-by-trial responses, given the model, while being constrained by a regularizing prior. We constrained the free parameter using a gamma distribution with shape parameters 1 and 5, setting the bounds between 0 and 50. For the other parameters, we employed a beta distribution with both shape parameters equal to 1.2, constrained to the range of 0 to 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrumental learning phase</head><p>To confirm the acquisition of the optimal decision-making strategy by participants and exclude possible differences between sign-trackers and goal-trackers, we performed a 2×2 mixed-measures Bayesian ANOVA with response (R1/R2) as within-subjects factor and group (sign-trackers/goaltrackers) as between-subjects factor, using the relative percentage R1 and R2 (over the total) as dependent variable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer phase</head><p>To test the difference in maladaptive Pavlovian bias in decision-making between sign-trackers and goal-trackers, we used Bayesian Informative Hypotheses. Our analyses were conducted on the percentage of R1 responses (i.e., the rich option), which was calculated separately and compared across CSs. Pavlovian bias is shown if the percentage of R1 is (a) increased in the presence of the CS+1 and (b) reduced in the presence of the CS+2, compared to the two control conditions (CS-and No cue). Specifically, we formulated four hypotheses to be directly compared. Results showed that H1 presents the highest relative posterior model probability indicating H1 as the strongest hypothesis, both when excluding and including the complement hypothesis Hc <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5a</ref>; <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Coherently, H1 also presented the highest Bayes Factor computed relative to H2 (BF12 = 40.37), H3 (BF13 = 3.37), and H4 (BF14 = 10.48). Visual inspection of the data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5b</ref>) confirms that, in the CS+1 and control (CS-and No cue) conditions, both groups maintain the optimal decisionmaking strategy, consisting of choosing more R1 than R2. Crucially, the main differences between the two groups emerge in the presence of the CS+2: while goal-trackers maintain on average the optimal decision-making (R1 &gt; R2), sign-trackers show the maladaptive bias, which is observable through an increased percentage of R2 compared to how expected (i.e., the control conditions). The trial-by-trial plot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5c</ref>) shows that at the beginning of the transfer phase, both groups are affected by CS+2 (increased percentage of R2). Subsequently, while goal-trackers rapidly adapt their choice returning to the optimal decision-making strategy, sign-trackers are not able to overcome such Pavlovian bias (confidence intervals in figure 5b and 5c between R1 and R2 are overlapped).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(H1, H2, H3, H4)</ref>, together with the complement hypothesis (Hc). (b) is the graphical representation of the data. Specifically, they show the percentage of R1 (red) and R2 (blue) in the four conditions. White dots represent group means, and coloured vertical bars represent their 95% confidence intervals. Overall, results show the presence of Pavlovian bias only in sign-trackers (higher posterior model probability for H1, and reduced percentage of R1 selectively in the CS+2 condition). The trial-by-trial plot (c) represents the percentage of R1 (continuous red line) and R2 (continuous blue line) throughout the task for each CS. The shaded regions reflect the 95% confidence interval across subjects for each response. Dashed lines represent the expected matching for R1 (red, 70%) and R2 (blue, 30%). Data are smoothed using a 5-trial moving average. On the right side of the figure the overall percentage of R1 and R2 is showed: red (R1) and blue (R2) dots represent group means and their vertical bars represent their 95% confidence intervals. Overall, results show that the difference between sign-trackers and goal-trackers emerges only in the CS+2 condition, particularly as time progresses.</p><p>Computational model Bayesian Informative Hypotheses were used to test whether the observed difference in Pavlovian bias between sign-trackers and goal-trackers arises from differences in CS associative value updating (Pavlovian α), the weight of the CSs value with respect to the response value ( ), or both. Three hypotheses were thus formulated.</p><p>The first hypothesis posited that sign-trackers exhibit a lower Pavlovian α compared to goaltrackers, while the two groups would not differ on , indicating that the effect is driven by a slower CS associative value updating in sign-trackers:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H1: [Pavlovian α]sign-trackers &lt; [Pavlovian α]goal-trackers &amp; [ ]sign-trackers = [ ]goal-trackers</formula><p>The second hypothesis posited no differences in Pavlovian α between groups, but higher in signtrackers compared to goal-trackers, indicating that the effect is driven by an increased weight of the CS associative value on instrumental values in sign-trackers: H1 emerged as the strongest hypothesis, demonstrating the highest relative posterior model probability, even when accounting for Hc <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 6a</ref>, <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Additionally, H1 showed the highest Bayes Factor when compared to H2 (BF12 = 7.54) and H3 (BF13 = 4.96). This pattern is also evident in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6b</ref>, which displays the Pavlovian α and values for sign-and goal-trackers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6c</ref> further illustrates that in the sign-tracker group, the estimated value of CS+2 for O1 never exceeds that of CS+2 for O2 throughout the transfer phase. In contrast, in the goal-tracker group, the value of CS+2 for O1 exceeds that of CS+2 for O2 after only a few trials.</p><p>There were no a priori hypotheses regarding the free parameters and instrumental α. However, as an exploratory analysis, we tested whether these parameters could distinguish between signand goal-trackers. The results indicated no differences between the two groups for either parameter ( : BF10 = 0.262; W = 435 | instrumental α: BF10 = 0.450; err% = 0.010). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regressions between psychophysiological and computational results</head><p>To test if the incentive value attribution during Pavlovian learning could predict the computational parameters Pavlovian α and , two separate simple linear regressions were conducted using an incentive value index as independent variable, and Pavlovian α <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 7a</ref>) and γ <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 7b</ref>) as dependent variables, respectively. The incentive value index was computed as the difference between the average pupil dilation to CSs+ (CS+1 and CS+2) and CS-. Results showed evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis for Pavlovian α (BF10 = 5.131; R 2 = 0.116), while γ showed evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (BF10 = 0.739; err% = 0.042). In other words, greater differential pupil dilation was associated with lower Pavlovian α. Overall, these results demonstrate that the stronger is the incentive value attributed to the cue during Pavlovian learning the lower is the ability to update its reward value. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Two distinct profiles have been identified in Pavlovian learning: sign-trackers and goal-trackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Colaizzi et al., 2020)</ref>. The aim of this study was to examine whether, and how, these learning profiles differ in terms of maladaptive Pavlovian bias in decision-making . Our experimental design involved a Pavlovian learning phase where participants learned associations between two cues (CS+1 and CS+2) and two corresponding outcomes (O1 and O2). In a subsequent phase, participants developed an optimal decision-making strategy, which required favoring one option (R1 -"rich" option) over another (R2 -"poor" option) to maximize rewards. These options were linked to outcomes O1 and O2, respectively. Finally, during the transfer phase, these Pavlovian cues were reintroduced-though irrelevant to the task-to test whether and how they would bias participants' choices toward the previously learned outcomes (i.e., CS+1 → R1; CS+2 → R2).</p><p>Coherently with what expected, our findings revealed that sign-trackers exhibit a greater maladaptive Pavlovian bias over decision-making than goal-trackers. More specifically, during transfer, when the reward cue associated with the poor option (CS+2) appeared, only sign-trackers deviated from the optimal strategy, shifting their decisions toward R2. By contrast, goal-trackers sustained the optimal decision-making strategy under all conditions, indicating their recognition of the irrelevance of the cues to reward obtainment during the transfer phase.</p><p>Importantly, both groups successfully learned the optimal decision-making strategy during the instrumental learning phase and maintained this strategy during the transfer phase, regardless of whether the reward cue associated with the rich option (CS+1), the non-predictive cue (CS-), or no cue (No Cue) was presented. This suggests that the bias observed during the presentation of the reward cue associated with the poor option (CS+2) cannot be attributed to a failure in learning or retrieving the optimal decision-making strategy. Moreover, both groups also demonstrated comparable explicit (accurate reporting of CS-outcome associations) and implicit (increased liking for CSs+) Pavlovian learning.</p><p>In line with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Schad et al., 2020)</ref>, we found a group difference in the psychophysiological activation during Pavlovian learning, with only sign-trackers displaying greater pupil dilation in response to CSs+ compared to CS-. Pupil dilation is a reliable indicator of the incentive salience attributed to Pavlovian cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Finke et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pietrock et al., 2019)</ref>. These findings support the interpretation that sign-trackers attribute higher incentive value to the conditioned stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Felix &amp; Flagel, 2024;</ref>, thereby validating our classification of participants as either sign-or goal-trackers.</p><p>This selective acquisition of heightened incentive value in sign-trackers may be pivotal to their increased maladaptive Pavlovian bias. In this population, cues can function as "motivational magnets" that capture attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Le Pelley et al., 2016)</ref> and interfere with the optimal decisionmaking strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Watson et al., 2014)</ref>. This occurs by activating the instrumental action previously associated with the same outcome <ref type="bibr">(Finotti et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Garofalo et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, an even more compelling pattern emerges when examining responses over time <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5c</ref>). At the start of the transfer phase (~ 5-8 initial trials), both groups tend to favor the poor option (R2) when the corresponding outcome-predictive cue (CS+2) is presented. This suggests that both groups exploit the cue, as it provides the only novel source of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dorfman &amp; Gershman, 2019)</ref> relative to the previous instrumental learning phase. They likely assume that following the cue will enhance their chances of obtaining the associated reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cartoni et al., 2013)</ref>. However, a difference gradually becomes apparent. As the task progresses, participants can observe the outcome of their choices (reward obtained or not), which should signal the interference and negative significance of the cues for the optimal performance of the task. This feedback encourages a return to the previously learned optimal decision-making strategy. Critically, while goal-trackers promptly adapt and revert to this strategy, sign-trackers persist in their maladaptive Pavlovian bias, showing a much slower adjustment. Notably, this delayed adaptation is specific to the CS+2 condition and is not observed in the other conditions (CS+1, <ref type="bibr">CS-, or No Cue)</ref>.</p><p>In line with these behavioral findings, our computational model provides deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying the observed Pavlovian bias. Specifically, it reveals that the primary difference between sign-trackers and goal-trackers lies in the rate of cue value updating (Pavlovian α), rather than the weight assigned to the conditioned stimulus relative to the instrumental response (γ). To recognize the irrelevance of the cues and return to optimal decision-making, participants must update the value of the cue by gradually reducing it based on current reward contingencies. Our findings indicate that sign-trackers exhibit a lower Pavlovian α, reflecting a slower rate of cue value updating compared to goal-trackers. Consequently, sign-trackers continue to rely on outdated cue values, which leads to persistent maladaptive choices, even when the cues become irrelevantor counterproductive -for obtaining the reward.</p><p>Remarkably, our regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between pupil dilation to conditioned stimuli and Pavlovian α, indicating that higher incentive value is associated with slower cue value updating. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how inflated incentive value underlies suboptimal decision-making in sign-trackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Flagel et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schad et al., 2020)</ref> Specifically, heightened incentive value appears to hinder the ability to revise cue values, even when new information indicates that contingencies have changed and previously learned associations no longer apply.</p><p>Notably, the persistent nature of sign-trackers' maladaptive Pavlovian bias over time aligns with their documented resistance to extinction compared to goal-trackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahrens et al., 2016)</ref>. This persistence suggests a rigid, reward-independent behavioral pattern, bearing a striking resemblance to addictive disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Redish, 2004)</ref>. Indeed, in animal models, sign-tracking behavior has been linked to greater vulnerability to addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Flagel et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Tomie &amp; Morrow, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Future studies could extend these findings to humans by investigating the sign-tracker/goal-tracker distinction in individuals with addiction, or by adapting our task to include drug-related cues (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Garbusow et al., 2014)</ref>. Such approaches could determine whether similar behavioral patterns and mechanisms are observed in addiction-related contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, while interindividual differences in Pavlovian processes and their links to pathological conditions (e.g., addiction) remain under investigation, our study provides convergent evidence from eye-tracking, pupillometry, behavioral and computational measures that maladaptive Pavlovian bias in decision-making is more prominent among sign-trackers than goal-trackers. Furthermore, our computational modeling reveals that this bias stems from slower cue value updating in sign-trackers.</p><p>These findings deepen our understanding of addiction vulnerability and underscore the critical role of Pavlovian learning mechanisms in shaping decision-making. Future research should explore unresolved questions, particularly the interplay between incentive salience and cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balleine, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ostlund &amp; Marshall, 2021)</ref> in sustaining maladaptive behavior across diverse contexts. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Illustration of the Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer task.
