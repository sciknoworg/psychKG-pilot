			<abstract>
				<p>Risk permeates decision making because choice outcomes are often uncertain. When basing decisions on prior experience, early research suggested that the prospects of gain and loss differentially lead people to underweight low and overweight high probabilities. However, more recent studies have suggested that learning the odds through experiences may lead to general overweighting of all probabilities. These experience-based effects have been explained in terms of an &quot;extreme-outcome rule&quot; (EOR), which posits that valuations of uncertain options are biased towards the best/worst possible outcome. However, prior studies of the EOR only examined probability weighting at the 50% uncertainty level and it was unclear whether extreme-outcomes lead to generalized overweighting of low and high probabilities. Across three pre-registered experiments, we observed that individuals particularly overweighted low probabilities and generally underweighted high probabilities in experience-based decision-making. These results are more consistent with probability weightings predicted by prospect theory than with early sampling-based studies of decisions from experience. Across experiments, we examined whether uncertainty preferences were influenced by outcome extremity and the relative certainty associated with the safe, reference options. These factors modulated the probability weighting curve in different ways: extreme outcomes shifted the probability weighting curve up/down whereas information format sharpened the curve, leading to exaggerations in probability under/overweighting. We conclude that additional learning-related factors, beyond the scope of traditional prospect theory, contribute to the formation of subjective estimations of probability and, more generally, value.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We are constantly faced with choices that involve varying degrees of uncertainty.</p><p>Whether it's selecting a career path, making investment decisions, or choosing between potential outcomes, individuals must grapple with uncertainty and evaluate the likelihood of different outcomes. A key factor thought to shape decision-making under uncertainty is the process of probability weighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>, which describes how individuals perceive and evaluate the risks associated with choice options with uncertain outcomes. For example, probability overweighting describes people behaving as if a given risky option is more likely to pay off than it objectively is; probability underweighting describes people behaving as if a risky option is less likely to pay off than it objectively is.</p><p>In a series of seminal experiments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kahneman and Tversky (1979)</ref> presented people with written hypothetical choice problems in terms of pairs of options that explicitly described the probability and amounts of money at stake. For example, one problem (A) offered the following choice options: 80% chance of winning 4,000 $ vs. guaranteed (100%) 3,000 $, and another (B) these options: 20% chance of winning 4,000 $ vs. 25% chance of winning 3,000 $. <ref type="bibr">Kahneman</ref> and Tversky found that people were more likely to select a risky option when the probabilities were low (e.g., Problem B) and, conversely, were less likely to select a risky option when probabilities were high (Problem A). This well-replicated finding <ref type="bibr">(Ruggeri et al., 2020)</ref> suggests that people overweight low probabilities and underweight high probabilities.</p><p>Kahneman and Tversky also found that people treat the prospect of loss as more consequential than the prospect of gain -a phenomenon termed "loss aversion". Together, the ideas of probability weighting and loss aversion form two of the cornerstones of prospect theory -a detailed descriptive framework for estimating such biases in choice behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992</ref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a very different choice pattern emerges when people make decisions based on prior experience as compared to from descriptions of hypothetical choice problems (as in <ref type="bibr">Kahneman and Tversky's work)</ref>. In an early study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hertwig et al. (2004)</ref> compared choice patterns of people who learned the odds associated with choice options through verbal (written) description or by repeatedly sampling the options before making a single consequential choice. This sampling paradigm allowed people to experience the odds associated with an option before choosing it. In contrast to the predictions of prospect theory, Hertwig et al.'s participants underweighted low probabilities and overweighted high probabilities. For example, when faced with the prospect of gain, <ref type="bibr">Hertwig et al.'s participants</ref> were less likely to choose a low-probability risky option and were more likely to choose a high-probability uncertain option (as compared to equivaluable "sure bets"). The reversed pattern was found when participants faced the prospect of loss. These results were surprising because they were exactly the opposite of what classic prospect theory would have predicted.</p><p>Today, the distinction between description/experience-based choice patterns is known as the description-experience (DE) gap.</p><p>The reasons for the DE gap remain unclear (see reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hau et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Garcia et al., 2021)</ref>. One possibility lies in the distinction between risk and uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Camilleri &amp; Newell, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Knight, 1921)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Knight (1921)</ref> defined "risk" to pertain to choices where all probability information is known, whereas "uncertainty" is associated with choices where probabilities are not entirely known. Knight's taxonomy suggests that description-based decisions primarily involve risk, whereas experience-based choices additionally involve uncertainty. Uncertainty connotes the processes of learning and inference, whereby uncertainty about a choice option is reduced through repeated experience. The cognitive processes influencing probability weighting in experience-based choice may differ from those influencing description-based choice because, unlike reading written descriptions, they involve dynamically estimating the odds through experience. Indeed, factors distinctly related to learning are known to critically modulate experience-based choices involving uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Elston et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garcia et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ludvig et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Niv et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>One such learning-related factor is sampling error. Sampling error arises due to participants not sampling the entire outcome distribution of an option prior to choosing. For example, if an option has a 10% chance of paying $100, it is possible that even after many samples, the participant never experiences the rare outcome ($100). Indeed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hertwig et al. (2004)</ref> reported that 78% of their participants made decisions without ever sampling the rare outcome. When <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Camilleri and Newell (2011)</ref> forced their participants to sample each option 100 times before choosing, their participants did not show any clear distortions in probability weighting. In other words, their participants were equally likely to select an uncertain option of any probability as an equivaluable safe one. This suggests that undersampling could lead to an incorrect interpretation that participants underweighted low probabilities because the participant never experienced a rare non-zero outcome and therefore cannot know that the option is in fact uncertain. Given their experience, participants would have learned that such an option has zero probability of reward, which is not the same as probability underweighting.</p><p>However, other studies have found that additional sampling experience attenuates rather than abolishes probability distortion and that people underweight low probabilities inferred through experience even when sampling error is controlled for <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aydogan &amp; Gao, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barron &amp; Ursino, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fox &amp; Hadar, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hau et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ungemach et al., 2009)</ref>. Nevertheless, it is crucial to consider the influence of sampling error when interpreting studies of experience-based choice.</p><p>The consequentialness of choices is another critical, learning-related factor in experience-based choice. Choices are rendered consequential through feedback such that each decision yields a concrete gain or loss. In partial-feedback paradigms, participants select an option and are then shown the outcome of their decision; each outcome has direct consequences for accumulating money or some other reward. In full-feedback paradigms, participants are shown the outcome of both the chosen and unchosen option. Such feedback paradigms typically involve hundreds of choices, ensuring that participants adequately sample each option's outcome distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barron &amp; Erev, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jessup et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garcia et al. (2023)</ref> recently reported that participants who learned probabilities through trial-and-error neglected those odds (regardless of probability) when probed in blocks of trials without reward feedback. Interestingly, even in fully descriptive choice situations, the inclusion of consequential outcomes appears to substantially attenuate distortions in probability weighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jessup et al., 2008)</ref>. This suggests that experience-based choice is critically modulated by encountering the type of ongoing feedback that led to the initial formation and refinement of learned outcome estimates.</p><p>Other studies of probability weighting in partial-feedback paradigms have yielded conflicting results. For example, Camilleri and Newell (2011) directly compared choice behavior in the sampling and partial-feedback paradigms and sought to equate the circumstances: in the sampling paradigm, they forced participants to sample options 100 times before allowing them to make a choice. In their partial-feedback condition, their participants decided between the same two choice options 100 times (thereby ensuring that only the feedback component distinguished the conditions). The authors found that the partial-feedback condition elicited choice behavior consistent with <ref type="bibr">Hertwig et al.'s (2004)</ref> early accounts of the DE gap: in the gain domain, participants were more likely to select a high probability uncertain option over an equivaluable sure bet (e.g. 90% chance of +10 vs 100% chance of +9) and were less likely to select a low probability uncertain option over an equivaluable sure bet (e.g. 15% chance of +14 vs 100% chance of +2). The opposite pattern was observed in the loss domain. In other words,</p><p>Camilleri and Newell found that people underweight low probabilities and overweight high ones even in the presence of feedback (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Erev et al., 2010)</ref>. However, as reviewed next, a number of studies where participants did not repeatedly face the same two options 100 times in a row have yielded very different results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ludvig and Spetch (2011)</ref> had participants make decisions between probabilistic description/experience-based options and safe options in a partial-feedback paradigm. The experience options were colored doors and the description options were partially filled pie charts where filledness described the payoff odds. The critical condition involved equivaluable choices between description/experience options with 50% chance of paying/losing 40 points (or nothing) versus a fixed gain/loss of 20 points. The authors found that participants preferred uncertain experience-based options (colored doors) when faced with the prospect of gain and preferred risky description-based options when faced with the prospect of loss. This result suggests that people overweight the odds associated with experience-based options -thus preferring them with the prospect of gain and avoiding them with the prospect of loss. This result was unanticipated by prospect theory and early accounts of the DE gap because the uncertainty level was 50%, meaning that there were no rare or common events to under-or overweight. It was unclear whether low/high probabilities inferred through consequential experience were generally overweighted as compared to equiprobable description-based options. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Elston et al. (2021)</ref> recently generalized this notion in an experiment where the critical condition involved decisions between equiprobable description and experience options across several probabilities (20%, 50%, 80%). Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ludvig and Spetch (2011)</ref>, Elston et al.'s description options were partially-filled bars where e.g. 20% filledness indicated a 20% payoff likelihood; the experience options were randomly-selected sets of emojis. The outcome amounts and payoff distributions were identical, and there were no "safe/reference" options, meaning that information type was the only mitigating factor in choice patterns. Early accounts of the DE gap and prospect theory would have predicted that participants faced with the prospect of gain would have strongly preferred the description-options at low probabilities and preferred the experience-options at high probabilities (and vice-versa when faced with the prospect of loss). Instead, Elston et al.'s participants preferred experience-based options across all probabilities in the gain domain and, conversely, preferred description-based options across all probabilities in the loss domain. This suggests that experience-based options are generally overweighted when all other factors are held constant and that a broader set of cognitive processes than those framed by prospect theory are at play in experience-based choice. As first suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Knight (1921)</ref>, differences in how people learn the values of options may also contribute to the probability distortions observed in experience-based choice.</p><p>Extreme outcomes are another learning-related factor shown to play an outsized role in how people learn the values of uncertain options <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Konstantinidis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ludvig et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ludvig et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Madan et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Madan et al., , 2017</ref>. These studies used partial-feedback paradigms where the critical condition involved decisions between equivaluable safe and uncertain options (e.g., 100% chance of 20 points vs. 50/50 chance of 20 points or nothing) and found that participants were more likely to choose the uncertain option in the gain domain relative to the loss domain (where they preferred the certain, intermediate loss over the risk of losing a larger amount).</p><p>Interestingly, this difference in uncertainty-preference for the gain/loss domains increased as the stakes of the gamble increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Konstantinidis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ludvig et al., 2014)</ref> -as the expected values of the payoffs became more extreme, participants increasingly preferred the uncertain option in the gain domain relative to the loss domain. These studies suggest that participants bias their inferences about an option's value towards the best/worst outcome it could yield. However, these prior studies of the "extreme-outcome rule" (EOR) have only examined risk preference at the 50% level and it remains unclear how extreme outcomes influence probability weightings and uncertainty preferences at low and high probabilities in the gain and loss domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Experiment</head><p>The overall goal of our experiments was to assess how extreme outcomes influence uncertainty preferences in the gain and loss domains across a wider range of probabilities than previously investigated. To our knowledge, no study has systematically examined how extreme outcomes influence probability weighting at low and high probabilities when making consequential, experience-based choices. This is critical because the key difference between description and experience-based choices has traditionally been reported at low and high probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hertwig et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kellen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wulff et al., 2018)</ref>. To address this question, we conducted three experiments where the critical condition involved decisions between equivaluable safe and uncertain options across three probabilities (20%, 50%, 80%) with the goals of either maximizing gains or minimizing losses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competing predictions</head><p>A simple generalization of the "extreme outcome rule" predicts that participants will generally prefer the more uncertain options across all probabilities in the gain domain and, conversely, avoid them in the loss domain. In contrast, the sampling-based studies reviewed above predict that participants will underweight low probability uncertain options (and thus avoid/seek them in the gain/loss domain) and will overweight high probability uncertain options (and thus seek/avoid them in the gain/loss domain). A third possible result, predicted by classic prospect theory, is that participants will overweight low probabilities (and thus seek/avoid them in the gain/loss domains) and underweight high probabilities (and thus avoid/seek them in the gain/loss domains). These predictions, in the context of our experimental design, are graphically represented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task design and key controls</head><p>To delineate between these competing predictions, we used a partial-feedback paradigm where participants made choices between safe and uncertain options in separate periods of gain and loss domain trials (480 trials per domain; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref>). To guard against the potential confounds of sampling error, each domain began with two training mini-blocks (96 trials/block) where participants learned the values of the safe and uncertain options; these training blocks preceded three experimental blocks (96 trials/block) where participants choose between all possible combinations of choice options. We confirmed that participants experienced the full outcome distributions of uncertain options within the training blocks (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref>).</p><p>The critical condition of the post-training experimental blocks involved decisions between equivaluable safe and uncertain options -options that had the same expected value (probability x amount; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2C</ref>). We used three uncertainty levels (20%, 50%, and 80%) and, to isolate the effect of probability weighting, all uncertain options within a given experiment paid/lost the same number of points (e.g., 40 points; example equivaluable trial: 20% of +40 vs 100% of +8). The uncertain option always had a more extreme outcome than the safe option and the only difference in preferences across the probabilities could be due to how the probabilities themselves were weighted. This allowed us to directly measure participant probability weightings through choice patterns without the need for an intervening model. Our key analysis related participant likelihoods of choosing the uncertain option as a function of uncertainty level (20%, 50%, 80%) and domain (gain, loss) during the equivaluable choices. To examine how the degree of outcome extremity influenced probability weighting, we changed the expected value of all choice options across experiments: in Experiments 1 and 3, we used a set of higher expected values; in Experiment 2, we used a lower set of expected values.</p></div>

The exact number of participants in each Experiment are described in the Results sub-section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online behavioral testing environment and stimuli</head><p>Experiments were conducted online using the JavaScript library jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015). A centrally positioned "+" on a light gray background served as a fixation point. The "uncertain" options were represented as 6 emojis (3 unique options for each domain -gain and loss) that were randomly selected from a pool of 34 emojis. All candidate emojis were simple in color and form and did not contain faces or face-adjacent information <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Elston et al., 2021)</ref>. The probabilities of 20%, 50%, and 80% were randomly assigned to the emojis for each subject.</p><p>Across experiments, we changed the format of the safe, reference options. In Experiments 1 and 2, we used partially filled bar-stimuli where the fill-percentage was related to the sure-bet number of points gained or lost (depending on the gain/loss context). Each of the three safe options had the same long-run expected values as an equivaluable (probability x amount) uncertain option. We used two different fill-colors to differentiate across contexts: green-fill was used to denote gains, whereas red-fill was used to denote losses. In Experiment 3, the safe options were randomly selected emojis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Session organization and trial types</head><p>Each participant was tested in 10 blocks of 96 trials (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B)</ref>. Half of the participants experienced the gain context in the first 5 blocks (and the loss context in the remaining blocks). The remaining half experienced the reverse order. Within a context, the first two blocks were training blocks consisting entirely of either "safe" or "uncertain" options. The purpose of these training blocks was to ensure that participants adequately sampled the appropriate outcome distribution for each stimulus and learned the stimulus values. Before starting the first training block of the gain context, participants were told to select the best option to gain as many points as possible. Before starting the loss context, participants were told to retain as many points as possible (i.e., to mitigate their losses). Participants were also told that the top 10% of participants finishing with the most points at the end of the session would win a 10 € voucher. The order of risky and uncertain training blocks was counterbalanced across contexts and subjects. A self-paced pause was introduced between each block. To ensure participants did not accrue negative points throughout the experiment, all participants were given 20000 points prior to the start of the first block of the first context.</p><p>After the two training blocks, participants were tested in three experimental blocks where they were presented with decisions between (i) two uncertain options with different payoff probabilities ("Pure U"), (ii) two "safe" options with different payoff amounts ("Pure S"), (iii) both a safe and uncertain option where one of the options had a higher expected value ("≠SvsU"), and (iv) equivaluable "safe" and "uncertain" options with equal expected values ("=SvsU"; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure and events of individual trials</head><p>As schematized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>, trials began with the presentation of a central "+" for 500 ms. Participants were then presented with two different stimuli of either the same or different type (either "safe" or "uncertain" stimuli) on the left/right side of the computer screen.</p><p>Participants responded with their left and right index fingers by pressing the "Q" (left) and "P" (right) keys on QWERTZ keyboards. The stimuli remained on the screen until participants responded; there was no response deadline on choice reaction times. After each trial, participants received feedback about the points their choice accumulated.</p><p>In the training blocks, participants made choices exclusively between either safe or uncertain options. In the main experimental blocks, four equally-occurring trial types were presented: (i) "pure safe (Pure S)" trials where participants decided between two "safe" options (identical to training blocks); (ii) "pure uncertain (Pure U)" trials where participants decided between two "uncertain" options (identical to training blocks); (iii) "unequal safe versus uncertain (≠SvsU)" trials were participants decided between both "safe" and "uncertain" options but one was objectively better; (iv) "equal safe versus uncertain (=SvsU)" trials where participants choose between a "safe" and "uncertain" option with identical expected values. All stimulus combinations were equally counterbalanced in terms of frequency and spatial location (that is, all stimuli were presented an equal number of times on the left and right sides of the computer screen).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusion criterion and data preparation</head><p>As pre-registered, we excluded subjects that performed worse than 60% across trials where decisions were between the same type (safe vs. safe, risky vs. risky) across both the training and experimental blocks. We report the exact number of excluded subjects in the Results sub-heading of each experiment. Furthermore, as per our pre-registrations, we excluded individual trials with outlier choice reaction times (RTs). Based on our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Elston et al., 2021)</ref> and manual inspection of the data, we defined outlier RTs as those less than 200 ms and greater than 1500 ms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1 -High Expected Values and Descriptive Safe Options</head><p>In our first experiment, our primary question was whether participants' preference for uncertain gain versus loss options was independent of the probability of the outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ludvig et al. (2014)</ref> found that participants were more likely to overweight the odds associated with uncertain options when the expected values of all choice options were relatively higher and every trial led to a concrete gain or loss (no "zero"/nothing outcomes). Our first experiment capitalized on these prior results in order to examine whether such probability overweighting occurred at low and high probabilities. In addition to using higher expected values and no "nothing" outcomes, we also used descriptive bar-stimuli as the safe options in order to heighten the contrast between the safe, "sure bet" and uncertain options. The exact payoff scheme and stimuli used in Experiment 1 are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Results -choice patterns during equivaluable (=SvsU) trials</head><p>Our experiment's critical condition involved decisions between equivaluable safe and uncertain options -options that had the same expected value (probability x amount). We used three uncertainty levels (20%, 50%, and 80%) and, to isolate the effect of probability weighting, all uncertain options paid/lost the same number of points, depending on whether a trial was in the gain or loss domain. The uncertain option always had a more extreme outcome than the safe option and the only difference in preferences across the probabilities could be due to how the probabilities themselves were weighted. This allowed us to directly measure participant probability weightings through how often the uncertain option was selected versus an equivaluable safe option.</p><p>To that end, we conducted repeated measures analyses of variance (rmANOVAs) with the within-subject factors of probability and domain. The rmANOVA revealed significant main effects of probability (F(2, 88) = 7.28, p = .001, η p 2 = .14) and context (F(1, 44) = 47.24, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = .52) as well as their interaction (F(2, 88) = 11.28, p &lt; .001,η p 2 = .20). To better understand the nature of this interaction effect, we first computed the difference between see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3D</ref>), indicating that participants especially preferred the uncertain option in the gain domain (and, by converse, avoided the uncertain option in the loss domain) at the lowest probabilities and tended towards neutrality at the middle and high probabilities. These results suggest that low probabilities were especially overweighted and thus preferred when in the gain domain and avoided in the loss domain. Contextual differences in uncertainty preferences grouped by probability. The y-axis is the Gain -Loss context difference in p(Choose Uncertain) and the x-axis is the uncertainty level in the =SvsU trials. These are simply the differences between the red and blue curves in panels A-C at each uncertainty level. Markers denote mean ± SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2 -Low Expected Values and Descriptive Safe Options</head><p>In Experiment 1, participants strongly overweighted low probabilities, preferring/avoiding uncertain options in the gain/loss domains. However, the size of this effect, although still present, diminished at intermediate and high probabilities. Ludvig et al. <ref type="formula">(2014) previously</ref>showed such an effect at the 50% probability level and found that the size of the across-domain differences appeared to depend on the payoff scheme. Specifically, they found that a non-zero payoff scheme, as used in Experiment 1, potentiated the probability weighting.</p><p>Next, we pre-registered and conducted Experiment 2 to examine whether using a payoff scheme with lower expected values and outcomes that included "0" would diminish probability overweighting (as Ludvig et al. had observed) and whether such an effect would be uniform across low, intermediate, and high probabilities. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> for complete details of the payoff scheme. To make Experiment 2 directly comparable to Experiment 1, we continued to use descriptive bar stimuli as the safe options. were excluded according to our pre-registered inclusion criterion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Validation -assessing sampling error and task performance</head><p>As in Experiment 1, participants in Experiment 2 adequately sampled the uncertain options during the training blocks (all p &gt; .05 when t-testing experienced probability against objective probability for a given option; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref>, middle) selected the best option across all conditions when a best option was available (all one-sample t-tests with ts(44) &gt; 7.17, ps &lt; .001, and Cohen's ds &gt; 1.06; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B-D, middle)</ref>. These results indicate that participants learned the values associated with the choice options and that subsequent results cannot be explained as an artifact of sampling error. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4B</ref> shows participant choice patterns during the equivaluable (=SvsU) trials as a function of probability and context. Critically, the interaction was again significant (F(2,88) = 8.07, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = .16; ps &gt; .06 for the main effects). To characterize this interaction, we again assessed the difference between uncertainty preferences across contexts and regressed the differences against the probability associated with equivaluable conditions. As in Experiment 1, we found a significant negative beta weight (β = -.51, p &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4E</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Results -choice patterns during equivaluable (=SvsU) trials</head><p>The negative slope indicates that participants were most likely to prefer the uncertain option for the 20% chance of gain (and conversely, avoided the uncertain option with the 20% chance of loss). These results again suggest that low probabilities were overweighted and that probabilities associated with common losses, including at the 50% level, were perceptually underweighted. Although the pattern of probability weighting we observed is not what would be expected from a simple generalization of the EOR, when comparing across Experiments 1 and 2, we note that probability weights appeared to be globally diminished when expected values were lower, consistent with the spirit of the EOR. We directly statistically compare these experiments in a later subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3 -High Expected Values and Non-Descriptive Safe Options</head><p>Our first two experiments addressed the question as to whether/how outcome extremeness influences probability weighting at low, intermediate, and high probabilities. Our initial conclusions were that, yes, extreme outcomes do modulate probability weighting across all probabilities and appear to do so by shifting a latent value function where low/high probabilities are over/underweighted -as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, the previous two experiments showed that participants strongly preferred uncertain gains over losses at low probabilities, and this preference was diminished or even reversed at medium and high probabilities. However, it was unclear whether our use of descriptive bar-stimuli in Experiments 1 and 2 as the safe, reference options influenced how people weight probabilities. Our prior study indicated that people perceive descriptive stimuli as more certain than emojis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Elston et al., 2021)</ref> when making probabilistic choices and we had initially used the descriptive reference stimuli as a way to accentuate the difference between the safe and uncertain options. To examine whether manipulating the certainty associated with the safe, reference options influenced probability weighting, we pre-registered and conducted a third experiment in which all stimuli, both safe and uncertain, were arbitrary images with no organizing principle. This allowed us to explore whether reference-point uncertainty plays a role in probability weighting. Because we, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ludvig et al. (2014)</ref>, observed the clearest effects with higher expected values and no "nothing" outcomes, we again opted to use that payoff scheme (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B-D, bottom)</ref>. These results indicate that participants learned the values associated with the choice options and that subsequent results cannot be explained as an artifact of sampling error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Results -choice patterns during equivaluable (=SvsU) trials</head><p>As in Experiments 1 and 2, we assessed choice behavior in the =SvsU trials with an rmANOVA (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4C)</ref>. Critically, the interaction was again significant (F(2, 106) = 3.23, p = .04, η p 2 = .06), as was the main effect of condition (F(2, 106)=5.96, p = .004, η p 2 = .10) but not context (F(1, 53) = 3.77, p = .057, η p 2 = .07). We again characterized the nature of the interaction effect by regressing contextual differences in uncertainty-preferences against probability and again detected a significant, negative beta weight (β = -.29, p = .03, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure   4F</ref>). The rmANOVA interaction result and the negative beta weight were critical as they indicated that our findings of overweighting of low probabilities and underweighting of high probabilities was primarily driven by the differential uncertainty associated with safe and uncertain options and cannot be explained due to differences in context, payoff scheme, or information format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing the Roles of Probability, Information Format, and Expected Value on Probability Weighting Across the Three Experiments</head><p>We consistently observed that participants preferred uncertain gains more than uncertain losses when probabilities were low (20%) and often preferred uncertain losses over uncertain gains at high probabilities (80%). However, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, choice behavior during equivaluable trials also appeared to be influenced by the expected values of the choice options (via the payoff schemes) and the information format of the safe option (whether it was descriptive or not). Next, we explored how these factors influenced probability weighting across Experiments via a general linear regression model (GLM). The dependent variable was the gain-minus-loss difference of p(Choose Uncertain) in the =SvsU trials (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4D-F)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to probability, our other predictors were expected value and information format. We coded the expected value regressor as +1 for the experiments with higher expected values (Experiments 1 and 3) and -1 for Experiment 2, which had a lower expected value for each choice option. Similarly, we coded the information format regressor as +1 for Experiments 1 and 2, where the safe option was descriptive; the regressor was coded as -1 for Experiment 3,</p><p>where the safe option was an arbitrary symbol. Coding the variables this way eased interpretation as positive values indicated a positive contribution to uncertainty preference. We included all interactions in the model.</p><p>As in our earlier analysis, we detected a significant, negative effect of probability (β = -.31, p &lt; .001), indicating that the same latent value function of over/underweighting low/high probabilities was present across all three experiments. Critically, the GLM revealed significant main effects of expected value (β = .09, p &lt; .001) and information format (β = .11, p &lt; .001).</p><p>The expected value main effect indicates that increased expected values (as in Experiments 1 and 3) generally led to greater probability overweighting (as indicated by a preference for uncertain options in the gain domain and uncertainty-aversion in the loss domain). Similarly, the positively-signed information format main effect indicates that participants preferred (and thus presumably overweighted) uncertain options when the safe option descriptively conveyed its payoff value.</p><p>We also observed a significant interaction of probability and information format (β = -.17, p &lt; .001). We note that this interaction was negatively signed, indicating that information format accentuated probability weighting (compare Experiments 1 and 3 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> where expected value was the same but information formats differed). It is also noteworthy that expected value did not interact with probability (β = -.06, p =.24). No other terms in the GLM were significant (expected value x information format: β = -.009, p = .76; probability x expected value x information format: β = .08, p = .1). Together, these results suggest that expected value acts as a sort of "DC-offset", shifting the probability weighting curve up and down without modifying its sharpness whereas the information format of the safe option appears to modify the sharpness of the curve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Across three pre-registered experiments, we examined how extreme gains and losses influenced decisions involving different degrees of uncertainty. Across all experiments, participants consistently preferred uncertain gains over uncertain losses at the 20% uncertainty level and, conversely, tended to prefer uncertain losses over uncertain gains at the 80% uncertainty level. This suggests that people overweight low probabilities and underweight high probabilities in experience-based choice. These results are more consistent with a probability weightings predicted by prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref> than those associated with early sampling-based studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hertwig et al., 2004)</ref> and the EOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ludvig et al., 2014</ref>) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>Across experiments, we explored whether outcome extremity and the format of the safe, reference options influenced uncertainty preferences across probabilities and domains. These factors modulated probability weighting (as measured by uncertainty preference in equivaluable trials) in different ways: extreme outcomes shifted the probability weighting curve up/down whereas information format sharpened the curve, leading to exaggerations in probability under/overweighting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome uncertainty, consequential decisions, and extreme outcomes</head><p>Our results support accounts assuming extreme outcomes of uncertain options -the range of possible outcomes a given choice option could yield -to be a critical component in probability weighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Konstantinidis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ludvig et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Madan et al., 2017)</ref>. This is because more uncertain options have wider outcome ranges, allowing for greater distortions in perceived probability in the sense that wider distributions provide higher/lower bounds for inferred likelihoods. It is noteworthy that our results are the exact opposite compared to early sampling-based studies of experience-based choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hertwig et al., 2004)</ref>. The main differences between these early studies and ours is that each decision in our paradigm was consequential and our participants made many more decisions. Consistent with this view, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garcia et al. (2023)</ref> recently reported that participants who learned probabilities associated with arbitrary stimuli through consequential (rewarded) learning neglected those values when probed in blocks of trials in the absence of reward feedback. Thus, experience-based choice appears to be critically modulated by the type of ongoing feedback that led to the formation and refinement of learned outcome estimates.</p><p>Our study helps to refine theories concerning how extreme-outcomes bias probability weightings in experience-based choice. We observed the largest probability distortions in our first and third (as compared to second) experiments, where the expected values were more extreme. However, since the same payoffs were used across all probabilities within each experiment, a simple generalization of the extreme-outcome rule predicted a general preference for uncertain gains and general aversion for uncertain losses, regardless of probability. Although we, like others <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Konstantinidis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ludvig et al., 2014)</ref>, observed moderate probability overweighting at the 50% level, we consistently observed the largest effect at the 20% level. To account for the pattern we observed, it seems possible to extend the "extreme-outcome rule" by assuming that probability overweighting could arise via distortions in a value-based learning process that incorporates the distribution from which outcomes are drawn. Specifically, options with greater outcome uncertainty yield a wider range of possible values, allowing for greater distortions in perceived value in the sense that wider distributions provide higher/lower bounds for inferred values. Interestingly, this distributional value-based learning seems to particularly influence choice behavior at low probabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling error and the information format of safe, reference options</head><p>Our task design, namely the inclusion of training blocks, precludes the possibility that our results stem from sampling error. Indeed, we confirmed that participants experienced the expected proportions of outcomes associated with uncertain options. Moreover, overweighting low probabilities, as we observed, is exactly the opposite of early, sampling-based studies found and have partially attributed to sampling error.</p><p>It is also important to note that the over/under-weighting of low/high probabilities observed in our study cannot be attributed to differences in the information format of the safe and uncertain options. Specifically, one might argue that the findings from the first two experiments, where the safe options were descriptive bar-stimuli, reflected a form of the DE gap due to different information formats. However, in Experiment 3 we used arbitrary stimuli (emojis) for both safe and uncertain options and used the same payoff scheme as in Experiment 1. Critically, we still observed a large difference between uncertainty-preferences across the gain and loss domains at the 20% and 80% levels. Therefore, our combined findings suggest that the critical factor is the level of uncertainty associated with the safe and uncertain options and that information format and outcome extremeness modulates probability weighting more generally, albeit in different ways.</p><p>Still, information format may play a role because we observed a larger and more general set of probability distortions in Experiment 1 (where the safe options were descriptive) as compared to Experiment 3 (where the safe options were arbitrary emojis). Critically, these two experiments used the same payoff scheme. Thus, while the information format did not itself drive the overweighting of low probabilities, our results suggest that it modulates probability weighting by exaggerating over/underweighting of low/high probabilities.</p><p>Prospect theory, learning, and evolution</p><p>We were surprised to observe choice patterns associated with over/underweighting low/high probabilities because it is exactly the opposite of early accounts of the DE gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hertwig et al., 2004)</ref>. Instead, our results are consistent with early studies of probability weighting where the probabilities were verbally described to participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. However, additional learning-related factors beyond the scope of traditional prospect theory must also be at play because participant behavior markedly responded to manipulating whether outcomes were more/less extreme and whether the safe, reference options were descriptive/arbitrary.</p><p>We also note that our results are consistent with reports of over/underweighting low/high probabilities in both description and experienced-based choice in non-human primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Garcia et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Heilbronner &amp; Hayden, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stauffer et al., 2015</ref>). Indeed, our task design, which used partial feedback and a complete intermixing of trial conditions closely resembles those studies. This suggests that probability distortion may reflect an evolutionarily preserved cognitive process. This is important because it suggests that it may be possible to bridge the gap between the human and animal cognition literatures in the study of value-based choice and probability weighting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of reference points</head><p>Interestingly, the results of the present study and our prior one differ at high probabilities -we observed robust overweighting of high probabilities in our prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Elston et al., 2021)</ref> and underweighting in the present study. One interpretation of this difference in choice patterns stems from prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>: value-based decisions depend on internal reference points to classify potential outcomes as gains or losses. Thus, it may be that decision contexts involving safe options induce a different set of reference points compared to when no sure-bet option exists. Indeed, recent experimental and computational work in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hunter &amp; Daw, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hunter &amp; Gershman, 2018)</ref> found that different reference points can be induced and manipulated in the same experiment and that this can strongly influence behavior. These results suggest that subjective valuations of uncertain options may be relative to reference points, that these reference points can change over time, and are likely the basis for learned outcome distributions to be formed around. Future studies might investigate the precise role that outcome uncertainty plays in the formation of reference points: we hypothesize that descriptive options would be more likely to be taken as reference points as compared to experience options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decisions involving uncertainty are more cognitively demanding</head><p>To better understand the dynamics of decisions involving uncertainty, we explore choice reaction times (see the Appendix for exact details and data). Across all three experiments, we observed that decisions involving uncertainty were slower than those that didn't and loss-domain decisions were slower than gain-domain ones. Choice reaction times are thought to reflect the duration of the cognitive processes necessary to report a choice: perception of the options, valuation, deliberation, and, ultimately, motor preparation and response execution.</p><p>Thus, elongated decision times reflect elongated cognitive processing demands. Prior accumulator-based models of choice times predict that multi-attribute options elicit longer decision times <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Busemeyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkin &amp; Brown, 2018)</ref>. Given that uncertain options, by definition, have more than outcome and each of these outcomes could be considered an attribute of the choice option, we interpret our results as evidence that decisions involving uncertainty are multi-attribute. Following these computational models, we theorize that outcomes associated with uncertain options are internally represented as a distribution and that reaction times partially reflect the process of integrating over that distribution. Thus, it may be that the process of computing values associated with uncertain options takes longer because the distribution to integrate over is wider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decisions dynamics are affected by context and expected value</head><p>We interpret the elongated reaction times associated with loss-mitigation as potentially reflecting <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kahneman and Tversky's (1979)</ref> notion of risk aversion due to overweighting the prospect of loss relative to gain. Thus, longer decision times during loss-mitigating choices could reflect increased deliberative conflict due to the worse outcome seeming worse than it really is. Interestingly, our results also showed that decision times were influenced by the joint impact of probability and context of outcomes in the =SvsU equivaluable trials. Specifically, we found that loss-mitigating decisions became slower as the probability of those losses increased, and conversely, gain-maximizing choices became faster as the probability of gain increased. One interpretation is that the probability-related effect may characterize differences in the processes of valuation whereas the context-related effect may characterize differences in deliberation and conflict. More generally, the present findings demonstrate the potential of reaction times as a complementary measure to gain deeper insights into the cognitive processes underlying decisions involving uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective valuation and orientations towards uncertainty</head><p>In circumstances where choice outcomes are uncertain, the way we perceive probabilities significantly impacts how we assign value to a given choice option. Consider Pascal's canonical expected value formula: EV = Amount x Probability. It follows that when outcome amounts are held constant, as was the case for the uncertain options in our experiment, probability overweighting leads to a higher subjective valuation of uncertain options as compared to certain, "sure bet" options. Thus, individual differences in uncertainty-preferences likely reflect a rational decision process but an irrational valuation process driven by probability distortion.</p><p>Subjective perceptions of probability are inherently abstract -probability, unlike outcome amount, does not exist as a concrete object in the world. Thus, subjective values associated with probability must be gleaned through experience -they must be learned. One limitation of prospect theory is that it is a descriptive rather than generative model -it elegantly explains behavior in a highly parameterized way but does not offer an account of the cognitive processes that undergird those parameters. Reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Sutton &amp; Barto, 2018)</ref> (RL) is a simple yet powerful framework whereby an agent learns the expected value of an option through trial and error. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Niv et al. (2012)</ref> introduced a risk-sensitive RL (RS-RL) model which allows the learning process to differentially weight unexpectedly positive and negative outcomes. Their RS-RL model explained participant choice behavior and neural responses better than a cumulative prospect theory model. Moreover, Niv et al. found that individual subjects who overweighted extremely positive outcomes preferred uncertain options and those who overweight extremely negative outcomes were uncertainty-averse. This result suggests that outcome uncertainty may be the substrate which enables probability distortion because more uncertain options have wider outcome ranges and, within the RS-RL framework, elicit larger prediction errors, thereby driving larger distortions in learned values. Future efforts might</p><p>seek to explicitly integrate the generative aspects of RL with some of the descriptive features of prospect theory in consequential experience-based choice. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>.

Accumulator-based models of choice RT predict that multi-attribute options elicit longer RTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Busemeyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkin &amp; Brown, 2018)</ref>;</p><p>given that uncertain options, by definition, have more than one outcome and each of these outcomes could be considered an attribute of the choice option. Thus, we hypothesized that choices involving uncertain options would elicit longer RTs as compared to decisions between purely safe/certain options. Similarly, our prior results <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Elston et al., 2021)</ref> indicated that RTs are longer in the loss than the gain domain. We were interested in whether such an effect would be visible in our present task design and whether RTs would additionally be modulated by expected value. We assessed the RT data with rmANOVAs with the within-subject factors of domain and uncertainty (see <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>) and obtained highly consistent results across all three experiments.</p></div>			</div>
