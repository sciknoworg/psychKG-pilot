			<abstract>
				<p>Prior work investigated how foreign language impacts decision making by either reducing access to emotion or imposing additional cognitive demands. In this fMRI study, we employed a cross-task design to assess at the neural level whether and how the interaction between cognitive loading and emotional involvement is affected by language (native L1 vs. foreign L2). Participants completed a Lexico-semantic task where in each trial they were presented with either a neutrally or a negatively valenced word either in L1 or L2, and either under cognitive loading or not. After each trial, they had to decide whether to take a risky decision within a gambling game. During the Gamling task, left amygdala and right insula were more activated after having processed a negative word under cognitive loading. However, this was true for L1 but not for L2, suggesting that cognitive loading was germane and facilitated rather than hindered access to emotion only in L1. Further suggesting that cognitive load can enhance emotional sensitivity in L1 but not in L2, we found that functional connectivity between reward-related striatum and right insula increased under cognitive loading only in L1. Overall, results suggest that cognitive loading in L1 can favor access to emotion and lead to a more impulsive decision making, whereas cognitive loading in L2 can attenuate access to emotion and lead to a more rational decision making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Involvement in Bilingual Decision Making</head><p>Facing a decision making task, bilinguals are often less impulsive and more analytic if the information is presented in their second language (L2) rather than in their native language (L1), an effect that was termed foreign language effect (Caldwell- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harris, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Costa et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Costa et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Geipel et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hayakawa et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hayakawa et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Keysar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Montero-Melis et al., 2020)</ref>. For instance, foreign language may reduce or eliminate decision making biases such as the framing effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Keysar et al., 2012)</ref>, the aversion to losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Costa et al., 2014)</ref>, and the hot hand fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gao et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Foreign language effect can be attributed to the fact that L2 is less grounded in the emotional system compared to L1 <ref type="bibr">(Dylman &amp; Bjarta, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuhne &amp; Gianelli, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Sulpizio et al., 2019)</ref>. Messages processed in L2 overall elicit milder emotional arousal than messages processed in L1, which in turn may lead to a more careful and rational decision making <ref type="bibr">(Díaz-Lago &amp; Matute, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hadjichristidis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Keysar et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Another key factor can be that making decisions in L2 rather than L1 involves greater cognitive resources <ref type="bibr">Oganian et al., 2016)</ref>. Indeed, orthography, phonetic, semantic and grammatical processing in L2 requires additional cognitive resources due to lower proficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hasegawa et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Stiller &amp; Schworm, 2019</ref>). The less automatic and more difficult processing in L2 may thus be source for distancing and lead to a more deliberate and analytic decision making.</p><p>As of yet, however, emotional involvement and cognitive loading were often treated as two separate factors, and prior work did not systematically investigate the underlying interaction between them in the context of the foreign language effect. Since cognitive resources are limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Franconeri et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Vroomen et al., 2001</ref>), the more they are recruited for orthography and semantic processing, the less they can be used for emotional processing. Despite this, cognitive load does not always hinder emotional processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berggren et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Debue &amp; van de Leemput, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Cognitive Load Theory argues that font emphasis, for instance, can reduce the extraneous cognitive loading related to the presentation of materials and improve the germane cognitive loading which is functional to the learning process <ref type="bibr">(Paas &amp; Sweller, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schneider et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, a greater allocation of cognitive resources can sometimes, when germane, work alongside an enhanced processing of the emotional information in the lexico-semantic access. However, this is more likely to happen in L1 than in L2. Indeed, because of the additional cognitive resources needed to process written or spoken foreign language, it is less likely to find germane cognitive loading in L2. Accordingly, cognitive loading may promote or hinder emotional processing depending also on the language in which the message is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural Bases of the Foreign Language Effect</head><p>Two brain regions have been shown to be crucially associated with emotional involvement: insula, which works for detecting emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Pedale et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Simmons et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Thom et al., 2012)</ref>, and amygdala, which is implicated in inducing the emotional response <ref type="bibr">(Dehdar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Guex et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Janak &amp; Tye, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Méndez-Bértolo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Namburi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Phan et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Tye et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In L2, activation of insula and amygdala may be reduced under cognitive loading.</p><p>This can be so because, given the weakness of the semantic access to orthography/phonology in L2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Green, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Runnqvist et al., 2019)</ref>, a competition for resource allocation may arise between the semantic and the emotional access. In contrast, in L1, bilinguals need to recruit less cognitive resources to process the language, and thus germane loading likely triggers a more indepth processing of the emotional content <ref type="bibr">(Dylman &amp; Bjärtå, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pavlenko, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Ponari et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Different lexical-semantic activation thresholds may thus lead to different emotional experiences: cognitive loading may deepen the emotional experience if the message is presented in L1 but weaken it if the message is presented in L2.</p><p>A fMRI study did indeed reveal that cognitive load can influence the emotional processing in L1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Van Dillen et al., 2009)</ref>. Participants saw a negative or neutral picture, performed an arithmetic task, and then rated the perceived unpleasantness of the picture.</p><p>The task load was shown to down-regulate the amygdala and right insula activity for negative stimuli, resulting in a reduction of the negative emotions.</p><p>Relevant is also a fMRI study in which the role of emotional involvement in bilinguals' decision making was assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Zheng et al., 2020)</ref>. Participants made 'play' or 'leave' decisions in an equal-odds Gambling task where gambling feedbacks were presented in either L1 or L2. At the behavioral level, both in L1 and L2 participants showed the Gambler's fallacy, i.e. the tendency to bet more when losing rather than winning. However, the fMRI scanning revealed that language modulated the neural responses associated to the gambling feedbacks and to the participants' decisions.</p><p>Importantly, the activation of the reward brain networks in response to positive feedbacks was exaggerated in L2 compared to L1.</p><p>Authors thus found that receiving a positive message in L2 amplified the associated emotion. This evidence is somehow in contrast with the emotion-reducing hypothesis according to which L2 reduces the emotional reactions, but it is consistent with the positive-bias hypothesis according to which L2 specifically enhances positive emotions (Caldwell- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harris, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sheikh &amp; Titone, 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>This Study</head><p>The current study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the neural activation underpinning the interaction between cognitive load and emotional involvement in the foreign versus native language context. Participants were first presented with a Lexico-semantic task widely used in semantics research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fujimaki et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hinojosa et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pu et al., 2005)</ref>. In each trial they were presented with either a neutrally or a negatively valenced word either in L1 or in L2, and either under cognitive loading or not. Three factors were thus varied in this task: language (L1, L2), emotion (valenced, not valenced), cognitive load (low, high).</p><p>We aimed at assessing the influence of these three factors and their interaction on participants' subsequent decisions in an even-probability Gambling task <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, we aimed at revealing the associated neural activity. We predicted coordination or competition varying across languages and cognitive load conditions between the dorsal striatum, which is associated with decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Korucuoglu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sharpe et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Wimmer et al., 2014)</ref>, and insula and amygdala <ref type="bibr">(Gorka et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Korgaonkar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Shiv et al., 2005)</ref>, two areas associated with emotion processing. If the automaticity of L1 processing enables more emotional access whereas the increased cognitive demands in L2 leave little room for emotionality, we should find that cognitive loading boosts access to emotion in L1 but hinders access to emotion in L2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Thirty unbalanced Chinese-English (L1-L2) bilinguals participated in this study.</p><p>They were right handed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological or psychological impairments. None of them were receiving treatment with psychoactive medication. Due to the excessive head movement of five participants, the imaging data analysis included only 25 participants (9 male, M = 22.56 ± 2.35 years).</p><p>The behavioral data analysis included 28 participants (10 male, M = 22.61 ± 2.27 years) because the answers of two participants in the Gambling task were extreme (gambling ratio &gt; 85%). The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the School of Psychology, Liaoning Normal University.</p><p>Participants' language proficiency was assessed through questionnaires asking the age of L2 acquisition and to self-rate the language skills on a scale that ranged from 1 (= no knowledge of L1/L2) to 6 (= perfect knowledge). Language proficiency was also measured with the Oxford Placement Test (OPT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allan, 2004)</ref>, by administering 25 multiple choice questions and a cloze test. Maximum score was 50 (see Appendix A). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows participants' average language proficiency. Four paired t-test revealed that proficiency ratings were significantly higher for L1 than L2 in listening, speaking, reading and writing, t(29) ≥ 4.75, ps &lt; 0.001. Moreover, self-rating and OPT scores were similar to those of Chinese-English bilinguals with intermediate L2 proficiency who participated in prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Liang &amp; Chen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Liu et al., 2016)</ref>. At the end of the session, participants completed a Risk Attitude Scale ranging from 1 (= conservative) to 5 (= adventure), M = 2.81, SD = 0.60 <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Weber et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Appendix B)</ref>. </p></div>

Words had two characters in Chinese and four to nine letters in English, M = 5.80 ± 1.33. Their emotional valence was established by using the modern Chinese words emotion rating scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Wang et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Forty words (20 negative, 20 neutral) in simplified L1 (e.g. 恐惧，新闻) and lowercase L2 (e.g. fear, news) were chosen for the Low-load condition. Forty words in traditional L1 (e.g. 恐懼, 新聞) and capital L2 (e.g. FEAR, NEWS) were instead chosen for the High-load condition. Words in the two conditions were phonologically and semantically identical but written in a different form (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>).</p><p>Words in L1 and L2 were matched for lexical frequency and emotional valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cai &amp; Brysbaert, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">see</ref>  English pseudo-words were instead constructed by randomly by substituting or adding one letter (e.g. flyy; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>). Pseudo-words were not analyzed.  <ref type="bibr">(-50, -40, -30, -20, -10)</ref>. For each gamble, participants saw two numbers preceded by a sign indicating the prospective gain and loss (e.g. +100 and -50). These numbers were separated by a horizontal bar indicating that the probability of winning or losing was 0.50 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure   1b</ref>). In 76% of the trails the magnitude of prospective gain was larger compared to loss, in 16% was smaller, and in 8% of the trails was equal. A large magnitude of prospective gain was used in most of the trials to lead participants to gamble more often than not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In our cross-task study, participants were first presented with a practice block of 26 trials that helped them to understand the instructions. Participants were then presented with 200 trials, equally divided into four blocks, with two practice trials per block. L1</p><p>and L2 words were randomly mixed and presented in the four blocks. The order of blocks was counterbalanced across participants. Stimuli were white words or numbers presented on a black background using E-Prime 2.0 software on a Dell PC. Words and numbers were displayed in Courier New, words in size 34 and numbers in size 18.</p><p>In the Lexico-semantic task, participants' attention was directed to the lexicosemantic properties of the words by asking them to distinguish meaningful words from pseudowords. Each trial started with a fixation cross displayed for 500 ms, followed by a word displayed for 3000 ms to allow semantic processing (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref>). Participants had to judge, as quickly and accurate as possible, whether the word was correct by pressing 1 (= yes) or 3 (= no). Key buttons were counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>After each Lexico-sematic trial, participants received a Gambling task trial which started with a fixation cross displayed for 500 ms followed by a 50/50 gamble option ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>). Participants had to decide within 3000 ms whether to bet by pressing 1 (= play) or not to bet by pressing 3 (= leave). Key buttons were counterbalanced across participants. If participants chose to leave or did not press any buttons, a blank screen appeared for 1000 ms, and the next trial started after another blank screen displayed for a random duration between 500 and 2000 ms. If participants chose to gamble, a feedback appeared for 1000 ms displaying the sum earned or lost in the trial. This outcome was randomly generated where each option was given 50% probability. Lastly, a blank screen was displayed for a 500-2000 ms time window. whereas if they did not gamble, a black screen appeared.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Data Analysis</head><p>Both participants' accuracy (ACC) scores and reaction times (RT) in the Lexicosemantic task were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed effect model using language, cognitive load and emotional valence as fixed effects. Participants was added as the random effect in the ACC analysis, whereas participants and words were added as random effects in the RT analysis. Participants' decisions and RTs in the Gambling task were analyzed with a liner mixed effect model using the three factors listed above as fixed effects, and participants and potential gain/loss as random effects.</p><p>fMRI Data Preprocessing fMRI data were preprocessed with DPABI <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Yan et al., 2016)</ref>. First, all the EPI DICOM data were converted to NIFTI format, and the first 15 volumes of each run were discarded because of T1 relaxation artifacts. Second, all volumes slice scan times were corrected to the middle time slice and realigned to the first scan to correct for head motion. Third, the structural images of each participant were co-registered with the mean functional images and next they were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template. Fourth, all voxels were resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm. Fifth, all functional volumes were smoothed by using a 6-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>fMRI Data Analysis</head><p>First-level statistical analysis was conducted using SPM12 software. General linear models were computed from the 100 z-normalized volume time courses (25 participants × 4 blocks). The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response was modeled using a double gamma hemodynamic response function. A general linear model was performed for each of the four blocks. For the the Lexico-semantic task, factors were language, cognitive load and emotional valence. For the Gambling task, factors were language, cognitive load, emotional valence and choice (gamble, no gamble).</p><p>We ran a full factorial analysis on the Lexico-semantic task and Gambling task data to test for main effects and interactions with one-way, two-way or three-way ANOVAs.</p><p>Region of Interest (ROI) analyses were done with MarsBaR tool, using percent signal change to explore the dynamic changes of activation over time in ROI.

We next created PPI regressor using element-by-element products of the extracted, deconvolved insula time series and a vector coding for the main effect of cognitive load (1 for High-load, -1 for Low-load). This product was reconvolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and entered as PPI regressor along with the cognitive load (psychological), right insula time series (physiological) and the head motion (nuisance) regressors. Subject-specific PPI models were run, and contrast images were generated for High-load and Low-load PPIs. For cognitive load-dependent functional connectivity of the right insula with other regions in L2, the same operation was done.</p></div>

This area was activated more in L1 than in L2 (M = 0.07, SD = 3.08, and M = -1.03, SD = 3.56, respectively), and more under cognitive loading (M = 0.22, SD = 3.57, and M = -1.18, SD = 3.01; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). The analysis revealed also a significant Language × Emotional valence interaction: Left amygdala was activated more for L1 than for L2 in the negative words condition, p = 0.007, but this was not true for the neutral words condition. Lastly, a significant Language × Cognitive load × Emotional valence interaction was primarily due to greater activation under cognitive loading for L1 negative words, p &lt; 0.001 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>).</p><p>In sum, we found greater activation of left amygdala under cognitive loading in L1</p><p>but not in L2, suggesting that germane cognitive loading in L1 favored an indepth emotion processing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PsychoPhysiological Interaction (PPI) Analysis</head><p>Since we found a significant interaction between cognitive load and emotion in the right insula, we selected the difference between right insula activation for negative and neutral words as PPI seeds. In L1 condition, we found a robust activation in regions of the right dorsal striatum (i.e. lentiform nucleus, putamen) dependent on cognitive loading (Appendix E) and a functional interaction between right dorsal striatum (region related to cognitive load) and right insula (region related to emotion) (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>). In addition, there was a significant functional connectivity between the right insula and the left superior temporal gyrus under cognitive loading, but the activation of the left superior temporal gyrus was not itself dependent on the cognitive load condition (-63 -48 18). For L2, instead, the right parahippocampal gyrus, responsible for memory processes and here activated differently as a function of cognitive loading (Appendix E), showed a strong connectivity with the right insula. Although the left dorsal striatum and right thalamus also connected with the right insula, they were not part of the cognitive load-dependent functional connectivity.  <ref type="bibr">Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Benjiamini &amp; Yekutieli, 2001</ref>) was applied to p values which are reported as corrected.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study adopted a cross-task design to investigate at the neural level how the interaction between cognition and emotion can be affected by language (L1 vs. L2).</p><p>We found that activation of the left amygdala and right insula was increased under cognitive loading in L1 negative words condition but not in L2 negative words condition. Both left amygdala and right insula modulate emotional processing <ref type="bibr">(Gorka et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hassel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Korgaonkar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Shiv et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xue et al., 2011)</ref>: the former is known to be involved in sympathetic emotional activation <ref type="bibr">(Eimontaite et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Korn &amp; Bach, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Orem et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Williams et al. 2005)</ref>, and the latter is associated with negative affect and avoidance behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Saga et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Turel et al., 2020)</ref>. Here these regions were found to interact differently with cognitive loading depending on the language context.</p><p>This study further revealed that cognitive load-dependent connectivity in L1 was different to the one in L2. The increased connectivity with the reward-related striatum in L1 under cognitive loading suggests that cognitive load can enhance emotional sensitivity in L1. By contrast, in L2 context, the connection between the insula and the parahippocampal gyrus, a memory area, indicates that the brain favored the semantics access over the emotion processing.</p><p>A different access to emotion in the two languages (native, foreign) may explain the neural-behavioral correlations that we found. While in L1 the gambling ratio was positively correlated with the difference in left amygdala activation between the Highload negative words condition and the Low-load negative words condition, in L2 it was negatively correlated with the difference in right insula activation between the Highload negative words condition and the High-load neutral words condition. This suggests that in L1 cognitive loading can facilitate or deepen the emotional experience leading to a more impulsive decision making, whereas in L2 it can attenuate or hinder the access to emotion leading to more rational decision making.</p><p>The correlation between gambling ratio and left amygdala activation in L1 is in line with research showing that amygdala modulates risk behavior <ref type="bibr">(Takeuchi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">van Holstein et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xue et al., 2011)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Zheng et al. (2020)</ref> showed that the processing of gambling feedbacks was associated with activation in the bilateral caudate, right posterior insula and amygdala, and that the activation in these areas helps explain foreign language effect in participants' gambling choices. However, while in while experiencing negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Scholer et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We also found a correlation between gambling ratio and right insula activation in L2. This area is known to be implicated in top-down control of sympathetic nervous system functioning which is involved in hunger, survival, addiction, negative affect and avoidance behavior <ref type="bibr">(Craig, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Naqvi et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Saga et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Turel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Xue et al., 2010)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arsalidou et al. (2013)</ref> reported that the bilateral insula areas were modulated by cognitive loading in a working memory task, strengthening the hypothesis that insula activation reflects both cognitive loading and emotion.</p><p>Overall, the correlational results pattern reported here can be explained by different thresholds of lexical-semantic access in the two languages (L1, L2). After processing a L1 word, cognitive resources are often still available to be recruited in the processing of the emotional valence of the word. In our study this may have led participants to a more emotional or impulsive decision making. By contrast, cognitive load in L2 hinders or attenuates access to emotion as more cognitive resources are needed to process the lexical-semantic components of the words.</p><p>In our cross-task study, participants first completed a Lexical-semantic task trial where they were provided with a L1 or L2 language stimulus, and then made their decision whether to gamble. Thus, the language stimulus can be conceptualized as an anchor. We were interested in assessing under which conditions this anchor would have had an effect on participants' decision making. The anchoring effect is a cognitive heuristic and refers to the process where the individual is systematically biased in their judgment by an information given before the judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beggs &amp; Graddy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Furnham &amp; Boo, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Furnham et al., 2012)</ref>. For instance, an individual's numerical estimate can be affected by biased estimates toward arbitrary values presented before.</p><p>In the native L1 context of our study, bilinguals may have been biased toward a more emotional and less rational decision making by having been anchored to the emotion assessment in the Lexical-semantic task. By contrast, in the foreign L2 context, the achoring effect may have been hindered because cognitive loading and processing did not leave room for emotion processing in the anchoring phase in the first place.</p><p>However, it should also be noted that we did not find any significant left amygdala activation specific for negative words vs. neutral words in the Low-load condition in both L1 and L2. A possibility is that the emotion processing of valenced words highly depends on the difficulty of the lexical-semantic processing needed to complete the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hinojosa et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schacht &amp; Sommer, 2009b)</ref>. Perhaps Low-load trials were too simple to process, and participants did not direct their attention to the emotional aspects of the stimuli. By contrast, participants may have been more focused on the emotional aspects in the High-load trials because the higher difficulty of the task increased their attention. Needless to say, this phenomenon closely resembles the germane cognitive loading phenomenon we discussed in the Introduction.</p><p>An unexpected result was found in the L1 Low-load condition: the insula, an area associated with emotion detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Pedale et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Simmons et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Thom et al., 2012)</ref>, was activated for the neutral words more than it was for the negative words.</p><p>A possibility is that emotion detection was processed almost automatically for negative stimuli, but effortfully for neutral stimuli. Under this hypothesis, activation of insula can be seen as reflecting participants' effort in assessing whether neutral words had emotional content or not. Ultimately, however, no emotion can be associated to neutral words, as evidenced by the lack of activation of the amygdala region. Of interest here is that such unexpected effect was not found in L2 context. This further evidence of interaction insensitivity in L2 supports a foreign language effect.</p><p>It is worth noting that a number of studies reported that loading cognitive processes reduces emotional influence on judgment and cognition more in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berggren et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">DeFraine, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mueller et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Panasiti et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van Dillena et al., 2009)</ref>. Instead, at least in L1 context, we found that loading cognitive processes led to increased emotionality: in L1 but not in L2, negative stimuli provoked higher amygdala activity under cognitive loading. Work reporting an emotionality reduction effect often uses arithmetic-based tasks to interfere with the processing of affective stimuli (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chen &amp; Epps, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clarke &amp; Johnstone, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Van Dillen et al., 2009)</ref>. By contrast, we used linguistic stimuli which already carry an emotional significance. In particular, it can be observed that words can induce different emotional arousal depending on whether they are in L1 or L2. This is so because L1 is learned in a diversified set of situations including negative ones, whereas L2 is acquired and used mainly in decontexted classroom environments where negative experiences are scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atkinson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grauwe et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kühne &amp; Gianelli, 2019)</ref>. L1 words processing may thus be more closely associated with the emotional brain networks.</p><p>These observations help explain why in L1 but not in L2 a germane cognitive load as the one employed in the current study resulted in higher activation of areas associated with emotion processing. This higher emotion activation under cognitive loading in L1</p><p>led to a biased decision making where insula showed significant connectivity with the the dorsal striatum, an area related to decision making <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2019)</ref>, action planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Vink et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Zandbelt &amp; Vink, 2010)</ref>, motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gemikonakli et al., 2019)</ref>, reinforcement and reward perception <ref type="bibr">(Pan et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Wimmer et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Instead, in L2 context, words underwent a more declarative lexico-semantic processing:</p><p>insula was indeed found to be more connected with the parahippocampal gyrus, which plays an important role in memory encoding and retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aberg et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bohbot et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Murty et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Suzuki &amp; Amaral, 1994)</ref>. This suggests that cognitive loading in L2 led participants to first make an extra-effort to access the semantics and only later process the emotional valence of the words <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hinojosa et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, in L1, because of the ease of lexical-semantic access, cognitive loading can be germane and promote access to emotion, eventually affecting decision making. In L2 context, instead, the higher difficulty of the lexical-semantic access combined with cognitive loading can be too taxing for participants' cognitive resources and, as a result, hinder the emotional influence over decision making.</p></div>
