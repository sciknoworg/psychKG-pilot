			<abstract>
				<p>Evidence accumulation models provide a dominant account of human decision-making, and have been particularly successful at explaining behavioral and neural data in laboratory paradigms using abstract, stationary stimuli. It has been proposed, but with limited in-depth investigation so far, that similar decision-making mechanisms are involved in tasks of a more embodied nature, such as movement and locomotion, by directly accumulating externally measurable sensory quantities of which the precise, typically continuously time-varying, magnitudes are important for successful behavior. Here, we leverage collision threat detection as a task which is ecologically relevant in this sense, but which can also be rigorously observed and modelled in a laboratory setting. Conventionally, it is assumed that humans are limited in this task by a perceptual threshold on the optical expansion rate-the visual looming-of the obstacle. Using concurrent recordings of EEG and behavioral responses, we disprove this conventional assumption, and instead provide strong evidence that humans detect collision threats by accumulating the continuously time-varying visual looming signal. Generalizing existing accumulator model assumptions from stationary to time-varying sensory evidence, we show that our model accounts for previously unexplained empirical observations and full distributions of detection response. We replicate a pre-response centroparietal positivity (CPP) in scalp potentials, which has previously been found to correlate with accumulated decision evidence. In contrast with these existing findings, we show that our model is capable of predicting the onset of the CPP signature rather than its buildup, suggesting that neural evidence accumulation is implemented differently, possibly in distinct brain regions, in collision detection compared to previously studied paradigms.</p>

In recent decades, evidence accumulation models (also known as drift diffusion or sequential sampling models) have emerged as one dominant account, positing that decisions are made once noisy evidence has been integrated over time up to a decision threshold <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. These models have been successful at explaining distributions of behavioral choices and response times across numerous laboratory paradigms, e.g., where participants make categorization decisions about ambiguous stimuli, or choose between options with different subjective or objective value <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. There is also strong neurophysiological support for the idea that the brain indeed implements something akin to evidence accumulation in these types of tasks <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Notably, there is mounting support for the idea that signatures of neural evidence accumulation can be observed using human electroencephalography (EEG), in the form of a centroparietal positivity (CPP) that builds up during deliberation and peaks when the overt response is made <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>However, computational modelling of evidence accumulation decision-making has so far focused on laboratory paradigms using stimuli that (i) have stationary or only intermittently and/or noisily changing saliency over time <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and (ii) are abstract in nature, typically not mapping directly to any real-world task.</p><p>It is currently an open question whether decision-making is well-described by evidence accumulation models in less cognitive and more embodied task contexts, relating to human sensorimotor control, movement, and locomotion in the real world.</p><p>The nervous system performs myriad choices of motor actions to perform tasks such as keeping the body upright <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, balancing a stick <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, intercepting a ball <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> or avoiding collisions with other cars while driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Do evidence accumulation mechanisms play a role also in these contexts? <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> One challenge in answering this question lies in the nature of the sensory evidence being used: A hallmark feature of real-world sensorimotor behaviors is that they depend on continuously time-varying sensory stimuli, such as joint angles, sight point rotations or optical expansion rates, of which the exact, externally measurable values are important for successfully shaping the behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This is in stark contrast with most existing evidence accumulation modeling work, which has emphasized stationary evidence (in part because this enables computationally efficient model-fitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>), with the rate of evidence in the model typically fitted as a free parameter per experimental condition, without a mechanistic link to the properties of the external stimulus. We and others have begun exploring accumulation models of which the input evidence instead scales directly with external sensory data, in tasks such as stick-balancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, visual and vestibular judgment of self-motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, longitudinal and lateral control in car driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and road-crossing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, but these studies have so far not performed model testing and selection at the same level of detail as is typical in the broader evidence May 7, <ref type="bibr">2021</ref> 2/23 accumulation model literature.</p><p>Here, we aim to close this gap by developing and studying a paradigm where participants detect onset of visually looming (optically expanding) collision threats. We chose this task because it is an ecologically relevant task with time-varying sensory evidence, and accumulation of visual looming has also been suggested-but not conclusively proven-in several of the mentioned previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, yet this task nevertheless permits collection of large numbers of repetitions in a controlled laboratory environment, enabling detailed models fits of full per-participant probability distributions of response. There are also some specific predictions to test:</p><p>Conventionally, it is assumed that humans can detect collision threats once the rate of optical expansion of the obstacle's projection onto the observer's retina exceeds a looming detection threshold (LDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This LDT assumption has been adopted in basic perceptual psychology research into collision avoidance and target interception <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, time-to-contact estimation research <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, sports science <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> and applied research in the road traffic safety domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Notably, the LDT assumption is also used in traffic accident litigation, to answer questions about whether an appropriately attentive driver should have been able to avoid a crash <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>.</p><p>However, some of the early literature on the LDT reported that the kinematics of the collision course (i.e., the movement trajectories of the observer and collision object)</p><p>could seemingly affect the value of the threshold itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. We have previously</p><p>proposed that such kinematics-dependencies in human collision detection ability could be understood if, instead of an LDT, collision threat detection were determined by evidence accumulation of the visual looming signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, a hypothesis which we test here. We also complement our behavioral observations with concurrent EEG recordings, to investigate whether the previously reported CPP signature could be observed in our paradigm, and if so whether the nature of this neural signature aligned with the predictions of our time-varying evidence accumulation model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We conducted an experiment where we simultaneously recorded participants' overt looming detection responses and concurrent EEG. Rather than opting for the type of abstract stimuli conventionally used in neuroscientific research on collision perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, to emphasize the connection to real-world collision threat detection we instead chose to create a laboratory version of the driving test track experiment by Lamble et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. In their experiment, participants followed a lead vehicle at either 20 m or 40 m distance, and pressed their car's brake pedal as soon as they saw the lead vehicle come closer, which it did by a 0.7 m/s 2 deceleration (not accompanied by a brake light signal). In our laboratory implementation, illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1A and</ref> described in detail in Materials and Methods, participants were instructed to fixate a location on a screen, where an image of the back of a car appeared at an appropriate optical size for either 20 m or 40 m viewing distance, with minor horizontal and vertical perturbations over time. The car image either remained the same size for 7 s before disappearing (catch trials; 16.7 % of the total number of trials) or began, after a random delay in the 1.5-3.5 s range, to optically expand, recreating the looming trajectory of a decelerating lead vehicle (i.e., accelerating toward the observer). Participants were instructed to press a key as soon as they saw the car "coming closer"(i.e., growing on the screen).</p><p>Lamble et al. included also non-foveal detection conditions, which we omitted. Instead, we extended the design by including a 0.35 m/s 2 lead vehicle deceleration, for a total of four kinematical trajectories, with distinct profiles of visual looming, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1A.</ref> We denote the projected optical angle of the lead vehicle stimulus on the participant's retina θ, and its optical expansion rateθ = dθ/dt, increasing nonlinearly Overview of paradigm, model, and behavioral results. (A) In each trial, participants fixated a target, at which an image of the back of a car appeared, and after a variable time delay began to optically expand following one of four different looming trajectories (solid lines; colors per corresponding kinematical conditions as indicated in the boxed legend). The dotted line shows the across-experiment average optical expansion rateθ mean at which participants reported detection of this visual looming. The shaded regions all have the same area, to illustrate why evidence accumulation predicts detection at lowerθ in conditions where this quantity increases more slowly. (B) Histograms show the participants' detection response times across the entire experiment for the fastest and slowest of the four looming conditions, overlaid with the corresponding predictions from per-participant maximum likelihood fits of the variable-gain accumulator model (model AV; thick solid lines). This model posits that the visual looming evidence shown in panel A is integrated over time together with normally distributed noise, up to a fixed threshold at which detection occurs (example time histories of noisy integration of the looming input shown as thin solid lines, with circle symbols at the fixed decision threshold). The triangle symbols indicate the response times that would be predicted by a conventional looming detection threshold model, withθ mean as threshold. (C) Optical expansion rates at which the participants (histograms) and fitted accumulator model (lines) reported detection, in the four different looming conditions. The dotted lines again showθ mean , and the black crosses indicate the detection thresholds reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> for the same kinematical conditions.</p><p>with time both because of the vehicle acceleration and because the visual angle of an object is (approximately) proportional to the inverse of its distance from the observer.</p><p>Note also that in each looming condition there was a direct relationship between response time (the horizontal axis in Figs 1A and B and optical expansion rate at response (the vertical axis in Figs 1A and C. To align with the existing literature on looming detection, our basic inferential testing on the behavioral data focused onθ at response, whereas to align with the literature on evidence accumulation modeling, our model-fitting was instead focused on distributions of response time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overt responses refute the fixed looming detection threshold assumption</head><p>After exclusion of a small minority of trials for early (0.6 %) and missing (0.2 %)</p><p>detection responses, and a larger number of trials for electrooculographic indications of eye blinks (15.9 %; see Materials and Methods for details), the final data set included 22 participants, with an average of 182 trials per participant (an average of 46 trials per looming condition). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1C</ref> shows that our data replicated the kinematics-dependency reported by Lamble et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, with detection occurring at lower average optical expansion ratesθ for the larger initial distance (F (1, 3698) = 1255.48; p &lt; .0001). Also in an absolute sense, ourθ values at detection were similar to those observed in the test track experiment (black crosses in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1C)</ref>, but slightly lower, potentially due to the reduced noise in the laboratory environment and the use of a finger key press instead of a foot pedal to report response.</p><p>As initially suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, detection at lowerθ values for larger initial distances is predicted by a looming accumulation account, because looming grows more slowly from larger distances, and because accumulation (i.e., integration) of a smallθ over a long time is equivalent to accumulation of a largeθ over a short time; see the shaded areas in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1A.</ref> Similarly, for lower deceleration magnitudes, where looming develops even more slowly, the looming accumulation account also predicts detection at further decreasedθ values. This was the motivation for the inclusion of the 0.35 m/s 2 deceleration condition, and the observedθ values at detection were indeed further reduced for this lower magnitude of deceleration ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1C;</ref> F (1, 3698) = 810.26; p &lt; .0001).</p><p>These behavioral findings strongly reinforce the idea that looming detection occurs at magnitudes of optical expansion rate that are dependent on the kinematics of the collision course, in contrast with the conventional LDT assumption of a situation-independent threshold for detection. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1B illustrates</ref> the response times that would be predicted by a situation-independent looming threshold fixed at the averageθ at detection observed across this experiment. The LDT predictions are too early in fast looming conditions, and too late in slow looming conditions, which is precisely the qualitative pattern of errors that one would expect to see if participants' responses were instead determined by evidence accumulation of optical expansion rate.</p><p>From a methodological point of view it is worth noting that our behavioral analyses also identified statistically significant effects of experimental block (slightly increased looming sensitivity in later blocks) and the 1.5-3.5 s pre-looming wait time (slightly increased looming sensitivity with increased pre-looming wait time). These effects were substantially smaller than the effects of looming condition and between-participant differences (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table II</ref> in S1 Appendix), and were therefore not separated out in the subsequent model fitting described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A visual looming accumulator model accounts for full detection distributions</head><p>As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1B,</ref> the looming accumulation hypothesis can be computationally formalized as a single-boundary accumulator (or drift diffusion) model, with its rate of evidence accumulation (sometimes referred to as "drift rate") at each point in time determined by the momentary optical expansion rate, multiplied by some gain, and where overt detection response occurs once an evidence threshold is reached. Noise in the evidence accumulation process (e.g., due to noisy sensory input, interference from other brain activity, or both) gives rise to variability, i.e., probability distributions of response time. It may be noted that our model, like previous evidence accumulation models of detection of intermittent, subtle changes in abstract stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, effectively implements Page's cumulative sum ('CUSUM') technique for change detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>The conventional LDT assumption is completely deterministic, and as such does not make predictions about probability distributions. However, one might consider a stochastic threshold model, positing that looming detection occurs once a noisy optical expansion rate signal first exceeds a fixed threshold. In fact, such a model would also predict the qualitative findings reported above, since in conditions where looming develops slowly, there would be more time for large noise values to occur by chance, thus eventually exceeding the threshold even if the sensory signal itself is still sub-threshold. We therefore tested also this type of model, and compared it to the accumulator model.  When modelling perceptual decision-making in paradigms with stationary stimulus saliency, it has often been found that assuming between-trial variability of the stationary rate of evidence accumulation is needed to closely reproduce human response time distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Analogously, we investigated an extended version of our basic accumulator model, where the input gain applied to the optical expansion rate was not constant per participant, but instead drawn at random per trial from a normal distribution, of which the standard deviation thus becomes an additional free model parameter. This extended model (model AV) produced distributions that more closely matched those of the human detection responses. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 2B shows</ref> the relative goodness of fit of the three models, in terms of differences in Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).</p><p>These results indicate a very strong preference for the accumulator model over the threshold model for all participants but one, with an average ∆AIC of -43.2 (a difference of more than 14 suggests "very strong support" for the preferred model <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>). This analysis also indicated that for most participants, the additional model complexity introduced by the input gain variability (model AV) was warranted given the The ABC analysis also favored the accumulator model over the threshold model.</p><p>The geometric mean of the per-participant Bayes factor (an estimate of the expected Bayes factor for hypothetical additional participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>) in favor of the accumulator model was 3.0-7.3 ("substantial evidence" <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>), depending on the choice of the ABC distance threshold hyperparameter RT , with the highest Bayes factors for the more As an additional test of this best-performing model, we also examined its predictions in response to variations in pre-looming wait time. As mentioned above, the model-fitting was blind to this experimental manipulation. However, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig</ref>  including a characteristic separation at this peak, with higher CPP amplitudes for the more salient looming conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>; see the dots along the bottom of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3C.</ref> However, the CPP we observe here differs in at least two respects from previous observations. First, the build-up of the CPP has previously been reported to be of similar duration as the overt response times, typically only 100-200 ms shorter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This is consistent with the idea that the CPP reflects evidence accumulation that starts shortly after stimulus presentation. In contrast, average response times per looming condition in our experiment ranged from 1.1 to 2.4 s, yet it is clear from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3C that</ref> the average CPP build-up duration was shorter than 0.5 s for all conditions. Second, since in previous studies CPP increase over ERP baseline has been obvious soon after stimulus onset, conditions with slower responses (typically due to less salient stimuli)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">stringent RT (see Fig V</formula><p>have produced CPP profiles with build-up commencing earlier in time before the overt response <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. In contrast, in our response-locked ERP data, there is no obvious separation between conditions in when the CPP build-up commences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig 3D</head><p>shows that the CPP signal is subtly affected by EEG pre-processing choices (most notably, the 0.1 Hz low-pass filter we used causes a slight suppression to negative (E) Response-locked average accumulated evidence E in each looming condition, for the best-fitting variable-gain accumulator model AV. Note that the model traces converge at the decision threshold E = 1; the exact location of this point in the plot depends on how much of the non-decision time in the model is assumed to be due to sensory and motor delays, respectively. (F) Estimated onsets of the pre-response centroparietal positivity (CPP) relative to the overt detection response, in the four looming conditions. This includes the (17 out of 22) participants for which the CPP onsets could be reliably estimated. The black markers indicate condition means. The intervals plotted in black and gray at the bottom of the panel show, respectively, the maximum observed difference between condition means, and the upper edge of a 95 % confidence interval for this difference. (G) Averaged ("Vincentized") per-participant cumulative density functions (CDFs) of CPP onset time relative to the looming stimulus onset, for the participants and the maximum-likelihood-fitted variable-gain accumulator model. (H) The top panel shows per-participant AIC differences for the T → A and A → AV model comparisons, when fitted to the CPP onset data. The bottom panel shows the total cross-participant sums of AIC differences, with 95 % confidence intervals. Previous studies have indicated that purely behavioral fits of evidence accumulation models can yield model evidence profiles that align qualitatively with the corresponding CPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, but as described above this was not the case here. One possible reason for this could be that our models were flexible enough to achieve good behavioral fits for a range of parameterizations, with a range of widely different evidence build-up May 7, 2021 8/23</p><p>profiles, and that our purely behavioral fits were therefore not enough to observe an alignment between model evidence and recorded CPP signatures. Therefore, using ABC, we investigated whether fitting the models simultaneously to the behavioral and neural data could identify a behaviorally well-fitting model which did not exhibit early separation of accumulated model evidence, thus aligning better with our CPP observations, but no such model was identified; see Fig X in S1 Appendix.</p><p>A different possible explanation for our late, rapid, and seemingly condition-independent CPP could be that (i) the looming accumulation process indicated by the behavioral modeling results is not directly reflected in the CPP, and (ii) the observed CPP instead reflects a second stage of the response decision process, which begins only once the looming accumulation process reaches threshold. To further investigate this hypothesis, we estimated full distributions of CPP onset times from the EEG data, by averaging ERPs over trials with similar response times, to increase signal-to-noise ratio, and identifying the last time where the averaged ERP exceeded 30 % of its value at the overt response. We found that this allowed us to reliably estimate CPP onsets for 17 out of the 22 participants. We then investigated our hypothesis using this dataset in two ways: Firstly, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3F,</ref> we analyzed the distributions of CPP onset time relative to overt response. In line with our hypothesis that the process reflected in our CPP has a duration that is independent of looming condition, we found that the largest difference in the average CPP onset between two conditions was 22 ms (interval marked in black at bottom of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3F)</ref> and that the upper edge of a 95 % confidence interval for this difference was 79 ms (interval marked in gray). In other words, any effect of looming condition on CPP onset relative to detection response was small in magnitude (and not statistically significant in our dataset;</p><p>F (3, 377) = 1.94; p = .133). Secondly, we refitted, using MLE, the threshold and accumulator models to the estimated CPP onsets instead of to the overt responses. We found that the accumulator models could account well for the distributions of CPP onset, and reliably better than the threshold model; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figs</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results presented here support four main conclusions. First, that human collision threat detection occurs at optical expansion rates that are highly dependent on the kinematics of the collision scenario. We replicate the previously observed effect of initial obstacle distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, and additionally demonstrate an effect of obstacle acceleration, predicted by our looming accumulation hypothesis. Taken together with the mentioned previous literature, our findings strongly refute the LDT assumption, i.e., the assumption of a single, kinematics-independent threshold for looming detection. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1A,</ref> this conventional assumption can yield estimated detection times that are incorrect by several seconds. We therefore caution against further use of the LDT assumption, not least in the applied context of road traffic safety, where it has influenced research, recommendations, and legal proceedings <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">May 7, 2021 9/23</formula><p>Second, we show that not only the qualitative patterns of kinematics-dependency, but also full probability distributions of collision threat detection can be explained by an evidence accumulation model, assuming that the optical expansion rate information is integrated over time, with noise, up to a threshold at which detection is reported. We thus provide a computational account of how humans perform collision threat detection, which explains both average tendency and precise patterns of variability in performance.</p><p>From an applied perspective, the accumulator models proposed here can be considered as an alternative to the LDT assumption. It should be noted, however, that the focus here was on investigating human ability of collision threat detection in a controlled laboratory experiment, rather than to provide and validate a model for applied use. Third, we provide strong support for the idea that established evidence accumulation models of decision-making can be extended beyond typical laboratory paradigms with static or intermittently changing abstract stimuli, to tasks with ecologically relevant, continuously time-varying sensory evidence, directly using the externally measurable stimulus as an input to the evidence accumulation. We and others have reported that evidence accumulation models show promise for modelling decisions in real-world tasks, e.g., when to apply brakes in response to a developing collision threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, or on whether and when to cross a road with oncoming traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. However, in these contexts it has not been possible to fit full response time probability distributions per participant, a minimum expectation in evidence accumulation modeling of more typical, abstract laboratory tasks. Drugowitsch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> provided compelling support for evidence accumulation decision-making in their visual-vestibular heading discrimination paradigm, but did not emphasize detailed fits of response distributions. <ref type="bibr">Ratcliff and</ref> Strayer achieved this level of model-fitting stringency in a driving setting, but did so by using a paradigm of speeded response to discrete stimuli, thus abstracting away from the continuously time-varying nature of the real-world driving task <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>. Our looming detection paradigm was instead chosen to enable similarly rigorous model analyses of an ecologically relevant, continuously time-varying stimulus. It is notable that, among our alternative models, the accumulator model with between-trial variability in input gain (model AV) performed best for a majority of participants. For static input evidence, (i.e.,θ = constant, in our case), this input gain variability reduces to between-trial variability in a static accumulation rate, a very common assumption in past modeling work, with much empirical support <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Our results thus demonstrate how this model assumption for static evidence paradigms can be usefully generalized to paradigms with time-varying evidence. Our paradigm and models may provide useful starting points for further research into decision making with continuously time-varying evidence, both in other sensory detection tasks (cf., e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>) as well as in sensorimotor control tasks of basic or applied nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, in contrast with previous studies on the CPP signature, we show that in our paradigm the late onset of the CPP, rather than a build-up rate present from early on after stimulus presentation, can be explained by evidence accumulation. The existing literature features several paradigms that are similar to ours in tasking participants with detecting low-saliency changes in sustained stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, for example in the form of gradual changes in visual contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, following time courses not dissimilar to the looming trajectories studied here ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 1A)</ref>. These studies and others have provided converging evidence for the notion that the CPP source (i.e., the neural circuits giving rise to the CPP signature; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>) is involved in (or connected to) an early, sustained, and saliency-dependent accumulation of evidence for the decision to respond <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Our behavioral modeling results support this type of evidence accumulation account of looming detection, yet the CPP in our paradigm is late, rapid, and without a clear effect of stimulus saliency on its duration. We did not hypothesize in advance that our CPP results would differ from previous findings in this way. For this reason, and because the CPP onset analyses we performed here were simple and exploratory in nature, we are unable to draw any firm conclusions about the underlying reasons for the nature of our CPP signatures. However, one seemingly plausible hypothesis would be that a key factor is our use of an ecologically relevant stimulus, specifically visual looming, known to be processed in phylogenetically old subcortical brain structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Aligning with findings in non-human species <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans has implicated structures such as the superior colliculus and the medial pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus in processing of visual looming <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. These structures play important roles in attentional orientating <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, and have cortical projections circumventing early visual areas, for example to the middle temporal (MT) visual area, known to be involved in processing of motion cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. In a general sense, this difference in connectivity may play a role in why our ERP results stand out. More specifically, both our behavioral and CPP results can be understood if it is assumed that the pathways for looming processing include neural circuits implementing evidence accumulation detection of collision threats, from which only the decision outcome (threat detected or not) is communicated onward to the CPP source, which then carries out a rapid, second-stage evidence accumulation, implementing the higher-level, modality-general decision of mapping stimulus to response in the task at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This tentative 'two-accumulator' hypothesis would explain why the onset distributions of the late and rapid CPP in our data can be well accounted for by a looming accumulation model. In the Supplementary Information we provide a computational formulation of this hypothesis and illustrate how it might explain also the at-response CPP separation between looming conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 3C; Fig XI in S1</ref> Appendix). The two-accumulator hypothesis is interesting not least in light of findings that the CPP correlates with subjectively reported experience of the perceptual decision being formed <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. From this perspective, the late CPP signatures in our data suggest the empirically testable hypothesis that visual looming evidence accumulation (before CPP onset) occurs with near-zero subjective awareness or confidence. This would align well with conventional notions of an early perceptual limitation on looming detectability, but recasting the limitation as an evidence accumulation decision process instead of a perceptual threshold.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>The objective of the experiment was to observe participants' detection of a visually looming object, to what extent this detection was influenced by the kinematical details of the object's approach, and whether traces of the response process could be observed in participant scalp potentials. All procedures were approved by the School of Psychology Research Ethics Committee, University of Leeds, reference number PSC-484.</p><p>The basic task was a computer-simulated replication and extension of the foveal looming conditions of the test track experiment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The paradigm was implemented in MathWorks MATLAB using PsychToolbox v3.0.14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>. The participants viewed the stimulus screen at a distance of 1.00 m, meaning that each screen pixel subtended a visual angle of 0.95 arcmin (0.016 degrees), lower than the 1.6 arcmin threshold reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> for maximum Vernier acuity with antialiased stimuli. To further reduce the risk of pixel effects, and to mimic the conditions of the replicated test track experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, the stimulus was displayed with small horizontal and vertical oscillatory perturbation throughout, generated by moving the simulated viewport as if the participant themselves were sitting in a car, with perturbation spectra </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants provided written informed consent before taking part in the experiment, which was carried out in a dark room with the participant sitting in front of the stimulus display, supported by a chin rest. In a first demonstration block of four trials, the experimenter demonstrated the task, including the auditory tone given upon incorrect, early responses, as well as a feedback screen that was shown after each block. This feedback screen listed average response times and frequency of correct responses for all blocks so far, and encouraged participants to rest if their response times were increasing. The participants then decided themselves when to start the next block. The participants first completed a practice block of 12 trials, two of each of the four looming conditions (2 initial distances × 2 acceleration levels), and four catch trials. Then followed the five experimental blocks, each with a total of 48 trials, eight catch trials and ten repetitions of each of the four looming conditions (two repetitions for each of the five pre-looming wait times), making for a total of 5 × 40 = 200 looming trials per participant, 50 for each looming condition. Trial order was fully randomized per block and participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The target initial sample size was twenty-five participants, to provide a comfortable margin over the total number of trials collected in previous studies reporting on the CPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Twenty-six right-handed participants were recruited from a local pool of participants, all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and with no history of psychiatric diagnosis, severe brain injury, motor diseases or any skin conditions. EEG recording was incomplete for one participant, and data from the remaining twenty-five participants, of ages between 20 and 46 years (mean 26.5), 12 male and 13 female, were retained for further analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data acquisition and preprocessing</head><p>Behavioral responses were recorded at the 60 Hz refresh rate of the display screen. Out of the 25 × 40 = 1000 catch trials, there were 61 (6.1 %) with false detection responses. The catch trials were not further considered in the analyses or modeling. Out of the 25 × 200 = 5000 trials with looming stimuli, participants responded before looming onset in 32 trials (0.6 %), and non-responses were observed in 8 trials (0.2 %); these early and non-responses were included in the behavioral model fits, but were excluded from all EEG analyses. analysis, the EEG data of looming trials were divided into epochs from 1 s before to 8 s after the looming onset in each trial (sufficient to include all responses in all conditions given the 0.03 rad/s trial expiry threshold mentioned above), and the EEG data for each epoch were baseline-corrected, using the average of the last 200 ms before the looming onset as baseline. Then, the five channels centered on Pz mentioned above were averaged to yield the final signal used in the CPP analyses (per-condition averages across participants shown in panels B and C of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3;</ref> per-condition averages per participants shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig VII of S1 Appendix)</ref>. The analysis illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3C was</ref> also rerun after disabling the 0.1 Hz EEG high-pass filter and the ICA ocular artefact removal, confirming that neither of these two preprocessing steps substantially altered the obtained CPP signatures; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3D</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig VI in S1</ref> Appendix.</p><p>For the analyses which focused specifically on the onset of the CPP, we increased the signal to noise ratio by sorting trials on response time per participant and looming condition, separating the sorted trials into groups of five trials, and taking the average response-locked ERP within each such group. We then identified the CPP onset for each averaged trial as the last sample where the averaged response-locked ERP was less than 30 % of its value at the overt response. We excluded averaged trials where this did not occur within 1 s before the response, or where the ERP at response was less than +2 µV, resulting in a total exclusion of 284 (37.4 %) out of the 760 averaged trials. 134 of these exclusions were due to five participants, who distinguished themselves from the rest either by having no clear ERP peak at response (Cohen's d &lt; 0.3 when comparing ERP between 0.5 s before response and at response) or by the at-response peak occurring at close to zero voltage; see Fig VII in S1 Appendix. These five participants were excluded from the CPP onset analyses, leaving a data set of 17 participants and 445 averaged trials (an average of 26 per participant). Since our CPP onset estimation method was novel, and not originally planned for, we also conducted sensitivity analyses. As illustrated in Figs VI and VIII of S1 Appendix, these analyses showed that the obtained CPP onset estimates were robust to variations in the parameters of our method, but also that our method was not suitable for use on non high-pass filtered ERP data. Future work should improve on these onset estimation methods, for example along the lines of the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>To test for effects of the kinematical looming conditions on the optical expansion rate at behavioral detection response, we carried out a repeated-measures ANOVA, implemented using MATLAB's anovan function with participant as a random factor, independent variables initial car distance (2 levels) × acceleration magnitude (2 levels) × experimental block (5 levels) × pre-looming wait time (5 levels), limited to first-order interactions only, and log(θ) as the dependent variable; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table II</ref> in S1 Appendix for full results. To study separation between response-locked ERPs for different looming conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figs 3C and D)</ref>, we performed ANOVAs at 20 ms intervals, with the response-locked ERP as the dependent variable, participant as a random factor, and looming condition (4 levels) as independent variable. We also performed this type of ANOVA to test for an effect of looming condition on CPP onset relative response <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig 3F)</ref>. The 95 % confidence intervals in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3F and 3H</ref> were obtained by 100,000 sample bootstraps from the empirical data in question.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational models</head><p>The optical expansion rate accumulator models investigated here can be described by the following discrete update equation for the accumulated evidence E at time step i:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E(i) = max 0, E(i − 1) +Kθ(i)∆t + σν(i) √ ∆t ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>whereK is an accumulation gain parameter either drawn at random per trial from a normal distribution N (K, σ K ) with σ K as a free parameter (model AV), or kept constant per participant (σ K = 0; model A), ∆t is the discrete simulation time step length, and the final term is a discrete implementation of a Wiener process with noise intensity σ, with ν(i) drawn at random per time step from a standard normal distribution N (0, 1). Note that we included a reflecting lower boundary at zero (the max function), as often done for evidence accumulators with a single decision boundary <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92]</ref>. The optical expansion rateθ(i) is the time derivative of the optical size of the collision obstacle (here, the lead vehicle):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">θ(i) = 2 arctan W 2D(i) ⇒θ(i) = W V (i) D 2 (i) + W 2 /4<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where W and D(i) are the width of and momentary distance to the collision obstacle, and V (i) is the momentary speed at which it is coming closer <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The accumulator model makes a detection decision once E(i) ≥ 1 (E is in arbitrary units, so one of decision threshold, K, or σ can be fixed without loss of generality) overtly responding a non-decision time T ND later. A fraction α ND = 0.3 of T ND was assumed to occur before the evidence accumulation, based on <ref type="bibr">[29, p. 189]</ref>; this value did not affect the behavioral model fits or comparisons, only model evidence visualizations like the one in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3E.</ref> For a description of the other accumulator model variants that were also tested, see the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supporting Information.</head><p>The stochastic threshold model investigated here (model T) can be written on a similar form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E(i) =θ (i) θ d + σν(i),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>again with overt detection response a time T ND after E(i) ≥ 1, i.e., the parameterθ d is the looming detection threshold parameter. Note that the estimated value of σ for this model will depend on the discrete simulation time step length; we used ∆t = 0.02 s across all models. The models were simulated from the start of each trial, i.e., the pre-looming wait time was also simulated, and the accumulator models were initialised at E = 0 for each trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fitting by Approximate Bayesian Computation</head><p>Our main goal of ABC was parameter estimation rather than model selection, so we used relatively broad, non-informative priors. To make the obtained Bayes Factors reasonably meaningful, and for increased computational efficiency, we identified approximate limits for the model priors by means of a first ABC fit to the information available from the previous test track experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>; see Supplementary Material for details. We then fitted each model variant (T, A, AV, etc) to each participant separately. To implement ABC rejection sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>, for each parameterization sampled at random from the prior distribution, we generated a simulated data set of the exact same nature and size as the data obtained from one human participant, (same number of repetitions, pre-looming wait times, etc.) and calculated and stored a set of twenty summary statistics; the response time quantiles {0.1, 0. of the four looming conditions separately. We then compared the simulated RT quantiles to each human participant's data, for each participant retaining only parameter samples where all twenty absolute differences between simulated and observed RT quantiles were below a rejection threshold RT . These retained samples provide an approximation of the posterior parameter distribution for the participant <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>. There are several more advanced versions of ABC than this basic rejection sampling algorithm, but this method was preferred here because it allowed us to obtain individual per-participant fits without extra simulations of the model (which is the computationally costly step), and because it made computationally feasible the investigations illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig V of S1 Appendix,</ref> showing that the ABC model comparisons were robust to the choice of the hyperparameter RT . In the Supporting Information we also describe how we used ABC to jointly fit both our behavioral and neural data, finding that excessive model flexibility was not the reason for the mismatch between our CPP observations and our behavioral models' evidence traces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fitting by maximum likelihood estimation</head><p>Maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters was carried out using exhaustive grid search over the model parameter ranges identified by the abovementioned initial ABC fits to the previous test track experiment, with each parameter's range uniformly divided into 20 searched grid values. For each parameterization in this grid, as in the ABC fits a replica of the real experiment was simulated, but upscaled by a factor 20 to 1000 trials per looming condition yielding a numerical response time distribution per condition, estimated at a bin size of 0.25 s. For these fits, all models were also extended by assuming a probability P C = 0.01 (our conclusions were robust to variations in this value) per trial of 'contaminant' responses poorly described by our model, e.g., due to temporary lapses in participant attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, modeled as a uniform distribution across the time range from looming onset to trial expiry. (Whereas our ABC fitting method is robust to such contaminant responses, they can disrupt the MLE fits if they fall in low probability response time bins, which may occasionally be numerically estimated to zero probability by the contaminant-free model.) Likelihoods were then estimated from the resulting numerical probability distributions, per participant and model parameterization. This model fitting method was computationally feasible for models with up to four free parameters (T, A, AV, AG, AL); based on the results from the ABC fits we would not expect to see substantial further improvements with the more complex models.</p><p>Supporting information S1 Appendix.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus perturbation</head><p>In the test track experiment reproduced here <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, small lateral oscillations and vertical vibration of especially the participant's own vehicle would have caused slight movement of the visual angle to the lead vehicle in the participant's field of view, making the looming detection task somewhat more challenging <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. To mimic this effect in our paradigm, and also to further reduce any risk of pixel effects in our stimulus display, we introduced small random perturbations to the horizontal and vertical position of the stimulus image, computed as if arising from perturbations of the participant's viewpoint. These viewpoint perturbations were generated by passing white noise from a uniform distribution through digital Butterworth bandpass filters designed as specified in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table I</ref>, and scaled to the 95th percentile absolute amplitudes also listed in the table. The filter parameters for the horizontal and vertical perturbations were based on vehicle oscillation frequency spectra reported in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, respectively. Initially we attempted using naturalistic values also for the amplitudes, but this resulted in subjectively excessive perturbations (possibly due to the lack of associated vestibular sensory perturbation), why the amplitudes were manually scaled until deemed subjectively appropriate by the researchers. Behavioral ANOVA <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table II</ref> provides the full results of the main behavioral ANOVA on the log-transformed optical expansion rate ̇ at participant response. Besides the between-participant differences, it is clear from the partial eta squared ( 2 ) that the two hypothesized main effects of initial car distance and acceleration magnitude explain most of the variance in the data. We will not discuss the full table of results here, but from a methodological point of view it is worth noting that there were small but statistically significant effects of experimental block and pre-looming wait time. The former was a minor (relative to the effects of initial distance and acceleration magnitude) increase in looming sensitivity over time, with mean ̇ at response of 0.00213 rad/s and 0.00197 rad/s in the first and fifth blocks, respectively. The latter is discussed further below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approximate priors from the test track study results</head><p>To obtain reasonable initial model parameter ranges for both the ABC and MLE model fits, we performed a first ABC fit of each model to the information available from the Lamble et al. test track study <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>; specifically their observed mean ̇ at detection for the two looming conditions with 0.7 m/s 2 lead vehicle deceleration, and the width of the corresponding confidence intervals (the latter approximately estimated from their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure  4</ref>). We used the same basic rejection sampling algorithm as described for the main model fits in Materials and Methods, running 300,000 simulated replications of the test track experiment per model, drawing from wide uniform priors. We rejected ABC samples for which any of the four normalized deviations ( sim − obs )/ obs between simulation and observation of the mean ̇ or its confidence interval width was greater than 0.5, or for which there was more than 5 % premature looming detection responses in either of the looming conditions (Lamble et al. do not mention observing any such early responses). The equal-tailed 95 % credible intervals of the posterior distributions obtained in this way were expanded in both directions by 50 % of their width (but limited to positive values), to obtain the parameter ranges that we then used in the main model fits, to bound the uniform ABC priors and the MLE grid search. The reasons we adopted these relatively permissive ABC distance metric thresholds and the subsequent widening of the credible intervals were that (i) we were not certain how similar behavior would be between the test track and laboratory paradigms, and (ii) the test track means were averages across participants, whereas we wanted to fit our models to individual participants, so we needed to allow for between-participant variability. The final values of the hyperparameters mentioned above were arrived at by some trial and error to avoid obvious truncation of the main ABC or MLE model fits; the conclusions reported in this paper were robust to these hyperparameter variations. Examples of the adopted priors can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig II,</ref> as the ranges within which the posterior distributions are plotted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of pre-looming wait time on collision threat detection</head><p>As mentioned above, the behavioral ANOVA identified a statistically significant effect of pre-looming wait time (the time delay of 1.5-3.5 s between appearance of the lead vehicle and its deceleration onset) on the optical expansion rate at detection response.

However, as described in Materials and Methods, the goodness of fit of the models was tested by comparing observed and model distributions per looming condition, thus pooling across the pre-looming wait times. In other words, the models were not fitted to reproduce the pre-looming wait time effect. However, as can be seen in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. III</ref>, model AV did nevertheless reproduce this effect rather closely, including the hint of an interaction with looming condition (a non-significant trend in our behavioral analyses; <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table II</ref>). The reason model AV exhibits this behavior is that before looming onset (while ̇= 0) it will accumulate some noise, and with longer pre-looming wait times it is more likely to randomly be close to the decision threshold once looming begins increasing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative model variants</head><p>In addition to the looming accumulator model variants mentioned in the main text, defined as in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>, we also tested a number of other accumulator models, based on the following more general formulation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">( ) = max (0, ( − 1) + [− 1 ( ) +̃(( ) −̇)] Δ + ( )√Δ ),<label>(S1)</label></formula><p>where is a leakage (memory decay) time parameter and ̇ is a gating threshold on the sensory input, essentially preventing accumulation of looming evidence until ( ) &gt;̇, since we constrain ( ) ≥ 0. Note that with large and ̇= 0, Equation (S1) reduces to Equation <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>.</p><p>Using MLE, we tested models AG and AL with just the gating and leakage assumptions added beyond the basic accumulator model, but as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. IV</ref> neither of them provided better fits of the data than the AV model (AIC positive for all participants, as seen in panel B). We further investigated these alternative accumulator models using ABC, with which it was computationally feasible to also test even more complex model variants, obtained by further combining the assumptions of gain variability, gating, and leakage. for the comparison between models A and across different values of the ABC distance threshold RT . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. V</ref> shows only model comparisons for which at least 15 participants had at least 100 non-rejected ABC samples; for RT &lt; 0.3 s this was true for no model comparison. It can be noted that even though the obtained Bayes factors varied with RT , the ordering of the models was robust to the choice of RT . The ABC fits align with the MLE fits in ordering AV above AL, and AL above AG. Overall, both the MLE and ABC results provide rather compelling evidence against the inclusion of gating in the accumulator model; this can be taken as a further argument against the assumption that fixed sensory thresholds play a role in collision threat detection. The results are somewhat less clear with respect to the leakage assumption. The MLE results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.</ref> IV do suggest that model AV is preferable to model AL, but given what was already mentioned in the main text about our broad ABC priors potentially over-penalizing model complexity, we would not strongly argue that model AV is also preferable to model AVL based on the results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. V</ref>. Conversely, however, our model comparison clearly does not provide evidence for favoring AVL over AV. In fact, also our finding that looming sensitivity increased with pre-looming wait time <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. III)</ref> could be taken as indirect evidence against leakage playing a strong role in this paradigm, since leakage counteracts the type of pre-looming accumulation of noise that was discussed above. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of EEG preprocessing choices on ERPs and CPP onset estimates</head><p>To eliminate concerns that the obtained CPP signature might have arisen from excessive filtering of low EEG frequencies or excessive exclusion of ICA components as ocular artefacts, the ERP analyses were rerun without these processing steps. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. VI</ref> illustrates the impact of just the 0.1 Hz high-pass filter (compare panels A and C of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig VI)</ref> and of the ICA-based ocular artefact removal (compare <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig VI.</ref>A vs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3C in the main text)</ref>. The ocular artefact removal reduces the overall amplitude of the ERP somewhat, seemingly due to the presence of time-varying within-trial eye artefacts, i.e., on the same time scale as the CPP. The high-pass filter introduces a slight suppression into negative voltages before the CPP build-up commences. However, it is clear that neither of these EEG preprocessing steps change the qualitative aspect of the response-locked CPP signature; it remains late, rapid, and without a clear effect of looming condition on CPP duration.</p><p>Panels B and D of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. VI</ref> show the results of applying the same CPP onset estimation algorithm as described in the main text to these differently pre-processed ERP data. Removing the high-pass filter (panel D) introduces a small but noticeable separation in the CPP onsets between looming conditions (74 ms maximum difference between condition means, with upper edge of 95 % confidence interval at 136 ms). On closer inspection, however, all or most of this effect arguably seems to be artefactual in nature, deriving from our CPP onset estimation method, which defines CPP onset as occurring when the ERP last exceeds 30 % of the ERP amplitude at response, an amplitude which in turn is strongly dependent on looming condition, thus effectively setting the onset threshold at different voltages for the different conditions. We adopted this method because it is simple, allows estimation of CPP onset regardless of the at-response ERP in the specific trial, and since with the high-pass filter's suppression of the ERP into negative voltages before CPP build-up, 30 % of the positive ERP peak occurs at a point in time where the ERP is changing rapidly, such that there is little impact on the onset estimation of the between-condition difference in CPP onset threshold. Without the high-pass filter, this between-condition difference in threshold makes a more noticeable difference. Panel E in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig VI shows</ref> the results of alternatively defining CPP onset as occurring at 30 % of the average ERP at response across all trials for the participant in question, i.e., with the same threshold for all trials. This method does indeed yield smaller differences between looming conditions (35 ms maximum difference between means, with upper edge of 95 % confidence interval at 106 ms), but as expected the estimated distributions are no longer well-formed, due to ERP being below threshold at the response itself on many trials.</p><p>Overall, it may be argued that while the high-pass filter distorts the visual aspect of the CPP signal somewhat, this filtering is useful for estimating the CPP onsets. Future work should improve on these methods, to allow non-biased CPP onset estimation also without prior high-pass filtering. Crucially, however, it should be noted that even if the results shown in panel D of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig VI are</ref> taken at face value, they can still not be seen as suggesting that the CPP signal in our paradigm aligns with the evidence signal in our behavioral model, since the 74 ms difference between conditions in panel D is still an order of magnitude smaller than the 1.3 s maximum between-condition difference in response times. (Also, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig IX.</ref>B, using these CPP onsets for model fitting does not change the conclusions from the comparison between models predicting CPP onset.)  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3D in</ref> the main text, i.e., response-locked ERPs without both 0.1 Hz high-pass filtering and ICA ocular artefact removal. (D) CPP onsets obtained using the same method as previously, from the ERP data shown in panel C of this figure.

For participant emlq this was due to the peak ERPs at response occurring near or below baseline levels, for the other four of these participants there was no noticeable CPP peak (low effect size in ERP amplitude change during the last 500 ms before response). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig VIII shows</ref> the result of a further sensitivity analysis of the CPP onset estimation method, testing all combinations of (i) the number of sorted trials averaged across, varied in {3, 5, 7}, (ii) the minimum at-response ERP required for inclusion of such an averaged trial, varied in {0.15, 0.2, 0.25} V, and (iii) the fraction of at-response ERP at which the CPP was estimated as having its onset, varied in {25, 30, 35} %. The figure shows that the CPP onset estimation method was robust to these parameter variations, in the sense that the same five excluded participants mentioned above consistently caused around half of the exclusions of averaged ERP trials (panel A), and the estimated CPP onset occurred close in time to the overt response (panel B), with small differences between looming conditions (panel C). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3G</ref> and H by illustrating the results of MLE-fitting also models T and A to the CPP onset distributions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. IX.B</ref> shows the results of MLE-fitting the same models to the CPP onset distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. VI</ref>.D, to show that even if taking these-as explained above arguably biased-CPP onset estimates at face value, the conclusions from the model comparison remain unchanged.    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3G</ref>, but also showing results for models T and A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. IX.A complements</head><p>We wanted to ascertain whether there existed parameterizations of the accumulator models which could achieve good fits of our behavioral data, while at the same time also exhibiting evidence build-up profiles more similar to our CPP observations, where onset and between-condition separation occurred late in the trial. We therefore extended our perparticipant ABC fits with an additional distance metric: For each observed or modelsimulated trial we took the response-locked build-up profile ( ), either the response locked ERP or model evidence ( ). In the latter case, we needed to determine how much of the non-decision time ND to allocate to early sensory and late neuromuscular delays, respectively; we therefore introduced an additional model parameter ND representing the fraction of ND occurring before the evidence accumulation, with a uniform prior in [0, 1]. We then calculated the grand mean ̅ R of ( ) across all trials, in the last 100 ms before the overt response, to quantify the grand-average at-response peak amplitude. For each condition we calculated the mean of ( ) for trials in condition , in the interval 400-700 ms before response, and calculated the fraction = ̅ ,0 / ̅ , to quantify the amount of early build-up in condition . We then extended our ABC rejection sampler to retain model parameterizations for which not only the previously described RT threshold criterion was achieved, but also where the difference between observed and modelsimulated was smaller than a threshold for all looming conditions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. X</ref> shows the results of purely behavioral fits ( = ∞) of model AVL for RT at 0.4 and 0.8, as well as fits where we progressively reduced from 0.8 in steps of 0.1, to find the smallest for which at least 100 ABC samples were retained. Included here are only the 17 participants who showed clear CPP profiles as described above, minus a further exclusion of two participants for which 100 ABC samples were not retained with ( RT = 0.4, = ∞); more permissive inclusion criteria yielded similar results. It is clear from the figure that the looming accumulator model is not able to achieve the type of late build-up profile observed in our CPP data, not even when setting a permissive behavioral threshold RT = 0.8, at which the response time fits become noticeably corrupted. We are showing the AVL model here since it is the most complex of the models with good behavioral fits, and thus the model with best chances of being flexible enough to also account for the neural data. The corresponding figure for model AV is very similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. X.   Fig. X</ref>: Testing the accumulator model's ability to also account for the neural observations. "Vincentised" cumulative distributions of detection response time (top panels) and normalised grand averages of observed response-locked ERP and model evidence ( ), for ABC fits of model AVL. Looming conditions are colour coded as in the figures in the main text. The leftmost and rightmost two columns show fits obtained with the ABC distance threshold for response times set to RT = 0.4 s and RT = 0.8 s, respectively. In the fits shown in the second and fourth columns, also a threshold was imposed, for a metric quantifying the distance between the model evidence trace and the observed ERPs.</p><p>Panel A in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. XI</ref> illustrates a hypothetical two-stage accumulation process which could possibly explain both our behavioral and neural observations. The looming evidence integrated in the looming accumulator model ( ) ↦ ( ), corresponding to the computational models proposed in this paper, is passed, after thresholding, to a second accumulator which decides on the overt response. Panel B in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. XI</ref> shows, as crossparticipant averages per looming condition, the result of taking the evidence ( ) in the MLE-fitted model AV, passing it through a logistic sigmoid threshold centered at ( ) = 1, i.e., 1/(1 + − ( ( )−1) ), with = 20, and then subjecting the output of this thresholding to a second integration to yield a second evidence quantity ′( ). As can be seen, ′( ) shows similar condition-independent late onset and condition-dependent separation in at-response amplitude (and hence also in build-up rate) as we observed for the CPP in our paradigm. This type of model can of course be tested formally, but is substantially more complex (at least and a separate decision threshold are needed as free parameters, and possibly also a separate noise intensity); therefore such an investigation is left outside of the scope here. As mentioned in the main text, separations in CPP peak amplitude at overt response has been previously reported, between experimental conditions of different saliency <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. This separation has been suggested to arise either due to interference from motor preparation-related negative potentials at frontocentral electrodes <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> or due to continued evidence accumulation after the decision threshold has been reached, before feedback on the motor execution has been fed back to the CPP source <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>; the model evidence traces in the lower panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3C provide</ref> an illustration of this latter idea. This post-decision separation in ( ) between conditions in the looming accumulator, fed through the sigmoidal threshold, is what causes the separation in ′( ) seen in panel B of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. XI</ref>. However, the two-stage model as such does not fundamentally imply at-response separation in accumulated evidence; e.g., for lower values of the model predicts small or no such separation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.

All considered models were fitted per participant, both using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), to the per-participant response time distributions in each looming condition.

The original image was at higher resolution than shown on screen, and was scaled to appropriate size and displayed with antialiasing using the OpenGL trilinear filtering provided by PsychToolbox.A central fixation target (a red dot, diameter 6 pixels, 0.095 degrees visual angle) was displayed throughout each experimental block. In each trial, initially only this fixation target was shown for 3 s, then the stimulus image appeared centrally on the screen, accompanied by an auditory tone, displayed at a size corresponding to an initial distance of either 20 or 40 m (subtending 5.30 and 2.65 degrees horizontal visual angle, respectively). Some trials were catch trials without any looming, at which the stimulus remained at the same size for 7 s before disappearing. In non-catch trials, the stimulus remained at the same size during an initial pre-looming wait time, one of 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 s, whereafter the size of the stimulus was gradually increased to reproduce the looming visual input from a car decelerating at either 0.35 or 0.7 m/s 2 ; as shown inFig 1A.The participants were instructed to keep their eyes on the fixation target, refrain from blinking while the car was being shown and until their response, which they were instructed to give by pressing the space bar on a computer keyboard with their right hand "as soon as you see the car coming closer, in other words when it is growing on the screen". Trials terminated once participants either (a) made a correct looming detection response, after which the stimulus continued looming for another 0.5 s before disappearing, to avoid the impact of this visual transient interfering with the EEG measurements at time of response, (b) made no response before the looming stimulus had reached a trial expiry threshold of 0.03 rad/s (about ten times the threshold typically stated in the literature), or (c) made an incorrect, early detection response before the onset of visual looming; in this last case a distinct auditory tone was played to inform the participant of their incorrect detection response.</figDesc></figure>

Another interesting question for future work is whether these improved models of collision threat detection (which as mentioned above effectively implement a change detection algorithm which is optimal under certain assumptions<ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>) can support improved models of collision avoidance response. In the road traffic context, some existing models of collision avoidance response suggest that detection and response are separate and sequential steps<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>, whereas other accounts suggest that defensive responses are instead driven directly by kinematical urgency, without a clear role for a first, separate step of detection<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

EEG preprocessing was done using EEGLAB v14.1.1<ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>, first resampling to 512 Hz, then using the PREP pipeline EEGLAB plugin v0.55.3<ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> for robust re-referencing to average channel and interpolation of noisy channels. PREP interpolated one of the five channels analyzed as part of the pre-response positivity analyses here (Pz and surrounding channels CPz, POz, P1, P2) for only three participants (one of which was later excluded due to ocular artefacts; see below), in each case only one of the five channels was interpolated. Then, bandpass filtering was done using EEGLAB's sinc FIR filter with a Kaiser window, with pass/stopband ripple of 0.001, lowpass filter of with 45 Hz cut-off and 5 Hz transition bandwidth, and high-pass filtering at 0.1 Hz cut-off with 1 Hz bandwidth. participants, who therefore failed to reach a minimum of at least 30 trials in each looming condition. These three participants were excluded from further analysis. Further ocular artefacts were identified and removed from the EEG data per participant, using EEGLAB's independent component analysis (ICA) functionality. The final dataset included 22 participants with a total of 4013 looming trials, i.e., an average of 46 trials per participant and looming condition.
