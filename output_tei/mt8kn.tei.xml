			<abstract>
				<p>Contagion is the belief that an entity&apos;s invisible or essential qualities can be transferred to a target. Researchers studying contagion have often distinguished between physical contagion (the perceived transfer of germs, toxins, and pathogens) and spiritual contagion (the perceived transfer of metaphysical properties such as spirits, essence, and moral characteristics). While sensitivity to physical contagion is a component of several existing scales, to date, there are no scales that measure sensitivity to spiritual contagion. Here, we develop and validate a measure of Spiritual Contagion Sensitivity (SCS), which considers positive, negative, and neutral aspects of spiritual contagion. We demonstrate discriminant validity from existing measures of physical contagion sensitivity, such as perceived vulnerability to disease and disgust sensitivity (Study 1). We demonstrate construct validity by showing the correlation between SCS and a variety of published findings in the literature for which spiritual contagion beliefs have been hypothesized to play a role (Study 2). Finally, we demonstrate predictive utility of the SCS scale by showing significant moderation of spiritual contagion effects from the literature (Studies 3A-3C).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many of the things that can harm us, such as germs or toxins, are invisible to the naked eye. A belief in contagion-the notion that an entity's invisible or essential qualities can be transferred to a target-serves to track and avoid such contaminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Nemeroff &amp; Rozin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rozin et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rozin &amp; Nemeroff, 2002)</ref>. However, as was documented over 100 years ago <ref type="bibr">(Frazer, 1936</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frazer, /2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mauss, 1902</ref><ref type="bibr">Mauss, /2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tylor, 1871)</ref>, it is common for contagion beliefs to arise in contexts that do not immediately involve harmful microbes or toxins. For example, in several cultures it was believed that a person's physical residues (e.g., hair, fingernail clipping) contained their essence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Frazer, 1922</ref><ref type="bibr">(Frazer, /1990</ref>. People in many cultures endorse the belief that one may acquire the properties of the animals or materials they ingest <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Nemeroff &amp; Rozin, 1989)</ref>. Even North-American undergraduates refuse to wear a sweater worn by a "creepy person" because the sweater itself is seen as tainted and creepy <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Nemeroff &amp; Rozin, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Contagion beliefs involve four central components: a source, a target, a contaminant (i.e., the thing or property that is transferred from the source to the target), and a means of contamination. In this paper, we focus on a distinction between sensitivities to different types of contaminants. Specifically, we distinguish between sensitivities to physical contagion and sensitivities to spiritual contagion <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Huang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nemeroff &amp; Rozin, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Physical contagion sensitivity is sensitivity to the transfer of physical contaminants (e.g., pathogens, germs, toxins, and other harmful, disgusting, or aversive agents; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nemeroff &amp; Rozin, 1994</ref>). People may be sensitive to the transfer of these contaminants even when they are aware that there is little potential for harm. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rozin et al. (1986)</ref> showed that Americans rejected orange juice that had been in brief contact with a dead, sterilized cockroach, even though they understood that the drink was safe to consume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>SPIRITUAL <ref type="bibr">CONTAGION SENSITIVITY 4</ref> In contrast, spiritual contagion sensitivity is sensitivity to the transfer of metaphysical contaminants (e.g., spirits, essence, abilities, the moral characteristics of a source). For example, adults refuse to try on a sweater if they believe that it once belonged to a serial killer or Adolf Hitler <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Rozin et al., 1986)</ref>. In such cases, the contaminant is not anything physical that could potentially cause harm; rather, the contaminant is something immaterial in nature-the person's immoral character, or spiritual "cooties." Spiritual contagion sensitivity does not merely arise from participants' desires to communicate their own moral beliefs about the source in question.</p><p>For example, people prefer to wear gloves when handling a morally tainted object, even if they would so in private <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fedotova &amp; Rozin, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Beyond the nature of the contaminant, a second important distinction between physical and spiritual contagion is the valence of the contaminant. Physical contagion sensitivity involves primarily negative contaminants-e.g., things that are harmful or disgusting. By contrast, spiritual contagion sensitivity involves properties that may be negative (e.g., Hitler's essence), positive (e.g., my favorite celebrity's essence), or neutral (e.g., an ancestor's essence).</p><p>Although one may consider the means of contamination (i.e., presence or absence of physical contact) to be the key distinction between physical and spiritual contagion, in our view, it is not. For example, if an individual avoids physical contact with someone who has a sexually transmitted disease, they may be concerned about physical contagion (transfer of the pathogen) or spiritual contagion (transfer of perceived immorality). In such cases, the means of contamination does not differentiate between physical and spiritual contagion, whereas the nature of the contaminant does differentiate between them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spiritual Versus Physical Contagion: A Mismatch Between Phenomena and Measures</head><p>In the existing literature, there are several scales that measure physical contagion sensitivity, such as the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Duncan et al., 2009)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and the</head></div>

Additionally, the Disgust Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Haidt et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Olatunji et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rozin et al., 1984)</ref> include items which measure physical contagion beliefs (e.g., "Even if I was hungry, I</p><p>would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed flyswatter").</p><p>To date, however, there are no measures of spiritual contagion sensitivity <ref type="bibr">(Nemeroff et al., 2020, p. 960)</ref>. This is notable, because much of the research in consumer behavior has focused on phenomena related to spiritual contagion, rather than physical contagion. Some prominent examples of spiritual contagion effects are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Some Examples of Spiritual Contagion Effects</head><p>It is important to note that physical and spiritual contagion are theoretically related, as spiritual contagion beliefs are hypothesized to derive from mechanisms used for tracking the spread of actual disease contaminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Nemeroff &amp; Rozin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rozin et al., 2009)</ref>. Consistent with this notion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chapman et al. (2009)</ref> find that oral disgust and moral disgust evoke similar facial motor activity, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chan et al. (2014)</ref> show that moral violations can reduce oral consumption.</p><p>In the absence of a dedicated measure of spiritual contagion sensitivity, previous research relied on measures of physical contagion sensitivity when assessing individual differences in spiritual contagion effects. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hingston et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Newman and Bloom (2014)</ref> adapted and used two items from the Disgust Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Olatunji et al., 2007)</ref> and four items from the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Duncan et al., 2009)</ref> to measure "contagion sensitivity." Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Newman et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Newman and Dhar (2014)</ref> used the same two items from the Disgust Scale in their measure of "contagion sensitivity." Nonetheless, given that much of the research on contagion within consumer behavior focuses on spiritual contagion phenomena, we argue that there is a need for a more targeted measure of spiritual contagion sensitivity (hereafter, SCS).</p><p>Beyond providing greater empirical precision, developing a measure of SCS addresses several important theoretical issues. First, while it has been hypothesized that physical and spiritual contagion are distinct psychological constructs, to date, no research has directly tested this claim. Second, existing measures of physical contagion sensitivity (hereafter, PCS) only measure sensitivity to negative contaminants and are thus ill-suited to measure sensitivity to negative, positive, or neutral spiritual contagion. Finally, developing a reliable measure of SCS provides a means of assessing whether various consumer behavior phenomena are, in fact, related to spiritual contagion. In other words, in cases where researchers hypothesize that</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>SPIRITUAL CONTAGION SENSITIVITY 7 spiritual contagion beliefs explain various behavioral results, a reliable measure of SCS provides a straightforward means of empirically testing those claims.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>Study 1 validates the three-factor structure of our SCS scale (sensitivities to negative, neutral, and positive spiritual contagion) and demonstrates the scale's discriminant validity by distinguishing it from existing measures of PCS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The SCS Scale</head><p>The SCS scale was developed over the course of a decade. Specifically, the scale items were developed as part of the third author's dissertation, under the guidance of the last author <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fedotova &amp; Rozin, 2013)</ref>. The items were subjected to extensive pilot testing, multiple iterations of revisions, and consultation with several experts in the field.</p><p>The result is a 12-item scale (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>). The scale asks respondents to rate on a series of 7-point Likert scales the extent to which they agree or disagree with four statements about negative spiritual contagion (e.g., "I could never live on a piece of land where someone was tortured and killed, even if I built a brand-new house"), four statements about positive spiritual contagion (e.g., "I would be excited to try on a jacket that was worn by my favorite musician, even if I could not tell other people about it"), and four statements about neutral spiritual contagion (e.g., "I believe that family heirlooms, such as jewelry, are imbued with the spirits of the people they once belonged to").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Procedure</head><p>Using the online platform Prolific <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Palan &amp; Schitter, 2018)</ref>, we recruited 500 U.S. residents (Mage = 35.7, 51% female) to participate in Study 1. All participants completed four scales: the SCS (described above), Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (hereafter, PVD; Duncan Accepted Article <ref type="bibr">SPIRITUAL CONTAGION SENSITIVITY 8 et al., 2009)</ref>, Part I of the Disgust Scale-Revised (hereafter, DS-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Olatunji et al., 2007)</ref>, and the contamination subscale of the Vancouver Obsessional Compulsive Inventory (hereafter, VOCI-CTN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Thordarson et al., 2004)</ref>. We adapted the original scales by dropping outdated items and changing the scales to 7-point scales (1 = Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree). All scale items are reported in Section A of the Methodological Details Appendix (hereafter, MDA).</p><p>Participants responded to a total of 48 items, which were presented one per item page, in a completely randomized order. Afterwards, participants provided demographic information (age, gender, political ideology, and education). Analyses on SCS by demographic variables are presented in the MDA, Section N.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We confirmed that our 12-item scale of SCS consists of the positive, negative, and neutral components by conducting (a) parallel analysis, (b) exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and (c) confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). First, a parallel analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dinno, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Horn, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kim, 2022b)</ref> suggested retention of three factors as expected (see the MDA, <ref type="figure">Figure B1</ref>). Next, we used CEFA program <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Browne et al., 2010)</ref> to conduct an exploratory factor analysis, extracting three factors with Maximum Wishart Likelihood factor extraction method and Promax rotation method. Results of this EFA <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 2)</ref> show that items intended to capture positive, negative, and neutral spiritual contagion components do indeed load on their respective factors (all main factor loadings &gt; 0.4). A follow-up confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling showed that the model of SCS consisting of the three components (negative, positive, and neutral) had a good fit, with each indicator having an acceptable loading for their respective component; χ 2 (51) = 84.7, RMSEA = 0.036, CFI = 0.981, TLI = 0.976, SRMR = .0387 (see the MDA, Section C). Note. We extracted three factors using Maximum Wishart Likelihood factor extraction and a Promax rotation method. Factor loadings for items' intended factor (subscale) are in bold. a These items were reverse-coded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>We next computed correlation and reliability coefficients for all four scales examined in this study. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> shows each scale's reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) along the diagonal, and the correlation between each column and each row scale below the diagonal.</p><p>Following the logic of Raghunathan and Chandrasekaran (2021), we compared reliability coefficients with correlation (validity) coefficients. To the extent that the SCS scale is related to the measures of physical contagion sensitivity, and yet, sufficiently different from them, the correlation (validity) coefficients should be significant but lower than the reliability coefficients.</p><p>Indeed, this is what we find: while the correlation coefficients were all significant (p &lt; .012) and</p></div>

In other words, the SCS items were more correlated with one another than they were with the existing measures of PCS. Note. Each scale's Cronbach's alpha is shown along the diagonal in parentheses, and correlations between the column and row scale scores are shown below the diagonal. *** p &lt; .001; * p &lt; .05</p><p>We further assessed discriminant validity of the SCS scale by using two common methods: <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref> method and heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Results from the parallel analysis, EFA, and CFA all converge to support the three-factor structure of the 12-item SCS scale (i.e., negative, positive, and neutral SCS).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>The main objective of Study 2 was to provide evidence of construct validity. To assess construct validity, we examined the correlation between scores on the SCS scale and 10 previously identified effects from the consumer literature for which spiritual contagion beliefs have been hypothesized to play a role. The 10 previously published findings are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>For each finding, we consulted the original research article, selected a vignette that operationalized the finding, and adapted the measure for our study. When using the original vignette verbatim was not feasible, we constructed a new vignette, drawing inspiration from the original materials. For example, for the ability contagion construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kramer &amp; Block, 2014)</ref>, we could not manipulate-for our online participants-physically touching a study guide used by the previous high-or low-performing participant. We thus asked participants to imagine a scenario in which they were taking a difficult course and were choosing to receive either handwritten notes (physical touch) or an electronic copy of the same notes (no physical touch) from a friend who did well in the course. All 10 vignettes are reported in the MDA, Section E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>From the online platform Prolific, we recruited 501 U.S. residents (Mage = 32.9, 49% female) to participate in Study 2. All participants began the study by completing the 10 vignettes in a random order (each was shown on a separate page). Participants then completed the 12-item SCS scale and the 13-item Disgust Scale (all 25 items in a random order). We measured disgust sensitivity along with SCS because it was the construct most closely related to SCS in Study 1.</p><p>This enabled us to compare the predictive utility of the SCS scale with that of the 13-item Disgust Scale as well as the two items from the Disgust Scale, which have been used in previous research to measure general "contagion sensitivity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Newman &amp; Dhar, 2014)</ref>. After completing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>the SCS and Disgust Scale, participants provided demographic information (age, gender, political ideology, and education).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To test whether SCS significantly correlates with the 10 published findings, we first created a composite score of the 10 vignettes by taking the following steps. For each vignette, we created a vignette score by recoding participants' responses such that higher ratings indicated attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors consistent with a greater sensitivity to spiritual contagion (e.g., reluctance to receive an organ transplant from a murderer or preference for products made in the original factory). Eight of the 10 vignettes were coded in this manner. For two vignettes measured with multiple items (i.e., preference for earlier serial numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[Smith et al., 2016]</ref> and perceived attractiveness of handmade products <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Fuchs et al., 2015]</ref>), the mean rating across the items (computed within-participant) served as the vignette score. Next, we computed the z-score for each of the 10 vignette scores and computed the mean of these 10 z-scores for each participant (hereafter, the composite score).</p><p>We then correlated the composite score with SCS. As hypothesized, the composite score of the 10 vignettes were significantly and positively correlated with the mean rating on the SCS scale: r(499) = .19, p &lt; .001 (see the MDA, <ref type="figure">Figure F1</ref>). Thus, consumers who scored higher on our SCS scale did indeed think and behave in ways that suggest greater sensitivity to spiritual contagion. We then compared SCS with disgust sensitivity in terms of the strength of their correlation with the composite score of the 10 vignettes. The correlation between disgust sensitivity and the composite score, though significant, was much weaker than that between SCS and the composite score-only about half the size: r(499) = .10, p = .028. Moreover, the two correlations (.19 and .10) were significantly different from each other, Williams's t(498) = -2.2, p = .031 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen &amp; Popovich, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kim, 2022b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Steiger, 1980)</ref>. Thus, although SCS and disgust</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>SPIRITUAL CONTAGION SENSITIVITY 13 sensitivity both correlated with previously identified spiritual contagion phenomena, SCS explained spiritual contagion effects to a greater extent than disgust sensitivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation Between SCS and Each of the 10 Vignettes</head><p>We further examined construct validity of the SCS scale and its three subscales by correlating them with each of the 10 vignette scores individually. The 10 correlation coefficients along with the associated p-values are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>. These analyses revealed that SCS was significantly correlated in the expected direction with five of the 10 vignettes: moral contagion regarding organ transplants <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hood et al., 2011)</ref>, meaning attached to historical artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grayson &amp; Martinec, 2004)</ref>, preference for products from the original source of production <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Newman &amp; Dhar, 2014)</ref>, ability contagion <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kramer &amp; Block, 2014)</ref>, and perceived attractiveness of handmade products <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fuchs et al., 2015)</ref>; see the MDA, Section G, for further discussion of why some of these measures may have failed to show significant correlations.</p><p>Additionally, when we examine the three subscales and compare their predictive utility against the 2-item measure of contagion sensitivity and the Disgust Scale, we see that in most cases, the appropriate subscale (based on valence) showed the highest correlation with the phenomenon of interest (see Note in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>).  Note. Correlations in this table shows that each of the three, 4-item subscales of SCS can be a better predictor for spiritual contagion phenomena of different valences than either the 2-item measure of contagion sensitivity or the Disgust Scale (the last two columns of this table). For example, perceived attractiveness of handmade products (a positive spiritual contagion phenomenon) is better predicted by (i.e., shows a stronger correlation with) the positive subscale of SCS (r = .17) than either the 2-item measure of contagion sensitivity (r = .06) or the Disgust Scale (r = .06), Williams's t-test ps &lt; .05. Such results demonstrate the utility of more targeted measures of sensitivity to spiritual contagion, namely, the subscales measuring sensitivity to positive, negative, and neutral spiritual contagion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>SPIRITUAL CONTAGION SENSITIVITY 16 literature to measure contagion sensitivity. To achieve these goals, we conducted three studies (3A-3C) testing whether the SCS (short-form) moderates three different spiritual contagion effects. The effects that we selected were the three highest-correlated effects identified in Study 2: moral contagion regarding an organ transplant from a murderer (Study 3A), meaning attached to historical artifacts (Study 3B), and preference for products from the original source of production (Study 3C). Further, these three phenomena respectively provided examples of negative spiritual contagion (immoral essence), neutral spiritual contagion (unspecified historical events), and positive spiritual contagion (luxury brand essence).</p><p>In each of the three studies, we replicated the basic effect using the materials adapted from the original papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grayson &amp; Martinec, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hood et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Newman &amp; Dhar, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>We additionally measured two moderator variables: SCS (short-form) and two items taken from the Disgust Scale and used in previous research to measure "contagion sensitivity" (hereafter, the 2-item measure; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Newman &amp; Dhar, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Olatunji et al., 2007)</ref>. The two items were as follows:</p><p>(1) "Even if I was hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed flyswatter"; (2) "It would bother me to sleep in a nice hotel room if I knew that a man had died of a heart attack in that room the night before." These two items were measured on the same 7-point scale as the SCS. Our aim was to test whether the SCS</p><p>(short-form) shows stronger moderations of spiritual contagion effects (i.e., stronger interaction effects), as compared with the 2-item measure from the literature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>After 14 months of waiting, the doctor told them they could receive a heart transplant from someone young and in good health that died recently. At this point, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (Donor: Murderer vs. Volunteer) designed to produce a moral contagion effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hood et al., 2011)</ref>. In the Murderer condition, the donor "murdered their spouse and committed suicide," whereas in the Volunteer condition, the donor "volunteered often, helping people… <ref type="bibr">[and]</ref> died in a car accident."</p><p>Participants rated how happy they would be to receive a heart transplant from the donor on an 11-point scale (0 = Not Very, 10 = Very).

All participants began the study by reading that historical museums consider displaying replicas instead of original objects for safety and preservation concerns (see the MDA, <ref type="figure">Figure I2</ref>). Participants were then randomly assigned to one of two conditions (Replica vs. Original). In the Replica [Original] condition, participants were presented with the question, "If a history museum contained only identical replica objects (not originals) [original objects (not replicas)], how likely would you be to visit that museum?" They answered the question on a 7-point scale (1 = Not at all, 7 = Very likely), and these ratings served as the dependent measure of the study. As in Study 3A, all participants subsequently answered the five moderator items (three items of SCS short-form and the 2-item measure in previous research) in a randomized order and provided demographic information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderation of Spiritual Contagion Effects by SCS Short Form and the 2-Item Measure</head><p>Having confirmed the three contagion effects predicted by previous research, we next tested whether each of the effects is indeed stronger among participants who are more sensitive to spiritual contagion than among participants who are less sensitive to spiritual contagion (see Note in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). At the same time, we also tested whether such moderation effects are stronger with SCS short form scores as the moderator as compared with the 2-item measure scores as the moderator. Specifically, we conducted three separate regressions analyses, one for each study, in which each study's dependent variable (e.g., happiness with heart transplant) is regressed on (1) experimental condition (e.g., 0 = Murderer, 1 = Volunteer), (2) mean-centered score on the 2item measure, (3) mean-centered score on the SCS short form, (4) condition × mean-centered score on the 2-item measure interaction, and (5) condition × mean-centered score on the SCS short form interaction (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 6</ref>). a The donor of a heart transplant was manipulated to be either a murderer (0) or a volunteer worker (1).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>SPIRITUAL CONTAGION SENSITIVITY 21 revealed that the condition × SCS interaction was significantly or marginally significantly stronger than the condition × the 2-item measure interaction in each of the three studies, Z &gt; 1.60, p &lt; .054 (see the MDA, Section J).</p><p>We further examined the nature of the condition × SCS interaction in each of the three studies (see the MDA, Section K). As seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (Panels A, C, and E), SCS was selectively correlated with responses in the conditions that one would expect, in the directions predicted by theory. Specifically, in Study 3A, SCS was negatively correlated with happiness about receiving a murderer's heart, r(197) = -.49, p &lt; .001, but uncorrelated with happiness about receiving a volunteer's heart, r(199) = -.02, p = .73 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1, Panel A)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The present studies develop and validate long (12-item) and short (3-item) measures of spiritual contagion sensitivity (SCS). In Study 1, we confirm the three-factor structure of our  <ref type="bibr">and (b)</ref> show that our SCS scale is a stronger moderator of spiritual contagion effects as compared with the measure of "contagion sensitivity" used in previous research.</p><p>One theoretical contribution of the present research is demonstrating that physical and spiritual contagion are distinct psychological constructs. In some cases, these phenomena may overlap, but the SCS scales provide useful means of distinguishing them. For example, adding cream into a meat dish <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Nemeroff &amp; Rozin, 1992</ref>) may be perceived as either physical or spiritual contagion for people who observe kosher laws. Dairy is a physical substance, but the violation of kosher laws is a moral one. The SCS scales developed here would be useful in examining such cases, because they can more precisely identify which kind of contagion (spiritual vs. not) a consumer is responding to.</p><p>Moreover, given that most of the research on contagion within consumer behavior examines spiritual (rather than physical) contagion, the SCS scales provide a means of assessing whether various consumer behavior phenomena are, in fact, related to spiritual contagion. In Studies 2 and 3A-3C, we show that in cases where researchers have hypothesized that spiritual contagion beliefs explain various behavioral results, the SCS scales provide a straightforward means of empirically testing those hypotheses. In addition, the positive, negative, and neutral</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p>subscales of our 12-item scale provide even more targeted measures of spiritual contagion sensitivity, because researchers studying spiritual contagion effects of particular valence(s) can use any (combination) of the subscales to test their specific hypotheses.</p><p>In addition to more targeted uses when examining contaminants of different valences, another extension of our work would be to explore the role of spiritual contagion sensitivity in more social psychological phenomena. For example, future research may consider the potential role of SCS in important social issues like intergroup attitudes. Previous research shows that physical contagion sensitivities (i.e., disgust sensitivity and/or perceived vulnerability to disease) predict phenomena such as ethnocentrism <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Navarrete &amp; Fessler, 2006)</ref>, demands for protectionist policies (closing the border regarding disease outbreaks; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kam, 2019)</ref>, and intuitive disapproval of homosexuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Inbar et al., 2009)</ref>. Similarly, intergroup disgust sensitivity predicts negative attitudes towards many outgroups and Islamophobia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Choma et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hodson et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>Because SCS is closely linked with physical contagion sensitivity, and SCS can be engaged via both physical contact and any type of metaphysical link <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Morales et al., 2018)</ref>, SCS may be a better predictor of such intergroup attitudes. Moreover, since intergroup attitudes encompass both outgroup avoidance and ingroup attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Navarrete &amp; Fessler, 2006)</ref>, SCS with its negative and positive components may better predict both aspects of intergroup attitudes.</p><p>In sum, the current work represents a significant step in development of an instrument designed to measure individual differences in spiritual contagion sensitivity. Scale development is a continuous, collective effort, and additional studies of the psychometric properties of the SCS scales will undoubtedly improve them. In the meantime, we hope that the creation of longand short-form measures of SCS opens the door for several new lines of inquiry.</p></div>
