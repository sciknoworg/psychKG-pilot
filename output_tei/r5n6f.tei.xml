<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The sunk-cost effect-the influence of past investment of resources upon current choice problems or courses of action-is a well-documented, putatively irrational decision-making bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Garland, 1990</ref>) often invoked to explain wasteful policy decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Staw, 1976)</ref>, disadvantageous corporate strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Staw &amp; Hoang, 1995)</ref>, or reluctance to leave unhealthy relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Strube, 1988)</ref>. While investigations of sunk-cost effects have historically relied upon hypothetical decision scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985)</ref>, more recent examinations of sunk-cost effects have experimentally manipulated key decision variables such as past and current monetary investment levels and the likelihood of a course of action succeeding in non-hypothetical scenarios, observing robust effects of past monetary investments on individuals' choice behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bogdanov et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haller &amp; Schwabe, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schulreich et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wang &amp; Li, 2022)</ref>, However, while a wealth of evidence supports sunk-cost effects in financial and economic decisions, surprisingly few studies have examined whether choices are also influenced by previous investments of non-monetary investments, such as cognitive effort-defined here as a subjective intensification of mental activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref>-which individuals typically evaluate as costly, or even aversive <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(David et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Devine et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015</ref>). If cognitive effort expenditure is indeed treated as an economic cost, we might expect that previous investments of cognitive effort towards a course of action should bias subsequent decisions to exert additional cognitive effort to continue that course of action. While a handful of studies have previously investigated sunk-cost effects in the domain of non-monetary investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cunha &amp; Caldieraro, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Otto, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ronayne et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yan &amp; Otto, 2020)</ref> their findings have been largely inconsistent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 4</head><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cunha and Caldieraro (2009)</ref> observed that in a hypothetical choice scenario in which participants learned, after making an initial choice of a consumer product, about a new, slightly superior product, participants were more likely to remain with their initially chosen product option if the evaluation process leading to the original choice involved more (versus less) mental work. However, a series of direct replication attempts failed to replicate this apparent sunk effort effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Otto, 2010)</ref>. Together, these findings have sparked debate about whether or not the exertion of cognitive effort may reliably engender sunk-cost effects similar to economic investments-or even at all. Here, we investigate whether "sunk effort costs" can influence choices by building on a recent paradigmatic advancement in the study of sunk costs.</p><p>It is worth noting that sunk-cost effects, more generally, have been observed across two structurally different, but related choice situations: "utilization" versus "progress" decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Garland &amp; Conlon, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Holton et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moon, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roth et al., 2015)</ref>. Previous work investigating the influence of sunk costs in the effort domain has exclusively focused on utilization decisions. Briefly, in utilization decisions, sunk-cost effects are observed when individuals' choices between similarly attractive and available options are dictated by previous resource investment in one of the options. In progress decisions, by contrast, sunk-cost effects emerge when individuals escalate investment in-rather than abandon-courses of action into which they have previously invested resources. One critical difference between these types of circumstances is that in progress decisions, deciding on the basis of sunk costs leads to the choice of an option with lower objective value (e.g., an inferior consumer product), whereas in progress decisions, an individual's reluctance to invest further resources into a course of action prevents them from receiving the desired outcome, and thus results in a total loss of prior SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 5 investments. Accordingly, we reasoned that sunk effort costs may be more readily observable in progress (versus utilization) decisions in light of the consequences of effort withdrawal.</p><p>In two experiments, we examine whether previous cognitive effort investments (i.e., sunk effort costs) increase individuals' propensity to invest additional cognitive effort into a course of action. To test this question, we adopted a well-studied progress sunk-cost paradigm-previously demonstrated to elicit sunk-cost effects with monetary investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bogdanov et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haller &amp; Schwabe, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schulreich et al., 2022)</ref>-in which participants chose whether to continue investing resources into (versus abandon) virtual "projects" that succeed with varying likelihoods, resulting in monetary rewards <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Critically, rather than making economic investments, participants were required to perform demanding arithmetic problems in order to advance projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Devine et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Vassena, Gerrits, et al., 2019)</ref> which varied in the level of cognitive effort required. While some projects ended after solving a single arithmetic problem, other projects required participants to make a subsequent effort investment in order to continue the project. This allowed us to compare investment decisions with no prior investment against decisions that following high (or low) levels of cognitive effort exertion.</p><p>We hypothesized that if cognitive effort is, like economic investments, treated as a cost, past investments of cognitive effort would lead participants to intensify their effort investment in order to continue a course of action-in other words, we would observe a stronger preference to invest in projects for which effort has already been invested, compared to investment decisions made in the absence of prior investments. As a corollary, we also reasoned that that this preference to increase investment of effort would be for projects for which large (versus small) levels of effort had been previously invested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 6</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Here we report two experiments: an initial laboratory experiment (Experiment 1) and a direct replication using a larger, online sample (Experiment 2). As the procedures for the two experiments were nearly identical, we describe both studies below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>An a priori power analysis revealed that at least 34 participants would be required to detect a small sunk-cost effect with 80% power (see Supplemental Materials, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>, <ref type="table">Table   S1</ref>). Accordingly, 38 healthy participants were recruited for Experiment 1. Two participants were excluded owing to experienced technical issues, leaving 36 participants in the final sample (Mean age = 20.83, SD = 1.32, 31 female). All participants gave informed consent in accordance with the McGill Research Ethics Board.</p><p>To assess the replicability and generalizability of our findings beyond the undergraduate participant sample used in Experiment 1, in Experiment 2 we recruited a sample of 100 participants via Prolific.com, an online recruitment platform, which yielded 99% power based on the Experiment 1 power analysis. Two participants experienced technical difficulties that prevented the analysis of their data, resulting in 98 analyzable datasets (Mean age = 38.79, SD = 18.70, 40 female). We excluded the data of 4 participants who failed more than 33% of catch trials (described below) and excluded 5 participants who missed more than 20% of response deadlines, leaving 89 participants in the final analysis. Note that the exclusion of the above participants does not affect the pattern of significance of our key results of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Investment Task. The experiment was conducted in a one-hour session. Participants were asked to complete a two-stage cognitive effort investment task, adapted from a monetary SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 7 investment task used in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bogdanov et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haller &amp; Schwabe, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schulreich et al., 2022)</ref>, which required participants to make investment decisions in hypothetical "projects", characterized by varying demand levels (low, high effort) and success probabilities (40%, 50%, 60%). Participants were presented with a series of projects they could invest in-some of which may succeed and some of which may fail-and that the outcome would solely depend on the success probability of the current project ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). To complete a particular project, participants would have to solve a simple arithmetic problem. Importantly, participants were instructed that some projects may require them to solve an additional arithmetic problem in order to realize that project's success. At the end of the experiment, participants were instructed that 5 projects would be randomly selected, and they would be paid $1 for each chosen project that succeeded (in reality all participants were paid a fixed $5 bonus in accordance with the ethics protocol governing the study).</p><p>In the first stage of the task, participants were presented with a project proposal, for which they needed to decide whether to invest effort or not. To visualize this decision, a screen with a thermometer filled at different heights (3/4 or entirely full), representing the difficulty of the upcoming arithmetic problem, and text depicting the likelihood of success of the project, as a percentage <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Participants had 5s to decide whether to invest in the project using "Y" (yes) or "N" (no) on the keyboard. If participants chose not to invest or responded too slowly, the project would be abandoned, and the following text would appear on the screen for 1.5s: "The project has been abandoned.".</p><p>If they chose to invest in the project, participants were faced with a demanding arithmetic problem, at the stated demand difficulty level, which was adapted from past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Devine et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Vassena, Gerrits, et al., 2019)</ref> and required participants to solve 4-digit mathematical SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 8 problems (addition and subtraction) that ranged in difficulty across two demand levels: low (e.g., 9 + 2 -8 -1), or high (5 +7 -4 + 3). Specifically, demand level was operationalized by the number of carrying and borrowing operations required to solve the problem (e.g., easy trials require carrying/borrowing once, whereas more difficult trials require carrying/borrowing and borrowing many times). Previous work has established a monotonic relationship between demand levels in these problems and subjective effort evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Devine et al., 2023)</ref>. The difficulty of the presented problem matched the height of thermometer on the previous screen.</p><p>Each problem was presented on the screen for 3s, after which three possible answers to the problem appeared. Participants had up to 3s to indicate their choice for the correct answer using the Q, W, or E keys. Demand levels and success probabilities were selected, on the basis of a pilot experiment, in order to avoid ceiling (or floor) effects in participants' investment choices stemming from either the arithmetic problems being perceived as too easy (or too difficult) or the success probabilities being too high (or too low). More specifically, the difficulty levels in the current studies corresponded to the two highest demand levels used in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Devine et al., 2023)</ref>. Thus, while "high" demand problems were more difficult than the "low" demand problems, both levels were nevertheless substantially challenging. This relative similarity in overall demand level furthermore served to reduce potential time differences in mental calculations between effort conditions, which, if too large, could have conflated sunk cost effects resulting from effort investment with those resulting from time investment.</p><p>The task consisted of three within-subjects conditions: No Prior Investment, Low Prior Investment, and High Prior Investment. In the No Prior Investment condition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A)</ref>, after completing the first stage described above, participants would receive immediate feedback about the success of the project: if the project was successful, text indicating that "The project was SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 9 successful" would appear on the screen for 1.5s, otherwise, the text would read "The project was unsuccessful". A project's success did not depend on correctly responding to the arithmetic problems but only on the initial success probability indicated on the investment decision screen (i.e., 40%, 50%, or 60%). After the project's outcome was shown, the trial would conclude and a randomly jittered inter-trial interval (1 -1.5s) would separate trials.</p><p>In the Low Prior Investment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>) and High Prior Investment <ref type="table">(Figures 1C)</ref> conditions, participants were told, after making an initial investment, that further investment would be needed in order for the project to succeed, otherwise it would be abandoned and potential rewards foregone. Importantly, in the Low Prior Investment condition, the demand level of the first-stage arithmetic problem was low, whereas in the High Prior Investment condition, the demand level of the arithmetic problem was high. After pressing the spacebar to continue, participants were then presented with updated (second-stage) demand levels and success probabilities, and chose whether to continue with the current project (necessitating the completion of a second arithmetic problem) or to abandon it, again using the "Y" or "N" keys.</p><p>After completing the final arithmetic problem-i.e., the first-stage problem in No Prior Investment trials, or the second-stage problem in Low or High Prior Investment trialsparticipants received feedback about the project's success, governed by the most recently described success probability.</p><p>In summary, the effort investment task comprised a 3 (First-stage demand level: No Prior Investment versus Low Prior Investment versus High Prior Investment) ⨉ 3 (First-stage success probability: 40% versus 50% versus 60%) ⨉ 2 (Second-stage demand level: low demand versus high demand) ⨉ 3 (Second-stage success probability: 40% versus 50% versus 60%) design. In Experiment 1, participants performed 4 repetitions of each of these 54 possible trial types (each SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 10 employing unique arithmetic problems), resulting in 216 total trials per participant. In Experiment 2, to adapt the task to the online setting, we reduce the length of the task such that participants performed three repetitions of each trial type, yielding 162 total trials per participants. Furthermore, to identify online participants who may have disengaged with the task, we added 9 "catch" trials, for which first-stage investments included a 0% success probability at the decision stage per condition (one catch trial for each first-stage factorial combination; i.e., for all conditions). Three questionnaires were administered in Experiment 2 as a part of our standard questionnaire battery for online studies. The Need for Cognition (NFC) scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, &amp; Jarvis, 1996)</ref>, the short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale (SUPPS-P; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cyders, Littlefield, Coffey, &amp; Karyadi, 2014)</ref>, and, a short questionnaire designed to evaluate individuals' sunk-cost tendency and desire for not appearing as wasteful, coined the Wastefulness Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bogdanov, Ruff, &amp; Schwabe, 2017)</ref>. Questionnaire data were not analyzed in the current study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We analyzed performance in arithmetic problems (RTs and accuracy rates) using mixedeffects linear (or logistic, in the case of accuracy) regressions using the lme4 package in R (version 4.1.1; Bates et al., 2014), predicting performance as a function of demand level (effectscoded, -0.5 = low demand, 0.5 = high demand), success probability (median-centered and divided by 10), and decision stage (effects-coded, -0.5 = first stage, 0.5 = second stage). All interactions between predictors were investigated. The effect of choice stage (first-vs. secondstage arithmetic problems) on performance was allowed to vary (treated as a random slope) and random intercepts were computed per participant.</p><p>We examined investment choices using mixed-effects logistic regression, predicting decisions to invest (versus abandon) projects as a function of prior investment condition (dummy-coded, reference = No Prior Investment condition), the demand level of the current decision (effects-coded, -0.5 = low demand, 0.5 = high demand), and success probability (median-centered and divided by 10). To probe the sunk cost effect specifically, we compared second-stage decisions in Low and High Prior Investment trials to first-stage decisions in No Prior Investment trials (i.e., decisions depicted to the right of the dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Importantly, in the Low and High Prior Investment conditions, we only examined decisions made following correct responses to the initial arithmetic problem to ensure that participants invested the requisite amounts of effort in second-stage decisions, resulting in the exclusion of 14% and 9% of choices in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Importantly, the key patterns of results do not change if these trials are included (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S2</ref> in the supplement for full regression table displaying these alternative analyses). All interactions between predictors were investigated. Random intercepts were computed per participant. Finally, to examine the SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 13 difference in investment rates between Low and High Prior Investment conditions-in other words, to investigate the parametric effect of prior effort level upon investment decisions-we refit these models, taking the Low Prior Investment condition as the Intercept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arithmetic Task Performance</head><p>Mirroring past work using this arithmetic task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Devine et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vassena, Deraeve, et al., 2019)</ref> versus low-demand arithmetic problems (see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> for full descriptive results), suggesting that the demand manipulation was successful at engendering increased cognitive effort investment across difficulty levels (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for full regression results).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Investment Decisions</head><p>To confirm that participants were sensitive to required effort levels and project success likelihoods, we first examined whether participants chose to invest effort towards a project in the  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 14</head><p>Examining effort investment decisions as a function of previous effort investment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure   2</ref>), we found that participants were more likely to choose to invest cognitive effort in a project if they had previously invested effort-that is, they were more willing to complete another mentally demanding arithmetic problem to complete a project if they had previously completed an arithmetic problem in order to advance that project. Statistically, across Experiments 1 and 2, we observed reliable sunk effort cost effects both in the Low Prior Investment condition, where participants had previously completed a low-demand arithmetic task (Experiment 1: b = 1.51, CI = [1.24, 1.78], p &lt; .001; Experiment 2: b = 2.07, CI = [1.84, 2.30], p &lt; .001; see "Low-Prior" in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>We also examined more specifically, between the Low and High Prior Investment demand level was low, perhaps owing to a ceiling effect in investment rates for low-demand problems. Taken together, the results of these two analyses provide robust evidence for a sunkcost bias that manifests in decisions about cognitive effort investment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Differences in Sunk Cost Effects</head><p>We also examined, in an exploratory fashion, individual differences in participants' sensitivity to sunk effort costs. Specifically, we reasoned that participants who exhibited slower (correct) RTs on high-demand arithmetic problems-which we take as here as a proxy for a greater evoked effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Vassena, Gerrits, et al., 2019)</ref>-would be more susceptive to a sunk-cost effect, owing to the additional effort invested into first stage projects, in line with the notion that greater past investment engenders greater perceived sunk costs in financial decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Roth et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 16</head><p>To investigate this possibility, we examined the influence of individual participants' average correct RTs upon first-stage high-demand trials upon subsequent second-stage investment choices (irrespective of current demand level), observing that participants with longer first-stage arithmetic problems RTs exhibited more pronounced sunk effort cost effects, as indexed by a greater difference in investment rates between the High Prior Investment condition and the No Prior Investment condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 3</ref>). Statistically, we tested this predictive relationship by including participants' (standardized) average first-stage correct RTs into the logistic multilevel investment choice model described above in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2,</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The sunk-cost effect is among the most well-documented biases in economic decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moon, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Whyte, 1986)</ref>. By adapting an established economic sunk-cost paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haller &amp; Schwabe, 2014)</ref>, the present study provides compelling evidence that decisions about cognitive effort expenditure are influenced by prior exertion of cognitive effort in a similar fashion as economic sunk costs. Specifically, we found that participants were more likely to engage with a cognitively effortful task in order to advance a course of action if they had already invested effort in that course of action. In our study, this sunk effort cost effect was apparent, both when comparing low and high prior investment trials to no prior investment trials, and in comparing low versus high prior investment trials-though in the latter case, sunk costs only influenced decisions involving high levels of prospective effort investment. Importantly, we observed nearly identical choice patterns in an independent replication of our lab-based experiment in a larger online sample, demonstrating the robustness of the observed sunk effort cost effect.</p><p>Taken together, these results effectively demonstrate the generalizability of sunk-cost effects to the cognitive effort domain, for which previous investigations have yielded limited and inconsistent results that have been difficult to replicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cunha &amp; Caldieraro, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Otto, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ronayne et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yan &amp; Otto, 2020)</ref>. Here, across two experiments, we observed that the vast majority of participants (84% and 92% in Experiments 1 and 2 respectively; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3)</ref> were more likely to invest further effort in a course of action after having invested effort in a given project, mirroring the patterns of sunk-cost sensitivity repeatedly observed in a structurally similar task probing (economic) investment choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bogdanov et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haller &amp; Schwabe, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schulreich et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, exploratory analyses suggested individuals who took SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 19 longer to solve first-stage math problems, which we take as larger initial investment of effort costs, also displayed larger sunk-cost effects.</p><p>Why might have these sunk effort cost effects been elusive-or inconsistent at best-in previous work, yet were readily observable in the present study? This disparity may arise from the reliance of previous past work on utilization decisions, in which sunk-cost effects emerge when participants ascribe higher subjective value to choice options for which they had previously exerted effort versus similarly attractive and available alternative options for which they had not. Importantly, these types of decision still yield an outcome to the decision-maker, even if that outcome is of lower objective value. In contrast, the present studies observed a robust influence of previous effort investment in progress decisions, wherein individuals can choose to escalate resource investment in order to advance a (potentially failing) course of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Moon, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roth et al., 2015)</ref>. One important feature of the progress decisions examined here is that, unlike utilization decisions, a decision-maker is required to escalate investment of effort in order to receive any outcome at all and thus to avoid an irrecoverable loss of effort already invested in the project. It may indeed be the case that individuals treat sunk effort costs as more salient decision variables in the case of progress decisions, but importantly, future work is needed to directly examine the influence of sunk effort cost across these two decision types.</p><p>More generally, while the idea that individuals' choices may be sensitive to previous investments of effort (similar to money or time) is not new <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985)</ref>, the question has received comparatively little experimental attention. Recently, however, interest in the topic has increased, in part, due to the rising popularity of cost-benefit accounts of effort-based decision-making that explicitly treat effort as an economic cost akin to monetary investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Shenhav et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. Consistent with this SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 20 view, we observed a substantial sunk effort cost effect which suggests that individuals do, in fact, perceive and treat past effort exertion as a cost to consider and that they may weigh (putatively irrelevant) investments of cognitive effort costs against prospective monetary reward for successfully completing a project, which may hint at the possibility that these distinct commodities might be converted into a common currency during the decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Castanheira et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Levy &amp; Glimcher, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. Notably, our results indicate that present cost-benefit calculations can be affected not only by prospective or anticipated effort, as frequently demonstrated with effort-based choice paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bogdanov et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Devine et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kool et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>, but also by effort costs spent in the past. This is consistent with previous evidence suggesting that effort exertion may retrospectively increase the subjective value of associated rewards, potentially through effort-justification mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bogdanov, Renault, et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Harmon-Jones et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Inzlicht et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Norton et al., 2012</ref>). Yet, most contemporary formal cost-benefit accounts of effort valuation currently do not account for past effort expenditure and solely focus on prospective choices. Thus, our findings highlight the need to broaden theories of effort-based decision-making.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting potential limitations inherent to the decision paradigm employed here. First, once participants had decided to invest in a given project, the outcome depended solely on the current success probability, irrespective of their accuracy in the arithmetic problem. Thus, it is possible that participants could advance projects without engaging effortfully in the arithmetic task. To mitigate this possibility, and to ensure that participants had demonstrably engaged, rather than disengaged, from the arithmetic task, we only analyzed investment choices on trials in which participants made correct responses on first-stage SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 21 arithmetic problems. Thus, under this conservative approach, our analysis may omit trials in which participants engaged effortful processes but nonetheless made erroneous responses (see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>).</p><p>Second, it may be the case that past time investment-which is well-documented as another source of sunk cost that can influence choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Soman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sweis et al., 2018</ref>)-could play a role in the observed investment decisions. Here, Low and High Prior Investment trials (which involved first-stage effort investment) differed from No Prior Investment trials not only in effort investment required, but also previous time investment, as these trials entailed a prior decision stage. However, the observation that participants were more likely to invest additional effort when they had made a high prior investment versus a low prior investment (whose trial durations were equivalent, by design) when they faced a large prospective effort investment suggests that these investment decisions were uniquely guided by past effort, rather than time investment. While disentangling the relationship between elapsed time and effort investment has proven difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fleming et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sayalı &amp; Badre, 2021)</ref>, future work should aim to address the unique contributions of time versus effort contributions to sunk costs.</p><p>In summary, our findings provide evidence for a robust behavioral sunk-cost effect emerging following exertion of cognitive effort in choice problems involving progress decisions.</p><p>These effects were consistent across two independent, well-powered studies (one in-lab and one online), varied based on individual differences in task performance and, to a lower degree, with the size of the prior effort investment. Considering the ubiquity as well as the potentially important consequences associated with sunk-cost effects in our daily life, these findings might help to better understand how humans incorporate past effort exertion into current decisions and may help to establish interventions to prevent individuals from falling for this decision bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUNK-COSTS IN COG. EFFORT 22</head><p>Finally, our results also have important implications for theories of effort valuation as they demonstrate the need to refine and broaden current models to account for considerations of past effort exertion to explain future choices. In order to determine the required sample size to achieve acceptable power in Experiment 1, we conducted a simulation-based power analysis for the (logistic) multilevel regression discussed in the main text. We did so in three steps: 1) we defined effect sizes of minimal interest and high random variance estimates for expected investment behaviour, 2) we simulated investment decisions according to these estimates, 3) we fit a series of logistic multilevel model to simulated data and computed the proportion the significant results as an approximation for statistical power.</p><p>In step 1, we defined effect sizes of minimal interest. The values we used are listed in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>. For the purposes of the power analysis, we did not assume any interaction terms, as we did not have any a priori hypotheses about these effects and their inclusion would not affect the main effects of interest. Under these assumptions, we anticipated an 8.7% difference between investment rates in the No Prior condition versus the Low Prior condition, and a 12% difference between investment rates in the No Prior condition versus the High Prior condition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1A</ref>).</p><p>These estimates are rather conservative both in light of past work using a similar paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bogdanov et al., 2017)</ref> and relative to the observed effects we report in the main text (though we obviously did not know this at the time of conducting this power analysis). We did not have a sense of what the random variance in overall investment rates, sensitivity to demand level, or success probability would be. Accordingly, we set the random variance terms in to be 1-a moderate-to-high degree of variability in this context.</p><p>In step 2, we simulated participant behaviour in the investment task. We tested power at samples sizes of 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90. All simulated participants completed 216 trials of the task (the same as in Experiment 1). All other specifications are identical to those described in the Method section of the main text. Participant behaviour was sampled from the following multilevel model: is the demand level of the current investment offer (effectcoded, -0.5 = low demand, 0.5 = high demand). ( ) is the success probability of the current investment offer (divided by 10 and median-centred). All (apart from 00 ) are fixed slope effects and all are random deviations from these fixed effects (i.e., random effects), which are multivariate normal distributed with a mean of 0 and covariance Σ. All assumed parameter values are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S2</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">=</formula><p>Finally, in step 3, we fit the model presented in equation S1 to simulated behaviour.</p><p>Datasets were simulated and models were fit 100 times in each sample size.

To estimate an exact sample size, we linearly interpolated power estimates between tested sample sizes. Doing so, a sample size of 34 yielded an estimated power of 0.796-i.e., ~80% power. We used this estimate as our target sample size in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the final sample size of 89 yielded power of 0.9885.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Schematic of the Investment Task.
