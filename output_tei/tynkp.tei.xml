			<abstract>
				<p>Prior research found that &quot;1-in-X&quot; ratios led to higher and less accurate subjective probability than &quot;N-in-X*N&quot; ratios or other formats even though they featured the same mathematical information. It is unclear, however, whether the effect transfers into health decisions and the practical significance of the effect is undetermined. Based on previous findings and risk communication theories, we hypothesised that the &quot;1-in-X&quot; effect would occur and transfer into relevant decisions. We also tested whether age, gender and education differences would moderate the &quot;1-in-X&quot; effect on decision-making. We conducted three well-powered experiments (n = 1912) using a sample from the general adult UK population to test our hypotheses, estimated the effect and excluded a possible methodological explanation for such a transfer. In hypothetical scenarios, participants decided whether to travel to Kenya given the chance of contracting malaria (Experiment 1) and whether to take recommended steroids given the side effects (Experiments 2 and 3). Across the experiments, we replicated a smallto-medium &quot;1-in-X&quot; effect on the perceived probability, Hedge&apos;s g =-0.36, 95% CI [-0.47,-0.24], z =-6.18, p &lt; .001 and found a small effect on subsequent decisions, OR = 1.32, 95% CI [1.10, 1.59], z = 2.99, p = .003. The perceived probability fully mediated the effect of the ratio format on decision. Age, gender and education did not moderate the &quot;1-in-X&quot; effect on decision. We argue that a high prevalence of &quot;1-in-X&quot; ratios in medical communication makes these small changes clinically relevant. Therefore, to communicate information accurately, &quot;1-in-X&quot; ratios should not be used or at least used cautiously in medical communication.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When making informed decisions about our health, an accurate perception of probabilistic information is critical. For instance, one can decide against taking steroids if the probability of experiencing side effects seems too high. Previous research studied the factors that shape subjective probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. As part of this research programme, recent studies found that "1-in-X" probability ratios (e.g., 1 in 10) consistently yielded higher subjective probabilities than the same probability magnitudes expressed as "N-in-X*N" ratios (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> in 100) or percentages (e.g., 10%). This effect has been labelled the "1-in-X" effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The effect has been demonstrated with negative and positive outcomes, using various scenarios, replicated in different populations, and using different languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It has also been tested in an ecologically valid setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Based on this research, some called for the ratio to be eliminated from medical communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. "1-in-X" ratios are consistently higher than other numerical and pictorial formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and lead to a larger overestimation of the probability compared with "N-in-X*N" ratios when using objective numerical scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This means that probability estimation is biased by "1-in-X" ratios.</p><p>It remains unclear whether the "1-in-X" effect has any practical significancewhether the effect on probability perception transfers into decisions. This is important to establish because "1-in-X" ratios are currently the most prevalent ratio format used in medical communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Indeed, the majority of family physicians used this format to communicate the risks associated with prenatal screening to pregnant women <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Both decision-making theories and risk communication theories assume that the probability of an event (e.g., probability of a side effect) affects decisions involving this event (e.g., taking a medicine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>. Preliminary evidence also indicated that the format of probability ratios affected the decisions expressed as a likelihood of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, two drawbacks prevented us from drawing firm conclusions from this evidence: (i) the decision measure followed the probability question, thus inviting an order effect and (ii) the decision measure Running Head: PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE "1-IN-X" EFFECT 4 was continuous, which does not reflect the dual nature of decisions (e.g., accepting a treatment or not).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Experiments</head><p>The present manuscript details three experiments aimed at tackling the issue of the "1in-X" effect on health-related decisions. We had four main goals. First, we aimed to replicate the "1-in-X" effect in different scenarios. Second, we investigated whether the different ratios affected decisions presented as dichotomous choices: we used the decision to travel to Kenya considering the risk of contracting malaria (Experiment 1) and the decision to take steroids considering their side effects (Experiments 2 and 3). Whereas the former decision was based on a scenario used in the "1-in-X" effect literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, the latter decision was based on ecologically valid materials taken from the UK's National Health Service website <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. We also considered the possibility that the effect on decision could be a methodological artefactand that it might occur due to providing an explicit probability rating. We therefore manipulated the presentation order of the measures (Experiments 1 and 2). Third, we tested whether the subjective probability would mediate the effect on the subsequent decision (Experiments 1-3). Finally, we tested whether people of different ages, genders or educational backgrounds were more sensitive to the effect of ratio format on decision. For that purpose we worked with a large sample of the UK adult population (overall n = 1912).</p><p>We were interested in these relationships because prior research linked these variables with risk perception, health literacy and numeracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, even though such links were not detected specifically for the "1-in-X" effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> We tested three main hypotheses and one research question. First, we expected that the "1-in-X" effect would affect the subjective probabilities across various health-relevant scenarios. Second, we expected that the "1-in-X" effect would affect health-related decisions.</p><p>Third, we expected that the effect would be mediated by the subjective probability perception. Finally, we explored the role of gender, age and level of education as possible moderators of the "1-in-X" effect on decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants and Design. We aimed to recruit at least 597 participants in order to detect a small effect (OR = 1.71 ≈ 10% change from 0.2 to 0.3), while using a logistic regression and assuming α = .05, 1 -β = .80, and a two-sided test <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Therefore, 605 participants were recruited from an online panel (Prolific Academic) and completed a questionnaire. Only those participants who were at least 18 years old, resided in the UK andto assure the quality of responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> had an approval rating of more than 90% were eligible to participate. The participants were paid £1 for completing a 12-minute questionnaire which also featured a problem-solving task unrelated to the research reported here. Participants were mostly women (69.1%), the majority of whom had completed high school (38.2%) or held an undergraduate degree (41.2%). Their ages ranged from 18 to 84 years (M = 36.0, SD = 11.7 years). The sample consisted of managers and working professionals (25.8%), unemployed individuals, including students and homemakers (23.5%), and workers in sales and offices (12.6%), services (7.3%) or in another occupation.</p><p>In a 2(ratio: "1-in-X" vs "N-in-X*N") × 2(response order: probability first vs. decision first) between-subjects design, participants assessed the subjective probability of contracting malaria while travelling to Kenya and decided whether or not to maintain or cancel their booking.</p><p>Materials and Procedure. After providing informed consent, participants read a scenario describing a hypothetical situation in which they had booked a trip to Kenya <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In the scenario they learnt that the risk of contracting malaria during their trip was around 8%, described either with a "1-in-X" ratio (1 in 13) or an "N-in-X*N" ratio (10 in 130).</p><p>Participants expressed their subjective probability of contracting malaria on an 11-point Likert scale (anchored as 1: extremely low, 11: extremely high). On the same page, they reported their decision to cancel the trip (or not) on a dichotomous Yes/No scale. The response options were randomised (see Supplementary Materials for the exact wording). The presentation order of the probability and decision questions was counterbalanced. Participants then answered questions concerning their age, gender, level of education and occupation before being debriefed.</p><p>We followed the APA ethical guidelines when conducting all three experiments. We have reported all the experiments, measures, manipulations and exclusions. All data sets, R code and materials are available at: https://osf.io/u69jq/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>We found that participants provided higher probability estimates in the "1-in-X" condition than in the "N-in-X*N" condition and that this was the case regardless of the order of presentation of the questions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>, panel A). The observed "1-in-X" effect was statistically significant, F(1, 601) = 24.52, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = 0.04, whereas the main effect of order and the interaction term were not, F(1, 601) = 3.60, p = .058, η p 2 = 0.01; F(1, 601) = 0.81, p = .369, η p 2 &lt; 0.01, respectively. Thus, we replicated the "1-in-X" effect on the subjective perception of the probability reported in the prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. More participants decided to cancel their trip when the risk of contracting malaria was presented as a "1-in-X" ratio than an "N-in-X*N" ratio. This effect was slightly stronger when participants made their decision before providing a probability estimate rather than after ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, panel B). The interaction between the format and presentation order did not add significantly to the main effect model, χ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> (1) = 0.24, p = .626, so only the main effect model was considered further. In this model, we found a significant effect of the ratio format, To test the mediation hypothesis, we used a recommended analytical strategy using the macro PROCESS that relies on bootstrapped intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>. The total effect of the ratio format on decision, c = 0.37, z = 2.18, p = .029, was fully mediated by the perceived probability, since the indirect effect was significant (i.e., bootstrapped CIs did not contain zero), ab = 0.41, 95% CI BCa [0.24, 0.59] and the direct effect was substantially reduced and no longer significant, c' = 0.01, z = 0.03, p = .977. Hence, the ratio format affected decisionmaking, and this was not caused by an order effect in the tasks. We further established that the effect on decision was fully mediated via perceived probability, which is consistent with the prior literature on risk perception and with decision theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. It is important to note that the mediation analysis does not account for the whole variability in the decision-making variable, instead, it accounts for the variability in decision-making caused by the ratio format .36], z = -1.09, p = .275, respectively. We did not find evidence to support the fact that people of different ages, genders or educational levels would be more (or less) prone to the probability format affecting their decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that the ratio format affected the perceived probability which then had an impact on decision. In Experiment 2, we wanted to extend the robustness of the demonstration to a more realistic and complex health scenario. Therefore, In a 2(ratio: "1-in-X" vs "N-in-X*N") × 2(response order: probability first vs.</p><p>decision first) between-subjects design, participants assessed the subjective probability of a steroid's side effect and decided whether or not they would adhere to the medication.</p><p>Materials and Procedure. After providing informed consent, participants read a scenario describing a hypothetical situation in which they suffered from a reactive form of arthritis and their family physician suggested taking prednisolone to manage their symptoms (see</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Materials</head><p>). They also learnt that the risk of experiencing side effects such as depression and hallucinations while taking prednisolone was around 5%, described either as a "1-in-X" ratio (1 in 20) or an "N-in-X*N" ratio (5 in 100). In order to appear as realistic as possible, the scenario text was adapted from the NHS website and the prednisolone leaflet.</p><p>Curiously, while the NHS website reported the risk to be 1 in 20, the prednisolone leaflet described the risk as 5 in 100. Participants assessed their subjective probability of experiencing these side effects on an 11-point Likert scale, ("In your opinion, when taking prednisolone, the probability of experiencing changes in your mental state, such as depression or hallucinations, is…", anchored as 1: extremely low, 11: extremely high). They also reported their decision as to whether they would take the medication regularly (or not) on a dichotomous Yes/No scale, ("Given that the probability of experiencing changes in your mental state, such as depression or hallucinations, is 1 in 20 [5 in 100] when taking prednisolone, would you regularly take this medication?") The options were randomised and the presentation order of the two questions was systematically counterbalanced. Participants then reported their age, gender, level of education and occupation, and were debriefed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>We observed substantial variations in probability perception according to the ratio formatthe "1-in-X" format led to higher probability perception compared with the "N-in-X*N" format, whereas the probability varied minimally according to the presentation order ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, panel A). The observed "1-in-X" effect was statistically significant, F(1, 601) = 45.25, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = 0.07, whereas the main effect of order and the interaction with the main effect of ratio format were not, F(1, 601) = 0.13, p = .723, η p 2 &lt; 0.01; F(1, 601) = 0.14, p = .705, η p 2 &lt; 0.01, respectively. Thus, we replicated the findings from Experiment 1 concerning the significant "1-in-X" effect and the non-significant effect of order on probability perception. Participants decided not to take the medication (0: to take prednisolone, 1: not to take prednisolone) more often when the risk was presented in the "1-in-X" format compared with the "N-in-X*N" format, the effect of which was slightly more pronounced in the decisionfirst condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2, panel B)</ref>. In the main effect model (adding an interaction term did not significantly increase explained variance, χ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> (1) = 0.48, p = .486), we found a significant 457. Yet again we found the "1-in-X" effect on probability and decision-making. The effect on decision was fully mediated via probability perception.</p><p>Age, gender and education level (using the same approach and recoding as in , z = -0.83, p = .405, respectively. Thus, we did not find evidence that people of different ages, genders or education levels would be more (or less) prone to the format affecting their decision-making process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>In Experiment 3, we aimed to replicate the effect of the ratio format on probability perception Only those participants who were at least 18 years old, resided in the UK, and answered all the dependent variable questions were included in the final sample. Since we did not have control over the quality of responses, we measured the time people took to read the scenario and excluded those who were rushingi.e., those who read the scenario in less than 8.9</p><p>seconds, which was a third of the median time required for reading the scenario. This was an a priori exclusion rule that is part of the standard operating procedures of the lab and is applied consistently in other papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. and students (1.6%); six participants did not provide this information.</p><p>In a simple between-subjects design, in which we manipulated ratio ("1-in-X" vs "Nin-X*N"), participants decided whether or not they would adhere to the medication and assessed the subjective probability of a steroids' side effect.</p><p>Materials and Procedure. After providing informed consent, participants answered sociodemographic questions and some questions that were irrelevant to the reported research. They then read the same prednisolone scenario as in Experiment 2. The risk of experiencing side effects such as depression and hallucinations was described either as a "1-in-X" ratio (1 in 20) or an "N-in-X*N" ratio (10 in 200). On a separate page, participants reported their decision as to whether they would take the medication regularly (or not) using the same questions and scales as in Experiment 2; the options were presented in a random order. On the next page, participants assessed their subjective probability of experiencing the side effect using the same wording and scale as in Experiment 2. Participants were then debriefed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>compared with the "N-in-X*N" condition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3, panel A)</ref>. The observed "1-in-X" effect was not statistically significant, F(1, 700) = 2.71, p = .100, η p 2 = 0.004. We found that the "1-in-X" ratio caused only a small increase in the proportion of decisions not to take prednisolone (0: to take prednisolone, 1: not to take prednisolone) compared with the "N-in-X*N" ratio ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3, panel B)</ref>. We found a non-significant effect of the format, OR = 1.04, 95% CI [0.77, 1.40], z = 0.25, p = .802 (i.e., the direction was consistent with the "1-in-X" effect). Since we did not find a statistically significant or substantial effect we did not run a mediation analysis of the "1-in-X" effect on decision via probability perception. lower levels of education were more prone to the "1-in-X" effect than those with higher education levels for whom the effect was in the opposite direction. Thus, age and gender did not interact with the format in their effect on decision-making, whereas education level did.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Synthesis: Estimating the "1-in-X" Effect on Probability and Decision</head><p>To summarise the "1-in-X" effect on subjective probability and decision across the experiments reported here (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref> for summary), we computed an internal meta-analysis using fixed and random effect models with the R package metafor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. We found a small-tomedium and statistically significant "1-in-X" effect on perceived probability across the three experiments using a fixed effect model, Hedge's g = -0. We found a small "1-in-X" effect on health decision across the three experiments using a fixed effect model, OR = 1.32, 95% CI [1.10, 1.59], z = 2.99, p = .003 (a random effect model yielded similar results, OR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.02, 1.74]). The odds of mitigating the riskby cancelling a trip or by not adhering to a treatmentwere 24% more likely when the risk was quantified as a "1-in-X" ratio than when the risk was quantified as an "N-in-X*N" ratio.</p><p>When we pooled the data from the three experiments, we found an approximate 12% absolute risk difference (414/951 vs. 537/961), which means that being exposed to the "1-in-X" ratio brought 12 excess decisions to mitigate the risk per 100 decisions compared with the "N-in-X*N" ratio.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>In three well-powered experiments, we found that "1-in-X" ratios led to higher probability perception compared with "N-in-X*N" ratios. The overall "1-in-X" effect was small-to-medium sized. Critically, "1-in-X" ratios altered the subsequent health decisions: more people cancelled the trip abroad to remedy the risk of contracting an illness (Experiment 1) and more people did not adhere to the recommended treatment considering the risk of experiencing side effects (Experiment 2; but not significantly so in Experiment 3); the overall effect size was small. The effect on decision cannot be explained as a methodological artefact, i.e. as an expressed consequence of making a probability judgment prior to making a decision, given that we did not find that the order of the questions mattered (Experiments 1 and 2). The format effect on decision was fully mediated by the perceived probability of contracting the illness (Experiment 1) or experiencing side effects (Experiment 2). Socio-demographic indicatorsage, gender and educationdid not moderate the effect on decision with the exception of a higher sensitivity to the "1-in-X" effect for those less educated (Experiment 3). Our findings are consistent with prior research that demonstrated the "1-in-X" effect on probability perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The effect size is similar to that found in the recent meta-analysis which included some null findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The "1-in-X" effect on decisions and its mediation via subjective probability is consistent with prior evidence on the link between probability and decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref> and is also aligned with current theories of decision-making, in which perceived probability along with perceived utility are expected to determine decision-making such as the prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</p><p>To draw up the practical implications of our findings, we need to interpret the small effect on decision identified here in terms of practical significance. However, before drawing any conclusion, we need to cover two important caveats of our research: one concerning the size of the effect and one concerning the context in which such interpretations are made.</p><p>First, the effects generally reported in the literature are inflated <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> because of a bias favouring the publication of significant results, which might distort our perception of effect size. Here, we have transparently reported all of the three studies we conducted to assess the practical significance of the "1-in-X" effect, hence we believe that our estimate of the effect size does not suffer from such a distortion. Due to the high prevalence of "1-in-X" ratios in health communication, the small effect on decision can have a big cumulative effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Second, we have considered a context of informed decision-making where the objective is to communicate the information as accurately as possible. However, there might be different contexts such as health change and persuasion, in which practitioners might wish to emphasise the risks and therefore use "1-in-X" ratios.</p><p>Bearing these caveats in mind, we need to pay further consideration to the costs and benefits associated with the change of formats following the framework of determining a sufficiently important difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Given the small but cumulative harmful effect that the "1-in-X" ratios can bring to patients, and considering the fact that there is virtually no cost involved in changing the format, we believe that the ratio should be used sparsely. This conclusion is aligned with the calls to abandon "1-in-X" ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>One possible limitation in our research is whether or not we can trust the conclusion since we have presented mixed findings (two out of three experiments were significant).</p><p>First, by conducting an internal meta-analysis, we demonstrated that the effect is present and statistically significant. Second, the mixed findings are far more common than they are reported. We can calculate the support for the null and alternative hypothesis in our research <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. The probability of two out of three studies being significant, given the assumption that the alternative hypothesis is true (while having 80% power) is 38.4% and only 0.7% given the assumption that the null hypothesis is true (while having 5% alpha). The likelihood ratio (LR) then compares how well the two hypotheses predict the data; in this case LR = 0.384/0.007 = 55, which indicates that the observed results are around 55 times more likely to occur under the assumption that the alternative hypothesis is true rather than under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Another limitation of our studies is that we focused on hypothetical decisions. Future research should focus on the impact of ratios on Running Head: PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE "1-IN-X" EFFECT 20 actual rather than hypothetical decisions. The evidence available so far pinpoints the fact that there are no big differences in the perceived probability between hypothetical and actual situations of probability assessment in different studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>, which indicates that we can expect to observe similar findings in real life as we have found in hypothetical situations.</p><p>Finally, the current research does not address the issue of the psychological processes underlying the "1-in-X" effect. Future research should clarify these processes and test proposals suggested in prior research such as gist interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, ease of imagination <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, or association with severity and its subsequent overestimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>To conclude, we found that "1-in-X" ratios led to higher subjective probability perception compared with "N-in-X*N" ratios. This difference drove the changes in decisions.</p><p>We also found that people of different ages, genders or education levels were not more prone to these changes. Due to the high prevalence of "1-in-X" ratios, the relatively small effect of these ratios grows into a cumulative effect on decision-making, which might obscure informed decision-making. As there are minimal costs associated with the format use, health communicators wanting to promote accurate risk perceptions should use "N-in-X*N" ratios instead.</p></div>

Method Participants and Design. The same a priori stopping rule was used as in Experiment 1 (i.e., at least 597 participants to detect a small effect). A different sample of 605 participants was recruited from an online panel (Prolific Academic). We used the same eligibility criteria as in Experiment 1. Participants were mostly women (69.6%), the majority of whom had either finished high school (37.9%) or held an undergraduate degree (43.3%). Their ages ranged from 18 to 68 years (M = 35.6, SD = 11.6 years). The sample consisted of managers and working professionals (25.5%), unemployed individuals, including students and homemakers (24.6%), workers in sales and offices (12.9%), in services (6.3%) or in another occupation.</figDesc></figure>

This aimed to test the robustness of the effect on decision-making, specifically whether the effect on decision is dependent on mental representations of risk stored in short-term memory as is often the case in real-life decisions. Since we found no order effects on probability and decision, we presented the measures in a fixed order: the main variable of interestdecision-makingwas always presented first and the probability question second.Method Participants and Design. A similar power consideration was applied to define an a priori stopping rule as in the previous experiments. A sample of 831 participants was recruited from a different online panel to that of Experiments 1 and 2 (Bilendi) which was part of a larger study investigating other health-related topics. The sample composition roughly matched the composition of the UK adult population in terms of age, gender, education and living area.</figDesc></figure>
