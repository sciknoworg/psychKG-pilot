				<p>Background: Evidence-based treatments for depression exist but not all patients benefit from them. Efforts to develop predictive models that can assist clinicians in allocating treatments are ongoing, but there are major issues with acquiring the volume and breadth of data needed to train these models. We developed a protocol for internetbased data collection methods that may help advance this field. Methods: A fully internet-based protocol was used to gather repeated observational data from two transdiagnostic patient cohorts receiving internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) (N = 600) or antidepressant medication treatment (N = 110). At baseline, participants provided &gt;600 data points of self-report data, spanning sociodemographics, lifestyle, physical health, clinical and other psychological variables and completed 4 cognitive tests. They were followed weekly and completed another detailed clinical and cognitive assessment at week 4. In this paper, we describe our study design in detail and evaluate its methodological feasibility. In evaluating, we report on the demographic and clinical characteristics of participants, treatment adherence, study retention and compliance, indicators of data quality, and qualitative feedback from patients on study design and implementation. Results: Participant retention was 92% at week 3 and 84% for the final assessment. The relatively short study duration of 4 weeks was sufficient to reveal early treatment effects; there were significant reductions in 11 transdiagnostic psychiatric symptoms assessed, with the largest improvement seen for depression. Most participants (66%) reported being distracted at some point during the study, 11% failed 1 or more attention checks and 3% consumed an intoxicating substance. Data quality was nonetheless high, with near perfect 4-week test retest reliability for self-reported height (ICC = 0.97). Conclusions: An internet-based methodology can be used efficiently to gather large amounts of detailed patient data during iCBT and antidepressant treatment. Recruitment was rapid and retention was relatively high. The detailed data we report will help guide the design of future large-scale internet-based studies for predicting treatment outcomes in depression. The adoption of internet-based study designs may improve statistical power in this field and accelerate the search for tools that can aid clinical decisionmaking.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>A range of evidence-based treatments for depression exist, including pharmacotherapy, psychological therapies, and neurostimulation. These treatments work on average, but not all patients benefit. In fact, clinical trial data suggests that only 50% of patients respond to the initial treatment they receive, with just 30% achieving remission <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">2)</ref>. Many patients must try multiple, sequential and/or parallel treatments on a trial-and-error basis, each taking weeks or months for potential therapeutic effects to unfold, without guarantee of success <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">4)</ref>. This leads to sustained human suffering, accumulation of side-effects, and substantial economic costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">6)</ref>.</p><p>One potential approach to reducing trial-and-error in psychological treatment is to develop data-informed tools that can assist mental health practitioners in prescribing the best treatment for each individual patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(7)</ref>. This type of 'precision medicine' approach is not new; for more than two decades researchers have studied the potential predictive power of a wide range of factors including socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, as well as biomarkers derived from genetic, biochemical and neuroimaging data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">9)</ref>. While numerous factors have been observed to have an association with treatment response in individuals studies, effect sizes are mostly too small to have real-world clinical value <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">10)</ref>.</p><p>A solution to this problem may lie in the development of multivariable models that are informed by data from complementary domains, such as cognitive, (neuro)physiological and molecular data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(13)</ref>. Machine learning is one such method that can iteratively and contemporaneously analyse multiple variables and their interaction, aggregating small individual effects into single predictive values <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(14)</ref>. Using machine learning to optimise treatment approaches is promising, but to-date the published work in depression has thus far suffered from significant quality issues. A recent review on predicting treatment outcomes in depression highlighted that out of 54 published studies assessed, just 8 met basic quality control standards of including a large sample size (i.e., &gt;100 participants) and an adequate validation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(15)</ref>. For those studies that have large sample sizes, data tend to come from clinical trials that have access to only a small number of variables per patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(17)</ref>. This was the case for a model developed by Chekroud and colleagues (2016) that identified 25 self-report demographics and clinical measures which predicted treatment response to antidepressants with 60% accuracy (49% sensitivity and 71% specificity) in their heldout test dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(18)</ref>. Subsequently, Iniesta and colleagues (2018) trained an algorithm using a combination of clinical and molecular genetic data, which achieved high predictive performance (0.77 in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) in external data (69% sensitivity and 71% specificity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(19)</ref>. This suggests that incorporating different data modalities may be an important next step for improving the performance of these models.</p><p>One way to acquire these datasets is through multi-site collaboration via research consortia such as the EMBARC <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(20)</ref>, PReDICT <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(21)</ref> and iSPOT-D <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(22)</ref> studies. These large randomised controlled trials are gold-standard, but are costly, time-consuming, resource intensive, and due to the involvement of many sites, are logistically complex. Therefore, it would be of great value to complement these approaches with alternative methods that can provide us with even larger datasets, more rapidly, and in more diverse cohorts.</p><p>The Precision in Psychiatry (PIP) study uses an internet-based protocol to recruit, comprehensively assess and follow through time, mental health patients about to initiate internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy or antidepressant medication. We outline in detail the design of this study, the patient demographic and clinical characteristics, pre-post clinical changes, study attrition, schedule compliance, treatment adherence, data quality, and qualitative patient-perspectives gathered from exit surveys. In detailing our approach here, we seek to provide guidance for the design of future internet-based studies by highlighting which factors favourably influence recruitment and data collection. We discuss the benefits and limitations of this methodology and make suggestions for future studies adopting a similar approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Identification and Recruitment</head><p>Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT). Participants receiving clinician-guided iCBT on the SilverCloud Health platform were digitally recruited from two sites: (i) a National Health Service (NHS) mental health service 'Talking Therapies' based near Reading, West London, United Kingdom (Berkshire Foundation Trust) and (ii) a mental health charity based in Dublin, Ireland (Aware Ireland) that provides free education programs, and information services for the public impacted by mood-related conditions. A key difference across sites was that at Talking Therapies, patients have an initial consultation with a clinician who completes an initial assessment of the patient's needs before deciding whether to offer them an iCBT program via SilverCloud. In contrast, individuals recruited via the Aware charity are self-referring. At both sites, the iCBT intervention includes clinician support via the platform. At Berkshire, clinical supporters are made up of specially trained psychology graduates called Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs). At Aware, graduate volunteers provide the clinical support. All supporters have been trained in using the platform. Potential participants at each site received an automated 'Welcome' email upon registering for SilverCloud, which contained an invitation to participate in this study via a web-link.</p><p>Antidepressant Medication. Individuals initiating antidepressant medication were recruited internationally using a combination of online (Google Ads, social media platforms, mental health charities) and in-print advertisement campaigns (pharmacies, general practitioners, counselling clinics, newsletters). Participants in the antidepressant arm were asked to provide details on the type and dosage of the antidepressant medication treatment they were prescribed, and to upload a photograph of their prescription for verification purposes. Participants were not required to be medicationfree prior to starting the study; they were eligible to participate if they were about to experience a change in pharmacotherapy; initiating, switching, or adding medication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screening and Study Entry Requirements</head><p>Screening. In both treatment arms, participants read the information sheet online and provided electronic consent. Participants were notified that their participation was entirely voluntary and would not impact on their care in any way, and that their clinician would not be notified about their participation. They were also informed that they were free to terminate or alter their treatment at any time during the study, and that this would not affect their ability to continue to participate and receive payment. After providing informed consent, participants in both arms were directed to a screening survey used to determine their eligibility. Participants provided their age, English language fluency, confirmed computer access, email address, listed medications they were taking, and told us where they heard about the study. Participants indicated whether they had already started treatment or if they were planning to start in the future and provided an approximate treatment start date. As stated above, participants in the antidepressant arm also provided a photo of their prescription, which was manually checked for drug name, dose, and date prior to their admission. All participants completed the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(23)</ref>, which was used to determine eligibility. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. An overview of study design. Participants who gave informed consent and met our inclusion/exclusion criteria were invited to complete the baseline assessment, comprising cognitive tests, and a variety of self-report questions concerning participants' treatment, their clinical symptoms, psychosocial factors, lifestyle, and socio-demographics. Participants were sent an invitation for a weekly check-in assessment on a scheduled basis for 3 consecutive weeks, which tracked any changes in clinical symptoms and treatment adherence. Participants completed the study with a fifth and final assessment after 4 weeks of treatment, which was an abbreviated version of the baseline assessment.</p><p>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Participants in both arms were excluded if they were not between 18-70 years of age, were not fluent in English or reported that they did not have computer access. Participants were also required to score a 10 or above on the WSAS (23) which is a transdiagnostic measure capturing impairments in daily functioning arising from mental health problems. In the antidepressant arm, participants were required to have recently started (&lt;2 days ago) or be planning to start/change treatment soon (&lt;2 days from now). If they indicated that they were planning to start their treatment in &gt;2 days after the study sign-up date, they were contacted via email and advised to reapply for the study closer to the date of the treatment start. In the iCBT arm, participants were invited to our study via automated email directly following their registration on the SilverCloud platform, which ensured that all participants had started treatment to some minimal extent prior to signing up for our study. Given the self-paced nature of iCBT (i.e., users undertake the treatment at their own pace, and can freely choose the order of intervention modules and content they complete in), we also asked participants to indicate when they planned to start treatment. Participants who indicated that they had already started iCBT &gt;2 days prior to signing up were not included in the study, and those who indicated that they planned to start in &gt;2 days were contacted via email, and a treatment start date and study schedule agreed upon with the research team manually. In those cases, patients had technically registered on the platform, but were not planning to engage in the modules immediately for various personal reasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Schedule</head><p>If participants were deemed eligible to take part in the study, they were sent an individualised study schedule and a web-link for completing the baseline assessment. While we endeavoured to have participants complete the baseline on the same day they initiated treatment, we took a pragmatic and flexible approach, allowing participants a window of 4 days from their treatment start date in which to complete the baseline assessment. Four participants in the antidepressant arm completed their baseline assessments 5 days after their treatment start date due in part to administrative issues, and we chose to retain their data for analysis. In the iCBT arm, there were no participants outside of this criterion. Weekly check-in assessments and the final assessment for each participant were approximately scheduled at a 7-day interval following their treatment start date and were provided to participants 1 day before they were due with the instruction to complete them on the following day. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an overview of the study design and the assessments involved at each timepoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Measure</head><p>The primary outcome measure for this study is percent change in depression symptom severity on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -Self-Report (QIDS-SR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(24)</ref>. For certain types of planned machine learning analysis that require categorical outcomes, we binarize this as 'early response', defined as ≥30% pre-post improvement. We selected this because (i) participants are not expected to achieve 'response' (i.e., ≥50% pre-post improvement in QIDS-SR) or remission (i.e., QIDS-SR score of ≤5) in a 4 week timeframe and (ii) prior work has shown that this threshold of early response is a strong indicator of 8-week clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(25)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Assessment</head><p>The baseline assessment took approximately 1.5-2 hours to complete and required a mouse and a keyboard. Six categories of data were gathered, spanning (i) clinical data, (ii) treatment data, (iii) cognitive test data, (iv) socio-demographics, (v) psychosocial factors and (vi) lifestyle factors (see Additional File 2 -Variable Directory for a full outline of variables collected in the study).</p><p>Clinical Data. To assess whether treatment has a transdiagnostic effect on mental health, we considered the WSAS as a secondary outcome, measuring general impairment in psychosocial functioning due to mental health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(23)</ref>. To assess specific clinical changes, we administered a range of clinical self-report scales assessing obsessive-compulsive disorder measured by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory -Revised (OCI-R) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(26)</ref>, depression measured by the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(27)</ref>, trait anxiety measured by the trait portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(28)</ref>, alcohol addiction measured by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(29)</ref>, apathy measured by the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(30)</ref>, eating disorders measured by the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26) (31), impulsivity measured by the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-10) (32), schizotypy measured by the Short Scales for Measuring Schizotypy (SSMS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(33)</ref>, and social anxiety measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(34)</ref>. These instruments allow for estimation of three transdiagnostic dimensions (anxious-depression, compulsivity, and intrusive thought and social withdrawal) based on factor loadings identified in a prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(35)</ref>. These transdiagnostic dimensions have been shown to map onto certain aspects of cognition better than standard questionnaires, such as model-based planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">36)</ref> and metacognitive bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">38)</ref>. In addition to self-report symptoms, we assessed our participants' history and chronicity of mental health problems. More specifically, we assessed the number of mental health episodes they have experienced, what age they were when they experienced their first mental health episode, the duration of their current mental health episode, the number of psychiatric diagnoses they had, and the number of close family members with psychiatric diagnoses. As previously mentioned, Chekroud and colleagues' study (2016) developed a predictive model that achieved ~60% accuracy in predicting antidepressant response in a re-analysis of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(18)</ref>. We further included eight miscellaneous items from this study in order to recapitulate their model as a benchmark against which to compare our own (see Additional File 2 -Variable Directory).</p><p>Treatment Variables. Treatment variables included history of medication and/or psychological treatments for mental health, concurrent medication and/or psychological treatments for mental health, as well as participants' expectations about the mental health treatment they were about to initiate. For participants in the iCBT treatment arm, we examined objective engagement data for each participant, which was provided by SilverCloud.</p><p>Cognitive Test Data. Participants completed 4 browser-based gamified cognitive tasks in randomised order, interspersed with blocks of self-report assessments as outlined in this section. These were implemented in JavaScript and Python, hosted on a server at Trinity College Dublin and were accessible through any commonly used web-browser. Participants completed a two-step decision making task <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">40)</ref> which estimates various reinforcement learning parameters, including separate estimates of model-based and model-free learning, choice perseveration, and learning rate. Prior studies have shown that model-based planning is linked to compulsivity in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(35)</ref> and compulsive disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(41)</ref>, which benefit from antidepressant medication (albeit at higher doses) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(42)</ref> and are commonly comorbid with anxiety and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(43)</ref>. The second task in our battery is an aversive learning task that manipulates environmental volatility <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(44)</ref> to assess the extent to which participants adjust their learning rate appropriately as volatility increases. A reduced sensitivity to volatility has been previously linked to trait anxiety and the functioning of the noradrenergic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(45)</ref>. The third task we included is a task measuring metacognitive bias and sensitivity in the context of perceptual decision making. Individuals who score high on a transdiagnostic dimension of anxious-depression symptoms have lower confidence in their decision-making, while those high in compulsivity have over-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">37)</ref>. Our final cognitive assessment was abstract reasoning using a computerised adaptive task based on Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(46)</ref>. Reasoning deficits are associated with risk for various mental health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(47)</ref>.</p><p>Socio-Demographics. In addition to age, which they reported at study intake, participants self-reported their sex, country of residence, race, marital status, education level, subjective social status, and employment status.</p><p>Psychosocial Variables. Perceived social support was assessed using the 12-item Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) (48), perceived stress was assessed using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (49), experience of stressful life events in the past 12 months was assessed using the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(50)</ref>, and childhood traumatic experiences were measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(51)</ref>.</p><p>Physical Health and Lifestyle. This included exercising habits, smoking habits, dietary quality, current and prior recreational drug use, height, and weight. Physical health comorbidities were measured by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) (52), and somatic symptoms were measured by the five items pertaining to stomach, back, limbs, head, and chest pain in the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) (53).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Weekly Check-Ins</head><p>Weekly check-in assessments were sent to participants in each week of the study. They could be completed using a computer, tablet or smartphone and took approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Participants had 4 days to complete these assessments or were otherwise excluded from further participation. They completed 3 standardised questionnaires each week, including the QIDS-SR for depression symptoms, the WSAS for impairment symptoms, and the OCI-R for OCD symptoms. In addition, participants also answered questions about treatment adherence, side effects and dosage changes (for those in the antidepressant arm), whether they initiated any other mental health treatments, and other extra relevant information they wished to inform the study co-ordinators after they have begun participation in the study (i.e., during weekly check-in assessments).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Assessment</head><p>Participants were asked to complete a detailed final assessment after 4 weeks of treatment. This was almost identical to the baseline assessment, comprising 4 gamified cognitive tasks and self-report questionnaires administrated in a randomised order. Selfreport variables gathered during the baseline assessment that were not expected to change (e.g., childhood trauma, age, education etc) were not re-collected (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref> in Additional File 1 -Supplementary Materials for schedule of assessments). Contingent on completion of the final assessment, a proportion of participants were invited to complete a short feedback survey on their experience of the study and to provide suggestions for future studies with similar scope and design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality Control</head><p>Participants completed their assessments in an at-home environment where traditional experimental control is absent. To understand how this might affect data quality, we included questions to help us identify bad quality data. At the end of both the baseline and final assessments, participants were asked if they were distracted during the session and if so, by what. They were also asked if they had consumed any substances (e.g., alcohol/drugs) 5 hours prior. Participants were assured their continued participation would not be affected by their response. We included a 'catch question' that was embedded in both the OCI-R and WSAS questionnaires at baseline and in the WSAS scale at all subsequent timepoints. These 6 catch questions asked participants to select a specific answer option if they were paying attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Interventions</head><p>Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT). SilverCloud provides lowintensity, clinician-guided iCBT intervention programs for a range of common mental health problems (e.g., 'Space from Depression', 'Space from Anxiety', 'Life Skills', 'Space from Stress'). The programs partially overlap in terms of content, but also have unique components. All follow evidence-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">55)</ref>. Each module takes approximately one hour to complete, and while users can self-pace, they are generally recommended to complete at least one module per week. The intervention comprises cognitive, emotional, and behavioural components (e.g., behavioural activation, self-monitoring, activity scheduling, mood, and lifestyle monitoring). Each module incorporates introductory quizzes and videos, interactive activities, informational content, as well as homework assignments and summaries. Personal stories and accounts from other users are also included into the presentation of the content. The interventions additionally provide tailored content and modules dependent on the user's clinical presentation (e.g., 'Challenging Core Beliefs' module for depressive symptoms; 'Worry Tree' activity for managing symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder). Although the programs are clinician-guided, users are welcome to engage with the modules and content at their own pace and in the order they opt. A clinician, typically an Assistant Psychologist or a Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner (56) trained in the delivery of SilverCloud iCBT programs, is assigned to a user once they have registered and guides their progress through the intervention. During treatment, the clinician reviews the user's progress while leaving feedback and responding to queries. Typically, 6 to 8 weekly/fortnightly review sessions are offered across the supported period of the intervention (up to 12 weeks), however, this depends on the user's specific needs.</p><p>Antidepressant Medication. Participants in the antidepressant group (N = 92) were initiating a range of antidepressant medications. Most (86%) were taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but 13% were taking serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), 7% taking atypical antidepressants, and 2% were taking tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Due to polypharmacy, these numbers do not add to 100%. 8% of participants were taking more than 1 antidepressant medication and 5% were taking another non-antidepressant medication. The most common antidepressant medications were Sertraline (40%), Escitalopram (19%), and Fluoxetine (15%) (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S2</ref>, S3, and S4 in Additional File 1 -Supplementary Materials). Most participants (90%) experienced side effects from their treatment, with the most common including sleep-related problems such as day-time sleepiness (59%) and night-time sleep disturbances (55%), gastrointestinal symptoms (52%), migraines and headaches (36%), and sexual problems (36%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compensation</head><p>Participants in all three arms were paid €60 in an accelerating payment schedule through PayPal or digital gift cards. Participants received €10 for completing the baseline assessment, €20 euros after the third weekly check-in, and €30 upon completion of the final assessment. The feedback survey was optional and compensated with an additional €10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>In this paper, data are reported on participants who have fully completed the study in the iCBT and antidepressant arms, recruited from 4 th February 2019 to 20 th July 2021 (N = 594). Though the analyses are mostly descriptive, where appropriate, participants' recruitment trajectory, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment, and study compliance data (e.g., retention rates) were compared between study arms using chi-square, t-tests, and repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA). The significance of results (p-value) is reported for context and comparison, however, this study is largely descriptive in nature rather than focusing on hypothesis testing. As such, no correction for multiple comparisons was conducted. To assess data quality, we reported on the numbers of participants who were inattentive, distracted or intoxicated; and to assess the impact of this on data quality, we compared response consistency (i.e., the correlation of similar self-reported items) across the groups who were and were not flagged by these criteria. Finally, a qualitative content analysis was conducted on four open-ended free-text questions from the online feedback survey. This method allows researchers to quantify concepts in the data by counting the number of times these concepts appeared, thus providing descriptive statistics fit for the quantitative reporting of this data <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(57)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Recruitment and Retention</head><p>Detailed information regarding recruitment and retention are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Recruitment for the antidepressant arm began in February 2019 and the iCBT arm began in March 2020. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">1</ref> For the iCBT arm, once both arms were active (Aware and Berkshire), we reached a peak recruitment rate of 59 per month, with a mean of 47 (SD = 10.14) (estimated for 12 months, August 2020 -July 2021). In the antidepressant arm, active paid and unpaid recruitment via multiple sources spanned February 2019 to March 2020 (13 months), with a peak of 15 per month and a mean of 7 (SD = 3.67). The arm remained open for participants after that time, but active advertising was halted <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>). At the time of article preparation, screening data from N = 1811 were assessed for eligibility across the iCBT (N = 1507) and antidepressant (N = 304) arms. Of those eligible participants, 63% of participants completed the baseline assessment (N = 710), comprising N = 600 in the iCBT arm and N = 110 in the antidepressant arm. Retention of baseline completers to weekly check-in 3 was excellent for all groups, with no significant differences between iCBT participants (93%) and antidepressant participants (92%), X 2 = 0.06 (1), p = 0.80. For the final assessment, those numbers dropped to 84% for both treatment arms. For study completers in the antidepressant arm, most were referred from Google Ads (39%), followed by advertisements through pharmacies (25%), social media campaigns (11%), and general practitioners (8%). For the iCBT group, all were referred from SilverCloud and most came from Talking Therapies in the United Kingdom (83%) and the remaining through Aware Ireland (17%). Once completed the assessment at each study timepoint, participants were progressed onto the next stage of the study. Participants were considered a 'completer' of the study if they completed the assessments fully at each study stage. If due to technical errors participants were not able to complete specific components of their assessments, it was deemed appropriate to progress them onto the next stage of the study or be financially compensated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic characteristics</head><p>Baseline characteristics of the study arms are presented in detail in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Participants in all three arms were primarily white, female, employed and third level educated. Groups did not differ in sex, but there was a trend for participants in the iCBT arm to be older than those in the antidepressant arm, t(590) = -1.78, p = 0.08. Participants in the iCBT arm came from the United Kingdom and Ireland (&gt;98%), whereas the antidepressant arm was more international with 17% coming from other regions around the world, X 2 = 86.93 (2), p &lt; 0.001. Education level, marital status, and subjective social status did not differ across study arms (all p ≥ 0.16), but there were greater rates of unemployment in the antidepressant arm, X 2 = 12.81 (2), p = 0.002.    <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(58)</ref>. The scale has a range of 0-10, where the higher the score, the higher the rating of subjective social status. Outliers were not excluded in the descriptive analyses of demographic characteristics. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Flow Chart</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Characteristics</head><p>Most participants reported having one or more mental health diagnoses <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref>. This differed across arms; 9% of participants in the antidepressant arm had no formal diagnosis versus 31% of the iCBT arm, X 2 = 21.67 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(2)</ref>, p &lt; 0.001. This was expected as a proportion of the CBT arm were self-referring. There was no difference across study arms in the number of participants reporting having a family member with a mental health condition, X 2 = 1.80 (3), p = 0.62. Participants in the antidepressant arm compared to the iCBT arm reported having more lifetime mental health episodes, X 2 = 11.09 (2), p = 0.004, as well as earlier age of onset, X 2 = 8.68 (2), p = 0.01, but there were no group differences in self-reported duration of current mental health episode, X 2 = 0.05, p = 0.96). There was a trend towards more participants in the iCBT arm being treatment-naïve at 45% versus 32% in the antidepressant arm, X 2 = 5.95 (3), p = 0.11. To assess expectations about treatment efficacy, participants rated on a scale from 0-9 ("I don't expect to feel any better" to "I expect to feel completely better"). Those in the iCBT arm had a trend towards higher expectations (M = 5.02, SD = 2.04) about treatment success than those in the antidepressant arm (M = 4.58, SD = 1.89), t(592) = -1.95, p = 0.05.</p><p>In terms of clinical severity at baseline, participants in the antidepressant arm had a mean QIDS-SR score of 16.51 (SD = 4.17), which is conventionally interpreted as corresponding to severe symptoms of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(24)</ref>. QIDS-SR scores were somewhat lower in the iCBT arm with a mean of 13.86 (SD = 4.28), which corresponds to moderate depression symptoms (t(592) = 5.47, p &lt; 0.001. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>). For WSAS, those in the antidepressant arm had a mean of 22.73 (SD = 6.84), which indicates severe impairment in functioning. In the iCBT arm, scores were again lower with a mean of 19.02 (SD = 6.65), falling in the moderate range, t(580) = 4.61, p &lt; 0.001. For the other symptoms we assessed, the trend continued for those in the antidepressant arm to have greater severity <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 3</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Adherence and Concurrent Treatments</head><p>For both groups, the treatment adherence was high by week 3, where over ≥97% of the iCBT group reported still undergoing treatment (i.e., 98% at WCI 1 and WCI 2 and 97% at WCI 3) and ≥98% of the antidepressant group reported still taking antidepressant medication (i.e., 99% at WCI 1 and WCI 2 and 98% at WCI 3). In the antidepressant arm, 4 participants altered the dosage of their medication during the study participation (N = 2 took less than prescribed and N = 2 took more than prescribed).</p><p>For the iCBT group, 29% were receiving another treatment during the study (N=148), of which 39 (8% of total iCBT arm) were taking concurrent medication and 109 (22%) were receiving a concurrent form of psychotherapy. For the antidepressant group, 9% (N=8) were taking at least one other medication for a mental health problem at the time of study intake and 36% (N=33) were receiving some form of psychotherapy. Thus, there were partial overlaps in the treatments received across the two study arms. 2 At baseline, N = 3 were missing AUDIT symptom score and N = 12 were missing WSAS symptom score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Post 4-Week Clinical Changes</head><p>Primary Outcome Measure. Participants in the antidepressant arm experienced a significantly larger percent reduction in QIDS-SR from baseline than those in the iCBT arm, t(589) = 2.73, p = 0.007, even after controlling for imbalances in baseline severity, F(1, 588) = 4.36, p = 0.04. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">3</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5D</ref> show the weekly percentage distribution of participants achieving early response, response, and remission throughout the study for each of the two treatment arms. For the iCBT arm, by week 4, 39% of participants have achieved 'early response' (i.e., a 30% reduction), 17% of participants have achieved 'response' (i.e., a 50% reduction) and 13% of participants have achieved 'remission' (i.e., a score ≤ 5). In comparison, by week 4, participants in the antidepressant arm exhibited significantly higher rate of early response at 51%, X 2 = 5.09 (1), p = 0.02, as well as rate of response at 29%, X 2 = 7.19 (1), p = 0.007, but no significant difference in their remission rate of 11%, X 2 = 0.24 <ref type="formula">1</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5A</ref>).</p><p>In terms of general functional impairments (WSAS), there were modest but significant improvements in both treatment groups. Participants in the iCBT arm saw their selfreported impairment reduce by 1.57 points (SD = 7.55) (8%), t(499) = 4.65, p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.21 and those in the antidepressant arm reported reductions of 3.09 points (SD = 8.46) (14%), t(79) = 3.27, p = 0.002, d = 0.37. These percentage changes did not differ significantly across the treatment arms, t(572) = 1.36, p = 0.17. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">4</ref> Consistent with a transdiagnostic perspective on mental health, clinical gains extended far beyond both depression symptoms and daily functioning. Analyses revealed significant reductions in most clinical symptoms gathered, in both treatment arms (all p&lt;0.05), except for schizotypy (p = 0.10), impulsivity (p= 0.95), and eating disorder symptoms (p = 0.05) in the antidepressant arm (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5B</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Change Trajectories</head><p>To understand the trajectory of treatment response, we examined the weekly depression scores measured on the QIDS-SR. We carried out a linear regression with QIDS-SR as the dependent variable and assessment week (0-4, within-subject) and treatment group (between subject) as independent variables. As expected, there was a linear effect of assessment week,  = -1.25, p &lt; 0.001, indicating that symptoms decreased with time. There was a main effect of group, such that symptoms were overall lower in the iCBT group (M = 11.9, SD = 4.84) when compared to the antidepressant group (M = 12.9, SD = 5.40),  = -1.86, p &lt; 0.001. There was a significant interaction between group and assessment week,  = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001. Tests of simple effects revealed significant differences across the study arms in depression at baseline only, such that as reported earlier, the iCBT group (M = 13.86, SD = 4.28) initiated the study with lower QIDS scores than the antidepressant group (M = 16.51, SD = 4.17),  = -2.65, p &lt; 0.001. There were however no group differences in depression scores at any other timepoint (all p &gt;= 0.21).</p><p>To identify where in treatment the biggest gains occurred and if this differed by group, we tested for significant changes in symptoms from week to week.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>iCBT Program Effects</head><p>Objective treatment engagement data were available from SilverCloud for almost all participants in the iCBT group (N = 491). Consistent with the self-paced nature of iCBT, we found that engagement varied considerably across participants (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  6A</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6B</ref>). For example, on average, participants spent just over 2 hours on the platform over the 4-week study period, with values ranging from 2.5 minutes to &gt;17 hours. This corresponded to participants on average viewing 37% of the program they received. On average, participants received two reviews from their supporter and completed 17 activities. Correlational analyses revealed associations between QIDS percent change and total time spent on the platform, r(483) = 0.11, p = 0.01 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6C</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>% (N) Range</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Schedule Compliance</head><p>On average, participants in the antidepressant arm completed the baseline assessment 1.24 days after initiating antidepressant medication (Median = 1, SD = 1.64, range = -3 to +5 days). For the iCBT cohort, this was reduced to 0.77 days (Median = 1, SD = 1.45, range = -2 to +4 days), which was significantly shorter than for the antidepressant arm, t(591) = 2.80, p = 0.005. For the iCBT cohort, we had the benefit of some objective data from the iCBT provider to contextualise the self-report. The median difference between self-reported treatment start date and the day participants first registered on the iCBT platform was +1 day (M = 1.76, SD = 2.90, range = -1 to +20) (i.e., registered for iCBT 1 day before reporting starting treatment). The due date for all subsequent assessments were based on the self-report treatment start date, regardless of whether their last assessment was completed slightly early or late. Weekly check-in assessments and the final assessment were provided to participants 1 day before they were due with the instruction to complete them on the following day. Despite this instruction, we found that many participants completed them immediately upon receipt (i.e., 1 day before due date). From the treatment initiation date, weekly check-in 1 was completed on average , which was significantly longer than in the iCBT arm, t(586) = 2.24, p = 0.03 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref>, <ref type="figure">Figure 7B</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S2</ref>).</p><p>Participants were requested to complete the baseline and final assessments in a single sitting, taking short breaks between sections. However, for a variety of practical and technical reasons, some participants were only able to partially complete their baseline or final assessment before returning later to complete the remaining sections. We defined participants as completing the section in one sitting if they did not take a break exceeding 4 hours between any of the study sections. Using this cut-off, 9% (N = 47) of participants in the iCBT arm and 23% of participants (N = 21) for the antidepressant arm did not complete the baseline assessment in one single session. Similarly, for the final session, 9% (N = 43) in the iCBT arm and 16% (N= 15) in the antidepressant arm did not complete it in a single session. Arm differences were significant at baseline, X 2 = 13.90 (1), p &lt; 0.001, and at final, X 2 = 5.28 <ref type="formula">1</ref>, p = 0.02. Of those who completed their assessments in a single session, the median time it took participants to complete the baseline assessment was 1.63 hours (SD = 0.77) and the median time to complete the final assessment was 1.30 hours (SD = 0.85). Participants were more likely to complete the brief weekly check-ins during daytime (6am-6pm: 76%) when compared to the baseline and final assessments (both 59%, X 2 = 62.71, p &lt; 0.001).  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Quality</head><p>At baseline, 66% reported being distracted in some way (iCBT n = 310, 65%, Antidepressant n = 61, 75%), with a trend for participants in the antidepressant arm to be more distracted than those in the iCBT arm, X 2 = 3.56 (1), p = 0.06. Overall, the most common types of distractions endorsed were family and friends (37%), background noise (32%), and phone (28%). In relation to intoxicating substances, at baseline, just 3% of participants informed us that they had taken one of our defined substances within 5 hours of starting the study (iCBT n = 14, 3%, Antidepressant n = 4, 5%), with no significant difference between groups, X 2 = 0.91 (1), p = 0.34. Of the very few participants who reported any form of substance use, 13 had consumed alcohol (2%), 5 reported marijuana use (&lt;1%) and 2 people reported using opiates (&lt;1%) (see <ref type="table">Table  S7</ref> and S8 in Additional File 1 -Supplementary Materials for similar trends in distraction and substance use items at final assessment). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">6</ref> In terms of our inattention 'catch questions', 11% (n = 63) of participants failed at least 1 of the 6 attention checks embedded in the study.

The majority of inattentive participants were only inattentive at one time (n = 47, 8% of total sample), with just 3% of the total sample (n = 16) failing more than one attention check. People were more likely to be inattentive at certain timepoints in the study, X 2 = 25.32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(5)</ref>, p &lt; 0.001. The longer, more burdensome assessment sessions had more attention lapses (baseline, check 1 N = 17, baseline, check 2: N = 35; final, check 1: n = 21) than the 3 brief weekly check-ins (1 check at each: n = 12, n=11, n=10, respectively). To further assess data quality, we examined participants' consistency in reporting their height at week 0 and week 4 (baseline and final assessments). Height reports were reliably measured across the two time points (ICC1 = 0.97), and there was no significant difference in the absolute size of the discrepancy of height reports based on whether participants were classed as inattentive or not, t(67) = -1.66, p = 0.10 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8B</ref>). Finally, we examined the internal consistency of self-report symptom assessments. At baseline, Cronbach's alpha was good for all scales (i.e., r &gt; 0.7), ranging from 0.71-0.95, and this rose to 0.81-0.95 at the final assessment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8D</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative Feedback</head><p>Of 155 invited, 135 participants completed the online feedback survey from 19/06/2020 to 13/10/2020, giving a response rate of 87%. Data were analysed for four open-ended free-text questions concerning what participants liked and disliked about the study, what they suggested could be added to the study, and whether they found the payment schedule to be satisfactory (see Additional File 1 -Supplementary Materials). When asked "What did you like about the study?", the most prominent theme emerging from the responses relates to Self-Reflection (40%). Participants liked how the study prompted them to reflect on aspects of their mental health they would not have done otherwise and helped them keep track of treatment progress through the weekly checkins. Another prominent theme was that participants found the study Easy to Complete (33%), citing convenience in terms of both online accessibility and flexibility with respect to assessment completion times and dates, the inclusion of breaks and email reminders, and the clarity of instructions. A good proportion of respondents said they liked the Gamified Tasks (24%) which some found interactive and challenging, and a further 20% Although 24% of participants reportedly liked the games, when asked "What did you dislike about the study?", a large number (89%) also cited the Gamified Tasks (89%), which were felt to be tedious (e.g., "repetitive", "boring", "lengthy"), and in some cases confusing, frustrating, and too difficult. The second most prominent theme in response to this question about dislikes referred to the overall Study Design and Mechanics (13%). Some did not like the length of baseline and follow-up assessments and overall timecommitment involved, while others had problems with study coordination, administrative or other logistical problems.</p><p>In terms of suggestions for additions to the study in future, most of the respondents suggested additional aspects of Self-Report (83%). Recommendations ranged from the inclusion of free-text and experience sampling to including a broader range of questions on treatment information, psychological states and behaviours, demographics, lifestyle, physical health, environmental factors, own perceptions of change/symptoms/problems, and positive mood. Another area for improvement pertained to the Study Mechanics and Design, including extending the overall study duration and including a longer-term follow-up assessment. A good proportion of participants (30%) reported there was Nothing they wished to add to the study. In relation to the payment schedule, participants were overwhelmingly satisfied, with only 7% citing a negative experience (e.g., missed/delayed payments, not worth the time-commitment). Most participants (71%) rated the payment schedule positive or very positive and some (33%) were neutral about it (e.g., "fine", "no complaints", "appropriate").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The adoption of online data collection in psychiatric research has seen a dramatic increase in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(59)</ref>, but much of this research remains cross-sectional and correlational in nature. The Precision in Psychiatry (PIP) study extends this conventional approach to create a foundation for longitudinal, treatment prediction research on depression. Our results demonstrate the successful use of an Internet-based method, we recruited and screened a large sample of individuals receiving iCBT (baseline N = 600, final N=502) and a smaller sample receiving antidepressant medication (baseline N = 110, final N = 92). For eligible patients, we acquired an extensive range of selfreport and cognitive measures (&gt;600 variables) at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment, in addition to brief weekly check-ins. In what follows, we discuss the benefits and limitations of this approach and put forward recommendations for future studies seeking to adopt a similar approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment at Scale, at Speed</head><p>The major success of the study in adopting an internet-based approach attributes to the efficiency with which we could recruit a large cohort of patients undertaking treatment for depression in a relatively short period of time. This was most evident in the iCBT arm where we reached a maximum recruitment rate of 47 patients completing the baseline assessment per month. This corresponded to just over 500 full study completers within one year and a half. While the antidepressant arm was slower and more expensive to recruit for, we nonetheless gathered data from close to 100 individuals in 13 months, which compared to conventional strategies for recruiting participants with clinical diagnoses, was rapid. This approach also benefitted from high retention rate, where 93% of participants were retained for 3 weeks, and 84% at week 4, following the final detailed assessment (1.5 hrs). This finding further indicates that research that does not require detailed cognitive and clinical follow-up data (i.e., studies focused purely on prediction), can expect better retention if they keep follow-up assessments brief (e.g., restricting to 1 or 2 self-report outcome measures). Qualitative feedback from users suggests that the flexibility of remote assessments delivered online may have helped us to recruit and retain them. With participants being able to take part from any location, and at any time, this reduces logistic challenges associated with traditional, in-person data collection methods (e.g., travel to in-person locations, 9-5 participation hours) and makes research available to people often underrepresented in research (e.g., those from rural areas, socially anxious, more severely disabled). Treatment adherence for those who remained in the study was very high at &gt;=97%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compatibility with Digital Therapy</head><p>Digital psychological interventions such as iCBT are becoming increasingly popular as they allow greater access to care at a reduced cost, while demonstrating similar effectiveness for those requiring low intensity intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">61)</ref>. There exists, however, little basic research examining the mechanisms of therapeutic change in iCBT, how it affects cognition, brain function, or indeed, who it is best suited to and why. We see this as an important opportunity for future work for several reasons. iCBT lends itself well to systematic research as the therapeutic content that patients have access to is standardised and reproducible, which solves issues of both inter-clinician and intraclinician variability in the delivery of in-person CBT and leads to more generalisable insights. Individual variability in engagement with the online platform can be tracked precisely via granular and objective treatment data (e.g., what modules, when, and for how long), which can be mined to understand moderators of treatment success <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">63)</ref>. This may be particularly useful for researchers and clinical providers aiming to identify active ingredients of successful CBT, for personalisation, precision and more. This combination of digitised therapy and digitised research may thus provide a much more direct route to real-world clinical integration than other less integrated approaches.</p><p>While our study required participants use a computer/laptop to complete the baseline and follow-up assessments, they had the additional option to complete weekly checkins via smartphone. Future research should consider adopting smartphones and smartwatches more substantially in data collection. They are not only more convenient for participants but are also a likely medium through which future clinical decision tools are deployed in future. Smartphones and smartwatches additionally allow researchers to collect other sources of data that might improve predictive/explanatory power, including passive sensor data such as heart rate, geospatial locations, sleep quality, and exercise, as well as more regular and ecological valid assessments such as experience sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(64)</ref>. Due to the online nature of this study, 'hard' biological measures such as those involving neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram and genetics (blood and saliva sampling) were not gathered. Instead, we opted for computerised tasks that probe aspects of cognition with moderately well-established neural correlates <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">65)</ref>. Cognitive tests have the advantage that they are easier and less expensive to collect than neuroimaging data, which will make integration and adoption of these data types into real-world clinical care much more practical <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(14)</ref>. Future work might also consider remote saliva collection or the use of at-home EEG wearables, to assess if these measures can add predictive value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Random Assignment in Naturalistic Design</head><p>The observational nature of this study reflects the 'real world' of treatment allocation (i.e., non-randomised), which places a fundamental limit on causal inference. Though it does not solve the problem of non-random assignment, we included more than one observational arm, which allows us to assess the generalisability and specificity of any treatment prediction model we develop to new cohorts and treatments. In terms of demographics, participants in both iCBT and antidepressant arms were primarily white, female, employed, third level educated. These sample characteristics are comparable to other large-scale studies recruiting for antidepressant treatment (2) and iCBT <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(55)</ref>. However, there were other baseline differences between the two arms. Participants in the antidepressant arm were marginally younger and more likely to be unemployed, but most notably they had more severe clinical presentations and symptoms than their iCBT counterparts. This was expected as it follows the guidelines of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program in NHS, where iCBT is typically prescribed first for mild to moderate depression before antidepressant medication is considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(66)</ref>. By week four, participants in the antidepressant group experienced greater symptom reduction. Prior research suggests comparable effectiveness of the two treatments (67), but the short timeframe of our study and the self-paced nature of the iCBT intervention likely made for a weaker overall 'dose' for this arm. Some participants in each arm were also receiving concurrent, overlapping treatments (8% of patients in the iCBT group taking medication, and 36% of the antidepressant group receiving some form of psychotherapy). This is a significant limitation of the inclusive study design we adopted, and insights regarding specificity or generality of any effects should be supported with sensitivity analyses (i.e., excluding participants undertaking concurrent treatments).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of Experimental Control</head><p>While we could not completely control when and if participants will complete each study section as per their schedule, to make participation as convenient and flexible as possible, we issued each study section one day before due-date and allowed participants a four-day window to complete it. As a result, participants on average completed assessments 1 day earlier than they were due, and participants overall differed in the intervals between starting treatment and completing baseline and subsequent sessions. While these differences were minimised, issues of timing are some of the most challenging for researchers working with internet-based methods to manage. As previously mentioned, online studies primarily rely on self-report, rather than clinician-assigned diagnoses or severity assessments. This raises legitimate concerns regarding the reliability and validity of online data gathered in a less-controlled environment when compared to traditional, in-lab / in-clinic settings. Online studies can be susceptible to inattentive and careless responding, as is the case for other forms of online research (e.g., crowdsourcing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(68)</ref>. At a minimum, prior research suggests that individuals tend to follow task instructions better when tested in-person versus at home <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(69)</ref>. Our analyses of the quality of the baseline data we gathered revealed that some participants failed to complete their assessments in a single sitting (11%), most reported being distracted during the study session (63%), and a few had even consumed intoxicating substances (3%). On the extreme end, some online platforms (e.g. Amazon's Mechanical Turk) are suffering from major quality control issues, with a recent paper finding that &gt;50% of respondents reported their own gender identity inconsistently at two time-points (70). We believe these more serious risks can be mitigated by adopting a more targeted recruitment protocol such as that described here, i.e., advertising the study to only those individuals eligible, using validation steps (prescription upload, registration requirement for iCBT), and ensuring that the mission of the study is aligned to the goals of the participants (i.e., improving mental health treatment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(70)</ref>. In terms of our more objective quality checks, just 11% of subjects were caught by any of our attention checks when filling in online questionnaires. Overall, we found the data to be of excellent quality; height (in inches) self-reported at week 0 and week 4 had near perfect inter-rater reliability. This exceeds the 2-week test-retest reliability of height (in adolescents) gathered using paper booklets (r = 0.93) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(71)</ref>.</p><p>Internal consistency of the self-report questionnaires administered was also high. QIDS had the lowest Cronbach's alpha at baseline of 0.71, comparable to that observed in another patient sample at treatment outset (alpha = 0.72) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(24)</ref>. In terms of measurement properties, inter-rater reliability (clinician agreement) for some of the most common mental health conditions, including depression, is relatively low for the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) (72), while self-report assessments enjoy much higher reliability, both in-person <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(73)</ref> and online <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(74)</ref>. Although self-report has these advantages, it must be acknowledged it may be less valid for use in mental health populations where insight is compromised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Depression is a highly heterogeneous disorder for which no single treatment intervention is universally effective. We need to move from a trial-and-error approach to treatment to one that is precise and where possible personalised. To this end, researchers are currently exploring the potential of developing clinical decision tools by training machine learning algorithms to predict clinical outcomes using measures that can be obtained easily and frequently, such as self-reported symptoms and cognitive measures. In order to obtain robust predictions at the single-patient level with this approach, we need sample sizes substantially larger than has been typical for psychiatric treatment research, e.g., including held-out datasets for testing the generalisability of predictions.</p><p>Our data suggest that Internet-based methods can achieve this, allowing us to gather rich, complex datasets from large cohorts, with measurable indicators of treatment adherence and engagement. We hope that the detailed data we have provided in this paper will be informative for designing future Internet-based studies in psychiatry. Additionally, once the ongoing PIP study has been completed, machine learning will be used to examine the feasibility of predicting individual treatment response over a fourweek interval. Generally, we anticipate that cognitive and clinical data acquired online will usefully complement other efforts to establish personalised methods for treatment allocation and outcome prediction.</p><p>Neuroscience and Department of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.

To examine whether the inclusion of a range of programs had effects on treatment response, we compared QIDS percent change across participants undertaking different iCBT program types. Specifically, we compared data from the most utilised programs including Space from Depression, Space from Depression &amp; Anxiety, Space from Anxiety, Space from Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Life Skills. Miscellaneous programs were merged into an 'Others' category (see Additional File 2 -Variable Directory). A one-way ANOVA demonstrated no significant effect of program type on depression percent change score measured by the QIDS, F(4, 483) = 0.79, p = 0.53, indicating that despite there being some variation in the specific iCBT programs participants received, the treatment effect of iCBT on depression was not dependent on program type (Figure 6E).<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">5</ref> </figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Keep Assessments Brief</head><p>Retention was high for brief, self-report assessments and in particular weekly check-ins were well-received by patients wishing to track their progress through treatment. Cognitive tests were by far the most disliked component of our study. Considerable work is needed to make these more tolerable for participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Ensure Incentives are Aligned</head><p>The key to quality data in an online environment is to keep incentives aligned. Participants in our study resonated with the mission of the study and/or enjoyed the opportunity for self-reflection. Future research should be sensitive to these motivations and (i) communicate the mission of the study clearly, early, and often, (ii) supply participants with information about study outcomes at the time of publication, (iii) solicit feedback from participants and (iv) consider a graphical display where service users can visualise their progress throughout treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Make Participation Easy</head><p>The ease of participation is imperative to achieving successful online recruitment, for example, allowing participants to complete assessments remotely and at a time convenient to them. In addition to a PC/laptop, smartphone and smartwatch may be incorporated in future for increased convenience in online data collection. They can further facilitate the collection of different sorts of data, such as mobility data, sleep, and experience sampling data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Issue Regular Reminders, be Flexible and Pragmatic</head><p>To encourage retention, a timely reminder for each assessment should be delivered a day prior to due date, and a small window for completion may be provided to increase flexibility for participants to complete each assessment. Sensitivity analyses can be used to ensure late or early assessments do not confound results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Data Quality is not a Given</head><p>Data quality indicators (e.g., catch questions, distraction probes, and stable variables for high test-retest reliability analysis) should continue to be included for assessing the quality of self-report online data. The online research environment changes and is potentially vulnerable to BOTS or dishonest respondents. To reduce the threat this poses to valid research, recruitment should be targeted to those initiating treatment and include a validation (prescription photo, iCBT registration).</p></div>
