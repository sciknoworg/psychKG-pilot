			<abstract>
				<p>Adaptive behavior depends on appropriate responses to environmental uncertainty. Incidental sensory events might simply be distracting and increase errors, but alternatively could lead to stereotyped responses despite their irrelevance. To evaluate these two possibilities, we tested whether task-irrelevant sensory prediction errors influence risky decision making across multiple experiments (n=1200). Rare auditory sequences preceding option presentation systematically increased risk taking and increased switching away from previously chosen options. The two effects were dissociable by manipulating auditory statistics: when rare sequences ended on standard tones, including when rare sequences consisted only of standard tones, participants were more likely to switch options but not more likely to take risks. Computational modelling revealed that these effects could not be explained by increased decision noise but could be explained by value-independent risky bias and perseveration parameters. Our findings suggest that incidental sounds may influence many of the decisions we make in daily life.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The ability to respond appropriately to unexpected events is crucial for survival because such events can signal potential rewards or threats. Unexpected events have been theorized to motivate exploratory behaviors, allowing humans to learn about unfamiliar stimuli (1) and detect environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. Appropriate responses to environmental uncertainty are a hallmark of adaptive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</p><p>A common source of environmental uncertainty is sensory events. Unpredictable sensory events, or sensory prediction errors, are salient and can attract attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In noisy urban environments, these sources of environmental uncertainty are often irrelevant for one's goals. Unpredictable irrelevant sensory information can lead to impaired performance in decision-making tasks including with incidental visual distractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, changes in visual salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, acoustic frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, and stimulus loudness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. While these effects could be explained by attentional lapses or increased noise in the decision process, sensory prediction errors could alternatively elicit systematic stereotyped responses, fixed or repetitive behaviors without obvious adaptive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. In particular, stereotyped responses might include uncertainty seeking and option switching, consistent with the uncertainty reduction responses to task-relevant uncertainty observed in learning paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. However, such responses are often adaptive in learning paradigms. It is unknown whether stereotyped responses to environmental uncertainty are present even when any such responses are not adaptive.</p><p>To test whether sensory prediction errors systematically influence risky decision making, we interleave an established risky decision-making paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> with auditory stimuli that previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref> have shown elicit multiple forms of surprise. Decision making under uncertainty is well studied with established theoretical models able to account for choices between safe and risky options <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Importantly, the value of potential options in risky decision-making tasks can be parametrically varied in a manner that is independent and unpredictable from trial to trial. This permits any influence of incidental sensory prediction errors on choice to be separated from the effect of changing option values, avoiding confounds that arise in tasks that require learning. Auditory stimuli are easily manipulated, statistically well defined, and amenable to eliciting multiple forms of surprise with dissociable neurophysiological correlates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. Consistent with its use in this literature, we use the term 'surprise' to refer to sensory prediction errors, which entails expectation violations according to environmental statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. In this literature, use of this term does not imply that individuals find stimuli subjectively surprising, only that stimuli are unpredictable.</p><p>By design, the auditory stimuli in our experiments do not carry information that would enhance future decision making, and therefore could have no impact on behavior. Incidental sounds could increase attentional lapses or lead to greater decision noise, which may explain psychological accounts of incidental sensory information being associated with performance deficits (6-9). Alternatively, taskirrelevant sensory prediction errors could introduce systematic stereotyped responses, including increased risk taking and increased option switching. This pattern of results would be consistent with the results from learning paradigms of increased exploration in response to task-relevant uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. This would also be consistent with converging evidence from human and animal models of neuromodulatory mechanisms relating surprise and arousal to behavior. Phasic changes in arousal following administration of a noradrenergic drug increased risk taking in rodents when salient audiovisual cues are paired with outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. A growing body of evidence has also shown that dopamine neurons respond not only to rewards but also to value-neutral sensory information like unexpected changes in stimulus identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, highlighting a link between sensory surprise and dopamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. Endogenous fluctuations of dopaminergic midbrain activity preceding stimulus onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> and direct D1 receptor stimulation (41) predicted risk taking. Notably, pharmacologically boosting dopamine increased value-independent risk taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>. Pharmacologically boosting dopamine also increased option switching in learning paradigms in a manner that does not depend on rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45)</ref>.</p><p>In each trial of our paradigm, participants wearing earphones chose between risky and safe options, with risky options having equal probabilities of winning or losing <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>; see Methods). Immediately before option onset for every choice trial, participants passively listened to a six-tone auditory sequence in which 75% of options were presented after one "common" sequence and 25% of options were presented after another "rare" sequence with a different ending. Consistent with our predictions, we found in two experiments (n=400) that rare auditory sequences increased risk taking and option switching relative to common sequences. When tone sequences were equally balanced in two experiments (n=400), consequent differences in risk-taking and option-switching behavior were eliminated. Using computational models, we found that these two effects do not depend on value and are dissociable. In two additional experiments (n=400), rare sequences that ended on standard tones did not increase risk taking but did increase option switching, consistent with option switching being increased by rare sequences but not rare sequence features (i.e., deviant tones), which are instead associated with greater risk taking). These findings demonstrate that surprising sounds systematically influence human behavior in multiple ways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Experimental design. Participants chose between risky and safe options on each trial and received feedback after a 1.3 second delay. Prior to option onset in every trial, six auditory tones of 100</head><p>millisecond duration were presented with 400 milliseconds between sounds. 75% of trials featured "common" sequences (AAAAAA in Experiments 1 and 2) and 25% of trials featured "rare" sequences that ended with a surprising deviant tone (AAAAAB or AAAAAC in Experiments 1 and 2). The auditory sequences were irrelevant to reward outcomes. Experiments 1 and 2 differed only in the spatial arrangement of options: in Experiment 1, the risky option was always on the left side; in Experiment 2, the spatial location of the risky option alternated every 10 trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensory prediction errors increase risk taking.</head><p>Participants chose the risky option in 53.16 ± 1.17% (mean ± SEM) of trials in Experiment 1 (n = 200). We first asked whether rare auditory sequences increased risk taking. On average, participants chose the risky option 2.06 ± 1.09% more on rare trials, which ended on a deviant tone, compared to common trials (p = 0.005, two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>). In Experiment 2 (n = 200), when the left-right spatial arrangement of options alternated every 10 trials, participants chose the risky option in 47.54 ± 0.98% of trials, less than in Experiment 1 (p &lt; 0.001, two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Moreover, median reaction times in Experiment 2 (1.32 ± 0.03 s) were slower compared to Experiment 1 (1.26 ± 0.03 s; p = 0.028), consistent with a modest increase in cognitive demand for a non-static spatial arrangement of options. We replicated the increased risk-taking effect, finding that participants chose the risky option 4.03 ± 1.06% more on rare compared to common trials (p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>). For further analysis in subsets of trials, we combined Experiment 1 and 2 datasets. Irrespective of trial type, we observed greater risk taking after rare compared to common trials (n = 400; Gain trials: p &lt; 0.001, 3.09 ± 1.01%; Mixed trials: p = 0.010, 2.75 ± 0.97%; Loss trials: p &lt; 0.001, 3.17 ± 0.88%; <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). Thus, the risk-taking effect does not depend on option valence, and is present both in Gain trials where people tend to take risks (64.47 ± 1.12%) and in Loss trials where they tend not to (36.84 ± 1.16%).  We fitted choice behavior in individual participants with a parametric decision model based on Prospect Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>. The 4-parameter model (SI Methods), which included parameters for loss aversion, risk aversion in gains and losses, and choice stochasticity (i.e., decision noise), fit the behavior well in both Experiment 1 (pseudo-r 2 = 0.208 ± 0.011, mean ± SEM) and Experiment 2 (pseudo-r 2 = 0.223 ± 0.012). On average, participants had loss aversion coefficients greater than 1, consistent with the presence of loss aversion in our population (Experiment 1: = 2.121 ± 0.123, p &lt; 0.0001; Experiment 2: = 2.094 ± 0.120, p &lt; 0.0001; <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>). To test whether the increased risk taking varied as the subjective value of risk taking varied across trials, we binned participant trials in both experiments according to whether the model-derived probability of choosing the risky option was below or above 50% for the subset of participants (n = 319) who had at least 25% of trials in each bin. The risk-taking effect was present ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>) both for trials where participants tended to take risks (p = 0.005, 1.61 ± 0.84%) in which model-derived risk choice probability was at least 50%, and for trials where participants tended not to take risks (p &lt; 0.0001, 3.69 ± 0.90%) in which the model-derived risk choice probability was less than 50%.</p><p>Several studies have highlighted the importance of quantifying influences on risk taking that do not depend on the subjective value of risky and safe options, particularly in relation to potential dopaminergic influences on behavior. These influences can be accounted for by a value-independent gambling bias parameter in the softmax choice probability function <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48)</ref>. To account for any value-independent influence on risk taking that cannot be captured by risk or loss aversion, we introduced a Risky Bias parameter, , to the softmax rule in the Prospect Theory model such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) = 1 1 + (−[μ( ( ) − ( )) + ])</formula><p>A positive Risky Bias parameter reflects an increased tendency to choose risky options. Conversely, a negative Risky Bias parameter reflects an increased tendency to choose the safe option. Model comparison using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) confirmed that this Risky Bias model explained the choice data in Experiments 1 and 2 better than the Prospect Theory model (Risky Bias model: AIC = 68323; Prospect Theory model: AIC = 71219; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S2</ref>). The average Risky Bias parameter was lower in Experiment 2 relative to Experiment 1 (Experiment 1: 0.100 ± 0.067; Experiment 2: -0.233 ± 0.062; p &lt; 0.001), consistent with our observation that risk taking overall was reduced in Experiment 2.</p><p>We next tested whether the risk-taking effect could be explained by a change in the Risky Bias parameter. We included an additional riskybias difference parameter in rare trials to capture any change in rare compared to common trials. For comparison, we considered four alternative models that each featured a single difference parameter for one of the other four parameters in Prospect Theory ( μ , λ , α gain , α loss ). Model comparison showed that the Risky Bias Difference model, which featured a riskybias difference parameter, best explained the data <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S2</ref>). Consistent with the overall pattern of increased risk taking in rare relative to common trials in Experiments 1 and 2 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2D</ref>), riskybias difference parameters were positive on average in both experiments (Experiment 1: p = 0.005, 0.121 ± 0.064; Experiment 2: p &lt; 0.001, 0.233 ± 0.069; <ref type="figure">Figure 2E</ref>). Data simulated using the Risky Bias Difference model with parameters estimated from individual participants (n = 400) showed the same overall pattern of increased risk taking in rare relative to common trials in all three trial types ( <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that surprising sounds lead to an increase in risk taking that can be explained by a single model parameter that captures change in a value-independent influence on risk taking.</p><p>Sensory prediction errors increased switching between options. Next, we investigated whether surprising sounds influence how likely participants are to repeat choices. We quantified this tendency by computing the percentage of trials in which the same choice (e.g., choosing the safe option) was made on consecutive trials. In Experiment 1, participants stayed with the previously chosen option in 59.10 ± 0.72% (mean ± SEM) of trials. On average, participants stayed with their previous choice less frequently on rare compared to common trials (p &lt; 0.0001, -3.69 ± 0.81%; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3A</ref>). In Experiment 2, which had an alternating left-right spatial arrangement of risky and safe options, participants repeated choices 54.91 ± 0.63% of the time, less frequently compared to Experiment 1 (p &lt; 0.0001). Nevertheless, in Experiment 2, participants also stayed with their previous choice less frequently on rare compared to common trials (p &lt; 0.001, -3.62 ± 0.89%; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3A)</ref>. Thus, the effect of surprising sounds on increasing the probability of switching options was present in experiments with different overall levels of perseveration.</p><p>Irrespective of trial type, participants chose to stay with the previous option less on rare relative to common trials (n = 400, Gain trials: p &lt; 0.001, -3.51 ± 0.89%; Mixed trials: p &lt; 0.0001, -4.63 ± 0.87%; Loss trials: p = 0.006, -2.68 ± 0.82%; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3B</ref>). Thus, the option-switching effect is present both in trial types with only potential gains and in trial types with only potential losses. Next, we investigated whether the decrease in staying with previous options after rare sequences was present both on trials for which staying was or was not predicted by the Prospect Theory model. We binned trials according to whether the choice probability of staying with the previous option predicted by Prospect Theory was above or below 50%. Among participants who had at least 25% of data in both bins (n = 385), the option-switching effect was present both for trials where participants were predicted to stay with the previous option (p &lt; 0.0001; -5.14 ± 0.80%), and for trials where participants were predicted not to stay with the previous option (p = 0.019; -1.57 ± 0.71%; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3C</ref>). Thus, both between and within trial types we see that the option-switching effect is present irrespective of whether given trials have high or low predicted option repetition probability. For both experiments, the probability of staying with the previous choice (i.e., the safe or risky option) was lower for rare compared to common trials. B. The probability of staying was lower for rare compared to common trials irrespective of trial type. C. Trials were binned based on whether the model-predicted choice probability of staying with the previous option was above or below 50%. The increase in option switching occurred both when the stay probability was high or low. D. We included a Perseveration parameter in the softmax equation, biasing choice according to the option selected in the previous trial. Model comparison using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) confirmed that adding a Perseveration parameter to the Risky Bias model explained the choice data in Experiments 1 and 2 better (Risky Bias model: AIC = 68323; Risky Bias Perseveration model: AIC = 67548). The Perseveration parameter was lower in Experiment 2 relative to Experiment 1 (0.281 ± 0.031 in Experiment 1; 0.132 ± 0.033 in Experiment 2; p = 0.001), consistent with the observation that overall perseveration for Experiment 2 was lower than in Experiment 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) = 1 1 + (−[μ( ( ) − ( )) + + ]) = * ( ( − 1) − ( − 1))</formula><p>We considered models with difference parameters for pairs of the six model parameters ( μ , λ , α gain , α loss , riskybias , persev ). Model comparison showed that a model with riskybias and persev value-independent difference parameters was preferred to six models with all possible pairs of the four value-dependent difference parameters <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref>). In the winning Risky Bias Perseveration Difference model, riskybias difference parameters were positive on average in both Experiment 1 (0.210 ± 0.076, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>) and Experiment 2 (0.241 ± 0.074, p &lt; 0.001). The average persev difference parameter for the winning model was negative in Experiment 1 (-0.171 ± 0.063, p = 0.002) and Experiment 2 (-0.144 ± 0.056, p = 0.019), capturing a decrease in choice perseveration (i.e., increased option switching) on rare trials in both experiments. Parameter recovery analysis confirmed that all model parameters including the riskybias and δ persev difference parameters were recoverable <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1</ref>).</p><p>Sensory prediction error effects are not explained by changes in choice stochasticity or lapse rate. We addressed several alternative explanations for the observed effects. Task-irrelevant distractor sounds have been shown to prolong reaction times and lead to lapses that reduce detection and categorization accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>. Thus, we considered an alternative model that used a lapse rate, which reflects a constant rate of errors independent of option values.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( ) = 1 − 1 + (− [μ ( ( ) − ( ))]) + (0.5 × )</formula><p>We added a lapse difference parameter to see if the effects of sensory prediction errors observed in Experiments 1 and 2 combined could be explained by an increased lapse rate. The overall lapse rate was 0.283 ± 0.011, and the lapse difference parameter was negative (-0.061 ± 0.013, p &lt; 0.001), contrary to the prediction that sensory prediction errors would increase error rates. Next, we investigated whether the Lapse Rate model fitted to participants in Experiments 1 and 2 could generate the same qualitative patterns in risk taking and option switching observed in the data. Overall, the Lapse Rate model predictions were not consistent with the data <ref type="figure">(Fig. S2)</ref>. In particular, the Lapse Rate model predicted decreased risk taking in rare Gain trials, but we observed increased risk taking in these trials <ref type="figure">(Fig. S2A)</ref>. Model comparison confirms that the full Risky Bias Perseveration Difference model is preferred to this alternative Lapse Rate model <ref type="table">(Table S5</ref>).</p><p>The orienting response to novel stimuli could pull perceptual resources away from task-related processes, resulting in reduced choice consistency or sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Conversely, the orienting response could increase arousal and choice consistency. Thus, we tested whether systematic influences on choice stochasticity could explain observed effects. We tested whether replacing the riskybias and persev difference parameters with μ in the winning Risky Bias Perseveration Difference model could produce risk taking and option switching patterns that match the observed data. This model failed to generate the observed pattern of increased risk taking and increased option switching across the three trial types <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.  S3A)</ref>. Notably, the best-fitting μ difference model predicted a significant decrease in risk taking in rare Loss trials, a pattern that is starkly inconsistent with the observed data and with the predictions of preferred models showing instead increased risk taking in rare Loss trials. Model comparison shows that the full Risky Bias Perseveration Difference model is preferred to this alternative μ difference model <ref type="table">(Table S5)</ref>. Altogether, our results show that the observed behavioral effects cannot be explained by sensory prediction errors changing choice stochasticity or lapse rate.</p><p>Option-switching and risk-taking effects are dissociable. Risky Bias and Perseveration difference parameters were only weakly correlated (Spearman  = -0.127, p = 0.011, n = 400), suggesting that they might arise from distinct processes. In Experiments 3 and 4, we asked whether the risk-taking effect might be due to hearing rare sequence features (i.e., deviant tones) and not hearing rare sequences. If deviant tones increase risk taking, rare sequences should not increase risk taking in experiments where rare sequences end on standard rather than deviant tones.  In Experiment 3, risk taking did not increase in rare trials (-2.50 ± 1.83%, mean ± SEM, p = 0.51). Here, we found evidence for the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis with a Bayes Factor (BF01) of 5.06. However, perseveration in Experiment 3 did decrease (-6.00 ± 1.02%, p &lt; 0.0001), consistent with Experiments 1 and 2. Risky Bias Perseveration Difference model parameter estimates were consistent with selective reduction of the risk-taking effect for rare sequences. The riskybias difference parameter was no different from zero on average (-0.02 ± 0.15, p = 0.71, BF01 = 12.57). In contrast, the persev difference parameter was negative (-0.39 ± 0.09, p &lt; 0.0001), consistent with Experiments 1 and 2. Experiment 4 also did not show increased risk taking in rare trials (-3.23 ± 1.43%, p = 0.075, BF01 = 1.07), but perseveration did decrease (-4.27 ± 0.87%, p &lt; 0.0001). This was mirrored in our model-based analyses, which showed that the riskybias difference parameter was no different from zero on average (-0.08 ± 0.10, p = 0.31, BF01 = 9.75) and was reduced compared to both Experiments 1 and 2 (Experiment 1: p = 0.010; Experiment 2: p = 0.010). In contrast, the persev difference parameter was again negative (-0.23 ± 0.07, p &lt; 0.001). When rare sequences end on standard tones, rare sequences increase option switching but not risk taking, suggesting that hearing rare sequences explains only the former effect. The option-switching effect was intact despite a change of at least a factor of six in the relative frequencies of A and B tones in both experiments (i.e., B tones were much less 'deviant', particularly in Experiment 3). Overall, we find that the risk-taking and option-switching effects are dissociable by manipulating the statistics of auditory sequences in the task. Using model-based and model-independent analyses, we find evidence in all four experiments that rare sequences increase option switching, irrespective of whether they contain deviant tones.</p><p>Predictable sequences eliminate option-switching and risk-taking effects. We conducted two additional experiments, which presented each tone sequence with equal frequency (50% AAAAAB, 50% AAAAAA. In these experiments, neither sequence was labeled as rare or common. In Experiment 5, AAAAAB and AAAAAA tone sequences alternated deterministically across trials. In Experiment 6, AAAAAB and AAAAAA tone sequences were randomly shuffled such that no sequence was rarer than the other overall. Model fit quality was comparable to previous experiments <ref type="table">(Table S4</ref>). In the absence of rare or common trials in both experiments, we observed no option-switching effect. The persev difference parameters were no different from zero in Experiment 5 (-0.051 ± 0.062, p = 0.68, BF01 = 9.07) and Experiment 6 (-0.006 ± 0.039, p = 0.84, BF01 = 12.49), suggesting that the effect relies on participants having a prediction about sequence identity that is violated. Moreover, we observed no risk-taking effect in the riskybias difference parameters in Experiment 5 (0.080 ± 0.075, p = 0.68, BF01 = 7.27) and Experiment 6 (0.055 ± 0.069, p = 0.69, BF01 = 9.18). Here, B tones are less frequent than A tones, but are less 'deviant' compared to Experiments 1 and 2 due to a four-fold increase in the prevalence of A to B transitions. The average riskybias difference parameter for Experiment 5 was reduced compared to both Experiment 1 (p = 0.024) and 2 (p = 0.028). Similarly, Experiment 6 showed an attenuated risk-taking effect captured by the riskybias difference parameter compared to Experiments 1 (p = 0.016) and 2 (p = 0.017). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In bustling urban environments, unpredictable sensory events are common. If while walking you hear a fast-approaching car, you might quickly change directions, an appropriate response to avoiding many potential threats. It is unknown to what extent behaviors elicited by sensory surprise represent stereotyped actions, independent of goals to maximize reward and minimize threat. In six experiments (n = 1200), we investigated the effects of task-irrelevant sensory prediction errors on risky decision making. In Experiments 1 and 2, we found that rare auditory sequences that ended with a deviant tone resulted in increased risk taking and increased option switching. Using a computational model based on Prospect Theory, we captured sensory prediction error effects with two value-independent parameters that modulated overall risk taking and overall choice perseveration. In Experiments 3 and 4, we found that when rare sequences ended on standard tones and common sequences ended on deviant tones, the effect of increased risk taking after rare sequences observed in Experiments 1 and 2 was selectively eliminated, while the effect of increased option switching after rare sequences remained intact. Finally, in Experiments 5 and 6, we observed that both the option-switching and the risk-taking effects were eliminated when the tone sequences were presented in a balanced or predictable manner, with both sequences presented with equal probabilities either deterministically or stochastically. These results suggest that different aspects of surprise elicited by participant expectations due to the auditory statistics of the experiment have differing influences on behavior.</p><p>Surprise effects on behavior cannot be simply explained as changes in choice stochasticity. If surprising sounds make behavior less random because it enhances attention, then participants should take more risks on trials where the risky option has the higher subjective value and take fewer risks on trials where the safe option has the higher subjective value, making choices more congruent with value-based preferences. Alternatively, if surprising sounds increase choice randomness due to distraction, then the opposite effect should be observed and choices should be shifted toward indifference between risky and safe options. Contrary to both predictions, we observed that risk taking is increased on rare trials both for trials where participants usually take risks, and for trials where participants usually do not take risks. We observed that the option-switching effect was present both for trials where participants are expected to stay with the previous option, and for trials where participants are expected not to stay with the previous option. Qualitative and quantitative model comparison shows that a Risky Bias Perseveration Difference model that captures sensory prediction error effects with only value-independent risk-taking and perseveration parameters is preferred to models that capture only enhanced attention, distraction, or choice lapses.</p><p>The pattern of results is consistent with the option-switching effect arising from recognition of a surprising target sequence. Option switching was increased by a rare sequence in 25% of trials in Experiments 1-4 but not by a sequence with a deviant tone when both sequences occurred in 50% of trials in Experiments 5 and 6. The A tone was more common than the B tone in all six experiments, but the option-switching effect did not depend on the frequency of B tones: the option-switching effect was present despite wide variation in B tone frequency in Experiments 1-4 (Experiments 1 and 2: 2.1%; Experiment 3: 29.2%; Experiment 4: 12.5%), and absent in control experiments with intermediate B tone frequency (Experiments 5 and 6: 8.3%). Most strikingly, the rare sequences that led to increased option switching in Experiment 4 contained only A tones and contained no deviant B tones at all.</p><p>In contrast, the risk-taking effect cannot arise from recognition of a surprising target sequence as this effect was absent in Experiments 3 and 4, despite strong option-switching effects. This pattern of results is consistent with the risk-taking effect depending on deviant features of sequences such as the violation of a local expectation at a specific moment in time (e.g., hearing an A tone after another A tone). The A to B tone transition occurred only 2.5% of the time in Experiments 1 and 2, much less frequently compared to the other experiments that did not show the risk-taking effect (Experiment 3: 35%; Experiment 4: 15%; Experiments 5 and 6: 10%). In Experiment 4, when sequence probabilities were flipped such that the A to B transition occurred only in the common sequence and not the rare sequence, we did not expect an effect of the deviant tone on risk taking due to the six-fold increase in prevalence compared to Experiments 1 and 2. While we verified that participants can correctly identify the rare sequence both before and after the experiment, we cannot know precisely what they believe or find subjectively surprising during the task. However, the consistency of both effects across many different situations (e.g., with and without potential rewards, in situations where they tend to stay or switch, in situations where they tend to take risks or not) strongly suggests that effects on behavior do not depend on the value of available options.</p><p>Random exploration in reinforcement-learning tasks can be explained by summing uncertainty over all options <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref>. Exploration could also be driven by relative uncertainty between a pair of options, such that the more uncertain option has a higher probability to be explored according to a directed exploration strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>. Directed and random exploration may be adaptive in response to different forms of uncertainty during reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>. Multiple interacting systems are known to influence decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57)</ref> and task-relevant uncertainty may be a key factor in the arbitration between multiple decision strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>. In our paradigm, risky options always have equal probabilities of either outcome and thus overall and relative uncertainty do not vary from trial to trial. However, we find that uncertainty resulting from incidental tone sequences is sufficient to induce systematic changes in behavior, despite these influences not being adaptive given their irrelevance. Our results suggest that task-irrelevant sensory prediction errors can be used as a tool providing multiple ways to investigate the arbitration between decision strategies in any decision or learning paradigm.</p><p>We conclude that behavioral responses to auditory surprise during decision making under uncertainty appear in at least two ways: through an increase in risk taking, and through an increase in option switching. These results also provide a demonstration for how to use noninvasive auditory stimuli to generate hypotheses about the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms of experiences like surprise in a manner that avoids confounds related to participant choice. Moreover, aberrant sensory processing is implicated in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and psychosis. Our findings offer a new way to evaluate clinical samples by examining the relationships between sensory prediction errors, behavior, and mental health. We find that surprising sounds systematically alter human behavior, identifying a commonplace yet previously unrecognized potential source of behavioral variability in everyday decision making that could have important societal consequences. The same judge, doctor, or police officer could make different decisions depending on incidental sensory events that are literally noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS &amp; METHODS</head><p>Participants. We used the Gorilla Experiment Builder (https://gorilla.sc/) to develop our experiment . Data was collected between 24 Feb 2021 and 17 Jan 2022. Participants were recruited online through Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/). The inclusion criteria for the study were that participants spoke fluent English and were at least 18 years old. Participants provided informed consent and were paid for participation ($8.36/hour on average). Participants were then prescreened by completing an in-browser headphone screening task <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref>. This short task, designed to be easy for participants wearing headphones but difficult using speakers, allowed us to exclude participants not wearing headphones. This allowed us to standardize online sound presentation and mitigate concerns over sound quality. Across six separate experiments (each n=200), a total of 1200 participants passed the pre-screening and finished the main task (499 female, 687 male, 14 other or preferred not to say, aged 25.9 ± 8.1 years, mean ± SD). After completing the main task, participants were administered Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaires.</p><p>Procedure. Participants were informed at the start of the experiment that they would hear common and rare tone sequences, listened to each sequence, and were told which one was common. In Experiments 1-4, participants were asked to identify the common sequence before starting the task and after completing the task. Post-task accuracy for this question was on average 95.50%. Participants were endowed with 500 points and completed a risky decision task with 192 trials (Experiment 1) or 120 trials (Experiments 2-6; SI Methods). On each trial, participants chose between risky and safe options worth varying amounts of points by pressing one of two computer keys. Unchosen options disappeared immediately following a choice, and chosen gambles were resolved after a 1.3-s delay. Safe and risky outcomes were revealed for 1 s. Participants were explicitly informed that all risky options had equal probability of win and loss outcomes. The experiment featured three possible types of trials: (1) Gain: a sure gain or a risky option with a larger potential gain or zero; (2) Mixed: a sure option of zero or a risky option with both a potential gain and a potential loss; and (3) Loss: a sure loss or a risky option with a larger potential loss or zero. All choice trials were self-paced, with median reaction times of 1.37 s across all six experiments on average. Current earnings in the task were displayed at all times. During the 3-s inter-trial interval before the onset of options for every choice trial, participants viewed a fixation cross and passively listened to a task-irrelevant six-tone auditory sequence. 75% of trials featured "common" sequences, and 25% of trials featured "rare" sequences with a different ending. Each sequence was composed of six 100-millisecond pure sinusoidal tones played 400 milliseconds apart, of three possible frequencies: 1000 Hz tones (A), 1500 Hz (B), and 500 Hz (C). In Experiments 5 and 6, two sequences appeared with 50% frequency. In Experiments 1 and 3-6, the spatial position of risky and safe options was fixed. Experiment 2 differed from Experiment 1 in reversing the spatial positions of risky and safe options every 10 trials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2.
