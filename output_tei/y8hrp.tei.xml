			<abstract>
				<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is most often defined by social communication challenges and behavioral rigidity, but executive function deficits have long been considered potential contributors to autism-related impairments across these domains. Autism is a spectrum, with a broad range of phenotypes presenting below the diagnostic threshold, raising the possibility that variability in executive function may contribute to individual differences in autistic traits in the general population. Value based decision making tasks access aspects of executive function, and critically are amenable to computational approaches to dissect the latent variables that most contribute to individual differences in cognition. We capitalize on this approach to uncover the relationship between autistic traits as measured by the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) and explore-exploit balance in a three-armed restless bandit decision making task in a large (1001 participants) sample. We find that the BAPQ aloof subscale, which primarily describes social behavior related phenotypes, most strongly explains changes in choice behaviors, including sensitivity to outcomes, changes in choice flexibility, and level of exploration as inferred from a Hidden Markov Model. Canonical correlation analysis reveals that the strongest loading for these non-social reward related measures are in fact socially coded items. These findings suggest that different aspects of executive function challenges may be related to social and nonsocial autism-related behaviors in the general population, and that social components of behavior produce measurable differences in nonsocial tasks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The autism spectrum represents a broad range of phenotypes linked by alterations in behavioral rigidity and social communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. A long-standing question in autism research is what might be linking these domains, such that alterations in both social behavior and cognitive flexibility co-emerge within autistic individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. Recent evidence has implicated executive functions, which include cognitive flexibility, as key contributors to autism-related phenotypes across behavioral domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. One process essential to cognitive flexibility that is altered in ASD is reward-guided decision making. People on the autism spectrum show stereotyped challenges in decisionmaking tasks, including difficulty in learning new reward associations and an increase in perseverative errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. This raises the possibility that differences in flexibility in reward-guided decision-making predict other features of autism, including social communication issues, that may be related to differences in reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref> One powerful task for dissecting components of flexible decision-making as latent cognitive variables is the Multi-armed Bandit <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. In the bandit task, participants repeatedly choose between two or more choices whose value can only be learned through experience. Most computational models distinguish two major latent cognitive variables: exploiting a rewarding option when it's found and exploring for information about the environment. Balancing exploration and exploitation, collectively a "strategy", is essential for adapting to changing environments and sustaining long-term reward. Examining individual strategy allows us to link latent cognitive axes of decision making with autism-related phenotypes across behavioral domains. We used a variant of a classic bandit task, the three-armed restless bandit, to examine how individuals learn and explore in an uncertain environment. The "restless" twist of the task refers to a reward contingency that is not only stochastic, but also dynamic. The reward probability associated with each choice changes randomly and independently over time, requiring subjects to transition between exploiting previously rewarding options and exploring for new information. The lack of constraints on when and how individuals explore encourages a wide range of strategies, providing insight into the latent cognitive processes that may contribute to autism-related phenotypes.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to examine how executive function, as measured through latent cognitive strategies employed to navigate an uncertain environment, relates to broad autism phenotypes across social and nonsocial behavioral domains in a large online sample (n=1001). To identify the spectrum of autism-related phenotypes in our sample population, we adopted the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ), which measures autism phenotypes across three behavioral domains: social aloofness, behavioral rigidity, and pragmatic language (a measure of language difficulties) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. We examined how parameters of decision-making strategy varied across the three BAPQ domains. We find that the aloof subscale, which primarily describes social behavior-related phenotypes, most strongly explains changes in choice behaviors, including sensitivity to outcomes, changes in choice flexibility, and level of exploration. A canonical correlation analysis of individual questions in the BAPQ also revealed that the questions with the strongest loading for these presumed non-social behavioral measures are in fact socially coded items. Together, these findings suggest that broad autism phenotypes are associated with individual differences in behavioral measures of executive function, and that the autistic phenotypes most related to these executive function differences may lie within the domain of social communication challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>1001 participants over the age of 18 were recruited using the online platform Prolific to examine the relationship between autism-related phenotypes and latent cognitive processes underlying decision-making. To measure the expression of autism-related phenotypes, participants were asked to complete the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) prior to the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. The BAPQ is a commonly used tool to quantify autism-related traits across three major phenotypic domains, including aloofness, rigidity, and pragmatism ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C)</ref>. The total BAPQ score ranges from 36-216, a sum of the 12-72 score from each subscale, with higher scores associated with more severe autism-related phenotypes.</p><p>To examine individual differences in value-based decision-making strategies, we employed a restless three-armed bandit task. On each trial participants were given three decks of cards to choose from, each of which was associated with a reward probability that changed randomly and independently over time ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A-B</ref>). Participants accrued one point for every rewarded trial. The goal of the task is to maximize the number of points obtained over the duration of the experiment (300 trials). The dynamic reward contingency encourages participants to be flexible in their decisions as the current best option may become worse in the future. To maximize reward, participants must exploit a favorable option when it's found while flexibly exploring alternatives to gather information. To verify that participants understood the task, we calculated the probability of obtaining reward compared to the probability of reward if choosing randomly (chance). The results suggest that participants were performing the task significantly better than chance (one-sample t test, t(1000) = 79.14; p&lt;0.0005) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BAPQ Aloof Scores Drive Decreased Shift Behaviors</head><p>One way to measure cognitive flexibility is to examine shift behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. We calculated the probability of shifting to a different option on a given trial and examined whether this shifting behavior correlated with BAPQ total or subscale scores. We find that the probability of shifting away from a previous choice is correlated with the BAPQ aloof subscale, with high BAPQ aloof scores predicting decreased shift behavior (spearman correlation, rho=-0.1166, p=0.0002) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1E)</ref>. BAPQ rigid and pragmatic subscales were not significant predictors of shifting behavior in either direction. These results suggest that the variability in cognitive flexibility deficits demonstrated across the autism spectrum may be related to social aloofness in particular, highlighting a potential link between social deficits in autism and other cognitive domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aloofness-driven Stay Behaviors are Outcome Dependent</head><p>To determine if shift behavior was outcome-dependent, we examined measures of winstay (repeating a choice following reward), lose-shift (shifting to a different choice following no reward), and a measure of punishment sensitivity that considers the ratio of shifts as a result of no reward relative to reward while controlling for overall amount of shift behavior (Equation 1). We find a positive correlation between BAPQ aloof scores and win-stay (spearman correlation, rho=0.11, p=0.0005), as well as a negative correlation between BAPQ aloof scores and lose-shift (spearman correlation, rho=-0.09, p=0.0042) behaviors, consistent with decreased shift behaviors with increases in aloofness ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1F-G)</ref>. We also find a positive correlation between punishment sensitivity and BAPQ aloof, indicating an increased sensitivity to no reward relative to reward as aloofness increases ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1H</ref>). This suggests that high aloofness individuals showed decreased shift behaviors due to higher sensitivity to no reward, rather than a general strategy of increased choice repetition. reward probability</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BAPQ Aloof is Correlated with Decreased Frequency of Exploratory Behaviors</head><p>Previous studies have shown win-stay and lose-shift behaviors are not constant throughout the session, rather, they are elevated only during periods of exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. Therefore, we ask whether changes in outcome-dependent behaviors in high aloofness individuals are due to changes in exploratory strategy over time. To infer when exploration happens or how much individuals explore, we adopted a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that models exploration and exploitation as two latent goal states underlying choices. Previous studies have found that labeling explore-exploit states using an HMM consistently and accurately modeled choice behavior across species <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>. To examine how much individuals explore, we calculated the frequency of exploratory choices as labeled by the HMM. This analysis revealed that aloofness was correlated with exploratory behaviors, with high BAPQ aloof scores predicting decreased probability of exploring on a given trial (spearman correlation, rho=-0.135, p&lt;0.001) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2B</ref>).</p><p>Decreased exploratory choices could result from decreased frequency of exploratory bouts and/or shorter exploratory bouts. We therefore examined the transition probabilities between states, i.e. how likely an individual was to stop exploiting and start exploring, continue exploiting, etc. The results revealed that individuals with higher aloofness were less likely to continue exploring after exploring in a previous trial, indicating shorter bouts of exploration, however, they were not increasing the length of their exploitative bouts ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2C-D)</ref>. This suggests that the decrease in exploratory behaviors in high aloofness individuals is a product of their committing to a specific option more rapidly but not sticking to that option for a longer period compared to less aloof individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Behavior-Related Questions Show Highest Influence on Exploratory Strategy</head><p>Our correlation analyses revealed how differences in exploratory strategy can be predicted by the subscales of BAPQ, specifically BAPQ aloof. Next we ask whether this relationship is driven by specific questions within the aloof subscale or social behavior related questions as a whole. Specifically, we adopted sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA), an unsupervised learning algorithm used to maximize the correlations between two datasets, to estimate the predictive power of each question.</p><p>The two input datasets consisted of 36 single-item scores from BAPQ (one for each question) and nine task parameters that best characterized cognitive strategy ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  3A)</ref>. Chosen task parameters were (1) probability of exploration, (2) exploration potential, (3) punishment sensitivity, (4) probability of shifting away from the previous choice, (5) probability of repeating a rewarded choice (win-stay), (6) probability of shifting away from a non-rewarded choice (lose-shift), (7) relative response time difference (shift vs stay), (8) averaged response time, and (9) probability of obtaining reward relative to chance.</p><p>We selected the first canonical variate based on the degree of covariance explained for further analysis. We performed a permutation to test for significance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>. Null distribution was built by randomly re-assigning subjects' single-item scores to shuffle the original correlation between two datasets. Results showed that the first canonical variate is significant (permutation, 5000 times, p=0.033). To explain the psychiatric meaning of this component, we extracted canonical loadings for all single items within BAPQ ( <ref type="figure">Figure S1)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, the component was dominated by symptoms related to social behaviors, with high-loading questions such as "I feel like I am really connecting with other people" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3B)</ref>. On the task side, this component was dominated by the probability of exploration. Further, we conducted correlation analysis for p(explore) and the total score of these four symptoms, finding a strong correlation between the two (rho=-0.130 , p&lt;0.001) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3D</ref>). Together, our results demonstrate that individual differences in cognitive strategy, a measure of executive function, were most predictive of social-related autism phenotypes in a general population. This suggests that variability in executive function differentially contributes to the behavioral and social domains of autism phenotypes, highlighting the importance of considering the impact of mechanisms underlying social behaviors even in nonsocial tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we examined the relationship between behavioral and social domains of the autism spectrum and how they relate to measures of executive function in a general population. We used computational modeling approaches to extract latent cognitive axes of executive function from a value-based decision-making task and found significant differences in latent processes underlying executive function that were primarily driven by the BAPQ aloof subscale. Increased aloofness was correlated with decreased shift behaviors, increased sensitivity to unrewarded trials, and decreased levels of exploration, as inferred from a Hidden Markov model (HMM). We also showed that these effects were not driven by one or two specific questions in the aloof subscale; rather the most predictive questions, as measured by the highest loading in the sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA), were all within the aloof subscale. These findings suggest that specific autism-related behavioral domains are differentially associated with measures of executive function and highlight the influence of mechanisms underlying social behaviors in a nonsocial task.</p><p>Our finding that the aloof subscale was the most predictive of behavioral differences naturally raises the question of why. One potential explanation for this lies in the shared striatal circuitry of social information and reward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. Autismrelated deficits in social behaviors could be a result of dysfunction in the same circuitry responsible for general reward and goal-directed behaviors and would explain our observed correlations between aloofness, or lack of social motivation, and decision strategy, reflecting general motivation in this task. This interpretation would be consistent with a generalization of the social motivation hypothesis that has been proposed to explain the co-occurrence of changes in social and non-social reward sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> . However, we cannot rule out that these aloof-centric results may suggest that the subscales do not properly align with the phenotypic domains they are trying to measure. Ultimately, we cannot yet determine the answer to this question, but these results nonetheless highlight the exciting potential for capturing the influence of mechanisms underlying social behaviors using fundamentally non-social tasks.</p><p>Changes in exploratory behavior can be driven by both reward-related and rewardunrelated processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>. In the present study, we found evidence for both. Social aloofness was associated with shorter bouts of exploration (but not longer bouts of exploitation) regardless of reward history. One possible explanation for this finding is that people with higher levels of aloofness found exploration less tolerable. Another possible explanation is that more aloof individuals find exploitation more satisfying or rewarding. Either explanation is consistent with the fact that aloofness was associated with less decision-switching after a loss: a result suggesting that more aloof individuals may persist in behavior after receiving negative feedback that would cause other individuals to switch to a different choice. These are potentially distinct mechanisms by which rigidity may arise in autism and may have different neural underpinnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</p><p>An advantage of pairing a self-report questionnaire such as the BAPQ with a decisionmaking task such as the restless bandit is the ability to examine if what people report as their behavior matches what is revealed in a task accessing this behavior. To this point, it's interesting that self-reported levels of behavioral rigidity were not reflected in the behavioral strategy in the bandit task, with the rigid and pragmatic subscales showing no correlation with common measures of behavioral flexibility such as shiftiness. Selfreports are not necessarily accurate with regards to cognitive phenomena, and similar labels on self-report items and task measures do not mean that they access the same construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. It is possible that participants are better able to accurately self-reflect on aloof subscale prompts, because they access the motivation to perform social behaviors, rather than mere competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>. Responding to "I enjoy chatting with people" (from the aloof subscale) better reflects motivation and preference than responding to questions such as "I can tell when it is time to change topics in conversation" (from the pragmatic subscale), reflecting competence. Because autistic traits have repeatedly been linked with changes in motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>, this may be an important contributor to why the aloof scale in a general population best assesses nonsocial motivation.</p><p>The BAPQ was developed to measure broad autism phenotypes (BAP) in non-autistic relatives of autistic individuals, with high sensitivity for detecting BAP when comparing relatives of autistic individuals to non-autistic controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>. Although the BAPQ categorizes behaviors into three domains, recent work, including the current study, point to the possibility that shared mechanisms contribute to dysfunction across each domain. Currently, there is an exciting new trend across animal models and human research to adopt tasks that allow access to latent axes that capture interindividual variability in functioning with computational modeling approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. One of our recent studies using a similar approach identified latent strategies that convey resilience to stress and depression in health care workers during the Covid-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Fine-grained computational models, like the ones we developed here, can reveal computational phenotypes that convey vulnerability and resilience in mental illness, identify shared circuits and mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric features as intervention targets, and inform clinical practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>1001 online participants were recruited through Prolific, a recruiting tool for online experiments. Participation criteria included 1) being at least 18 years of age and 2) all participants must complete the task through desktop computers. These criteria were set to allow for a diverse general population from which to sample, with the device limitation implemented to mitigate any potential differences that could arise due to variation in modality used to complete the task. Participant ages ranged from 18-75+, with an age distribution as follows. 18-24: 473, 25-34: 339, 35-44:114, 45-54:50, 55-64: 18, 65-74: 6, 75+: 1. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants received $3.10 if they completed the entire study, $3.50 if they had high accuracy during the task, and an additional $2.00 for responding to survey questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-administered Assessments</head><p>Participants were asked to complete the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hurley et al. 2007)</ref>, as well as supply demographic information including sex assigned at birth, level of education, and household income.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploration-Exploitation Paradigm</head><p>Exploratory behaviors were measured using a three-arm restless bandit task <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>. Each trial, participants were presented with three choices, each of which was associated with a reward probability that changed randomly and independently over time. Rewarded trials resulted in participants earning 1 point. The probabilistic nature of the task necessitates exploratory behaviors to monitor changes in reward rates as the task progresses, while encouraging exploitation of a target while the chance of reward is high. Participants were initially screened with a tutorial section, in which they needed to demonstrate basic task proficiency over 15 practice trials prior to beginning the final task. Each participant's restless "walk", or the volatility of the reward probability across 300 trials, was dictated by predetermined parameters for the likelihood of change in reward probability each trial (hazard rate) and the subsequent magnitude of change in reward probability (step size). In this experiment we used a hazard rate of 0.6667 and a step size of +/-0.2, constrained within the range of [0.1-0.9].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General analytical techniques</head><p>Data analysis was performed with custom PYTHON scripts. Shapiro-Wilks test was performed on relevant variables, with key variables such as BAPQ subscale scores and percent explore/exploit found to be non-normally distributed. The relationship among and between BAPQ scores, explore-exploit metrics, and other variables was subsequently tested with Spearman's correlation tests. All tests assumed an alpha of 0.05. No participants were excluded from our final data analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Punishment Sensitivity</head><p>To determine whether shift behaviors were reward driven, i.e. participants only shift when the previous trial was not rewarded, we used a measure of punishment sensitivity to assess each participant's relative shift probability following rewarded or unrewarded trials. If shift behavior is not reward driven we will see punishment sensitivity close to zero. punishment sensitivity = (p(shift|loss) -p(shift|win)) / p(shift)</p><p>[1]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hidden Markov Model (HMM)</head><p>In order to examine how much an individual explored in the task, we fit a Hidden Markov model (HMM) to the choice sequence to infer latent explore/exploit state <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. The HMM modeled exploration and exploitation as two latent goal states underlying choices. Each state is defined by a different emission matrix, i.e. the probability of making each choice under each state. When the model is fit to the choice sequence of a subject, it estimates a transition matrix which dictates the probability of transitioning from one state to another over time. Since the HMM assumes a Markovian process, states are timedependent. The transition matrix is a mapping of past and future states, which describes the 1-time-step probability of transition between every combination of states.</p><p>In our model, there were four possible states (an exploit state for each choice, and one explore state). During each exploit state, the probability of choosing the exploited choice is 1, and 0 for other choices (fixed emission matrix). Exploration is modeled as a uniform distribution over choices because the uniform distribution over choices is the maximum entropy distribution of categorical variables. To accurately estimate the parameters of the model with a limited number of trials, the parameters were tied across exploit states such that each exploit state has the same probability of keep exploiting or begin exploring. Transitions out of exploration into exploit states were also tied. The model also assumed that subjects had to go through an explore state in between exploit states, even for a single trial exploration. The model estimates two unique free parameters -the probability of transitioning from exploration to exploitation and the probability of transitioning from exploitation to exploration.</p><p>To find the optimized transition matrix for each subject, we fit the model via expectation maximization using the Baum Welch algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. The algorithm was reseeded 10 times to avoid local maxima and find the global maxima. With the HMM transition matrix optimized from subject choice sequences, we then used the Viterbi algorithm to decode latent states from choices, allowing us to label each choice as either exploratory or exploitative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sparse canonical correlation analysis</head><p>We applied sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA), a well established and popular method to find associations across multiple sets of multivariate data. The main goal of sCCA is to find pairs of linear combinations which would maximize the correlations between two datasets with a sparseness parameter control, and how many dimensions are required for those correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. The pairs of linear combinations represent canonical variables, and the correlation between them are defined as canonical correlations.</p><p>In the current study, we have two dataset BAPQ single-items (B) and Exploration-Exploitation indices (E).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">B = ( ⋯ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ ⋯ ) E = ( ⋯ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ ⋯ ) [2]</formula><p>Where n represents the number of participants, p indicates the number of single items of BAPQ, q indicates the behavioral indices from exploration and exploitation task.</p><p>We aimed to find pairs of linear combinations to maximize the correlation between B and E. Where the 1 ( ) and 2 ( ) are lasso penalty functions (i.e., L1 regularization), and 1 , 2 should satisfy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 ≤ 1 ≤ √ , 1 ≤ 2 ≤ √</formula><p>The value of 1 and 2 are chosen by K-fold cross-validation (CV), where the corresponding penalty values are chosen by grid search in increments of 0.1 between 0.1 and 1.0 to identify the combinations of parameters to maximize the Cov (Bx, Ey). As previous studies (Wang et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2018) did, we have 10 randomly resampled datasets as replication datasets, each of them consisted of two-thirds of the dataset with full sample. We conducted sCCA in a predictive framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> to enhance the generalizability of the model. The L1 penalty for the single-item BAPQ dataset and behavioral indices from exploration-exploitation task were tuned by 10-fold crossvalidation, with a discovery (n = 667) and replication sample (n = 334). We obtained the best model with a penalty level of 1 on the single-item BAPQ and 0.9 on the explorationexploitation behavioral indices. Analyses were implemented in R package PMA <ref type="bibr">(Witten et al., 2009)</ref>, available at https://rdrr.io/cran/PMA/man/PMA-package.html</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Permutation test</head><p>Permutation testing was adopted to assess the significance of canonical variates <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mihalik et al., 2022)</ref>. We constructed null distribution for all canonical components by shuffling the rows of the BAPQ single items and holding the behavioral indices vector constant. Thus the linkage between BAPQ single items and participants' behavioral indices has been broken. We then conducted sCCA using the same regularization parameters on the re-aligned dataset to get canonical variates. If the canonical variates from preserved sample are significant than the canonical variates from permutated sample, we selected these canonical variates for further analysis. We performed permutation 5000 times and applied False Discovery Rate (FDR) to control for type I error due to multiple comparisons. The significance level is set at 0.05.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>High aloof individuals exhibit decreased exploration A) Schematic of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used to label latent goal states underlying choice behaviors.
