			<abstract>
				<p>As concerns over climate change, pandemics, and other intergenerational issues mount, the call for intergenerational stewardship resounds in psychology, ethics, and politics. Yet, the virtue of intergenerational beneficence has deep roots in historical philosophical perspectives, such as the principle of seventh generation stewardship advocated by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and other indigenous populations. For how many future generations do people believe we ought to consider the consequences of our individual and governmental actions? Can the temporal horizon of morality be expanded to include a greater number of future generations? Across five preregistered studies (N=3,876 Americans recruited on Prolific), we precisely map prescriptive beliefs regarding the number of future generations individuals and governments should have in mind when making collective decisions, the intergenerational depth of people&apos;s obligation and concern for future welfare, and individual variation in these tendencies. Moreover, by targeting the interconnectedness of people across time we successfully expand the temporal horizon of intergenerational concern, reducing intergenerational discounting.</p>

In light of rising concern over existential risk, nascent lines of inquiry and discourse across psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref> , behavioral economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref> , and ethical philosophy have begun to elucidate whether and how much people manage and utilize resources, make decisions, and create policies in ways that ensure the well-being, sustainability and prosperity of generations to come. Yet, intergenerational beneficence is not a novel principle, but one that has been advocated in spiritual and philosophical teachings for centuries. This virtue is no better encapsulated than in the seventh generation principle passed down through the oral and written traditions of indigenous populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> . Often attributed to The Great Law of Haudenosaunee Confederacy 1the foundational framework for the political, cultural and spiritual union of the six tribes 1 comprising the Iroquois Nation-seventh generation stewardship emphasizes the importance of considering the impacts of every decision on the seventh generation ahead. While The Great Law has influenced contemporary democracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> , intergenerational beneficence is seldom emphasized in the institutions and polices of governments worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref> . Moreover, emerging research indicates aspects of human psychology may inherently limit our ability to consider and promote <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The Haudenosaunee Confederacy (alternatively the Iroquois Nation or the Six Nations) comprised the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora tribes of what is now upstate New York. The principle of seventh generation stewardship originated among the teachings of the Six Nations, but similar principles emphasizing interconnectedness and intergenerational stewardship are shared among numerous other indigenous populations, including the MƒÅori of New Zealand <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14</ref> , the Native Peoples of Hawaii <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15</ref> , and the Inca of the South American Andes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref> .</p></div>

How far into the future do people typically consider the impacts of their own and their governments' collective decisions?</p><p>For better or worse, humanity is interconnected across the globe within vast networks that form the bonds of society <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> .

The individual and collective decisions, successes and failures of the past are in part responsible for the well-being of society in the present.

But the world is becoming increasingly interconnected. Advancements in communications, medical and economic technologies have strengthened the ties that bind us, enabling unprecedented ease in our ability to impact those distant in both space and time <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> . We can safeguard welfare across the globe and prepare for the flourishing of generations to come more effortlessly than ever before. Yet, our continued advancements simultaneously risk jeopardizing future flourishing, introducing and aggravating threats owing to sources like climate change, pandemics, artificial intelligence, and global conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> . Consequently, whether our current existence will represent an asset or liability for those to inherit the impacts of our tenure on Earth falls upon our actions in the present.</p><p>Here we explore for the first time (1a) the number of future generations people believe we should keep in mind when making collective decisions, (1b) the number of future generations for which people feel concern and obligation to protect, (2) individual differences the tendencies described above, and (3) whether through intervention greater concern can be cultivated for a greater number of future generations. Disparate findings offer peripheral insights into these issues. For one, social biases limit high-impact altruism benefitting distant recipients in the present. People empathize more easily with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> , feel greater concern for <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref> , and help <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50</ref> those who are socially or geographically closer, more similar, and personally identifiable. Better SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 5 understanding these biases has been a major focus of seminal <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52</ref> and emerging <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref> research in social psychology aiming to promote equality in altruism. Although these findings cannot directly elucidate the contours of intergenerational beneficence, social biases likely apply similarly to the temporally distant populations of society's far future-hypothetical collectives of socially distant and unidentifiable strangers from the perspectives of those already living <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref> .</p><p>Also insightful is the cognitive science of prospection, as imagination may be among our greatest psychological tools for representing the challenges of, and impact on, tomorrow. This research reveals temporal constraints on capacities in mental time travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref> -people more vividly envision and feel greater connectedness to proximal relative to distal imagined futures.</p><p>These limitations in imaginative capacities may render the adaptive prosocial functions of prospection <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">63</ref> more potent for temporally proximal targets of concern. Nonetheless, the science of prospection has focused most prominently on how we imagine our own personal futures and near-term contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref> . Only recently has attention been given to the cognitive and affective phenomenology of collective future thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">69</ref> -the features and emotions present in our prospective representations of the collectives to which we belong. Consequently, the present literature on imagination has largely overlooked the impact of prospection on levels of concern for the future of society.</p><p>Despite intergenerational beneficence being underemphasized in the literatures on altruistic biases and imagination, echoes of ages-old invocations for long-term stewardship 1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref> can once again be heard in contemporary scientific, philosophical, and public discourse. Forecasting experts warn the negative impacts of climate change are beginning to be felt across the globe <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">70</ref> and that other monumental challenges are looming nearer in temporal proximity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71</ref> . The emerging ethical philosophy and growing social movement of "longtermism" advocates for the disenfranchised future lives slated to bear the consequences of SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 6 our current actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> . Similarly, future-oriented concerns are becoming more prominently emphasized in the popular press 72 , and a handful of governments have even instituted legislative bodies to provide political representation for the citizens of tomorrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref> . Yet, the longtermism movement remains small, as does the number of people who are even aware of its existence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> .</p><p>Moreover, the number of governments that have implemented institutions and policies to protect future generations is far outnumbered by the number that have not <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">73</ref> .</p><p>In recent years, inquiry across psychology and behavioral economics has begun to elucidate levels of intergenerational concern and beneficence in ordinary adults, revealing that human psychology, not limitations in our technological capacity, may pose the most substantial roadblock to long-term welfare. Even with respect to near-future beneficiaries, people prefer smaller benefits to present over larger benefits to future generations in incentive-compatible economic paradigms (i.e., intergenerational discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> ). Moreover, people feel lesser moral concern, obligation and empathy for, have a greater difficulty visualizing, and perceive lesser efficacy over positively impacting the welfare of distant future targets relative to present and proximal targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> . Present-oriented biases extend to third-party moral judgments of intergenerational altruism-people tend to rate future welfare-maximizing prosociality as morally worse than alternative prosocial acts benefitting fewer recipients closer to the present <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref> . People even rate future welfare-maximizing altruists themselves as morally worse, less trustworthy, worse leaders, worse friends, and select them less frequently as cooperation partners in economic games (cite again). Nonetheless, it remains unclear exactly how many generations into the future people typically consider before their feelings of concern and obligation diminish to zero and whether there exists variability in these considerations.</p><p>Recent studies have started to unravel the prevalence of more expansive intergenerational outlooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> . While most respondents show a pronounced tendency to ascribe lesser concern for SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 7 future targets depicted farther away in time, a subset, between 20% and 25% of respondents, show exceptionally high levels of concern for the welfare of targets in the most proximal futures without discounting their levels of concern for targets in progressively more distal ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref> . These individuals, at times described as endorsing "impartial intergenerational beneficence" (IIB), exhibit distinct psychological profiles from other respondents, especially with regard to prosocial attitudes and actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75</ref> . They score higher on measures of personality characteristics associated with prosociality and lower on those associated with antisocial behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75</ref> .</p><p>Furthermore, they feel greater moral concern for and obligation towards others overall and towards future people, socially distant humans, and entities within the natural world in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref> . In contrast to patterns observed in average adults, those with IIB rate future welfare-maximizing altruism (and altruists) as more moral (and more trustworthy) rather than less <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref> . At a more practical level, they show greater concern for future-oriented existential threats and support for sustainable and pro-future policy reform <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">77</ref> . Behaviorally, those with IIB donate more to future-oriented and sustainable charitable causes and are more willing to engage in cognitive effort to raise funding to promote the needs of tomorrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> .</p><p>The research above demonstrates that, despite average tendencies being present-biased, a non-negligible minority views the challenges of tomorrow as having greater consequence. In some ways aligning with the ethical framework advocated within The Great Law of the Haudenosaunee 1,17 , these individuals acknowledge the inherent interconnectedness of the world around them and their own importance within it <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75</ref> . This sense of connectedness translates into a heightened sense of duty not only to oneself and one's immediate surroundings, but to all entities within the natural world, whether living or non-living, socially close or socially distant, present or future. Consequently, it raises the question of whether those who endorse IIB also extend their concern and sense of duty to a greater number of generations beyond the present when SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 8 considering collective decision-making, as advocated in The Great Law and more broadly embodied in calls for seventh generation stewardship. Yet, this question remains critically unaddressed.</p><p>Finally, regardless of how many generations people consider at baseline, there is reason to believe that this number may be malleable. Prior research has successfully employed interventions to cultivate higher levels of intergenerational concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">78</ref> . In turn, this increased concern influences prosocial intergenerational actions, such as donations to future-oriented charities and support for future-oriented public policies. As such, we hypothesize that vividly imagining future harm reduction and deliberatively reflecting on philosophical arguments regarding intergenerational duty and the interconnectedness of people across time can boost both intergenerational concern and the number of future generations individuals include in their moral considerations.</p><p>To summarize, existing research reveals that people tend to prioritize the present and near future in their prosocial and moral considerations. However, prior studies have not precisely identified the specific generation at which individuals cease to include future others in their considerations entirely, nor have they explored the implications of this intergenerational horizon on recommendations for intergenerational thinking in both individual decisions and collective policy-making. Here, across five highly-powered and pre-registered studies (N = 3,876), we used mixed methodologies to test for the first time the extent to which people endorse the principle of seventh generation stewardship advocated within the laws, written histories and oral traditions of indigenous populations 1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> . First, we directly asked participants to report the number of future generations-operationalized as the number of people born within a 25-year period-that individuals (Study 1a) and governments (Study 1b) should have in mind when making collective decisions. To confirm and build upon these results, we employed additional methodologies for SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 9 identifying the point at which people entirely discount the needs of the future in the remaining studies. Specifically, in Studies S1a, S1b and 2, we measured reported levels of perceived moral obligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">56</ref> (Study S1a) and moral concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45</ref> in both zero-sum (Study S1b) and positive-sum (Study 2) paradigmatic contexts. Finally, in Study 2, we used a short and scalable intervention to cultivate greater intergenerational beneficence and investigate whether future-oriented moral concern and the number of generations considered can be flexibly expanded in ordinary adults across more distal time horizons.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1a: Future Generations Considered in Collective Decisions</head><p>A total of 603 U.S. American participants recruited on Prolific (see here for the preregistration of Studies 1a-1b: https://aspredicted.org/8Z8_JR2), we asked the question: "A universal value that most people share is the obligation to protect the world for future generations that will exist after them. Although this value is universal, what differs is how many future generations people think we should think about when we make these decisions. If one generation of people is the total number of people born across 25 years (such that 0 = present, 1 = one generation from now generation in the next 25 years, 2 = two generations from now in the next 50 years, etc.), how many future generations should we have in mind when we engage in collective decision making? Please enter the number of generations that you think is most appropriate. Keep in mind that this number reflects generations and not years."  <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref>). This SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 10 difference remained significant after adjusting for age, political orientation, religiosity and SES (see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref> in SOM).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Studies 1a-1b: Moral Obligation and Zero-Sum Moral Concern for Future</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generations</head><p>In two pre-registered (Supplementary Study 1a: https://aspredicted.org/CDN_GG7; Supplementary Study 1b: https://aspredicted.org/PZY_LJF), and highly-powered supplementary studies conducted on Prolific, we examined patterns of moral obligation and concern to future generations. Our aim was to determine the average distal future generation at which concern, or obligation drops to virtually zero. We investigated these patterns by implementing questions targeting the range of future generations people feel morally obligated to help and protect, and the degree to which they feel moral concern, when moral concern is conceptualized as a limited, finite resource (through the use of 100 moral points allocated to present and future generations).</p><p>Across both studies, two primary findings emerge. First, after about fifty future generations (i.e., people born 1250+ years from the present), concern drops to a near-zero level.</p><p>Second, relative to the majority of participants who do not endorse IIB, participants with IIB  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables S7 and S12 in SOM)</ref>. Importantly, these patterns are robust across different computational approaches for capturing the two outcome measures, as they emerged when we assessed the average level of moral obligation and concern participants reported feeling for all future generations combined, the aggregate number of generations for which participants reported feeling at least some level of moral obligation and concern, the average generational transition point at which their obligation and concern dropped to zero, and the area under their moral discounting curves (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables S6 and S11 for descriptive statistics</ref> and Figures S1 and S2 for a graphical depiction of these results).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 13</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Intergenerational Moral Discounting and an Intervention to Decrease it</head><p>Findings from two supplementary studies (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Supplementary Studies 1a and 1b in SOM)</ref> and from Studies 1a and 1b indicated that, on average, and with some variability depending on the specific measurement approach, individuals express obligation (Supplementary Study 1a), moral concern (Supplementary Study 1b), and believe that future generations should be considered in the context of collective (Study 1a) and legislative (Study 1b) decisions for up to 50 future generations. In our final study, we sought to utilize the most widely employed measure capturing the breadth and depth of moral concern felt for an array of entities spanning levels of psychological distance (i.e., the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45</ref> ) to examine the precise generation at which the moral worth ascribed to future generations is completely discounted (i.e., drops to zero). Compared to the measure of moral concern utilized in Supplementary Study 1b, the MES conceptualizes moral concern as a positive-sum resource. Thus, in Study 2, allocating moral concern to any given generation does not inherently detract from a limited pool of moral points. In other words, participants could in theory award the maximum number of points allowable (3 on a scale of 0 = no moral concern -3 = the highest level of moral concern) to every single generation. Study 2 was pre-registered (https://aspredicted.org/B2P_M75), highly-powered (total N = 1,029), and conducted on Prolific. U.S. American participants were randomly assigned to a baseline condition with no manipulation or a treatment condition. In the treatment condition, we implemented a brief imaginative exercise and thought experiment to examine whether an intervention targeting intergenerational beneficence would be effective at decreasing tendencies in the moral discounting of future generations. Specifically, in the first phase, participants were instructed to imagine themselves preventing near-future harm by picking up shards of glass from a water bottle they dropped along a hiking trail. In the second phase, they were instructed to SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 14 reflect on philosophical arguments related to the interconnectedness of people across time and intergenerational duty. Specifically, prior to engaging in written reflection, they were presented with arguments that (1) future people matter, regardless of when in time they exist, (2) people are connected across time, such that our decisions today can stand to either better or worsen quality of life for the many future generations that will come after us, and (3) we bear responsibility in the present to make future lives better rather than worse. This procedure has been successfully validated as a tool for boosting levels of intergenerational beneficence in previous research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6</ref> , but also see Methods for a closer look at the experimental procedure). Importantly, in addition to serving as a control for the intervention condition, the baseline condition, which lacked the imaginative exercise and thought experiment, allowed us to examine patterns in reported moral concern towards future generations unencumbered by the effects of the intervention (akin to prior studies) in a relatively highly-powered sample (N = 528).</p><p>Intriguingly, in line with the principle of seventh generation stewardship <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref> , participants in the baseline condition who scored below the threshold for IIB included, on average, the first seven future generations within the outer circle of moral regard, suggesting the vast majority ascribe a non-negligible amount of moral concern to an average of seven generations. What's especially astounding is that these general population participants transitioned to placing generations eight and beyond in the very fringes of the moral circle (M8 = 0.92, SD8 = 0.89), suggesting that, on average, they ascribe near-zero levels of moral concern to generations beyond the seventh. In contrast, participants in the baseline condition who scored above the threshold for IIB included all 50 generations within the outer circle on average (M50 = 1.22, SD50 = 1.12).</p><p>Consistent with our previous studies, we found significant differences between the  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S16</ref> in SOM). In fact, differences between the two groups in the levels of moral concern participants reported feeling for future generations is noted for 49 out of the 50 planned comparisons, even after adjusting for the total number of tests (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S17</ref> in SOM). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref> for a graphical depiction of these results.    <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S19</ref> in SOM).</p><p>Considering these results, and existing research suggesting that intergenerational concern explains a considerable amount of variance in policies and attitudes towards future generations 6,78 , we conducted mediation tests for each outcome metric with the treatment as our exogenous predictor and intergenerational concern as our mediator. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref> In all cases, a significant effect of the treatment (even after controlling for the mediator), of the mediator, and a significant indirect effect were noted (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).

Overlapping patterns emerge as well regardless of whether we score the IIBI continuously or dichotomously. Thus, we provide strong evidence that people in the present do feel concern for the future but are largely divided in the temporal depth of their considerations. Beyond deepening our understanding of the psychology of intergenerational beneficence, these findings have tangible implications for effectively framing pro-future policy and sustainability initiatives. For the vast majority of people, roughly 80%, such initiatives may prove most effective when framed in light of their near-future benefits. If SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 23 safeguarding the future is deemed a worthwhile societal objective, forthcoming research could address whether reframing pro-future initiatives to emphasize near-future impacts garners more widespread appeal for reform. Considerable research has shown reframing divisive issues around their more commonly agreed upon components to be effective for cultivating support across ideological divides <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">82</ref> .</p><p>Additionally, although participants demonstrate fairly expansive intergenerational outlooks at baseline, a brief intervention targeting the interconnectedness of people across time and intergenerational duty increases the temporal horizon of intergenerational concern even further. While controls in Study 2 extend their moral considerations 250 years beyond the present, participants who engage in this intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">78</ref> feel concern extending for 1,000 years.</p><p>Equally intriguing is that the intervention boosts moral concern for future and present generations alike, suggesting concerns for the challenges of tomorrow and today are not necessarily in psychological competition and that moral concern may not be a limited resource (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref> for a related finding). Future research should explore the durability of intervention effects on intergenerational attitudes and assess whether more immersive and direct exposure to indigenous wisdom on interconnectedness with nature and seventh generation stewardship 79 may yield longer-lasting effects. Moreover, as these findings align with research in the disparate cognitive science of prospection which shows that imagination supports prosociality <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62</ref> in more proximal, interpersonal contexts, forthcoming research should further elucidate the understudied adaptive function of collective future-thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">83</ref> in advancing societal well-being.</p><p>Another compelling area for further investigation is to address the disparity between supportive individual-level attitudes toward future beneficence and the limited presence of country-level pro-future policies and institutions. Our findings indicate widespread support for greater consideration of future generations by both individuals and governments. However, the SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 24 majority of governmental systems worldwide prioritize present over future needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">73</ref> . One potential explanation is that individuals may misperceive others' future-oriented attitudes as less robust than their own. Recent studies reveal that many significantly underestimate the extent of support for pro-climate policy initiatives among their peers compared to their own views <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">84</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online Methods</head><p>All studies were preregistered and conducted on Prolific. All recruited participants were U.S. American. For all studies, we used prolific screening criteria to ensure a near even gender split in our sample. Between 63% to 73% of each sample was White American, with the next most frequent racial identity being Black/African American. The average age across studies ranged from 38 to 44 years old. Detailed demographic information for each study can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref> in the SOM.</p><p>Studies 1a, 1b, and Supplementary Studies 1a and 1b had a correlational design with no random assignment. Study 2 was a between-subjects experiment. In all studies, IIB was measured with the Impartial Intergenerational Beneficence Inventory (IIBI <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> ). This measure has been validated extensively, with existing research noting that it predicts expansive prosociality to present and future people alike <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref> , as well as attitudes towards climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">88</ref> , and prosociality more broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75</ref> . The IIBI consists of 7 items, each shown four times, with the four different versions of each item simultaneously displayed. Each version captures concern for generations depicted at a different timeframe in the far future (i.e., 1000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 years in the future). Scores were captured on slider scales ranging from 0 = strongly disagree -100 = strongly agree. Following in line with the methodological approach employed in previously mentioned investigations using the IIBI, we identified participants as endorsing IIB based on the following criteria: (1) scoring higher than 75 (indicating at least agreement with the scale's items) for the closest timeframe (i.e., 1000 years), and (2) having the same (or a higher) score for all subsequent (more distal) timeframes. These criteria reflect the key tenets of the longtermist philosophy, which states that future people matter equally regardless of when in time they are living and that the welfare of future people should be considered ethically equivalent to the welfare of those alive today.  <ref type="figure">Study 1b)</ref>. The moral obligation measure was captured on a 0-10 slider scale, with 0 = no moral obligation, 5 = half as much obligation as the present generation, and 10 = the same moral obligation as the present generation.

In the treatment condition, participants engaged in a thought exercise from William MacAskill's What We Owe The Future 2 . For this exercise participants imagined themselves hiking in a forest. While hiking, they imagined a glass water bottle they were carrying fell and broke. In the distance, they were instructed to imagine that they could hear a child's voice nearby, and that they knew this child would walk down the path where the shards of SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 30 the water bottle are scattered. Participants were then asked whether they would pick up the shards in the imagined scenario, to which they could answer "Yes" or "No". Regardless of their answer, participants were asked to elaborate on their answer recalling details from the imagined scene. Then, the following was stated: "In deciding whether to clean it up, does it matter when the child will cut herself? Should you care whether it's a week, or a decade, or a century from now? No. Harm is harm, whenever it occurs." Following this, it was explained to participants that, if they agreed with this principle, and that, if they would have picked up the broken shards to prevent anyone in the future from being harmed, then it is likely that they also agree with the following principles espoused in the longtermism ethical philosophy: (1) Future people, no matter when they live in the future, matter. Their lives have just as much value as our lives today;</p><p>(2) An untold number of people will live after us. We have to think beyond the immediate or short-term consequences of our actions and consider how those actions might affect future generations; <ref type="formula">3</ref>We, the present generation, can make the lives of future people better. It is our moral responsibility to ensure that we do our best to protect future people who have no voice today. Finally, participants were told to reflect on these principles and write a brief 2-3-minute essay in response the following prompt: "In the space below, please take 2-3 minutes to reflect on what you just read. Specifically, please write what you think you can do today to help ensure a better future for those who will come after you."</p><p>We chose to employ this particular intervention for two primary reasons. First, this intervention has been well-validated in prior research as a viable means to boost intergenerational concern on the IIBI <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">78</ref> . Second, our primary interest was to test whether, by way of boosting intergenerational concern, alignment with the principle of seventh generation (or beyond) stewardship could be flexibly expanded in average U.S. adults past their baseline level of alignment. Thus, we chose this intervention because it provides a conservative introduction to SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 31 philosophical principles that overlap considerably with the core intergenerational ethics espoused in seventh generation stewardship, but without priming participants to specifically think seven generations ahead. Our intention was to avoid participants displaying an anchoring bias around the number seven in particular.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Notably, even the majority of participants who did not endorse IIB indicated that nine generations should be considered in collective decisions (N = 463, M = 8.95, SD = 17.31).

Conversely, participants with IIB (N = 91, M = 14.12, SD = 25.03) reported on average that 6 more future generations should be considered in governmental legislation (t(106.18) = 2.08, p = .039, Hedge's g = 0.31; seeFigure 1b).

Future studies should aim to replicate these findings in additional cross-cultural samples, and, in particular, among indigenous populations whose cultural values emphasize interconnectedness with the environment and the stewardship of resources for generations to come<ref type="bibr" target="#b77">79</ref> . It's likely that lifelong immersion in a cultural framework that comprehensively embodies these values may cultivate a remarkable sense of identity with people across time and a more pronounced array of real-world sustainable attitudes and behaviors. Similarly, further knowledge could be gained from exploring whether the present findings replicate in societies with greater long-term orientation<ref type="bibr" target="#b84">86</ref> and cultures that prioritize collective well-being<ref type="bibr" target="#b85">87</ref> against a truly representative cross-section of the U.S. population. Finally, for science more broadly, incorporating diverse perspectives, philosophies, and indigenous wisdom into inquiry going forward may continue to provide unique insights and approaches for better addressing the complexities of global challenges, leading to more holistic and effective solutions.SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 25In sum, our increasing influence over the long-term prospects of society places greater responsibility on the current generation to determine whether our impact on the future will net positive or negative. While the present and near future take precedence in people's moral considerations, approximately 80% of individuals express concern for others up to the seventh generation, with approximately 20% extending their concern even further. Moreover, the scope of future-oriented concern is flexible, as imaginative thinking and thoughtful reflection on intergenerational responsibility can significantly expand temporal moral horizons. These findings underscore the significant value placed by many on long-term thinking and intergenerational responsibility. Moreover, they highlight several avenues for future research to deepen understanding of the psychological boundaries, antecedents, and consequences of intergenerational beneficence. This research can help inform sustainable and ethical decisions that not only benefit the present but the countless future generations whose fates our bound to the decisions, success and failures of today, just as ours are bound to the decisions, successes, and failures of those who came before.SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 26</figDesc></figure>

The MES allows participants to place a series of entities of varying psychological distances (see Construal Level Theory<ref type="bibr" target="#b87">89</ref> ) into one of four moral SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 28 boundaries, each corresponding to the various rings of moral regard. Specifically, each boundary is assigned a separate numerical score: 0 = outside the moral boundary (comprising entities for whom participants ascribe no moral regard whatsoever), 1 = fringes of moral concern (the outermost ring comprising entities to whom participants ascribe at least some moral regard), 2 = outer circle of moral concern (the middle ring comprising entities to whom participants ascribe a moderate amount of moral regard), and 3 = the inner circle of moral concern (the inner-most ring comprising entities to whom participants ascribe the highest degree of moral standing).For studies in the published literature using the original version of the MES<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45</ref> , participants have been provided with a series of entities, which vary across the dimension of social distance (from family and friends to close humans to distant humans to entities within the natural world, such as animals and environments). However, in Study 2, which utilized an intergenerationally adapted version of the MES, participants were provided with a series of entities that varied across the intergenerational dimension. Specifically, participants placed 51 entities into the boundaries of their moral circles (i.e., the present generation as well as the subsequent 50 generations hence). For Supplementary Studies 1a-1b and Study 2, we also used each focal outcome to estimate three additional measures: (a) The total number of future generations (Study 2) or generational intervals (Supplementary Studies 1a-1b) to whom at least some moral concern and obligation was ascribed; in each case, this was the sum of the total number of generations or generational intervals to whom participants ascribed a score greater than one; (b) The generational transition point at which moral obligation and moral concern dropped to zero and remained at zero for subsequent, more-distal generations; and (c) the trapezoidal area under the moral discounting curve (AUC). SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 29 AUC was computed using the following steps. First, the curve was defined by plotting the levels of moral obligation or concern (y-axis) against the midpoint of each of the 21 generational intervals (in units of years from the present; x-axis) in Supplementary Studies 1a and 1b or against each of the 51 generations (in units of years from the present; x-axis) in Study 2. In other words, the number of years from the present for the middle generation within each interval (Supplementary Studies 1a and 1b) or for each individual generation (Study 2) was plotted along the x-axis. For instance, for the interval spanning 1-5 generations, the midpoint of 3generations equates to 75 years from the present. Thus, for this particular interval, 75 would be plotted along the x-axis.

Subjects report that individuals and governments alike ought to consider approximately 10 generations ahead when making collective decisions. They also report feeling at least some moral concern for approximately 30 future generations, the same point at which average perceptions of obligation to future generations drop to half their magnitude relative to the present. Intriguingly, obligation persists for twice as many future generations as moral concern, suggesting perceptions of responsibility may endure even in the absence of personal feelings of concern for beneficiaries. Beyond elucidating the precise temporal scope of intergenerational beneficence, our findings shed the first ever light on folk alignment with indigenous wisdom emphasizing the present's duty to consider the impacts of SEVENTH GENERATION STEWARDSHIP 21 every action on the seventh generation hence<ref type="bibr" target="#b77">79</ref> . Interestingly, we find that contemporary beliefs are largely aligned with seventh generation stewardship and at times may extend even further into the future than this traditional guideline.Nonetheless, closer analysis of the results from Supplementary Studies 1a, 1b and Study 2 suggest average Americans do exhibit biases favoring the present and near future. To highlight a few average tendencies, people ascribe greater than half of their moral concern to the present generation when it's conceptualized as a limited resource, reserving less than half for all future generations thereafter. Similarly, people feel less than half of the moral obligation to protect future generations relative to their feelings of obligation toward the present. Even when moral concern is conceptualized as limitless, people only report feeling relatively high levels for</figDesc><table /><note>4,6,9,71,72 . Here we investigate and map the temporal depth of intergenerational considerations in collective decision-making, people's sense of duty to protect those to come, and their moral concerns for future welfare.</note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>. So, while we find that moral considerations extend at least a handful of generations beyond our immediate temporal position, there manifests a near-term focus for most. This tendency is especially notable considering our actions in the present may impact populations for millennia to come 2 .Some of our most intriguing findings emerge when exploring variability in intergenerational outlooks. Approximately 20% of subjects' response patterns on the Impartial Intergenerational Beneficence Inventory (IIBI<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> ) indicate more equally distributed beneficence to near and distant-future targets alike (i.e., participants with IIB). These individuals, compared to those whose scores on the IIBI decline with increasing target temporal distance (i.e., the vast majority of participants who do not endorse IIB), display amplified tendencies to project their consideration, obligation, and moral concern far beyond the present. For instance, those with IIB report that individuals should keep an additional 10 future generations in mind when making collective decisions and that governments should consider an additional six. They feel moral obligation for 35 additional generations and moral concern for an additional 10 or 43, depending</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

This continuous composite measure displayed high reliability across all studies (all as ‚â• 0.97). Single-item measures with open ended responses allowing participants to enter their beliefs regarding the number of generations that should be considered in collective decisions made by individuals and governments were utilized in Studies 1a and 1b respectively. In supplementary Studies 1a and 1b, we used a measure of moral obligation adapted from research by Syropoulos and colleagues 7 (Supplementary Study 1a) and a measure of zero-sum moral concern adapted from research by Waytz and colleagues 49 (Supplementary</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
