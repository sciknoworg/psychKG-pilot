			<abstract>
				<p>To effectively communicate and collaborate with others, we must monitor not only other people&apos;s cognitive states (e.g., what someone thinks or believes), but also their metacognitive states (e.g., how confident they are in their beliefs). Confidence is however rarely communicated explicitly: instead, we often perceive others&apos; confidence via implicit signals such as speech prosody or movement dynamics. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have broadened the scope of these metacognitive inferences: artificial agents often perform similarly to humans yet rarely explicitly signal their confidence in their beliefs, raising the question as to how humans attribute confidence to AI. Here we report five pre-registered experiments in which participants observed human and artificial agents make perceptual choices, and reported how confident they thought the observed agent was in each choice. Overall, attributions of confidence were sensitive to observed variables such as task difficulty, accuracy, and response time. Strikingly, participants attributed higher confidence to AI agents compared to other humans, even though their behaviour was identical. An illusion of greater confidence in artificial agents&apos; decisions generalised across different behavioural profiles (Experiment 2), agent descriptions (Experiment 3), and choice domains (Experiment 4). Attributions of confidence also influenced advice-taking behaviour, as participants were more willing to accept the advice of artificial systems compared to matched humans (Experiment 5). Overall, our results uncover a systematic illusion of confidence in AI decisions, and highlight the importance of metacognition in guiding humanmachine interactions. Perceiving Confidence p. 3 Significance Statement Artificial intelligence is increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, making the study of human-machine interactions a key challenge for cognitive science. Perceptions of machine confidence are likely to play a key role in how we interact and collaborate with artificial systems, and yet little is known about how we attribute confidence to AI algorithms. Here we show that when watching other agents make decisions, people consistently overestimate the confidence of artificial agents compared to other humans, even when their behaviour is identical. Perceived confidence also affected advice-taking and perceived trustworthiness. Taken together, these results uncover a powerful illusion of confidence in artificial systems and highlight a central role for metacognition in human-machine interactions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Perceiving Confidence p. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Autonomous systems are increasingly pervasive in our daily lives -from personal assistance and product suggestions to healthcare recommendations and automated transportation.</p><p>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes progressively advanced and ubiquitous, key questions arise regarding how humans interact with machines. For example, building more optimal recommendation algorithms is useful only insofar as humans are willing to trust their suggestions, and designing more skilled robots is useful only insofar as humans are willing to rely on their assistance. Technological advances must thus be complemented with a psychology of human-machine collaboration -a novel challenge for cognitive science <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The study of human-machine interactions may be especially pressing given that they might involve different processes compared to human-human interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For example, past work has shown that humans hesitate to rely on advice or help from algorithms, even when they perform equally well if not better than humans -a phenomenon known as 'algorithm aversion' ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>; c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). And while attitudes towards AI can be enhanced by factors such as affective abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, physical presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, or decision interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a prior belief about actions being generated by computers (vs. humans) can be sufficient to influence perceptions of otherwise identical behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>One striking difference between human-human and human-machine interactions is that when we make decisions with other people, we have access not only to their behaviour but also to their metacognitive states -for instance, how confident they are in a belief or decision (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>). In humans, such confidence can be revealed not only explicitly, via verbal estimates (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>) or risk preferences (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>), but also implicitly via response times <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, movement dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, and speech prosody <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. In other words, humans regularly infer or attribute confidence to each other by tracking implicit signatures of metacognition. This type of information is highly valuable in collaborative decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>: for example, it helps resolve disagreements among group members <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, and indeed group decisions are more effective than individual ones only when confidence estimates are shared <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</p><p>If attributions of metacognition are key to human-human collaboration, they should also be central to human-machine interactions. However, little is currently known about how humans attribute metacognition and confidence to AI systems. In fact, this type of inference is difficult when interacting with machines which are typically designed to fulfil first-order rather than metacognitive functions, and often do not carry outward signs of confidence in their internal Perceiving Confidence p. 5 processes (although see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>). In fact, AI's capacity for metacognition is developing and will likely differ from humans' <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>. For example, while in humans confidence typically decreases as tasks get harder, some models show the opposite pattern of results <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>. Here we thus set out to investigate attributions of metacognition to humans and machines, and whether such attributions affect impressions of trust and competence.</p><p>To investigate attributions of metacognition, we designed a paradigm where participants watched other agents make perceptual choices and were asked to determine how confident the agents were in their choices. This key dependent measure thus involves participants' estimates of others' confidence, as opposed to estimates of others' actual performance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>), or participants' own confidence in others' choices (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>). This design allowed us to investigate how attributions of confidence are modulated by decision variables such as task difficulty, observed accuracy, and observed response time. At the same time, we kept these overall behaviours constant across different agents and varied the nature of the agents making the choices -which allowed us to examine how attributions of metacognitive states can depend on prior beliefs about agency, even when actual performance was in fact identical.</p><p>To pre-empt our results, we found a robust illusion of confidence in AI systems, despite observed behaviour being identical to matched human agents, and despite attributions of metacognition in both cases being governed by similar factors. In additional experiments, we tested the robustness and generalisability of these results, examining how confidence is attributed when machines display human-like (Experiment 1) or stereotyped behaviour (Experiment 2), when artificial agents are described in more or less anthropomorphic ways (Experiment 3), and when the task involves a general knowledge quiz (Experiment 4) rather than perceptual judgments. Finally, we explored the impact of perceived confidence on actual behaviour by examining advice-taking in a collaborative decision-making task (Experiment 5). Overall, these results reveal how people perceive metacognition in humans and machines, and demonstrate how even illusory attributions of confidence can have powerful influences on perceived trustworthiness and collaborative behaviour in human-human and human-machine interactions.</p><p>Perceiving Confidence p. 6</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1: Observing Perceptual Decisions</head><p>To investigate how people attribute confidence to others, we designed a task divided into two phases, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. In the first phase ('Self'), participants made a series of perceptual decisions -namely, which of two noise patches contained a Gabor stimulus with varying opacity <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. In the second phase ('Other'), participants watched other agents make these decisions, with these agents being either another person <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1B</ref>) or a robot <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1C</ref>), presented in a randomised order. The behaviour of these agents (namely, accuracy and response times) was determined by the behaviour of one of 20 real "counterpart participants" who had previously taken part in the experiment (for details, see Methods and Materials). Importantly, each participant was matched with one counterpart participant, whose performance determined the behaviour of both agents seen by the participant in the 'Other' phase. The same behavioural parameters and generative functions thus determined the behaviour of both the other person and the robot, such that within each participant performance was equated across the two agents. We hypothesised that estimates of other agents' confidence would depend on the difficulty of the task, but also on their behaviour (namely, accuracy and response times), as well as on their nature (human vs. artificial). All analyses reported here were pre-registered unless noted otherwise.</p><p>Perceiving Confidence p. 7 <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Overview of Design for Experiment 1. (A) Participants first completed a perceptual decision-making task where they selected which of two stimuli contained a Gabor patch (Phase One; 'Self'). (B and C) Next, participants observed other agents complete the same task, and reported their perception of the other agent's confidence (Phase Two; 'Other'). The other agent was described and depicted as either another person (B) or a robot (C), although their actual performance on the task was identical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cues to Others' Confidence</head><p>Attributions of confidence were sensitive to task parameters (i.e., task difficulty) as well as observed performance (i.e., accuracy and response times). As predicted, participants attributed higher confidence on easier trials where the target was presented at higher contrast (main effect of task difficulty: B=0.54, SE=0. <ref type="bibr">14, t(19777)</ref>  . This effect mirrors a classic statistical signature of confidence, the folded X pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>, suggesting that people have a sophisticated understanding of the factors affecting others' confidence.</p><p>We also investigated a possible relationship between self-directed and other-directed metacognition. We operationalised self-directed metacognition as metacognitive efficiency as participants were completing the detection task in Phase One, and other-directed metacognition as the granularity of their attributions for other agents in the observation in Phase Two. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no correlation between participants' metacognitive efficiency and their capacity for other-directed metacognition (r(111)=-0.06, p=.556). Inferred confidence was generally higher for easier trials, but only when the agent was accurate (green) and not when inaccurate (red). These data are from Experiment 1, but these patterns were robust across all experiments. Error bands represent 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>Perceiving Confidence p. 9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confidence in Humans versus Machines</head><p>We next turned to our key question of whether and how attributions of confidence differed between humans and machines. Strikingly, perceived confidence was higher for robots (mean=54. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanisms of Confidence Attribution</head><p>To further deconstruct the relative contribution of observed behaviour and prior beliefs about the agents to confidence attributions, in an additional exploratory analysis we investigated how confidence attributions on a given trial were affected by observations on previous trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3B</ref>). We found that confidence attributions on a given trial were influenced by the type of agent and their behaviour on the current trial (main effect of agent, accuracy, difficulty, response time, accuracy × difficulty interaction: all ps&lt;.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3B</ref>, left), but also by their behaviour on previous trials. This was especially true for previous response times (all ps&lt;.006), and less so for the interaction between accuracy and difficulty (ps=.386, .094, .968, .029, and .226; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3B</ref>, middle). The strongest predictors of confidence attributions however were previous confidence attributions, which leaked into the current trial (all ps&lt;.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3B, right)</ref>. This suggests that while attributions of confidence are sensitive to observed behaviour, they are also influenced by longer-timescale fluctuations, consistent with previously reported empirical patterns in selfdirected metacognitive judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>. This confidence leak phenomenon was also similar when interacting with both human and AI agents, as the impact of all variables from previous trials did not interact with agent type (all ps&gt;.095, except for the accuracy x difficulty interaction Perceiving Confidence p. 10 on the third and fourth previous trials being stronger for the robot vs. the human, ps=.037 and .058). This suggests that attributions of confidence are sophisticated, in that they show integration over time similar to that observed for self-directed metacognition, but they are also biased, in that they are systematically higher for robots irrespective of both current and recent observed behaviour.</p><p>In addition, we sought to further characterise this illusion of confidence by exploring its timecourse across trials, i.e. as participants observe the agents make their choices <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3C</ref>). We  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>From Perceived Confidence to Social Impressions</head><p>At the end of the experiment, we also asked participants to evaluate the agents' trustworthiness and competence (for details, see Methods and Materials). As depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure   3D</ref>, the artificial agent was rated as more trustworthy than the other person (t(112)=3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51</ref> These higher-level social impressions thus mirror the higher attributions of confidence -and indeed, an additional exploratory analysis revealed that attributions of confidence were positively correlated with both trustworthiness (r(224)=0.23, p&lt;.001) and competence (r(224)=0.26, p&lt;.001). This suggests that attributions of metacognition are related to the formation of broader personality impressions, even for artificial systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2: Machine-like Behaviour</head><p>The results of Experiment 1 show that people form estimates of other agents' confidence guided by a sophisticated model of their behaviour, but that these attributions are consistently inflated for artificial agents. In Experiment 1, however, the behaviour of both agents was humanlike, with accuracy and response times derived from the actual behaviour of "counterpart participants" who had previously taken part in the study. In Experiment 2, we sought to test the robustness of this illusion of confidence in AI by investigating whether it also arises when observing stereotyped, machine-like behaviour. This experiment was identical to Experiment 1, except that accuracy at each difficulty level was now based on the accuracy of a neural network trained to complete the perceptual discrimination task, and observed response times were now faster and less variable (for details, see Methods and Materials). As in Experiment 1, these generative functions were kept constant across both machine and human agents. We also replicated the (now pre-registered) effect of trial order, with stronger differences in the effect of agent at the beginning of each block, especially for participants who watched the other person before the robot (three-way interaction between trial number, agent, and block order: B=1.64, SE=0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3: Machine-like Descriptions</head><p>In both Experiments 1 and 2, the non-human agent was described and depicted as a robot <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1C)</ref>. To ensure that attributions of metacognition were not influenced by this anthropomorphic presentation, we conducted a new experiment identical to Experiment 2, but where the agents were no longer explicitly pictured, and the non-human agent was described as a computer algorithm (for details, see Methods and Materials).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4B</ref>). This is particularly striking given that in this design displays of agent behaviour were now identical, with the only difference being whether the agent was labelled as either a human or computer algorithm prior to the observation trials.</p><p>We also replicated the interaction between agent and difficulty (B=-0.86, SE=0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4: A General Knowledge Task</head><p>All experiments reported thus far involved a perceptual decision-making task, with participants deciding (and watching others decide) which of two stimuli contained a Gabor grating. However, past work has shown that attitudes towards algorithms can vary depending on the type of task at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. To ensure these effects are not specific to tasks involving perception, we investigated a different decision-making domain involving real-world knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. Experiment 4 was thus similar to Experiment 3, except that the perceptual task was replaced by a general knowledge task where agents select which of two countries has a larger population ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4C</ref>).</p><p>We also replicated the three-way interaction between trial number, agent, and block order (B=0.81, SE=0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43</ref>, p&lt;.001). These results suggest that even in general knowledge tests, people expect algorithms to be more confident in their answers, despite the algorithm's performance being equivalent to other agents. This shows how the effects uncovered in previous experiments are not specific to perceptual decision-making but rather also arise in general-knowledge domains relevant to real-world decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 5: Influences on Advice-Taking</head><p>The experiments discussed so far show that people can form estimates of others' confidence across different behavioural profiles, agent descriptions, and task domains. These attributions were however always measured via explicit ratings ("How confident do you think the other person was?"), and it remains unclear whether and how they affect behaviour in more ecologically valid scenarios. For example, effective metacognition is important for guiding advice-taking in joint decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>: optimal advice integration should weigh our own confidence against others' confidence, such that advice given with low confidence should have a lower impact than advice given with high confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. To investigate the effect of perceived confidence on advice-taking, we designed a task where participants make perceptual choices, and are then given the opportunity to revise their choice after receiving 'advice' from one of two other agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref> -either another person or a computer algorithm ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4D; for</ref>  . This experiment thus showed that participants do not just attribute higher confidence to artificial agents, but are also more willing to defer to their advice as a consequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Successful cooperation requires an understanding of others' mental states such as their feelings, goals, and beliefs -and indeed much work across all areas of psychology and neuroscience has explored our rich capacity for mental state attributions. Here we consider that in addition to others' cognitive states, social interactions also require that we perceive others' metacognitive states -namely how confident others are in their beliefs and decisions. Across five experiments, we found that when watching other agents make decisions, people form sophisticated estimates of their confidence, influenced by both task variables (e.g., difficulty) and observed behaviours (e.g., response time). Strikingly, however, people also consistently ascribed higher confidence to the decisions of artificial agents, compared to those of performance- The illusion of confidence uncovered in these experiments was especially striking given that in each experiment, the behaviour of the artificial agents was in fact equated to the human agents: the observed accuracy and response times were drawn from the same generative functions, such that any difference in perceived confidence solely reflected participants' assumptions about the agents. Indeed, further analyses of learning effects revealed that this bias was stronger at the beginning of the experimental blocks, and diminished thereafter as participants observed the agents' behaviour -suggesting that it may originate from a generalised prior belief that machine decisions are more confident. However, while this effect was modulated by observation and learning, it was also robust and highly replicable: the illusion of confidence in artificial agents was consistent across different behavioural profiles, arising both when the agents' behaviours were based on actual participants who had previously completed the experiment (Experiments 1, 4, and 5) and when based on a neural network trained to complete the task (Experiments 2 and 3). In addition to its robustness, the illusory boost in confidence for artificial agents was also sensitive to contextual factors, interacting with choice difficulty in Experiments 1 to 3, and with response times in Experiment 1.</p><p>Of note, in all Experiments participants reported that the computer algorithm was not just more confident in each choice, but also overall more trustworthy and more competent compared to the matched human counterpart. While future work is needed to probe possible causal relationships between perceived metacognition and social impressions, this result suggests that illusions of confidence may play an important role in human-machine interactions. For example, past work has shown that when making decisions in groups, individuals adapt their own confidence estimates to align with others' <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, raising the possibility that metacognitive processes may be altered when collaborating with humans vs. machines. In addition, an illusion of confidence may play a role in collaborations involving delegation, where human operators can choose to delegate tasks to automated agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref> and may choose to do so more often if higher confidence is attributed to a potential collaborator. The results of Experiment 5 are especially relevant in this respect, as they suggest that attributions of confidence affect advice taking in a scenario akin to AI support and assistance. In turn, our findings highlight the necessity for developing solutions for artificial metacognition that allow AI agents to appropriately communicate (potentially low) degrees of confidence in their behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>. Future work could Perceiving Confidence p. 18 explore types of metacognitive broadcasts (e.g., implicit vs. explicit) to facilitate alignment in human-AI interactions, and how these might help counter inaccurate priors.</p><p>More broadly, these investigations demonstrate a rich capacity for metacognitive attributions, introducing a new dimension to social perception and mentalizing. In particular, participants were able to intuitively perceive other agents' metacognitive states based on observed variables that past research on metacognition has shown to affect (self-)confidence. For example, in Experiments 1 and 4 participants used response time as a cue to confidence, with faster response times leading to higher confidence attributions. This result is consistent with past work showing that response times can function as cues not only to confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, but also to mental states including cognitive effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>, abstract preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42]</ref>, personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, and moral character <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. But rather than being parametrically dependent on just one variable, attributions of metacognitive states incorporated several cues as well as their interactions. For example, in all experiments participants used task difficulty as a cue to confidence, with higher confidence attributions for easier trials -but only when the decisions were correct, mirroring a classic statistical signature of confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. Importantly, comparisons with participants' own metacognitive profiles in Experiment 1 confirmed that these attributions did not just reflect participants' own confidence, but truly reflected actual inferences over others' behaviour. This form of 'folk metacognition' adds a new dimension to a growing body of evidence for how we achieve a naïve understanding of higher cognitive processes such as awareness and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>.</p><p>This initial demonstration of our capacity for metacognitive attributions also opens several new avenues for future research. For example, the current tasks involved minimal social interactions, with the other agents being described in relatively anonymous and generic terms (e.g., "another participant who previously completed this task"). However, everyday life more typically involves repeated interactions with known others who may differ in baseline metacognitive abilities, above and beyond the current context. For example, past work has shown robust individual differences in metacognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> related to variation in mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref> and personality traits such as dogmatism and radicalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>, raising the possibility that perceived confidence might depend not just on temporary states (e.g., how fast someone responds in that instance), but also on knowledge of more general personality traits (e.g., how fast someone responds in that instance compared to how they typically respond in the face of uncertainty).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceiving Confidence p. 19</head><p>The types of metacognitive attributions explored in the current study may also have rich connections to our robust capacity for self-directed metacognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. This link was partially explored in Experiment 1: we expected that participants with better metacognitive insight into their performance would also form more fine-grained metacognitive attributions about others, but did not find any significant relationship between these measures. This result is relevant to past work on action understanding, which posits that inferences of others' mental states from their actions are based on observers' own motor system. For example, past work has shown that inferences of others' confidence are relative to participants' own kinematic profiles, likely because these judgments are based on simulations of participants' own motor system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Of course, the current experiments differed from these as participants did not have access to movement kinematics; but they demonstrate that such judgments need not take into account participants' own metacognitive system, and can in principle be made on the basis of perceptual information alone. Future work could probe possible associations and dissociations between selfand other-directed metacognition, and the relative weight given to external cues such as response times <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and contextual factors and internal models of self and other ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>). An especially intriguing future direction in this domain is the study of child development, given proposals that metacognition may be scaffolded onto the development of social cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>.</p><p>In sum, these results demonstrate that people can form robust impressions of the metacognitive states of other agents. Beyond demonstrating the effect of candidate cues that affect attributions of metacognition (e.g., response times), we also highlight a striking illusion of confidence when attributing metacognition to AI, even when the actual performance is matched to humans.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments 1-3</head><p>Phase 1: Self. Participants began by completing an image discrimination task illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>. On each trial, they were shown two noise images side by side, and one also contained a Gabor patch. The noise images consisted of randomly intermixed white and black pixels, and were randomly selected for each participant on each trial without replacement amongst 1200 possible images. The Gabor patches consisted of sinusoidal gratings tilted at an orientation of 45° or 135° and were superimposed over the white noise with varying transparency, thus varying detection difficulty. Participants indicated which of the two images contained a stimulus via a keypress ('f' for left, 'j' for right), and then rated how confident they were in this choice.</p><p>This first phase began with some practice trials, where all gratings were presented at 100% opacity and feedback was given after each trial. Each trial in these practice blocks comprised: (1) a fixation cross (in 42px black Helvetica font), for 500ms; (2) the stimuli (120x120px with a 3px black border each, centred on the screen vertically and at -140 and 140px horizontally), until response; and (3) response feedback ("Correct" or "Wrong") and highlight (in Next, participants completed an experimental phase, where the grating opacity started at 100%, and was then updated on each block via a staircasing procedure: it decreased if accuracy in the last block was above 75%; increased if accuracy in the last block was below 60%; and remained unchanged otherwise. Decreases and increases occurred in steps of 50, 20, 10, 10, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, and 1 until convergence -with a maximum and minimum opacity value of 100 and 0, respectively. Each trial comprised: (1) a fixation cross, for 500ms; (2) the stimuli, until response;</p><p>(3) a blue (#0000FF) response highlight, for 500ms; and (4) a confidence prompt, until response ("How confident are you?", to be answered with a slider from 0 ["I am not confident at all"] to Phase Two: Other. Participants were then introduced to the idea that people can differ quite a lot in how confident they are in their choices, and they were shown sample distributions of confidence ratings from several previous participants for the same choice difficulty. They then began a series of blocks where they were shown choices from other agents and guessed how confident they thought the other agent was in that choice. The other agent was either another participant <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1B)</ref> or an artificial agent <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1C)</ref>  Both Phase One and the two halves of Phase Two were preceded by comprehension questions regarding which question participants would be asked in the trials to follow (e.g., "After observing the other participant's choice, you will be asked a question. Which one?").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceiving Confidence p. 23</head><p>Observed Behaviour. In Experiment 1, the agents' behaviour was determined by matching each observer with one of 20 counterpart participants who had previously completed a similar version of the experiment. In particular, these participants had completed a staircasing procedure (similar to Phase One as described above), followed by four blocks of experimental trials of the Gabor discrimination task, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44</ref>  In Experiments 2 and 3, the agents' behaviour was determined not from counterpart participants, but rather from an algorithm. This was a neural network implemented in Tensorflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref> with three convolutional blocks, each with a max pooling layer, and a fully-connected layer on top. The model was trained to discriminate between Gabor patches and noise stimuli, and an optimal opacity level was selected such that the model would have an average accuracy between 60 and 75% (thus matching the staircasing procedure from Experiment 1). On each trial we determined (1) the agent's accuracy, computed from the probability that the model would correctly classify a stimulus at that subjective difficulty level based on a psychometric function fit to its performance; (2) the agent's response time, randomly picked from a gaussian distribution with a mean of 250ms and a standard deviation of 20ms; and (3) the agent's confidence, randomly picked from a gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation based on the model's mean accuracy at that difficulty level. Again, these generative functions were importantly kept constant for each participant across both agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceiving Confidence p. 24</head><p>Debriefing. At the end of the experiment, participants were asked a series of questions regarding their performance (i.e., "How well do you think you did at deciding which box contained the grating?", and "How well do you think you did at guessing the [other participant/robot/computer algorithm]'s confidence?"), the other agents' performance (i.e., "How well do you think the [other participant/robot/computer algorithm] did on this task?"), the other agents' trustworthiness (i.e., "How much would you trust the [other participant/robot/computer algorithm] if you were working together?"), the artificial agent's functionality ("How do you think the robot/computer algorithm functions? What do you think its capabilities are?"). They were also asked about their demographics (age and gender) and experience in the survey (e.g. technical difficulties or interruptions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4</head><p>In this experiment, participants watched other agents pick which of two countries had a larger (or smaller) population and later rated how confident they thought the other agent was in that choice.

The trial characteristics (i.e., prompt and response options) and observed behaviour (i.e., accuracy, response time, and confidence) thus matched the counterpart participants' behaviour exactly -with the only constraint being a maximum response time of 12s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 5</head><p>In this experiment, participants received advice from other agents in a perceptual decision-making task. Phase One was identical to Experiments 1-3, except participants were no longer asked about their own confidence. Phase Two was instead adapted such that participants first made their own judgments, and later received the advice of another agent, after which they had the opportunity to revise their initial choices. Each trial thus comprised: (1) a fixation cross, for 500ms; (2) the stimuli, until response; (3) a response highlight, for 500ms; and (4) a screen with the advice (e.g., "Your choice: right; Other participant/Computer algorithm's choice: left") and reversal prompt ("Would you like to change your initial choice? Press 'y' for yes, 'n' for no."), until response. On some trials (with 10% probability each), this was followed by <ref type="formula">5</ref> ("another participant who previously completed this task"), and two with advice from the computer algorithm ("a computer algorithm that was built and trained to complete this task"), with the respective colour cues also randomised. The accuracy of the agents was determined as in Experiment 1, and every 11 trials (except for the last of each block pair), participants received feedback on their accuracy based on their revised choices.

To examine the relationship between self-directed metacognition and perceived metacognition, we first quantified the effect of trial difficulty on confidence attributions for each observer, agent, and accuracy, by fitting separate linear regression models predicting confidence estimates from difficulty. From these coefficients, we then operationalised other-directed metacognition as the difference between slopes on accurate vs. inaccurate trials, separately for each subject and agent.</p><p>Self-directed metacognition was operationalised as metacognitive efficiency computed via a hierarchical regression model (the RHmeta-d model, an extended version of the HMeta-d model; see https://github.com/metacoglab/HMeta-d; <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[62]</ref>).</p><p>To test whether attributions inferences of confidence might vary depending on whether they concern another person as opposed to an artificial agent, we added to the first model (with difficulty, accuracy, and response times) the agent as a fixed factor (coded as other person: -0.5, robot [Experiments 1-2] or algorithm [Experiments 3-4]: 0.5). To further deconstruct this effect, we ran an exploratory analysis predicting attributions of confidence from accuracy (interacting with difficulty), response time, and agent on the current trial, as well as accuracy (interacting with difficulty), response time, and confidence on each the previous five trials, again with observer number as a random intercept, and discarding the first 5 trials of each block.

Indeed, the effects of both trial number and agent were stronger for participants who watched the other person first (two-way interaction between trial number and block order: B=0.34, SE=0.11, t(19769)=3.12, p=.002, CI=[0.13, 0.56]; between agent and block order: B=-11.60, SE=1.48, t(19769)=-7.83, p&lt;.001, CI=[-14.51, -8.70]).

Advice-taking behaviour was consistent with the explicit ratings of perceived confidence from previous experiments. When receiving advice that was discordant with their initial choices (36.07% of all trials), participants sometimes reversed their choices (29.51% of discordant trials), and they did so more often when the task was more difficult (main effect of difficulty, B=0.08, SE=0.02, z=5.08, p&lt;.001, CI=[0.05, 0.11]) and when they were initially wrong (main effect of initial accuracy, B=0.99, SE=0.10, z=9.79, p&lt;.001, CI=[0.79, 1.19]). There was also an Perceiving Confidence p. 16 interaction between difficulty and initial accuracy (B=0.20, SE=0.03, z=6.23, p&lt;.001, CI=[0.14, 0.26]) wherein initial choices were revised more often on more difficult trials when the initial choice was incorrect (slope=0.18, SE=0.02, CI=[0.14, 0.23]), but not when correct (slope=-0.02, SE=0.02, CI=[-0.06, 0.03]). Most importantly, we observed a main effect of agent (B=1.37, SE=0.10, z=13.08, p&lt;.001, CI=[1.16, 1.58]), with a greater number of choice revisions after receiving advice from the AI (mean=1.87, SE=0.20) vs. the other person (mean=0.45, SE=0.19; Fig. 4D). We also replicated the three-way interaction between trial number, agent, and block order (B=0.12, SE=0.05, z=2.37, p=.018, CI=[0.02, 0.22]).

Participants were able to take part in the experiments if they were fluent in English, had a Prolific task approval rate of at least 95%, and had not previously participated in any of the other studies reported here. As per our pre-registered plan, we recruited N=120 participants for Experiment 1. This sample size was determined via a poweranalysis of pilot data (N=18) and was fixed for Experiment 2. The sample size for the remaining experiments was halved to N=60 based on a power analysis of Experiments 1 and 2. All methods and procedures were approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided their informed consent. Participants were excluded according to our pre-registered plans if they (1) had a viewport size smaller than 720x500px (N=1 in Experiment 4); (2) reported having encountered problems (see Debriefing; N=2 in Experiment 1, N=1 in Experiment 2); (3) failed to answer our open-ended text questions sensibly (see Debriefing; N=1 in Experiment 1, N=1 in Experiment 5); (4) had a mean accuracy in the catch questions about the agents' confidence lower than 70% for Experiment 5 (N=6); and (5) converged on a target with opacity level lower than 5% in Phase 1 (N=4, 10, 4, 1; in Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively).

As for the other preregistered exclusion criteria, no participants participated more than once as determined via their Prolific IDs, and no participants provided uniform confidence ratings in Phase Two (i.e. with 80% of ratings below 10% or above 90%) for Experiments 1 through 4.</figDesc></figure>
