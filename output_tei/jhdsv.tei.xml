<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Fear can significantly increase the experienced pain intensity in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain and limit their ability to engage in daily activities. Fear of movement-related pain (FMRP) is commonly assessed via self-report, but research suggests measuring psychophysiological or behavioral parameters as an alternative. The objective of this scoping review was to identify and evaluate existing paradigms to induce FMRP, as well as the psychophysiological, behavioral and neural measurements used for its assessment. Experimental studies, with adult participants (≥18 years, healthy and chronic pain) observing or performing movements were included if they used a FMRP induction paradigm or measured psychophysiological and behavioral proxies of FMRP. A total of 1883 studies were screened; 34 eligible studies were included. Paradigms inducing FMRP involved anticipated pain paired with movement (via classical or operant conditioning) or elicited pre-existing FMRP through the observation of movements potentially associated with pain. The identified studies employed various psychophysiological and behavioral measures indicating FMRP, such as response latency/duration, decision-making behavior, eyeblink startle response, and autonomic nervous system responses (e.g., skin conductance, heart rate, respiratory rate), as well as neural correlates (fMRI). fMRI studies revealed activation in fear-and pain-processing brain areas that correlated with patientreported measurements (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus, lateral orbitofrontal cortex). Among the psychophysiological and behavioral measures displaying significant differences between fear-evoking, and neutral conditions, heart rate, respiratory response, skin conductance, and eyeblink-startle response demonstrated the largest effect sizes. In conclusion, physiological reactions can be measured during imagined, observed, or performed movements as a proxy for FMRP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>People with chronic pain are often afraid of movements that they believe to cause harm or worsen their pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[77]</ref>. According to the fear-avoidance model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[77]</ref>, psychological factors such as pain-related fear and avoidance are important contributors to disability. The model proposes that pain-related worrying (often referred to as pain catastrophizing <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>) and negative affectivity, driven by threatening illness information, or individual tendencies to interpret pain as harmful or threatening, heighten the chance of acquiring fear of pain, fear of movement or fear of (re)injury, subsequently leading to avoidance behavior. The resulting outcomes may include the development of depression and functional disability. This vicious circle influences the level of pain and unpleasantness as well as the level of functional disability <ref type="bibr">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">76]</ref>.</p><p>The fear-avoidance model suggests that fear of movement-related Pain (FMRP) is acquired through classical conditioning, where an initially neutral movement (CS) is associated with pain or injury (US).</p><p>FMRP can also be learned through indirect pathways, such as observational learning or instructional learning <ref type="bibr">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">64]</ref>. Meulders and colleagues developed two FMRP induction paradigms: the voluntary joystick movement paradigm (VJM) and the robotic arm-reaching task, with the latter being an operant learning paradigm, so focusing on learning of the relationship between one's own behavior and its consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">55]</ref>. Other paradigms use imagery or action observation to trigger FMRP in chronic low back pain participants <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">42]</ref>.</p><p>Different types of pain-related fear are often grouped under the umbrella construct of FMRP <ref type="bibr">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">62]</ref>.</p><p>Common subconstructs include kinesiophobia (fear of (re)injury), fear of movement, pain-related fear, and fear-avoidance beliefs, with overlapping but distinct definitions <ref type="bibr">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">62]</ref>. Kinesiophobia is originally defined as "an excessive, irrational, and debilitating fear of physical movement and activity resulting from a feeling of vulnerability to painful injury or reinjury" <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref>. Although the term "kinesiophobia" is still widely used, it has recently been criticized for being pathologizing and potentially stigmatizing as it aligns with a phobia-based model of psychopathology <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Chronic pain is likely not a normal situation where patients respond abnormally, as seen in many psychopathological disorders, but rather an unusual condition to which patients have culturally normative responses <ref type="bibr">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">44]</ref>. One option is to use the term fear of (re)injury instead. The subconstruct fear of movement is defined as "a specific fear of movement and physical activity that is (wrongfully) assumed to cause reinjury" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[75]</ref>. Painrelated fear "incorporates fear of pain, fear of injury, fear of physical activity and so forth" <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Fearavoidance beliefs are cognitive beliefs that avoiding activity reduces pain, leading to negative reinforcement <ref type="bibr">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">81]</ref>.</p><p>The aforementioned constructs can be assessed using self-reported questionnaires, which provide clinically relevant patient perspectives, but are limited by social desirability, recall, and acquiescent response biases <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">62]</ref>. To address these limitations and more accurately assess FMRP, psychophysiological and behavioral parameters may be useful.</p><p>Known physiological responses related to fear (in general) correspond to functions of the autonomic nervous system <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">78]</ref>. When observing a fear-evoking movement, such as bending the back or lifting a heavy object, the autonomic nervous system reacts with a heart rate increase, higher frequency of breathing and increased skin conductance in patients with low back pain <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. Only a small number of studies report on autonomic fear responses that are associated with pain or movement <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">78]</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Meier et al. (2018)</ref> identified different neural sources for the above mentioned constructs of FMRP in the central nervous system by analyzing fMRI data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[43]</ref>. However, other research, such as Barke et al. (2012), found no significant fear-related activations in high-and lowavoidant low back pain (LBP) patients specifically when viewing back-straining activities <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Since most of the literature refers to research on fear in general and does not focus on fear related to pain and movement, the aim of this scoping review is (1) to present the diversity within experimental paradigms used to induce FMRP, as well as (2) to identify psychophysiological, behavioral and neural measurement methods to quantify FMRP and its underlying constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This scoping review was designed, conducted and reported using the recommendations for scoping reviews published by PRISMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[72]</ref>. The protocol was pre-registered in the open science framework platform (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CTNRH) and updated in February 2024. The eligibility criteria were expanded to include additional experimental study designs beyond the original plan, resulting in a greater variety of reported paradigms. The amendment was reported in the OSF.</p><p>Experimental study designs (e.g., experimental lab studies, case reports, clinical trials, controlled clinical trials and randomized clinical trials) published in English or German language from inception until February 2024 were included. Participants of included studies had to be adult humans (≥ 18 years, healthy and chronic pain participants) performing, imagining, or observing a movement. Studies were included if they report a paradigm used to induce or elicit FMRP (e.g. VJMP, PHODA-paradigm) and /or measured arousal, behavioral responses or neural correlates related to FMRP. Measures of avoidance behavior were included as well, although they are not measuring FMRP itself, but the avoidance behavior as a consequence or behavioral correlate of FMRP. Studies investigating pain and fear in the dentistry, studies about fear of falling, fear of childbirth and other fears not related to pain and movement were excluded. Studies solely reporting self-reported FMRP were excluded as well, as a separate review has already been published about patient-reported outcome measurements <ref type="bibr">(PROM)</ref> to assess FMRP in 2023 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[62]</ref>.</p><p>The databases Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline (PubMed), PsychNet, Scopus and Web of Science were searched with predefined combinations of MeSH terms and free-text terms <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>.

In a first step, titles and abstracts were screened by three independent reviewers against the eligibility criteria. All studies rated as eligible by at least one reviewer were screened in a full-text evaluation against the same eligibility criteria. The decisions for inclusion or exclusion of studies were made by three independent researchers (TMS, MB, LP). Conflicting results were rated by a fourth independent researcher (KL).</p><p>Data from included studies were entered into a pre-designed data extraction sheet. These included the number of participants, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, the paradigm used to induce or elicit FMRP, patient-reported FMRP and psychophysiological, behavioral or neuronal measurements used <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table I</ref>, supplementary material). The data extraction was performed by a single author (LP) and independently verified by two additional authors (MB, TMS) to ensure accuracy and reliability. If data were not reported in the full-texts, authors were contacted via email and sent reminders after one</p><p>week.</p></div>

Although the authors of the study including chronic headache participants stated that "participants with chronic headache constitute a clinical control group, which is not prone to fear of movement", the chronic headache population may represent an interesting group for evaluating FMRP responses, as these patients often experience The results of the individual studies are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table I (supplementary material)</ref>.</p><p>Paradigms to induce/condition fear of movement-related pain</p><p>The majority of the studies (n=19) used the VJM paradigm developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Meulders et al. (2011)</ref> with different adaptions <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">20,</ref><ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">80]</ref>. All except two of these studies included healthy participants. The remaining two included participants with fibromyalgia as well as healthy controls. The VJM paradigm is a classical (Pavlovian) differential conditioning paradigm: participants are exposed to conditioned stimuli (CSs; proprioceptive, joystick movements) with at least one movement direction (CS+) being paired with the unconditioned stimulus (pain-US; painful electrocutaneous stimulus), and one movement direction never being paired with the pain-US (CS-), leading to differential acquisition of conditioned responding (CR; fear of movement-related pain) (i.e. to the CS+, but not to the CS-). The participants receive instructions to move the joystick in a voluntary direction or as visually indicated on-screen. Counter bars displayed on the screen serve as visual feedback, indicating whether the movement was executed accurately. All of the included studies calibrated painful electrocutaneous stimuli to tolerance level (applied to the wrist of the dominant, joystick controlling hand) as the pain-US, that was associated to a certain movement direction of the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[53]</ref>. Hence, the closing movement was followed by the pain-US (CS+) leading to a FMRP for the joystick movement associated with the closing of a box. <ref type="bibr">Volders et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Volders et al. ( , 2015</ref>) gave their participants the option to actively avoid the pain-US by pressing a safety button to test the effect of avoidance behavior on the return of fear (when this safety button was no longer available), a phenomenon known as "protection from extinction" <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">80]</ref>.</p><p>The robotic arm-reaching task is another paradigm developed to induce FMRP <ref type="bibr">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">52]</ref>. The robotic arm apparatus has a force controlled haptic interface, so weight and force needed to reach different targets can be simulated. In one of the included studies, the to-be-performed movements were predefined circles <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. Here, one of the movement directions (clockwise/counterclockwise) was paired with the pain-US. In this study, the robotic arm-reaching task was used as a classical conditioning paradigm, focusing on the learning of FMRP as a CR. But in contrast to the before described paradigms, the robotic arm is mainly used in operant conditioning paradigms, focusing on the learning of painrelated avoidance behavior and its consequences. In three of the studies, the robotic arm needed to be moved in a horizontal plane to reach the target. There were three possible movement trajectories indicated by separate arches positioned midway the movement plane to reach the target, which are associated with different force applied to reach it and different distances (e.g., longer distance = more force is needed) <ref type="bibr">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">52]</ref>. The shortest way to reach the target was paired with a painful electrocutaneous stimulus (100% reinforcement) as well as the middle movement trajectory (50% reinforcement) with varying contingencies in different studies using the robotic arm. The longest movement distance is not paired with the painful stimulus. Three of the included studies further manipulated the experimental context by presenting pain stimuli with varying background colors or pictures (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor scenes) to signify either a safe or threatening context [31, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">52]</ref>. movements were shown to the participants and they were asked to perform the depicted movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[66]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Paradigms</formula><p>One study applied the modified Clarke test: a contraction of the quadriceps muscles in knee extension with and without experimental patella pressure as the fear-inducing stimulus <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(1.1) Eyeblink startle modulation</head><p>Sixteen studies measured the eyeblink startle modulation by using an electromyographic activity measurement of the orbicularis oculi muscle <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">31,</ref><ref type="bibr">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">80]</ref>. All of them used startle probes (e.g., burst of white noise) to elicit the eyeblink startle reaction. The burst of white noise was presented during the CS+, CS-, and inter-trial-interval. Past research indicates that the eyeblink startle reflex is increased in the presence of a threatening stimulus, compared to a nonthreatening stimulus <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>. The eyeblink startle response has been proven to be particularly useful in research on anxiety and fear, due to its high translational value and sensitivity to individual differences (e.g., task demands) <ref type="bibr">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">39]</ref>. All of the studies examining the eyeblink startle modulation found significant main effects for the CS+ movements (for example: den Hollander et al. 97, 2 =.16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[58]</ref>). The included studies examined the fear reaction under different circumstances:</p><p>A threat manipulation showed no effect on the eyeblink startle response in the CS+ condition in the study of den Hollander et al.

For the purpose of this study, the measurements were grouped according to the following three categories: responses in the central nervous system (neural correlates), psychophysiological and behavioral responses towards FMRP stimuli ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref>).  Additionally, it seems reasonable, that fear responses are more effectively triggered if avoidance behavior is constrained or if participants are directly exposed to the feared movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[44]</ref>. Less frequently used were brain imaging techniques, allowing to map neural correlates of FMRP and providing evidence that the processing of FMRP is surprisingly similar in different populations (i.e. healthy, chronic low back pain, patellofemoral pain).</p><p>A remarkable finding was that the activation of certain fear-related areas correlates with high TSK and</p><p>FABQ scores, indicating that the different constructs "fear of (re)injury" and "fear-avoidance beliefs"  In clinical practice, FMRP is measured by self-reported outcomes (for an overview see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[62]</ref>). However, the most commonly used questionnaires (TSK, FABQ) were criticized in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[63]</ref>. Self-reported questionnaires may lack sensitivity as they do not assess task-specific fear but rather general fear of movement. The importance of task-specific fear has been underscored in a review of the fear- intervention evaluation (e.g. exposure therapy), ultimately contributing to improved clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[70]</ref>. While this review offers important insights into the underlying learning mechanisms and the neural processing of FMRP, the direct clinical applicability of these measures is limited due to their high cost, time requirements, and the specialized expertise needed for implementation. Furthermore, the experimental settings used in these studies often lacked the real-world distractions and complexities that might affect measurement validity in clinical settings.</p><p>Hence, a general clinical importance of these measures has to be examined in future research.</p><p>Additionally, a replication of the psychophysiological measurements is required to allow for a more robust conclusion and generalizability to other pain conditions.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Among the reviewed paradigms, the VJMP is the most extensively researched for the learning of fear associated with pain and/or movement. Conditioned fear can subsequently be examined in experimental settings under varying conditions (e.g., change of context, additional stimuli), providing further insight into confounders and underlying learning mechanisms.In contrast, pictures of potentially harmful or painful movements have demonstrated high efficiency in eliciting pre-existing FMRP, proving its usage in brain imaging studies, among others, and therefore providing deeper insights into the processing of FMRP on brain level.The measurements found in this review ranged from psychophysiological measurements, over behavioral measurements to brain imaging techniques.Of these, the eyeblink startle modulation was the most extensively researched for FMRP assessment and is a widely used measure of fear across various fear-related contexts. The startle reflex (eyeblink) elicited by a probe (e.g., burst of white noise) is increased if the participants are exposed to athreatening cue (CS+) in comparison to a non-threatening cue (CS-) [39]. The studies included in this review provide evidence that the eyeblink startle response is a valid proxy for the measurement of FMRP, across various paradigms, including classical and operant conditioning studies, and one movement imagination study. Meulders &amp; Vlaeyen ascertained that "merely the intention to perform the painful movement can elicit conditioned fear responses" when measuring the eyeblink startle modulation [56]. Interestingly, Kronshage et al. (2001) found no significant influence on the eyeblink startle response in participants imagining a potentially harmful movement without anticipation of an actual movement [33]. In the latter study, fear was not conditioned within the experimental setting but rather a presumed pre-existing FMRP was triggered, probably accounting for the observed differences in the eyeblink startle response. Autonomic responses, such as heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and skin conductance response (SCR), also emerged as reliable proxies for FMRP, supported by the large effect sizes found by Díaz-Saez et al. (2021) [21]. As these measurements are well-established in fear research, transferring the insights and successfully validating the measurements within the context of FMRP is a reasonable and expected advancement. Additionally, pupil dilation, commonly used as a proxy for fear in fearconditioning studies, may provide valuable supplementary data for future FMRP studies [12,65].</figDesc></figure>

Given the close relationship between and interference of pain, fear, and avoidance behavior and their mutual influence as described in the fear-avoidance model, these results are unsurprising [37,77]. Measuring FMRP by monitoring the autonomic responses showed the most promising results in chronic low back pain participants with large effect sizes, while the eyeblink startle modulation is applicable for people with chronic pain and healthy controls, also showing robust effect sizes. Measuring brain cell activation after movement observation works well for participants with chronic low back pain and healthy controls, and using Pavlovian learning mechanisms, with patellofemoral pain as well [7-9,41-43,70].</figDesc></figure>

Hence, the last mentioned provoked a goal conflict between a fear-avoidance goal and reward-seeking goal. The VJM paradigm was adapted by Karos et al. (2015) by manipulating the social context while conditioning FMRP by using different facial expressions (angry vs. happy faces to create a social threatening and social safe context respectively) [30]. Geschwind et al. (2015) added a positive affect manipulation to evaluate its effect on generalization [24]. The adaptation of the VJM paradigm by Meulders et al. (2015) included a human scream as additional sound-US to analyze the return of fear using a cross-US reinstatement</figDesc><table /><note>joystick (CS) during the acquisition (learning) phase of the experiments. The included studies not only used the VJM to induce FMRP, but also to analyze its extinction under different conditions [20,30,48,50,56,79,80] and the generalization of the conditioned FMRP to novel movements and different comparable contexts [10,24,47,49,53,54,58]. Especially, it was examined how the fear response extinguishes if the pain-US was no longer presented or if its occurrence was no longer predictable. Adaptations to the VJM paradigm in the included studies are: additional manipulations such as verbal placebo/nocebo suggestions, different background colors acting as placebo or control stimulus [69], bogus feedback on skin-vulnerability or verbal instructions to manipulate the threat-value of the pain- US [10,20] and lottery tickets, monetary or personally relevant rewards as appetitiveprocedure [50].

SCR was assessed via electrodes attached to the participants' middle and index finger; for the assessment of RR, the participants wore a breathing sensor, which was placed around the chest passing over the xiphoid process; to measure HR, electrodes were applied longitudinally at the anterior and radial aspect of the wrists.

(2) Neural correlates of fear Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in seven of the included studies, with six of them using pictures of movements to elicit FMRP [8,9,41-43,70] and one inducing FMRP with a classical conditioning paradigm [7]. The time-relevant blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal was assessed to determine the changes of voxel activation in the brain from baseline measures to a fear-evoking condition. The fMRI measurement can detect underlying mechanisms and the processing of fear-evoking stimuli by assessing an increase of voxel activation in brain areas known to process fear, avoidance behavior or pain (e.g. hippocampus, amygdala, lateral orbitofrontal cortex). It has been used successfully in the investigation of anxiety in various contexts [8]. Barke et al. showed a higher activity of the left parietal lobe in participants with chronic low back pain who were highly fear-avoidant in their fMRI study from 2012 [8]. Notably, this activation pattern differs from typical responses associated with other fear-evoking stimuli, suggesting a unique neural response in this population [5,11,67]. In a following study, the same research group reported activations of brain areas in the same subgroup in more detail: right middle occipital gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobule, left cuneus and areas in the right cerebellum were activated by observing back-straining movements (PHODA-paradigm) [9]. An activation of the cuneus (bilaterally), left-middle occipital gyrus, left superior and inferior parietal lobule, left fusiform gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus [8] and the right fusiform gyrus and left inferior temporal gyrus [9] was reported for the low fear-avoidant participants in the beforementioned studies. Healthy participants had an activation of the left-middle temporal gyrus and right cerebellum [8], as well as the left precuneus [8,9], the bilateral occipital gyri, right inferior and superior parietal lobule, cuneus, left inferior temporal gyrus and declive [9]. In 2016, Barke et al. found significant differences of the high fear-avoidant participants compared to the low fear-avoidant participants in the following brain areas: greater activations in right hippocampus, right parahippocampal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus [9]. There was no significant difference between groups (high fear-avoidant vs. low fear-avoidant vs. healthy participants) when watching aversive or neutral pictures in their study from 2012 [8]. conditioned pain-word associations on response latency and observed no delay in movement initiation when a pain-associated word was presented [10]. Referring to Karos et al. (2015), there seems to be no effect of stimulus type (painful/nonpainful) for the response latency, but the participants become In 2015, positive correlation of the TSK scores was confirmed in a following study where healthy participants and participants with low back pain were included: left OFC extending into the left amygdala (t = 6.04, p(FWEcluster) = .001, r = .70), left middle temporal gyrus (t = 5.82, p(FWEcluster) = .001, r = .69), left postcentral gyrus (S1)/precuneus (t = 5.81, p(FWEcluster) = .001, r = .69), left rolandic operculum (t = 4.78, p(FWEcluster) = .043, r = .61), left angular gyrus (t = 4.64, p(FWEcluster) = .001, r = .58), left anterior insula (t = 4.01, p(FWEcluster) = .001, r = .53) right caudate (t = 4.00, p(FWEcluster) = .020, r = .55) [42]. Additionally, there was a significant group difference (healthy vs. CLBP) based on the TSK score in the correlation to left dorsal amygdala (t = 3.87, p &lt; .001 uncorrected, SVC p(FWEvoxel) &lt; .05) in the first level analysis and a significant group difference dependent on the TSK score in the functional connectivity between the left amygdala seed and the right anterior insula (t = 5.14, p(FWEcluster) = .011) in the second level analysis. In 2018, Meier et al. limited their inclusion to low back pain participants and demonstrated, that participants scoring high on the FABQ (measuring fear-avoidance beliefs) had an activation of the left thalamus, the right amygdala and the left hippocampus (&gt;69% of the total region weights) during observation of aversive movements. In contrast, participants with high TSK scores showed an activation of the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC; TSK-13, 52.7%; TSK-11, 60.49%) during the observation of aversive movements using the PHODA [43]. The findings revealed a clear distinction between the construct of fear of (re)injury and fear-avoidance beliefs. In the fMRI study by Timmers et al. (2019), participants had an activation of the posterior insula that was positively correlated to pain-related fear, whereas a decrease in activity in the medial prefrontal cortex was associated with pain-related fear while observing aversive pictures taken from the PHODA [70]. In contrast to other fMRI studies, Timmers et al. (2019) used an in vivo exposure to feared movements as an intervention. They assessed fear-related outcomes after exposure and compared significant correlations to decreases in pain-related fear from pretreatment to follow-up [70]. Barber Foss et al. (2022) showed a positive correlation between the TSK score and the activity of the right cerebellum (crus I+II), left paracingulate gyrus and frontal pole in their study, using the modified Clarke test to induce FMRP [7]. (3) Behavioral outcome measures (3.1) Response latency Response latency is one of the most common outcomes identified in this review (n=7) and it was used to measure avoidance tendencies in studies using the VJMP [10,15,16,30,55,58,69]. It reflects the hesitation to perform a CS+ compared to a CS-movement of a joystick, without real avoidance being possible. Świder et al. (2019) reported a significant between group difference, indicating that the group that was exposed to a predictable pain stimulus (attached to a certain movement of the joystick) was slower than the group with an unpredictable pain stimulus (that was not associated with a certain movement) (F(1,54) = 4.77, p = .03, 2 = .08). This was in line with the results of Claes et al. (2014), who observed that participants were moving more slowly when a pain stimulus was expected (F(1, 49) = 5.009, p = .03, d = -.31), as well as with Meulders et al. (2011) (F(1, 32) = 6.83, MSE = 35174.26, p &lt; .05), and Meulders &amp; Vlaeyen (2013) (F(1, 39) = 6.96, p &lt; .05, 2 = .15) [15,55,58]. In 2016, Claes et al. reported that participants were initially slower in making a decision when the movement was accompanied with an incongruent conditioned stimulus (presenting a reward cue with a painful movement or a pain cue with a reward-related movement) [16]. This effect disappeared over time. Bennett et al. (2015) used words as initial CS+ and then measured the response latency of the joystick movements while presenting CS+ or CS-stimuli to the participants. They investigated the impact of the significantly faster with every trial block they complete [30]. Although, Meulders et al. found a significant main effect of stimulus type in their studies from 2011 and 2013 (F(1, 32) = 5.57, MSE = 63651.80, p &lt; .05; F(1, 39) = 9.37, p &lt; .01, ηp 2 = .19) [55,58]. One study found evidence, that the context in which the stimuli are received plays a role for the movement-onset. Here, the response latency is significantly slower in a threatening context ((F(1, 40) = 8.36, p &lt; .01, d = .91, CI = .26, 1.57) [30]. (3.2) Response duration The response duration was used to measure avoidance behavior and showed a significant main effect of the condition (predictable/unpredictable pain-onset), indicating that on average the time to perform the joystick movements (from trial initiation to termination) was longer in the unpredictable condition than in the predictable condition, irrespective of stimulus type (painful/nonpainful) (F(1, 32) = 6.83, MSE = 35174.26, p &lt; .05) in one study [55]. A similar effect was observed by Świder et al. (2019): participants moved more slowly when they expected a painful stimulus (F(1,54) = 4.43, p = . 04, 2 = .08) [69]. These results could not have been replicated by Karos et al. (2015), where no differential before and after recordings. posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. The right posterior cingulate cortex showed response between painful and nonpainful movements were found [30].</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

The movements shown in the PHODA are activities of daily living which makes them highly clinically relevant. It seems reasonable, that FMRP may be more effectively elicited in participants with a history of pain than in healthy individuals, as the former group has stronger emotional associations with potentially painful movements. Surprisingly,</figDesc><table /><note>The paradigms identified by this review are the VJM paradigm, robotic arm-reaching task, modified Clarke test and movement observation paradigms (PHODA or comparable). They demonstrated efficacy in either inducing (VJMP, robotic arm-reaching task, modified Clarke test) or eliciting already existing FMRP (movement observation). The VJMP, robotic arm-reaching task and modified Clarke test utilized pain stimuli to provoke a fear reaction. Their participants had to execute a real movement when moving the joystick, robotic arm or contracting the quadriceps femoris that was conditioned with pain [7,10,15,16,20,23,24,30,47-50,53-56,58,69,79,80]. The VJMP has been mainly used with healthy participants [10,15,16,20,23,24,30,47-50,53-56,58,69,79,80] in the presented studies, but proved its effectivity in participants diagnosed with fibromyalgia [47,49] as well. The Clarke test, designed to mimic patellofemoral pain, is suitable exclusively for that specific pain population [7].Timmers et al. (2019), Meier et al. (2015, 2016) and Barke et al. (2012, 2016) demonstrated that the PHODA paradigm elicited FMRP not only in participants with chronic low back pain, but also in healthy controls [8,9,41,42,70]. Although Barke et al. (2012) suggested that FMRP processing does not involve the limbic system -unlike well-researched phobias like spider phobia -Meier et al. (2015, 2016, 2018) reported activation in limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus), which correlated with TSK and FABQ scores. This inconsistency highlights the need for further research to clarify the role of limbic structures in FMRP processing [8,41-43]. Since the pictures used in these studies were tailored to individuals with low back pain, future research should also examine alternative picture sets (e.g., the Avoidance of Daily Activity Photo Scale [1,2,71], Pictorial Fear of Activity Scale [74]) as paradigm to elicit FMRP in other pain populations. Interestingly, two different learning mechanisms were applied to induce FMRP: the VJMP and the modified Clarke test were used as a classical conditioning paradigm, while the robotic arm was used either in a classical conditioning [29] or in an operant conditioning set-up [45,46,52]. While the classical conditioning focuses on the learning of fear as a CR to a CS+, the operant conditioning focuses on the behavioral correlate of FMRP (avoidance). The movement observation paradigms elicit existing FMRP by provoking already learned avoidance-beliefs and movement-pain-associations. It can be assumed that the fear reaction is based on the imagined movement and is not biased by other stimuli.</note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data availability statement:</head><p>The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its supplementary materials. Practice: getting used to the robotic arm-reaching task -participants performed 5 movements in the experimental, pain-avoidance context (CTX_avoid; e.g., white background) and 5 in the yoked, control context (CTX_yoked; e.g., black background).</p><p>-no painful stimuli nor startle probes Acquisition: -2 trial blocks were run in the painavoidance context (e.g., white background color) and 2 blocks were run in the yoked context (e.g., black background color) -experimental group: T1, T2, and T3 were reinforced with painful stimuli at 100%, 50%, and 0%, modeling a trade-off between pain probability and effort -control group: same number of pain stimuli was presented as in the preceding experimental block, irrespective of the specific movement trajectories they chose Instructed movement phase: -distribution of startle probes equally across all movement trajectories -pain-avoidance block followed by a yoked block -the to-be-performed movement trajectory was indicated (could not be chosen freely)</p><p>Generalization: similar to the acquisition phase, but now participants also performed the arm reaching movements in 2 novel generalization contexts. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Startle probe habituation phase</head><p>Acquisition: -one movement was never followed by the pain-US (A-; safe movement). Another movement was always followed by the pain-US (B+; painful movement). The third movement was followed by a pain-US (C+) -startle probes were presented Extinction: -two groups (1) safety group: was instructed to use safety behavior (pressing a safety button on the joystick) to prevent pain-US (2) control group -third movement is no longer reinforced (C-) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Startle probe habituation phase</head><p>Acquisition: -pain-USs were delivered after the painful B + movement and the ambiguous C + / -movement, but not after the safe A-movement -startle probes were presented -no visual feedback (targets, cursor) Safety training: 3 groups: -Safety group (SG) + control group: safety button could be used to avert the pain-US (pain-avoidance goal) -reward group (RG): button would improve task performance, which could double the monetary reward (achievement goal).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reminder of acquisition: reminder presentations of the CS-US contingencies of the acquisition phase</head><p>Extinction: -pain-US was now omitted for the third movement (C -) -SG + RG: 1 of the 3 possible target regions had counter bars with red contours, indicating that the safety button could be used during the corresponding movement (C +/-) Test: Similar to extinction -counter bars no longer had red contours in the SG and RG, suggesting that the safety button should no longer be pressed. <ref type="table">/ performing well to double  the monetary reward: 11-point  Likert scale</ref> Motivation to perform well on the task: 11-point Likert scale differences between the SG and RG during the first (F&lt;1) or second extinction block (F&lt;1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of pain avoidance</head><p>Eyeblink startle modulation: CS movement X Block interaction at EXT2-TEST1 (F(2,174)=3.61, p&lt;0.05, 2 =0.04) indicates that the change across these blocks is different depending on the CS movement. Stronger fear responding in response to the painful B+ movement in the SG at TEST1 (A-vs. B+ in SG: F(1,87)=4.36, p&lt;0.05). Overall, startle responding to the safe A-movement is weaker than to the painful B+ movement at TEST1 in all groups, whereas startle responding to the ambiguous C+/-movement declines across the 2 blocks</p></div>			</div>
