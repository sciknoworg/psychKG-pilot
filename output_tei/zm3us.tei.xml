			<abstract>
				<p>Recent developments of open-source online eye-tracking algorithms suggests that they may be ready for use in online studies, thereby overcoming the limitations of in-lab eye-tracking studies. However, to date there have been limited tests of the efficacy of online eye-tracking for decision-making and cognitive psychology. In this online study, we explore the potential and the limitations of online eye-tracking tools for decision-making research using the webcam-based open-source library Webgazer (Papoutsaki et al., 2016). Our study had two aims. For our first aim we assessed different variables that might affect the quality of eyetracking data. In our experiment (N = 210) we measured a within-subjects variable of adding a provisional chin rest and a between-subjects variable of corrected vs uncorrected vision. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that the chin rest had a negative effect on data quality. In accordance with out hypotheses, we found lower quality data in participants who wore glasses. Other influence factors are discussed, such as the frame rate. For our second aim (N = 44) we attempted to replicate a decision-making paradigm where eye-tracking data was acquired using offline means (Amasino et al., 2019). We found some relations between choice behavior and eye-tracking measures, such as the last fixation and the distribution of gaze points at the moment right before the choice. However, several effects could not be reproduced, such as the overall distribution of gaze points or dynamic search strategies. Therefore, our hypotheses only find partial evidence. This study gives practical insights for the feasibility of online eye-tacking for decision making research as well as researchers from other disciplines.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications of Online Eye-Tracking</head><p>As a preemptive summary, we list five major lessons we learned from applying online eye-tracking for decision making research. Our suggestions, which are further detailed in the discussion section, provide practical guidelines for the design and procedures of online eyetracking studies in the field of decision-making and other disciplines.</p><p>1. One of the greatest challenges currently facing this tool is the large degree of variability in data quality, both with-in and between-subjects. Frequent validation and calibration of the eye-tracking data is suggested, particularly for participants with insufficient data quality. As a robust data quality measure for validation, we recommend the hit ratio, which is detailed in the Methods section <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020</ref>).</p><p>2. Giving clear and specific instructions to the participant can have a positive effect on the data quality. If possible, the participants should keep a natural but still head position, wear contact lenses instead of glasses, and use a desktop computer and an external monitor.</p><p>3. Online eye-trackers are best suited for testing relatively simple relationships between gaze and choice behavior, such as the last fixation. More subtle effects, such as gaze transitions, may be more difficult to assess. 4. Default settings of eye-trackers should be considered before data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Orquin &amp; Holmqvist, 2018)</ref>. The current version of Webgazer enables a Kalman filter, which, if turned on, makes the gaze prediction of fast gaze saccades more difficult.</p><p>5. Because of the lower accuracy of online eye-tracking, areas of interest (AOIs) should be larger than 15% of the total screen size. The most reliable gaze data could be achieved for a binary choice design with one stimulus for each choice option. These ONLINE EYE-TRACKING IN DECISION-MAKING RESEARCH 7 choice options should be horizontally aligned the choice options to ensure a large distance between the AOIs and compensate for inaccurate gaze predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploring the Potential of Online Webcam-based Eye Tracking in Decision-Making</head><p>Research and Influence Factors on Data Quality Eye-tracking Studies Help Understanding of Human Decision-Making Behavior Eye-tracking is an important research tool for understanding human decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Meißner &amp; Decker, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Orquin &amp; Mueller-Loose, 2013)</ref> and the role of visual attention, i.e., how humans recognize and select visual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bundesen, 1990)</ref>. It has been applied to understand everyday decisions in various areas, such as finance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Krol &amp; Krol, 2019)</ref>, medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al-Moteri et al., 2017)</ref>, and nutrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gidlöf et al., 2013)</ref>. Compared to other methods (e.g., fMRI), eye-tracking is less intrusive and enables a more naturalistic research environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Schulte-Mecklenbeck et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits of online eye-tracking studies</head><p>Computer scientists have recently developed Open Source computer algorithms that can predict gaze locations based on the user's interaction images from the user's webcam <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Papoutsaki et al., 2016)</ref>. This enabled researcher of various fields to combine the benefits of eye-tracking and online studies, which can result in more affordable, demographically diverse, and representative research samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goodman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Goodman &amp; Paolacci, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Henrich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Peterson, 2001)</ref>. Moreover, in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, research labs were closed and online eye-tracking methods appeared as a last-resort alternative for many researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online Eye-Tracking Tools</head><p>For this study, we will focus on the open source JavaScript based library Webgazer <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Papoutsaki et al., 2016)</ref>, which is one of the most popular online eye-tracking tools of this kind. In addition to the eye-images from the user's webcam, Webgazer uses user's mouse movements and clicks as training data, assuming an alignment between eye-and cursormovements <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Huang et al., 2012)</ref>. Webgazer is an advancement of prior webcam-based eyetrackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Huang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Xu et al., 2015)</ref> in such that it works remotely, requires a low amount of calibration, and focuses on predicting gaze points. Webgazer is still being actively developed and maintains an active discussion board on the GitHub repository page <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Papoutsaki et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online Eye-Tracking Tools Have yet to see use</head><p>Despite the benefits that online eye-tracking promises to bring, only a few behavioral researchers have made use of it so far (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Federico &amp; Brandimonte, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hsu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Madsen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Robal et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zhao et al., 2017)</ref>. Only one methods-focused study replicated a simple binary decision task using Webgazer <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>. A plausible reason for these reservations is uncertainty regarding the quality of the data obtained in the online context. Online participants could be worse at concentrating <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arechar &amp; Rand, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goodman et al., 2013)</ref>, and more likely to drop out because of data protection concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref>, high calibration effort-which can take up to 50% of the total study time <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018</ref>)-or because they do not meet the technical requirements, such as computer processing power <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Aims &amp; Hypotheses</head><p>For this study we specifically tested two major aims with five hypotheses as detailed below. The first aim concentrates on influence factors on data quality of online eye-tracking, which could indicate efficient improvements for the setup of future eye-tracking studies. The second aim concentrates on testing the feasibility decision-making studies with online eye-tracking by replicating a choice task where eye-tracking data was acquired using offline means <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Aim 1: Influence Factors on the Data Quality of Online Eye-Tracking</head><p>While previous studies showing the general feasibility for simple cognitive tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Papoutsaki et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>, there remain unresolved issues concerning the influence of participant-related factors on the data quality. The literature on in-lab eye-trackers suggests head movements and glasses as potentially efficiently controllable influence factors on the spatial resolution of online eyetracking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Head Movements</head><p>First, eye-tracking data becomes less accurate and precise when the participant moves their head <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hessels et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Niehorster et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wass et al., 2014)</ref>. Moreover, remote eye-trackers that allow a participant's head to remain in a natural position, show relatively worse data compared to tower-mounted eye-trackers, where the participant's head is fixated on a frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Holmqvist et al., 2011)</ref>. The current release of Webgazer <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Papoutsaki et al., 2020)</ref> cannot distinguish eye-from head movements, which can result in different gaze estimations, even if the participant looks at the same point on the screen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Semmelmann and Weigelt (2018)</ref> proposed that a provisional chin rest might improve the data quality of Webgazer. We therefore hypothesize that such a chin rest could help against the negative effects of head movements:</p><p>H1a: A chin rest instruction positively affects the eye-tracking data quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glasses</head><p>Second, in-lab eye-tracker show a lower accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Paulus et al., 2017</ref>) (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nyström et al., 2013)</ref> and precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Nyström et al., 2013)</ref> for participants with glasses. This could be due to two reasons: First, reflections from the glasses can distort the eye-images obtained from the webcam. Second, the frame of glasses could occlude the participant's eye and impair its detection on the webcam images, which could result in data loss and poor calibration. We therefore hypothesize that glasses have a negative effect on the spatial resolution of webcam-based online eye-tracking. If the hypothesis holds true, participants with visual impairment, where possible, could easily be instructed to switch to less reflective visual aids (e.g., contact lenses), or none if they are short-sighted:</p><p>H1b: Wearing glasses negatively relates to eye-tracking data quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Aim 2: Relationship Between Eye-Movements and Choice Behavior Online</head><p>Our second Study Aim is to explore the feasibility of online decision-making research with online eye-tracking tools on multi-attribute choice tasks by replicating an intertemporal discounting paradigm where eye-tracking data was acquired using offline means <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. Like in the original study, we attempt to find associations between gaze distribution, gaze movement, and choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Outcomes Relate to the Relative Distribution of Gaze Points</head><p>Across diverse choice paradigms, participants' choice behavior can be predicted by their relative distribution of gaze on the respective choice option, such as the last fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Franco-Watkins et al., 2016)</ref>, the total number of fixations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Franco-Watkins et al., 2016)</ref> and the number of gaze points <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. Possible explanations for this so-called utility effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Orquin &amp; Mueller-Loose, 2013)</ref> are underlying preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Shimojo et al., 2003</ref>) (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Glaholt &amp; Reingold, 2009)</ref>, comparison processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Glaholt &amp; Reingold, 2011)</ref>, evidence accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Krajbich et al., 2010)</ref> or a causal biasing effect of attention on choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gwinn et al., 2019)</ref>. In an online eye-tracking study with a binary choice task, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang and Krajbich (2020)</ref> found relationships between choice behavior and eye-tracking measurements, such as dwell time and fixations. Following this line of research, we hypothesize to find similar associations between gaze distribution and choice:</p><p>H2a: Participants' choices can be predicted by the number of gaze points on the respective choice option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intertemporal Choice Behavior</head><p>Intertemporal choices are choices between smaller but immediate (smaller-sooner; SS) and larger but delayed (larger-later; LL) rewards. Most studies on intertemporal discounting use choice tasks with four information attributes, i.e., one amount and time attribute for each option <ref type="bibr">(Figurec)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainslie, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grune-Yanoff, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mazur, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Odum, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Samuelson, 1937)</ref>. Two types of models were used to understand how humans integrate these two types of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Payne et al., 1988)</ref>: Option-wise integration models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainslie, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grune-Yanoff, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mazur, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Odum, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Samuelson, 1937)</ref> state that the subjective value (SV) of the reward of a choice option A decreases depending on the time delay and the discounting parameter k for participant i for the respective option. The relative value (RV) of a choice option A against choice option B could be formalized as the difference in SV. In contrast, attribute-wise integration models state that amount and time information are integrated separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ericson et al., 2015)</ref>, for example by integrating the difference in monetary reward and the difference in time across the choice options <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. These two intertemporal choice models imply distinct information search patterns, which can be empirically tested using eye-tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Franco-Watkins et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Liu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reeck et al., 2017)</ref>. Two of those implications are highlighted below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Outcomes Relate to More Gaze Points on Amount Information</head><p>First, participants who have more gaze points on amount rather than time information tend to make more patient decisions in intertemporal choice tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reeck et al., 2017)</ref>. Possible explanations for this are that the relative gaze indicates a lower subjective value for time information as the discounting factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Scholten et al., 2014)</ref> or a causal effect of attention to time information on impatient choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ebert &amp; Prelec, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Radu et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>H2b: Participants' choices for immediate over delayed options negatively relate to the relative number of gaze points on amount versus time attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Outcomes Relate to Attribute-Wise Gaze Transitions Between Information Attributes</head><p>Second, participants make more patient choices when they show more attribute-wise gaze transitions, i.e., gaze transitions between attributes of the same kind across different options, than option-wise gaze transitions, i.e., gaze transitions within a choice option <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Khaw et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reeck et al., 2017)</ref>. Attribute-wise gaze transitions search pattern might draw attention to the time information and therefore the costs of consumption for the respective option <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ebert &amp; Prelec, 2007)</ref>. It should be noted that <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amasino et al. (2019)</ref> could only find this effect in the main sample but not in the replication sample of their publication.</p><p>H2c: Participants who show more attribute-wise gaze patterns also prefer the delayed over the immediate choice option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>We used two tasks to test each of our major aims. For Study Aim 1 we used a fixation task to explore influential factors of eye-tracking data quality. For Study Aim 2 we used a binary choice task to test the relationship between choice behavior and eye-tracking data collected using an online eye-tracker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>264 participants were recruited via the online participant recruitment platform Prolific (www.prolific.co). An a-priori power simulation with the R package simr <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Green et al., 2016)</ref> with a mixed-effects model and estimated effect sizes based on literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Nyström et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Paulus et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stuart et al., 2016)</ref> showed that it requires a sample of N &gt; 225 to find a significant fixed effect of 2% of screen size of an influence factor on data quality with a power of at least .82 (α = .05, 95% CI = .81 to .83). This sample would contain more than twice as many participants as in previous studies on intertemporal choice paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reeck et al., 2017)</ref>. Participants were required to have a webcam and understand the English language. As a basic payment, participants received $3,00 for completing the study. As an additional bonus payment, one of the chosen options from the intertemporal choice task was randomly selected (50 cent to $5) and sent to the participant on the respective delay (e.g., $5 in 10 days). The experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the Freie Universität Berlin. Participants gave informed consent before entering the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>54% of the participants were male (45% female, 1.4% diverse). Mean age was 34.4 years (SD = 13.06 years, range = 20 years to 80 years). Most of the participants were Caucasian (65.9%; Asian: 19.4%; Hispanic: 7.8%; Black: 6.9%) and resided in the US (84%;</p><p>Poland: 4.6%, United Kingdom: 4.2%; other: 9.2%). Participants with residency in the United States did not differ from participants with international residency in terms of eye-movements data, choice behavior, and eye-tracking data quality. Almost all participants had Webcams with a frame rate of 30 Hz, only one participant had 25 Hz. Participant's screen width ranged from 1024 px to 2560 px (M = 1557.4 px, SD = 300.3 px) and screen heights range from 615 px to 1024 px (M = 898.9 px, SD = 163.8 px). Average monitor diagonal size was 1798.89 px diagonal (SD = 338.27 px, range = 1255.01 to 2939.21 px). Half of the participants (52%) wore visual aids (11% contact lenses, 41% glasses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Cleaning Procedure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixation Task</head><p>The participants who were excluded from the fixation task analysis as well as the reason for exclusion are described in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Data from around a fifth (20.5%) of the total number of 264 participants who completed the study was excluded. The most common reasons were of technical nature, such as an inconsistent time measure, where the time data as indicated by Webgazer excessively exceeded the time limit of the task (&gt;5500ms), incomplete eye-tracking data, or a low frame rate of the eye-tracking data. Interestingly, those three participants who were excluded based on extreme offset scores, were the only ones who used the Safari browser. The fact that seven participants had no variation in gaze points, i.e., all gaze points on one specific coordinate, indicates a calibration error. In total, N = 210 participants were included in the fixation task analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>Number of Excluded Participants for the Fixation Task Note. The raw dataset before data cleaning includes 264 participants. The reasons for exclusion are not mutually exclusive, i.e., a participant could be excluded for multiple reasons. Therefore, the total number of participants does not represent the sum of the number of excluded participants by reason. a had more than three trials that were longer than 5500ms b indicated that they moved their head or did not try to use the chin rest c eye-tracking data was recorded but the gaze points remained exactly at a specific position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Task</head><p>Of those 210 participants who were included in the fixation task, we additionally excluded data from 22 (10.5%) participants who only chose the LL option. Moreover, 22 (10.5%) participants showed inconsistent choice behavior that could not be fitted to a hyperbolic discounting model and could be plausibly explained by random choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, we adapted three selection criteria applied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang and Krajbich (2020)</ref>. First, reaction times must be larger than 400ms and less than 10000ms, which led to the exclusion of ten trials but no participants. Second, four (1.9%) participants were excluded because of a low frame rate of the eye-tracking data of &lt;5 Hz. Third, participants were required to have at least 6 out of 9 valid fixation dots in the fixation task. A fixation dot is defined as valid if more than 80% of all gaze dots are within a range of 15% screen size around the target stimulus. This criterion ensured that when the participant looked at the information attributes of the choice task, the far majority of the recorded gaze points would have been within the respective AOI <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>. 158 (75.2%) participants did not fulfill these criteria, which resulted in a total sample of N = 44 participants for the choice task analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>A within-subject design was used with one factor (chin rest: yes, no; <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). The participants performed two blocks in subsequent order, one block with the chin rest condition, the other block with the control condition. Both blocks contained a calibration task to setup Webgazer and a fixation task to measure data quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref>. In the chin rest block, participants also performed the choice task <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. Overall, each participant performed the calibration and the fixation task two times and the choice task one time. The order of the blocks was randomized between the participants in order to reduce position and carry-over-effects. The participants were randomly assigned to the two experimental groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Within-Subject Design Note. The effect of the chin rest instruction will be examined in a within-subject design with two conditions for each group. After receiving basic instructions in order to prepare for the Eye-Tracking tasks, participants are randomly assigned to one of the groups. Condition 1 contains tasks that are performed with the chin rest instruction. Condition 2 contains task that are performed without the chin rest instruction. After completing both conditions, participants answer demographic questions and receive a debriefing about the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>To prepare for the eye-tracking tasks, participants were instructed to only use one monitor, turn their mobile phone into airplane mode and close all CPU-intensive programs and websites. In addition, they received further instructions on how to position themselves and adjust the light based on experiences from our pilot study and previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>. In the chin rest condition, the participants were instructed to rest their head on one of their arms. In the control condition, they were instructed to not rest their head on their arm but to keep a natural and upright position. In both conditions, the participants were instructed to keep the head at the same position and only move the eyes. These instructions are detailed in Appendix A. Between each task and within one block, the participant was additionally instructed to not move and stay in the instructed position. During these instructions, the participants could see themselves in the video stream on the top left corner framed by a rectangle box. The rectangle appeared green if the face could be detected and red if the participant had to adjust the position.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, the participants answered demographic questions and provided information about the visual aids (perfect sight, glasses, contact lenses, not corrected), the kind of visual impairments (not corrected, near sighted, far sighted, and progressive), any makeup they are currently wearing (Eye-Shadow, Mascara, Eyeliner, Brow-Liner) and about the relative vertical position between them and the computer screen. As a manipulation check at the end of the study, participants were asked if they have actually tried to use the provisional chin rest and if they moved their head during the eye-tracking tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration</head><p>In the calibration, the participants clicked 13-times on one of 27 dots (50x50 px; RGB: 0, 191, 255) that appeared randomly on one of 13 possible positions on the screen (Figurea), which generated training data of 351 mouse clicks per participant as well as the mouse movements between the dots. During the task, the participants were instructed to always follow the mouse with their eyes. The total calibration time of ca. 6 minutes was still above the minimum calibration time recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang and Krajbich (2020)</ref>. In contrast to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref>, we did not exclude subjects with bad calibration or sent them back for recalibration because we aim to compare data quality across participants with the same calibration effort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixation Task</head><p>The quality of the eye-tracking data and influence factors on data quality were measured in the fixation task (Figureb) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>. In each trial, participants looked for 2000ms at a fixation cross in the center of the screen, followed by 500ms black screen, and then for 5000ms at a 50 x 50 px dot <ref type="bibr">(RGB: 0,</ref><ref type="bibr">191,</ref><ref type="bibr">255)</ref>. This procedure is repeated in a randomized order for each of the 9 possible dot positions on the screen. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Task</head><p>The intertemporal choice task (Figurec) was adapted from the replication study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amasino et al. (2019)</ref>. The participants made repeated choices between two options on the top and the bottom of the screen by pressing the up-and down arrow keys on the keyboard. The SS-option contained a small reward (50cent to $4.5 in 50 cent intervals) that is immediately available (at the same day the study was completed), the LL-option contained a larger reward ($4, $4.5, or $5) that will be delivered with a time delay (1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 90 and 180 days). For example, a participant can decide between $5 in 180 days versus $2 today. The top and bottom positions of the SS-and LL-options are randomized, and the left and right side is switched after half of the trials to account for cultural bias towards the top-left option <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. The options were presented after 1500ms blank screen and a 1500ms fixation cross. For each trial, data was collected on choice behavior, response time, and gaze points.</p><p>We made several modifications to the original procedure by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amasino et al. (2019)</ref> to account for the online setting. Instead of $10 maximum bonus payment with a maximum delay of 365 days, participants could win $5 with a maximum delay of 180 days. To increase attention to the LL-reward, we slightly varied the values between $4, $4.5, and $5 to increase visual attention. Moreover, we did not present all choice pairs but randomly selected 80 out of 141 possible choice combinations with a medium level of difficulty, where biased answers towards either the SS-or LL-option are least likely (Appendix B). We chose a lower number of trials in order to adjust to the low motivation and concentration participants indicated in our pilot study. Moreover, no time limit was set for the responses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Areas of Interest</head><p>To measure eye-movements during the choice task, we establish four AOIs for each information attribute: the amount for the SS, the amount for the LL, the time for the SS, and the amount for the SS. A gaze point is defined as within the AOI, if the gaze coordinate is within a box of 40% of the maximum screen height and width around the attribute relative to the participant's screen. The AOI size is larger than in the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref> to account for the low accuracy and precision of online eye-tracking data <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixations</head><p>A fixation is an event during the eye-tracking task where the gaze remains relatively still around an object on the screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Holmqvist et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Larsson et al., 2015)</ref>, and where the participant is assumed to uptake the visual information of that object <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rayner, 1998)</ref>. We define a fixation as a consecutive sequence of gaze points within an AOI. A new fixation starts when the gaze enters an AOI and ends when it leaves the AOI. In the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref> fixations were calculated based on an implicit algorithm provided by the eye-tracker (Tobii T60). To compare the fixations between the two studies, we recalculated the fixations based on the raw eye-tracking data that were published by the authors (www.osf.io/2p3dj/files/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye-Tracking Indices</head><p>Gaze distribution and gaze movements were described by three indices that are adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amasino et al. (2019)</ref>: The Option Index, Attribute Index, and Payne Index. All three indices are calculated based on gaze points within the AOIs. For the Option Index and Attribute Index, we defined that an AOI must contain at least 3 gaze points to be considered in the calculation. All indices range on a scale from -1 to 1. The indices are first calculated on trial level and then averaged for each subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Option Index</head><p>The Option Index measures the relative number of gaze points on the LL-versus the SS-choice option (9).

The x-and y-position of the stimulus were centered as -1 (left/top side, respectively), 0 (center), and 1 (right/bottom side). Data quality indices were calculated based on gaze data between 1000ms to 5000ms to account for gaze transitions within the first 1000ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Orquin &amp; Holmqvist, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref>. Because the monitor sizes vary across participants, offset and RMSE were standardized as percentage of the screen size <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref>, so that high value indicates a high offset and RMSE. Following the example of Semmelmann and Weigelt (2018), we report both percentage screen size and pixels whenever possible.</p><p>H1a and H1b were tested with mixed-effects general linear models to predict the data quality indices hit ratio, offset, and RMSE. Compared to a multiple regression, mixed-effects models allow the estimation of effects on trial level while controlling for homogeneity of the trials within participants and heterogeneous effects across participants. The null model contains the control variables as fixed effects and the participant as a random effect. The control variables are eventually recoded and included based on their contribution to the model fit (AIC) with the R package lmerTest <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kuznetsova et al., 2017)</ref>: the diagonal monitor size, webcam resolution, and frame rate were z-standardized; the ethnicity, browser, make-up, educational degree, and the sitting position of the participant were dummy-coded; the x-and y-positions of the target stimuli were codes as -1 (left/top), 0 (center), 1 (right/bottom); and the trial number as added without recoding. The square of the x-coordinate of the stimulus was added as a predictor since we expect a u-shaped relationship with data quality outcomes.</p><p>For the second block, chin rest (H1a) and glasses (H1b) were added. For the third block, random slopes were added for the chin rest effect. The contribution of chin rest and glasses for reducing the unexplained variance was estimated by calculating Pseudo-R² <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Snijders &amp; Bosker, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Task</head><p>In line of the replication efforts for the choice task and for manipulation checks, we fitted a participant-specific discounting parameter k based on the participants choice behavior in a hyperbolic discounting model, using maximum likelihood estimation. Because k is not normally distributed, it was log-transformed for further analysis. Pearson correlations were calculated between the discounting parameter and the eye-tracking indices.</p><p>H2a-c were tested with mixed-effects logistic regression models to predict participant's choices. The null model includes the control variables trial number and response time (z-standardized) as fixed effects and the participant as a random-effect. For the second block, the Option Index, Attribute Index, and Payne Index on the trial level were added. Due to significant correlations between the eye-tracking indices and choice outcomes on the participant level, the average eye-tracking indices on participant level were added in a third block. For fourth block, random slopes were tested for the eye-tracking indices.</p><p>To further investigate H2a, we partitioned all gaze points after stimuli onset into five time-bins for each trial and measured the proportion of gaze points within top AOIs versus bottom AOIs. We compared this proportion across the choice outcomes within each time-bin.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the last fixation of each trial and choice outcomes. All group differences were tested with a one-sided Welch's paired t-test against p &lt; 0.01. In contrast to the original study, no cluster correction methods were used on the eyetracking data because AOIs could not be identified clearly based on the raw gaze points <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Results are reported separately for the major aims of this study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics</head><p>Data Quality Outcomes</p><p>Across participants, the hit ratio distribution was left skewed around M = 60% (SD = 24.3%, range = 4.5% to 99.1%). On average, participants had 4 out of 9 valid fixation dots (SD = 2.9, range = 0 to 9). The offset distribution was right skewed around M = 15.6% (184 px, SD = 7.1% (102.6 px), range = 5.4% (63.3 px) to 44.7% (831.7 px)). The RMSE distribution was right skewed around M = 7.2% (86.2 px, SD = 2.6% (37.5 px), range = 3.3%</p><p>(31.7 px) to 27.1% (384.9 px)). Frame rate was normally distributed around M = 15.1 Hz (SD = 5.5 Hz, range = 3.9 Hz to 32.5 Hz).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation Checks</head><p>The t-tests did not show any difference between the randomized groups for hit ratio (t(208) = -0.27, p = 1.000) and offset (t(208) = 0.57, p = 1.000). However, the RMSE was less for the group where the chin rest was introduced first (M = 6.7%, SD = 3.3% vs. M = 7.6%, SD = 4.8%; t(208) = 2.43, p = .048, Cohen's d = 0.36). Additionally, by plotting the distribution of gaze points along the trials and across the screen, we could show that participants' gaze transition from the fixation cross at the center of the screen to the target stimulus and that most gaze points are distributed around the fixation stimuli (Appendix C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations Among Data Quality Outcomes and Predictors</head><p>Correlations among the continuous data quality outcomes and predictors are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. Offset and RMSE strongly correlate (p &lt; .001), such that those participants with less offset also have less RMSE. Moreover, offset is almost deterministically correlated with the hit ratio. Glasses show a negative correlation with hit ratio (p = .01), and positive correlations with offset (p = .028), and age (p = .03). Furthermore, frame rate is correlated with monitor size (p &lt; .001), such that those participants with larger monitors had a higher frame rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Findings</head><p>H1a and H1b were tested with linear mixed-effects models. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) showed that a more than a third of the variance in data quality outcomes on trial level can be attributed to the variance across participants (hit ratio: ICC = 37.3%, 95% CI = 32.6% to 42.7%; offset: ICC = 40.6%, 95% CI = 35.7% to 46%; RMSE: ICC = 35%, 95% CI = 30.3% to 40.2%). Moreover, for all three data quality outcomes, the SDs of the random intercepts on participant level, which estimates the variance of the data quality scores across participants, are more than two times larger than the fixed effects on the trial level. This suggest that data quality varies more among than within participants and that mixed-effects modeling is required for analyzing influence factors on data quality on trial level while considering the nested structure within participants. In the following, we discuss the effects for chin rest and glasses.  <ref type="figure">-c)</ref>. Compared to the trials in the control condition, participants in the chin rest condition had more than 1% higher offset (M = 16.3%, SD = 11.9% vs. M = 15%, SD = 9.5%). There was no significant effect for hit ratio and RMSE. Estimations of Pseudo R² showed a small contribution of the chin rest effect to the mixed-effects model: Compared to a model that only contains the control variables, the chin rest effect reduces the unexplained variance on trial level for offset by 0.75%.</p><p>For all three outcome models, random slopes for chin rest were added, which estimates the variance of the fixed chin rest effect across participants. Random slopes significantly improved the model fit compared to other models without random slopes (Appendix D), as can be seen on lower AIC and BIC scores, higher Log-Likelihoods, and</p><p>Chi²-tests for models comparisons for all three outcomes <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. For all data quality outcomes, the SD of the random slope for chin rest is more than twice as large as the estimated fixed effect of chin rest <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3Table</ref> 3a-c). This suggests that, while on average, there is evidence for a negative effect of chin rest on data quality, the direction of the effect varies greatly among participants.</p><p>We found negative correlations between the random intercept for the participant and the random slope for chin rest for the outcomes hit ratio (r(208) = -.31 and offset (r(208) = -.15), which means that the larger the hit ratio and offset, the lower the magnitude of the effect of the chin-rest. There was no correlation between the random elements of the model for RMSE (r(208) = -.05).  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> Model Comparison for the Mixed-Effects Model on Data Quality Outcomes Note. Block zero only contains an intercept only model on the respective criterion with a random effect for participants. Block 1 adds the control variables. Block 2 adds the experimental predictors chin rest and glasses. Block 3 adds the random effects for chin rest. A fixed effects one-way ANOVA analysis did not show any effect of the specific types of visual aids (contact lenses, glasses, none because of perfect sight, and none but uncorrected) (hit ratio: F(3, 206) = 3.34, p = .020; offset: F(3, 206) = 2.43, p = .066; RMSE:</p><p>F(3, 206) = 1.12, p = .343) or the type of correction (long sight, short sight, progressive, no correction) on data quality outcomes (hit ratio: F(3, 206) = 1.21, p = .307; offset: F(3, 306) = 1.13, p = .338; RMSE: F(3, 206) = 0.67, p = .569).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Factors</head><p>The mixed-effects models showed additional effects for the trial number, the frame rate and the stimuli position (Table 2a-c). There were significant effects of trial number on data quality, such that with each trial, the hit ratio decreases by around 1%, the offset and RMSE increase by around 0.2% to 0.1% of screen size respectively. This is a large effect, considering that the tasks involve up to 89 trials before recalibration. Moreover, we found that frame rate positively predicts offset, such that those trials with a higher frame rate of 1 SD have 0.9% less offset. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of the x-and y-position of the stimulus on data quality, such that the right side and the lower side of the screen has a better data quality. Compared to the center of the screen, the right side had 1.9% more hit ratio and 0.5% less offset, and the lower side had 0.4% less offset and 0.6% less RMSE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Analysis</head><p>In addition to the main findings, we were interested in the reliability of online eyetracking, i.e., to what extent the data quality outcomes vary across participants and environment. Therefore, one of the authors conducted the study five subsequent times under lab conditions with artificial room light. Results show that while the frame rate remained steady around M = 13.07 Hz (SD = 0.12 Hz), there were large variations in regards to hit ratio (M = 75.6%, SD = 18.3%), offset (M = 9.5% (90 px), SD = 1.7% (15.2 px)), and RMSE (M = 6.3% (60 px), SD = 0.4% (5.1 px)).</p></div>

The Option Index is also strongly correlated with the location of the choice options (p = .001) such that participants looked more often on a choice option when it was presented on top. Moreover, intertemporal discounting is negatively correlated with the Attribute Index (p = .001) and is positively correlated with Payne Index (p &lt; .001). Therefore, more patient participants look more on amount attributes and show more attribute-wise gaze transitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Findings</head><p>H2a-c were tested with mixed-effects models on the choice outcomes with the eyetracking indices as predictors ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6)</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 7)</ref>. The other models (Blocks 1, 2, and 4) that were compared against this model are described in Appendix F. The results for the specific hypotheses are detailed below. The Option Index measures relative gaze distribution for the larger-later option (index&gt;0) vs. the shorter-sooner-option (index&lt;0). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The Attribute Index measures relative gaze distribution for amounts (index&gt;0) versus times (index&lt;0).</p><p>5 The Payne Index measures gaze transitions between options (index&gt;0) versus between attributes (index&lt;0).   <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> Model Comparisons for the Mixed-Effects Models on Choice Models Note. Block zero only contains an intercept only model on choice outcomes with a random effect for participants. Block 1 adds the control variables. Block 2 adds the trial-specific eyetracking as experimental predictors. In Block 4, the eye-tracking indices are added as level 2 effects. In Block 4, adds random slopes for the eye-tracking indices on trial level. The parameter estimates for Block 1, 2 and 4 can be found in Appendix F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2a: Prediction of Choice Outcomes by Gaze Distribution</head><p>H2a states that choice behavior can be predicted by the gaze point distribution. Against H2a, the mixed-effects logistic regression did not show a significant effect for the Option Index <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 6)</ref>. Therefore, we could not find evidence that relative gaze on the LL-choice option predicts choice. However, in support of H2a, the analysis of time-bins and the last fixation show that the gaze distribution at the end of a trial predicts choice <ref type="figure">(Figure )</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref> shows the proportion of gaze points on top versus bottom AOIs for trials with top choice versus trials with bottom choice across five time-bins. In contrast to the original study, where participants already started to direct their gaze towards the chosen option in the second time-bin, we did not find significant differences in gaze point location in the first four time-bins (Welch's paired t-tests: -1.10 ≤ t(43) ≤ 1.59, .12 ≤ p ≤ 0.69). However, for the last time-bin, participants' choice could be predicted by gaze data (Welch's paired t-test: t(41) = 8.12, p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.74). Like the original study, the first timebin shows a strong bias towards the top option.  <ref type="figure">Figure b</ref> compares the last fixations on top versus bottom AOIs between the two choice outcomes. In approximately 60-65% of all trials, participants chose the last fixated option. Although this effect is slightly smaller compared to the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>, we also found a significantly higher proportion of top choices for the trials where the last fixation was on the top option (Welch's paired t-test: t(41) = 9.83, p &lt; .001; Cohen's d = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.31).</p><p>Hypothesis 2b: Choice Outcomes Relate to More Gaze Points on Amount</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information</head><p>Against H2b, which states that more relative gaze on amount versus time attributes relate to more patient choices, the mixed-effects models did not show a significant effect of Attribute Index on choice behavior, neither on trial-nor on participant level <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 6)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we did not find evidence that participants who more often chose the LL-than the SS-option also looked more at the amount attributes of the choice task.</p></div>

Therefore, we did not find evidence that participants who more often chose the LL-than the SS-option show more gaze transitions between the same kind of attributes across options than gaze transitions between different kinds of attributes within the same choice option. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this online study, we explored the potential and the limitations of online eyetracking tools, using the JavaScript based open-source library Webgazer <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Papoutsaki et al., 2016)</ref>. Our first Study Aim was to explore influence factors on the data quality. Therefore, we replicated a fixation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref> to examine the influence of a provisional chin rest and glasses on three data quality outcomes. In contrast to H1a, we found a negative effect of the chin rest intervention on the spatial resolution. In support of H1b, we found a lower spatial resolution for participants with glasses. Our evidence suggests that while using contact lenses instead of glasses seems like an effective intervention for improving the eye-tracking data, implementing a chin rest intervention could have a detrimental effect on the data quality.</p><p>Our second Study Aim was to explore whether decision-making findings from highperformance eye-trackers in a controlled lab environment can be reproduced online with an online eye-tracking tool. Therefore, we replicated a multi-attribute choice task <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. While participants showed the expected choice behavior, the eye-tracking data differed in several ways from the lab data. Out of 264 participants, who completed the study, only N = 44 (16.6%) had sufficient data quality to be included in the choice task analysis.</p><p>H2a finds mixed evidence: Although the overall gaze distribution did not predict choice, the time-bin analysis and the last fixations suggest that eye-tracking data could predict choice at the moment right before the participant reveals the decision. H2b and H2c must be rejected because choice could not be predicted by gaze distributions towards amount information (H2b) or gaze transitions between the same kind of attributes across options (H2c).</p><p>In the following, we will discuss the findings for the two study aims in more detail, as well as practical implications for future online eye-tracking studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Aim 1: Influence Factors on the Data Quality of Online Eye-Tracking</head><p>The goal of our fixation task was to identify influence factors on data quality in a large sample size. Moreover, results from this task give insight into the data quality that could be generally expected when doing online eye-tracking studies and what requirements participants must meet in order to provide meaningful data. For discussing the influence factors on eyetracking data quality, we specifically focused on a provisional chin rest and glasses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chin Rest</head><p>Against H1a, we found that participants had lower accuracy and hit ratio when using the chin rest. We conclude that, while it still seems plausible that head movements do have a negative effect on data quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hessels et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Niehorster et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wass et al., 2014)</ref>, the chin rest intervention failed to control them. The large variance of the chin rest effect among participants, which is more than twice as large as the estimated fixed effect, implies that the direction of the chin rest effect differs among participants. For some participants, the chin rest had a positive effect on data quality; for others, the chin rest had a negative effect on data quality. At lower levels of hit ratio or accuracy, the magnitude of the chin-rest effect (positive and negative) was larger. Behavioral factors, such as the participant's concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Niehorster et al., 2018)</ref>, could explain this variance. However, no moderating factor for the chin rest effect on trial-and participant levels was found in this study.</p><p>We propose two possible reasons for these findings: First, by following the instructions, several participants could have taken an unnatural and uncomfortable pose (e.g., by leaning forward to get the elbow on the table), which also explains why ten participants did not comply with the chin rest instruction at all. Second, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Robal et al. (2018)</ref> the hand on which the head rested could have obscured the face and interfered with the face detection. The face tracker used in this study <ref type="bibr">(Facemesh;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lugaresi et al., 2019)</ref> should greatly reduce the distorting effects of hands on the face. It might be possible that other types of chin rests, such as a plastic bar, contribute to fixating the participant's head without obscuring the face. Such chin rests would also be more robust against changing positions, for example when the participant relaxes the body position throughout the study.</p><p>Due to the large unexplained variability of the effect of the chin rest on data quality and the absence of a professional chin rest apparatus in the online setting, interventions other than controlling head movements seem more practical for improving the data quality of online eye-tracking. Future research should follow previous studies who instructed participants to keep the head still in a natural position <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hsu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Robal et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zhao et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glasses</head><p>In support of H1b, we found evidence for a negative effect of glasses on hit ratio and accuracy. Our findings are in line with previous research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Paulus et al. (2017)</ref>. In contrast to Nyström et al. (2013), we did not find any effect on precision. These findings suggest that glasses increase the bias in the estimation of gaze points based on eye-tracking data but do not increase the unsystematic variation in gaze points. Another reason for the absence of an effect on precision could be the generally low variance of the precision measure in this study, which is further discussed in the limitations section.</p><p>It is yet unclear whether reflections from the glasses distort the eye-image <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Holmqvist et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nyström et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stuart et al., 2016)</ref> or whether the frames of the glasses obscure the eye. Because we did not find an effect of glasses on precision, there is no evidence for any unsystematic distortions of the eye-image. Consequently, it seems like an efficient way to improve the data quality is by asking participants to wear contact lenses instead of glasses. By doing that, the demographic diversity of the sample should be considered because the exclusion of non-contact wearers might also exclude certain demographic groups, e.g. participants of older age, who are less likely to wear contact lenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cope et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Aim 2: Relationship Between Eye-Movements and Choice Behavior Online</head><p>By replicating an intertemporal choice task, we attempted to reproduce findings regarding the relationship between participants' gaze patterns and choice behavior. The task design belongs to an established paradigm in decision-making research and was internally replicated in the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, the multi-attribute choice task tests the potential of online eye-tracking in a more complex setting than the simple task designs of previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>We found partial evidence for H2a. We could not reproduce findings regarding the relation between choice and the distribution of the number of fixations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Franco-Watkins et al., 2016</ref>) the number of gaze points in in-lab studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>, and dwell time in an online study <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>. However, choice could be predicted by the last fixation and the distribution of gaze points right before the participant reveals the decision, which was also found in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Franco-Watkins et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Against H2b and H2c, we could not confirm the associations between choice outcomes and the gaze on amount information as well as attribute-wise gaze transitions that were found with in-lab eye-trackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Khaw et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reeck et al., 2017)</ref>, using online eye-tracking. While there was no significant fixed effect of any eyetracking variable, the model with the best fit included the eye-tracking indices on trial level and participant level alike. Future research should examine the difference between trial-wise variations in gaze distribution and participant-specific gaze patterns regarding their relationship with choice outcomes.</p><p>Our manipulation checks gave reason for us to rule out other explanations for the findings. Most of the participants followed our instructions and directed their true gaze towards the information attributes of the choice options. It is possible that online participants pay less attention to studies, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arechar &amp; Rand, 2020</ref>). However, a lack of visual attention would relate to inconsistent choices that would be detected in our data cleaning procedure. The distribution of the discounting parameter was comparable to the original study and predictive for the choice outcomes, response time, and the number of fixations on the choice options <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. This is in line with previous findings that intertemporal choice behavior could be described by a hyperbolic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainslie, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grune-Yanoff, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mazur, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Odum, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Samuelson, 1937)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, choosing the relevant options was incentivized with a real monetary reward of up to $5.</p><p>The similarity of choice preferences between online and in-lab participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goodman et al., 2013)</ref> and successful implementations of online eye-tracking in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref> suggest that associations between eye-movement and choice behavior do exist in the online setting, such as the utility effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Orquin &amp; Holmqvist, 2018)</ref>, the effect of attribute-wise search strategies on patience choice, and the effect of visual attention to amount information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reeck et al., 2017)</ref>. However, those associations are overlayed by a high level of noise in the eye-tracking data, which makes it is more difficult to dynamically track the choice process online compared to lab conditions. In other words, current online eye-tracking tools might not be accurate enough to measure more complex effects, such as associations between choice and gaze transitions between specific kinds of information attributes, but they suffice to measure strong effects, such as associations between choice and the gaze distribution right before the participant enters the decision into the computer.</p><p>The negative effect of trial-number on data quality suggests that the spatial resolution of the eye-tracking data in the choice task is worse than when it was originally measured in the fixation task. A linear extrapolation of this effect across 80 trials would mean that the accuracy and precision could decrease by 16% of screen size. Possible reasons are shifting head poses or an insufficient calibration at the beginning. This contradicts the finding of Yang and Krajbich (2020) who found a stable spatial resolution over time.</p><p>Practical Implications -(how) can Online Eye-Tracking be used for Decision-Making</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research?</head><p>Our findings revealed several restrictions to the feasibility of decision-making research with online eye-tracking. The data quality outcomes obtained in our study, which are comparable to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref> and other online eye-tracking tools (e.g., iTracker; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Krafka et al., 2016)</ref>, show that task stimuli and AOIs should be larger than 15% of the screen size to accurately measure gaze. In addition, future research must consider factors such as (re-)calibration, participant selection, and participant compliance, without which associations between eye-movements and decision making behavior cannot be efficiently examined in the online context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration and Participant Selection</head><p>As in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>, more than two-thirds of the participants who completed the study had to be excluded from further analysis, mostly, because of a low hit ratio. To meet the required data quality scores, online eye-tracking studies should measure the data quality and eventually recalibrate throughout the task. As a criterion for recalibration, the hit ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020</ref>) seems more suitable than average accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref> or precision because it is more robust against outliers. In this study, no recalibration was used because our study aims required us to compare data quality among participants with the same amount of calibration.</p><p>When selecting participants based on technical equipment or demographics, researchers must consider the eventual trade-off between demographic inclusivity and data quality and be sensitive about any possible discrimination against demographic groups. The low data quality of certain groups of participants, such as older participants who wear glasses (see this study), or non-Caucasian ethnicities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blignaut &amp; Wium, 2014)</ref> should be compensated with a more intense calibration instead of exclusion from the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Eye-Tracking data was Smoothened by Default Settings of the Eye-Tracker</head><p>The eye-tracking algorithm in our study differed from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Papoutsaki et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref> by using a Kalman Filter, which smoothens the data on-the-fly and reduces the unsystematic variation and the influence of outliers (e.g., blinks). The artificial gaze points, which were introduced by the filter, impeded the analysis of natural gaze saccades. This was one of the reasons, which prevented the use of a cluster correction algorithm on the choice task data, which could have helped associating clusters of gaze points with AOIs and separating them from gaze saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, contrary to the original purpose of measuring the unsystematic variation of the raw gaze points, the RMSE outcome is likely artificially diminished by the filter. This might explain why several predictors, which were found to influence other data quality scores, did not show any effect on precision and why no evidence was found for any relationships between gaze transitions and choice. This illustrates the influence of default settings of eye-trackers on the study results <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Orquin &amp; Holmqvist, 2018)</ref>. Future research should explore post-hoc data analysis methods for improving the quality and interpretability of raw eye-tracking data. Examples are the correction of systematic offsets with the help of clustering algorithms (e.g., agglomerative clustering) to detect AOIs or the use of machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural network classifiers) to detect fixations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Large Areas of Interest and Vertical Alignment of the Choice Options</head><p>The vertical alignment of the choice options could have increased the noise of some of the eye-tracking measures. On typical 16:9 monitors, vertically aligned AOIs are spatially closer together than horizontally aligned AOIs. Because the size of each AOI was set to 40% of the screen size, there was only 10% of the screen size between the AOIs (e.g., 90 px on the average monitor height in our sample). As a result, the more inaccurate the eye-tracker the higher the chance that true gaze points on the bottom AOIs are wrongly assigned to top AOIs and vice versa. This could have distorted the effects of eye-tracking measures that relied on an accurate separation of top and bottom gaze points, such as the Option Index. Future research should replicate the choice task with a horizontal alignment. It might also be useful to instruct participants to, instead of laptops, use a desktop computer with an external monitor, which is generally larger and, moreover, more likely to be on eye level with the participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Compliance and Technical Feasibility</head><p>Overall, we found that online participants are generally disciplined enough and technically equipped to contribute to online eye-tracking studies of less than 30 minutes. Most participants who completed the study looked at the fixation stimuli and only 12 participants indicated that they did not follow the instructions. Note that our participants had the option to take a break before the recalibration in the second task, which might have promoted their motivation in the long run. Moreover, only a minority of participants dropped out during the eye-tracking initialization. Those participants could have experienced long waiting times for the initialization due to a low computer performance or technical problems (e.g., a missing Webcam). Therefore, long waiting times and the required hardware should be clearly communicated to the participants beforehand. Moreover, it should be noted that because of the low frame rate of around 15 Hz, online eye-tracking is not suitable for tasks that involve fast gaze movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Two years after the first application of the eye-tracking tool Webgazer for cognitive research <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref>, eye-tracking is still mainly reserved for in-lab research. With the rise of a global pandemic, online eye-tracking tools appealed to many researchers as the last resort for continuing their research. Online eye-tracking can enable researchers of various fields to combine the benefits of eye-tracking and online studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Papoutsaki et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref>. Decisionmaking research that is conducted on large online sample with eye-tracking tools will probably achieve greater inter-individual differences in choice preferences, decision strategies, and demographics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>, which helps deriving interventions for supporting people at making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hertwig &amp; Grüne-Yanoff, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We experimentally examined influence factors on the data quality of online eyetracking studies, which will hopefully give practical guidelines for the experimental design of future studies. While asking participants to wear contact lenses instead of glasses seems like an effective intervention for improving the eye-tracking data, attempting to control head movements with a provisional chin rest could have detrimental effects on data quality. Future research should explore other participant related factors, such as webcam resolution and light <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feit et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Paulus et al., 2017)</ref> and post-hoc data analysis methods for improving the quality. Moreover, we found partial evidence for the feasibility of measuring eye-movements during choice behavior in the online context by replicating a decision-making paradigm that was previously conducted in a lab environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>. Although we found some simple relations between choice behavior and eye-tracking measures, such as the last fixation, more complex eye-tracking effects could not be reproduced. Intermediate recalibration throughout the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang &amp; Krajbich, 2020)</ref> as well as gamification of the calibration tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Xu et al., 2015)</ref> seem promising avenues for maintaining a sufficient data quality while maintaining the participant's motivation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of Trials for the Choice Task</head><p>We made some modifications to the choice task, in order to reduce the participant's biases towards either the LL-or the SS-choice options.

(2019)</ref> found that for some choice-pairs, participants always chose the LL-option, (e.g., 50 cent today vs. $10 tomorrow). Based on the hyperbolic discounting function (equation 1 in the main text), we determined an item-specific discounting parameter k for each amount and delay combination. k is the discounting parameter, where the SS-amount aSS equals the discounted value of the LL-amount aLL that is delayed by time delay tLL (B1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">= * (B1)</formula><p>Solving this equation (B1) for k, we obtain (B2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= (B2)</formula><p>In the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amasino et al., 2019)</ref>, for most of the items with k &gt; 0.33, more than 95% of all participants chose the LL-option. Therefore, we selected 114 choice-pairs, where k ≤ 0.33. With these modifications, we achieved similar frequency distributions of SS and LL amounts, reward-ratio, and time delays of our study compared to the original study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation Check for the Fixation Task</head><p>To check whether participants follow our instructions and look at the stimuli in the fixation task, we analyzed the gaze saccade from the fixation cross towards the stimulus and the distribution of gaze points around the stimuli positions.</p><p>First, we plotted the gaze point offsets over time from the fixation cross (t = -1500 ms), to the stimulus onset (t = 0 ms) and the stimulus offset (t = 5000 ms) ( <ref type="figure">Figure A1Figure</ref> ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Semmelmann &amp; Weigelt, 2018)</ref>. The colored lines represent the median offset in 100ms time-bins for the respective stimulus position. Offset was largest for positions at the corner of the screen, followed by positions at the y-or x-center. The purple line does not deviate because the stimulus is at the same center position as the fixation cross. For all positions, except the center location, a saccade can be clearly identified from 0 to about 1000ms.

Mixed-effects models facilitate analyzing the effects of eye-tracking related variables on choice on trial level while considering the nested structure within participants. Approximately 40% (ICC = 0.40, calculated based on Wu et al., 2012) of the variance in choice outcomes on trial level can be attributed to the variance across participants. Similar to the main analysis for Study Aim 1, logistic mixed-effects models are required for modeling choice outcomes on trial level while considering the homogeneity of choices within participants. Model comparisons with AIC, BIC and Log-Likelihood scores and Chi²-tests showed the best model fit for the model with fixed effects for eye-tracking indices on trial as well as participant level but no random slopes for the eye-tracking indices (</figDesc></figure>
