			<abstract>
				<p>In decision making under risk, adults tend to overestimate small and underestimate large probabilities (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992). This inverse S-shaped distortion pattern is similar to that observed in a wide variety of proportion judgment tasks (see Hollands &amp; Dyre, 2000, for review). In proportion judgment tasks, distortion patterns tend not to be fixed but rather to depend on the reference points to which the targets are compared. Here, we tested the novel hypothesis that probability distortion in decision making under risk might also be influenced by reference points-in this case, references implied by the probability range. Adult participants were assigned to either a full-range (probabilities from 0-100%), upper-range (50-100%), or lower-range (0-50%) condition, where they indicated certainty equivalents for 176 hypothetical monetary gambles (e.g., &quot;a 50% chance of $100, otherwise $0&quot;). Using a modified cumulative prospect theory model, we found only minimal differences in probability distortion as a function of condition, suggesting no differences in use of reference points by condition, and broadly demonstrating the robustness of distortion pattern across contexts. However, we also observed deviations from the curve across all conditions that warrant further research.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Cumulative prospect theory framework</head><p>Imagine a gamble involving a 50% chance of winning $100, otherwise $0. One's certainty equivalent (CE) for such a gamble is defined as the monetary outcome identified by the individual as being as attractive as playing the gamble, thus reflecting the overall value of the gamble to the individual. According to cumulative prospect theory (CPT), a dominant descriptive theory of decision-making under risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Glöckner &amp; Pachur, 2012</ref>, for comparison to other models), CEs for simple gambles with two possible nonnegative outcomes represented as (x 1 , p; x 2 , 1 -p), with probabilities expressed as decimal values from 0 to 1 can be modeled as: <ref type="bibr">1</ref> (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v(CE) = v(x 1 )w(p) + v(x 2 )(1 -w(p))</formula><p>where x 1 &gt; x 2 ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1.</p><p>One component of CPT reflected in the equation is that outcomes (including the certainty equivalent) and probabilities are transformed into subjective values and decision weights respectively before they are combined. A second component of CPT is that the subjective value of the CE is essentially the sum of the subjective value of each gamble outcome multiplied by its corresponding decision weight. The transformation of outcomes into subjective values is assumed to follow a concave curve for gains (reflecting diminishing sensitivity as outcome magnitude increases) and a convex curve for losses, with the curve being steeper for losses than for gains (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1a</ref> for the curve associated with gains). The transformation of probabilities into decision weights is assumed to follow an inverse S-shaped curve, reflecting an overweighting of small probabilities (e.g., behaving as if a 10% chance is more likely than it actually is) and an underweighting of medium to large ones (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1b</ref>). These general forms of distortion curves have been used to explain a complex pattern of behavior: risk aversion for high probability gains and risk seeking for high probability losses, but the reverse for low probability gains and losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to specific value and probability weighting functions, the CPT value function (we focus on the function for gains; an additional parameter is needed to accommodate losses) is typically specified as <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992</ref>; see <ref type="bibr">Fox &amp; Poldrack, 2014, for review)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v(x) = x α ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where α &gt; 0.</p><p>The value parameter α captures degree of curvature from the identity line: α = 1 is the identity relationship, α &lt; 1 is a concave curve (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1a</ref>), and α &gt; 1 is a convex curve. For probability weighting, several different specifications of the inverse S-shaped curve have been proposed (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fox &amp; Poldrack, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Stott, 2006)</ref>, including the one-parameter function originally proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tversky and Kahneman (1992)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w(p) = (p γ / (p γ + (1 -p) γ )) 1/γ ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where γ &gt; 0.</p><p>With the one-parameter function, the single parameter γ determines both degree of curvature and where the curve crosses the identity line (i.e., curvature and crossover are not independent). An alternative function with two parameters is one of the most commonly used (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fox &amp; Poldrack, 2014</ref>) because its parameters have a more natural interpretation. It has been shown to generally provide a better fit to individual-level data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cavagnaro, Pitt, Gonzalez, &amp; Myung, 2013)</ref>. This Probability range and distortion 5 alternative is <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lattimore, Baker, and Witte's (1992;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Goldstein &amp; Einhorn, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gonzalez &amp; Wu, 1999)</ref> function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">w(p) = δp γ / (δp γ + (1 -p) γ ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where δ &gt; 0 and γ &gt; 0.</p><p>The parameter γ captures degree of curvature from the identity line: γ = 1 is the identity relationship, γ &lt; 1 is an inverse S-shaped curve (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1c</ref>), and γ &gt; 1 is an S-shaped curve. The parameter δ captures elevation of the entire curve, which largely determines where it crosses the identity line: δ = 1 crosses at a probability of .5, while δ &gt; 1 crosses above .5 and δ &lt; 1 crosses below .5 (examples shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1d</ref>). While CPT as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tversky and Kahneman (1992)</ref> includes among its key elements that the value curve is concave for gains and that the probability weighting curve is inverse S-shaped, the parameters of the CPT equation are not formally constrained to being below 1, and individual-level estimates are often above 1 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Patalano et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gonzalez &amp; Wu, 1999)</ref>. As with past decision making work, we generally focus on the inverse S-shaped pattern here, but all equations discussed can produce S-shaped curves as well, and thus can be used to describe this less common pattern too.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE</head><p>A number of psychological explanations for the inverse-S shape of the probability weighting curve have been proposed. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tversky and Kahneman (1992)</ref> proposed the notion of diminishing sensitivity to probabilities as a function of their distance from reference points of impossibility and certainty (namely 0 and 100%). According to venture theory, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hogarth and Einhorn (1990)</ref>, one anchors on a stated probability and then adjusts by mentally simulating other possible values. The adjustment is generally expected to be in the direction in which there are more possible values, thereby giving rise to over-and Probability range and distortion 6 underestimation patterns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Klein et al., 2018)</ref> developed an affect-based account of probability weighting by which hope drives overestimation of low probabilities and fear drives underestimation of large probabilities. Though Tversky and</p><p>Kahneman's account is inspired by psychophysics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1984)</ref>, all of the explanations described thus far generally assume that the pattern of bias arises from inputs and mental processes specific to decision making, rather than from broader characteristics of cognition. These explanations also generally assume that the mapping of probability magnitudes to decision weights is fixed (e.g., not dependent on context) and that probability weighting can be accommodated by a single psychological explanation. To our knowledge, only <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gonzalez and Wu (1999)</ref> proposed distinct psychological sources of probability weighting curvature and elevation, namely, that curvature is associated with discrimination of probabilities (greater curvature indicates less discrimination), while elevation is associated with the overall attractiveness of gambling to the individual (greater elevation indicates greater attractiveness).</p><p>Finally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stewart, Chater, and Brown's (2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Stewart, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stewart, Reimers, &amp; Harris, 2015</ref>) decision by sampling theory-an approach that does not assume a fixed mapping-the probability weighting curve is thought to emerge dynamically in some contexts as a result of evaluating probabilities by ranking them relative to other probabilities sampled from the decision environment (but see <ref type="bibr">Alempaki, et al., in press</ref>, for alternative account).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Proportion judgment approach</head><p>Though not frequently discussed in the decision literature, similar distortion patterns have been found in a wide variety of cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks varying in task demands and types of stimuli (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hollands &amp; Dyre, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhang &amp; Maloney, 2012)</ref>. What these tasks have in common is that they can be conceptualized as involving proportion judgment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability range and distortion 7</head><p>For example, in a task involving judging the proportion of black dots in a visual display of black and white dots, individuals tend to overestimate small proportions of black dots (e.g., saying .30 or 30% when the correct response is .20 or 20%) and to underestimate large ones, showing a symmetrical (that is, with a crossover of the identity line at .50) inverse S-shaped pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Varey, Mellers, &amp; Birnbaum, 1990)</ref>. Similarly, in a number line task involving the placement of numbers on a line labeled only at its endpoints (e.g., with 0 and 100), participants tend to overestimate the position of small numbers and underestimate the position of large ones, again</p><p>showing the symmetrical inverse S-shaped pattern (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cohen &amp; Blanc-Goldhammer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Slusser &amp; Barth, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sullivan, Juhasz, Slattery, &amp; Barth, 2011)</ref>. Although less frequently, asymmetrical patterns of bias (e.g., an inverse S-shaped curve with a crossover at .30) have also been observed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Spence, 1990</ref>). These findings have raised the possibility of common psychological explanations across domains in which the task can be conceptualized as one of proportion judgment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hollands and Dyre (2000)</ref> developed a model in the psychophysical tradition, called the cyclical power model (CPM), that accounts for estimation biases resulting from a wide variety of perceptually based tasks. It has recently been extended to abstract symbolic representations of quantities such as the number line task <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barth &amp; Paladino, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cohen &amp; Blanc-Goldhammer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sullivan et al., 2011)</ref>. In the CPM, bias in proportion estimation is thought to originate from bias in the estimation of each part's magnitude, in that "psychological magnitude" is not the same as true physical magnitude. The CPM builds on Stevens' Law <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Stevens, 1957)</ref> which describes the relationship between the estimated or perceived magnitude of a stimulus and its actual magnitude. Steven's Law is a power function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = δx γ ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where x &gt; 0, δ &gt; 0, and γ &gt; 0,</p><p>where γ quantifies bias associated with judgments of a particular stimulus continuum (e.g. brightness or area) and δ is a scaling parameter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Spence (1990)</ref> extended Steven's power law (Eq. 5) to proportion judgments, demonstrating that one's judgment of the proportion (P) of a part to a whole (e.g., the relative area of one square to the whole of two squares) can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P(x) = x γ / (x γ + (1 -x) γ )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">0 ≤ x ≤ 1,</formula><p>where 1 reflects the whole, x reflects the true proportion of the stimulus to the whole, and γ refers to the same value used in <ref type="bibr">Stevens' Law (Eq. 5</ref>). Spence's power model produces a symmetrical inverse S-shaped curve when γ &lt; 1 and an S-shaped curve when γ &gt; 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hollands and Dyre's (2000)</ref> CPM is a modified and expanded version of Spence's power model (Eq. 6) in which stimuli can be expressed in any unit of magnitude (e.g., 20 out of a whole of 80, or 4 out of a whole of 16, rather than only as the proportion .25 out of a whole of 1), and in which reference points (which can vary by individual and context) can be used to constrain the range over which estimates of magnitude are made. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hollands and Dyre (2000)</ref> proposed that when judging a proportion, an individual might use two bounding reference points, resulting in the symmetrical one-cycle pattern of bias (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 2</ref>). Such a pattern might arise, for example, in a number line task if one judged the location of '20' on a line bounded by the labels 0 to 100, using only these two bounding reference points. Hollands and Dyre further proposed that additional intermediate reference points might also be used, leading to multi-cycle bias patterns, such as the symmetrical two-cycle pattern in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 2</ref> (which assumes one additional middle reference point). Such a pattern would arise in the number line task if one used the middle of the Probability range and distortion 9 line as an additional reference point. In this case, '20' would be estimated with reference to the range between 0 and 50, while a number such as '65' would be estimated with reference to the range between 50 and 100. Two-cycle bias patterns have been observed in diverse perceptual judgments (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hollands &amp; Dyre, 2000)</ref> and also in children's number-line estimates, with developmental change arising in part from the increasing use of additional reference points with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barth &amp; Paladino, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cohen &amp; Sarnecka, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Link, Huber, Nuerk, &amp; Moeller, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rouder &amp; Geary, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Slusser, Santiago, &amp; Barth, 2013, for details)</ref>. The CPM can explain a wide range of symmetrical (and some asymmetrical) multi-cycle patterns through the mechanism of reference points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE</head><p>Hollands and Dyre developed a general equation that can accommodate any defined number of reference points (though we focus on one-cycle and two-cycle patterns here, with two and three reference points respectively). They also developed a mixed model to accommodate situations in which one set of reference points is used for one subset of responses and a different set of reference points is used for another subset of responses (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 2</ref> which illustrates a combination of a one-cycle and a two-cycle pattern). According to the CPM, when observers respond using two or more reference points in their judgments of the relationship of a part to a whole, proportion estimates are predicted by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P(x) = ((x -R i-1 ) γ / ((x -R i-1 ) γ + (R i -x) γ )) (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) + R i-1 /R n<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R i-1 ≤ x ≤ R i ,</formula><p>where x is the stimulus magnitude, R is a vector of reference values from R 0 to R n (where R 0 and R n are the boundary values for the entire range), R i-1 is the lowerbound and R i is the upperbound of the immediate range containing x, and P(x) is the estimated proportion that x represents of the Probability range and distortion 10 whole. If there are only two reference points (a one-cycle pattern), the first part of the expression (until the multiplication sign) returns a proportion between 0 and 1, and the rest of the equation reduces to identity operations. However, if there are three equally-spaced reference values (a two-cycle pattern), the first part of the equation returns a proportion between 0 and 1 (e.g., .8), the expression (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) (which always equals .5 in the case of three equallyspaced reference points) scales the proportion to the reference range (e.g., .5 * .8 = .4), and the expression R i-1 /R n adds the proportion to the lower boundary of the reference range (which is either 0 or .5 in the case of three equally-spaced reference points). Further, a mixed model that incorporates the use of two reference points for some judgments and three for others can be written simply as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P(x) = ω(one-cycle equation) + (1-ω)(two-cycle equation),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">0 ≤ ω ≤ 1,</formula><p>where the first equation assumes two reference points and the second assumes three. The ω is an estimated parameter that reflects the weight assigned to each pattern in the best-fitting model (where ω = 1 indicates a pure one-cycle pattern, and ω = 0 indicates a pure two-cycle pattern).</p><p>Noteworthy about the mixed model is that it predicts bias patterns that are not necessarily symmetrical (because a weighted sum of two symmetrical patterns is not always symmetrical) and thereby is able to explain some asymmetrical patterns without need for any additional parameter (other than the weighting parameter) or psychological account of the crossover.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Integrating proportion judgment approach into decision models</head><p>It should now be apparent that probability distortion patterns in decision making are similar to those seen in other domains for which a proportion judgment account has been proposed and that the equations that have been fit to data are also very similar across domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability range and distortion 11</head><p>In particular, the probability weighting functions introduced earlier (Eqs. 3 and 4) are both identical to Spence's power model equation (Eq. 6) with the exception that each of the probability weighting functions includes a means of producing the asymmetrical distortion pattern (e.g., by raising or lowering the curve; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1c</ref>) often seen in decision making. 2 While proportion judgment does not provide an obvious explanation for the elevation of the probability weighting curve (which may have a distinct psychological source, such as the attractiveness of gambling to the individual; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gonzalez &amp; Wu, 1999)</ref>-it does offer a straightfoward account of the shape of the curve. We are interested in the intriguing question of whether adopting a proportion judgment approach might lead to new insights regarding probability distortion in decision making, in particular regarding the shape of the probability weighting curve.</p><p>According to Spence's power model (Eq. 6), distortion in proportion judgment arises from imprecision in the estimation of magnitudes contributing to the judgment. Thus one insight from a proportion judgment perspective, although not the focus of the present work, is that there might be a link between our intuitive magnitude system (see <ref type="bibr">Libertus &amp; Brannon, 2009, for review)</ref> and distortion in the use of numbers in decision making. Researchers have begun to study the link between intuitive magnitude skills (e.g., judging numerosity of dots in a display) and use of numbers in decision making (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Patalano, Saltiel, Machlin, &amp; Barth, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Peters, Slovic, Västfjäll, &amp; Mertz, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schley &amp; Peters, 2014</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Reyna, Nelson, Han, &amp; Dieckmann, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Winman, Juslin, Lindskog, Nilsson, &amp; Kerimi, 2014)</ref>, providing initial evidence that several intuitive magnitude estimation measures are related to value and probability distortion. Numeracy measures tapping into fluency in processing part-whole relationships (e.g., difficulty translating from fractions to percentages) have also been associated with value and probability distortion and with overall CPT model fit and response reliability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Patalano et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schley &amp; Peters, 2014)</ref>. These findings provide initial evidence that value and probability distortion in decision making might arise not (only) from psychological sources specific to decision making but, rather, from a more general property of an intuitive magnitude system involved in a wide range of magnitude and proportion-related judgments, evidence consistent with a proportion judgment account.</p><p>The focus of the present work is a prediction arising specifically from application of the cyclical power model to the distortion of probabilities in decision making. According to the CPM, whether a value is over-or underestimated depends not on its absolute magnitude but rather on the proportional relationship between it and the reference range to which it is compared. The type of cyclical pattern of bias that emerges in any context (e.g., one-cycle vs.</p><p>two-cycle patterns) depends on the number of reference points used. In decision making, probability weighting curves are assumed to follow a one-cycle pattern, with an inverse S-shaped curve extending across the full range of values. A novel prediction that follows if the CPM is applied to decision making is that contexts that facilitate the use of additional reference points during the evaluation of probabilities should give rise to multi-cycle patterns of probability distortion. For example, while a one-cycle pattern might emerge when only 0 and 100 are used as reference points in probability weighting <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 3a)</ref>, a two-cycle pattern might emerge when 50 is available as an additional reference point <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 3b)</ref> response to one's recent experience with other probabilities in the environment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ungemach, Stewart, &amp; Reimers, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wedell, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Windschitl &amp; Chambers, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Developing a cyclical CPT equation</head><p>Towards testing whether a one-or two-cycle probability weighting pattern might better fit CE data, we developed a modified probability weighting function by incorporating elements of the CPM into an existing probability weighting function. We took <ref type="bibr">Lattimore et al.'s (1992)</ref> two-parameter probability weighting function (Eq. 4) as our starting point. We used this function rather than, for example, <ref type="bibr">Tversky and Kahenman's (1992)</ref>  out of 100 rather than only .8 out of 1) for consistency with the CPM (Eq. 7; although this choice does not affect model predictions), and we introduced reference points, resulting in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">w(p) = (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ / (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ + (R i -p) γ )) (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) + R i-1 /R n<label>(9)</label></formula><p>In the above, we continue to use p as the expression for the probability input to differentiate it from the value input in the larger CPT equation. But p now refers to the numerator of the ratio implied by the percentage sign (such as '60' for 60/100), rather than already being translated into a proportion. Two versions of this equation were used in the present work. In the one-cycle CPT model (a shorthand for a CPT equation with a one-cycle probability weighting function), 0</p><p>and 100 are assumed to be the only reference values used by the decision maker. The one-cycle version is functionally the same as the Lattimore et al. equation (the parts after the multiplication Probability range and distortion 14 sign are identity operations in the one-cycle model) and can produce a standard probability weighting curve (an inverse S-shape) across the full 0-100 scale range (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3a)</ref>. In a twocycle CPT model, 50 is included as an additional reference point, such that the equation can produce an inverse S-shape between 0 and 50 that is repeated between 50 and 100 (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig 3b)</ref>.</p><p>Because there is also an elevation parameter in both versions to accommodate the asymmetrical crossover commonly seen in decision making research, any inverse S-shape need not be symmetrical to be well fit by the equation; that is, the equation accommodates crossovers in locations other than the midpoint of each S-shaped curve.</p><p>The CPT equation was thus modified as follows. We started with the general specification of the CPT model (Eq. 1) shown earlier:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">v(CE) = v(x 1 )w(p) + v(x 2 )(1 -w(p)).</formula><p>We then elaborated the value and probability weighting functions using the original value function (Eq. 2) and the CPM-inspired probability weighting function (Eq. 9):</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">CE α = x 1 α • (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ / (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ + (R i -p) γ ) (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) + R i-1 /R n ) + x 2 α • (1 -(δ(p -R i-1 ) γ / (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ + (R i -p) γ ) (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) + R i-1 /R n ))<label>(10)</label></formula><p>And we raised both sides by 1/α to isolate the CE dependent measure:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">CE = (x 1 α • (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ / (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ + (R i -p) γ ) (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) + R i-1 /R n ) + x 2 α • (1 -(δ(p -R i-1 ) γ / (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ + (R i -p) γ ) (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) + R i-1 /R n ))) 1/α<label>(11)</label></formula><p>As will be described in Section 1.5, we used this equation to test whether CE responses made by each individual in our study were better fit by a one-cycle CPT model (Eq. 11 with R 0 = 0 and R 1 = 100) or a two-cycle CPT model (R 0 = 0, R 1 = 50, and R 2 = 100) in each study condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Overview of present study</head><p>The goal of the present study was to attempt to manipulate use of two versus three Probability range and distortion 15 reference points for estimating probability in a gambling task and to assess fit of one-cycle CPT versus two-cycle CPT models to individual certainty equivalent data. Specifically, participants responded to a series of 176 gambles and CE data were derived from participant responses.</p><p>Participants in a first sample were assigned either to a full-range condition, in which probabilities (presented as percentages) ranged from 0-100% as they typically do in tasks of this type, or to an upper-range condition, in which probabilities ranged from 50-100%. In these conditions, participants were not explicitly told the probability range, but were expected to infer it from the gambles. In order to extend the findings to a different range and to ensure that the range was known, a new sample of participants was assigned to a lower-range condition in which probabilities ranged from 0-50%, and participants were explicitly instructed that all stated probabilities would be in this range. The purpose of the range manipulation across conditions was to influence reference points. We expected individuals in the full-range condition to be most likely to use only 0 and 100 as reference points, and those in the upper-range and lower-range conditions to be more likely to use 50 as an additional reference point. In all other ways, the full-range condition and the two "limited-range" conditions were the same. For ease of presentation, the three conditions are reported as a single study. Two short numeracy scales were also administered to all participants to assess their general skills with number.</p><p>In the full-range condition, we expected the CEs for most individuals to be best fit by a one-cycle CPT model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. In the two limited range conditions, if intermediate reference points are not used, we expected data to also be better fit by a one-cycle CPT model. That is,</p><p>CEs for the lower-range condition would reflect a distortion pattern matching the lower half of the inverse S-shape of the probability weighting curve, while CE's in the upper-range condition would reflect a distortion pattern matching the upper half of the same curve. If, instead, an intermediate reference point is used, we expected data in the limited-range conditions to be better fit by a two-cycle CPT model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 3b</ref>). In this case, CEs in the lower-range condition would reflect a single inverse S-shaped curve (the lower half of the two-cycle pattern), as would CEs in the upper-range condition (in this case, reflecting the upper half of the two-cycle pattern). We expected that such two-cycle curves, if present, would otherwise be similar to the one-cycle curve for the full-range condition. That is, the use of an additional reference point should affect the number of cycles in the probability weighting curve but not its degree of curvature or elevation (or the curvature associated with the value function; i.e., parameter estimates should not change). It is possible that there would also be some additional differences across conditions resulting from exposing participants to different ranges of probabilities (i.e., distinct from their choice of reference points), but we did not have specific predictions along these lines.</p><p>Though not the central focus, we also conducted analyses to assess the extent to which some individuals in the full-range condition might have spontaneously used a middle reference point. That is, we considered how many individuals in the full-range condition had CE data better fit by a two-cycle than a one-cycle CPT model. Additionally, after conducting initial analyses, we developed a mixed-cycle CPT model to assess whether such a model might explain patterns in the data better than either a one-or a two-cycle model alone. Such a model would be expected to fit CE data well if in one or more conditions a middle reference point was used on only a subset of trials. Finally, deviations of the probability weighting curve (and also the value curve) from the identity line, as well as model fitting error, were expected to be negatively correlated with numeracy. Such a finding would be consistent with past work (using a full-range condition; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Patalano et al., 2015)</ref> and would provide further evidence of a relationship between probability distortion and intuitive number skill more generally. Participants in a first group were randomly assigned to either the full-range (n = 44) or upperrange (n = 45) condition (with no explicit statement of probability range). A second group (run after the first group) was assigned to the lower-range (n = 48) condition (with explicit statement of probability range). Two additional participants came to the lab but did not complete the gambling task. Of those completing the gambling task, 9 participants were excluded from final data analysis based on the a priori elimination rule of having a large number of missing trials (&gt; 30 out of 176 trials), and 1 additional participant was excluded for extreme root mean square error (RMSE) values (&gt; 10 SD above the mean) for both CPT models. Analyses were based on the remaining 127 participants (full-range: n = 40; upper-range: n = 42; lower-range: n = 45; 1 of the latter did not complete the numeracy scales and was excluded just from that analysis).</p><p>Across conditions, there were no differences in the number of missing trials, F(2,124) = 0.87, p = .421, or in response reliability for the 11 pairs of repeated gambles (see 2.2. Procedure section), F(2,124) = 0.18, p = .837.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Procedure</head><p>Participants came individually to the lab for a two-hour session. Written informed consent of the participant was obtained at the start of each laboratory session. Participants then completed the gambling task for approximately 60 minutes, several tasks that were unrelated to the present one and that served as filler activities for approximately 30 minutes, and two numeracy measures for approximately 5 minutes. Participants completed the tasks individually Probability range and distortion 18 at their own pace on the computer in the laboratory. An experimenter sat nearby to monitor the study, provide instructions, and answer any questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Gambling task</head><p>The gambling task was modeled after <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gonzalez and Wu (1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>. The task, as shown in Figures 4a and 4b (which represent a single trial), was to compare a stated gamble (e.g., "95% chance of $100, otherwise $0") to each of six "sure- Probabilities varied by condition. In the full-range condition, the 11 probabilities (in a range between 0% and 100%) were 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 39%, 50%, 61%, 75%, 90%, 95%, and 99%.</p><p>In the upper-range condition, the probabilities (in a range between 50% and 100%) were 51%, 53%, 55%, 63%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 87%, 95%, 97%, and 99%. In the lower-range condition, the probabilities (in a range between 0 and 50%) were 1%, 3%, 5%, 13%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 37%, 45%, 47%, 49%. The proportional spacing of probabilities was matched between conditions (e.g., 10% out of 100% matched 5% out of 50%), with the exception that a few values were Probability range and distortion 19 adjusted so that the number of values divisible by five would be about the same in all conditions.</p><p>Eleven gambles, one at each probability level, were repeated as a reliability check, resulting in a total of 176 gambling trials. Ten pseudorandom orders of the trials were created, with no gamble appearing twice in a row.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.2">Task instructions and procedure</head><p>Each participant read task instructions on the screen, paraphrased the instructions back to the experimenter, and had the opportunity to ask any questions before beginning the task. A printed sheet of instructions was also available for reference throughout the experiment. Each trial began with a display similar to that shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4a</ref>. The sure-thing amounts ranged from the largest possible gamble outcome to the smallest (i.e., from $100 to $0 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 4a</ref>), with intermediate values at equally spaced intervals. Participants were told that it was expected that they would "cross over" from preferring the sure-thing to preferring the gamble at some point for each display. When done with the first display, the participant proceeded to a follow-up display (for the same trial; they could then no longer return to the previous display), which presented a narrower range of sure-thing values (the new endpoints were the sure-thing values bracketing the crossover point from the previous display, e.g., the endpoints might be from $80 to $60; see <ref type="bibr">Fig. 4b</ref>). This procedure is one of several used to obtain CEs in the decision literature. It is known to elicit more reliable responses than more direct procedures (e.g., directly asking for the overall value of the gamble; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fox &amp; Poldrack, 2014</ref>, for review). The instructions were the same across conditions except that, in the lower-range condition, participants were explicitly told (and expected to repeat back to the experimenter during the paraphrasing of the instructions) that the probabilities ranged between 0 and 50%. Any participants who did not spontaneously offer this range when paraphrasing the instructions was asked for it explicitly by the experimenter. A Probability range and distortion 20 participant who could not accurately state the range was asked to re-read the instructions and the process was repeated (no one needed to re-read the instructions more than once). The 5 items common to both scales were administered once, for a total of 14 items across both scales. All items on Lipkus et al.'s scale involve manipulating percentages, proportions, and fractions (e.g., "If the chance of getting a disease is 20 out of 100, this would be the same as having a ____% chance of getting the disease."). The Weller et al. scale also includes several word problems that are more difficult (e.g., "If it takes five machines five minutes to make five widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?"), but that are less directly related to manipulating part-whole relationships. Paper and pencil were available during this task and participants were free to jot down any computations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Gambling data processing</head><p>For the gambling task, certainty equivalents were obtained for each of the 176 trials for each participant based on their choices for each of the gambles. A certainty equivalent could not be directly inferred for trials in which the participant gave the same response to every comparison (i.e. the person chose all "sure-thing" or all "gamble" responses). These trials were excluded and responses were considered missing except for ones in which a participant indicated a crossover point on the first screen of a trial. In these cases, because the certainty equivalent range was narrowed by the first response, it was reasonable to conclude that a participant who Probability range and distortion 21 chose all "sure-thing" responses on the second screen was intending the lowest crossover point and a participant who chose all "gamble" responses intended the highest (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Patalano et al., 2015)</ref>. As mentioned in the Participants section (Section 2.1), those participants with more than 30 missing trials were eliminated from further consideration.</p><p>For each condition, one-cycle and two-cycle modified CPT models (based on Eq. 11)</p><p>were fit to CE data. An α parameter was estimated as a measure of curvature of the value function, δ was estimated as a measure of the elevation of the probability weighting function, and γ was estimated as a measure of curvature of the probability weighting function for each model. The modified CPT model was specified as (Eq. 11, rewritten here):</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">CE = (x 1 α • (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ / (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ + (R i -p) γ ) (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) + R i-1 /R n ) + x 2 α • (1 -(δ(p -R i-1 ) γ / (δ(p -R i-1 ) γ + (R i -p) γ ) (R i -R i-1 )/(R n -R 0 ) + R i-1 /R n ))) 1/α .</formula><p>For the one-cycle version of the CPT model, R 0 = 0 and R 1 = 100. For the two-cycle version, R 0 = 0, R 1 = 50, and R 2 = 100. SPSS statistical software, nonlinear least squares regression, and a sequential quadratic programming algorithm for parameter estimation were used. Parameter starting values considered were .5, .8 and 1.1 and the starting value that resulted in the lowest RMSE (with plausible parameter values) was selected <ref type="bibr">(.8</ref> was the preferred starting value in nearly all cases). Parameter estimates were constrained to be &gt; 0. Resulting distributions of estimates were positively skewed (skewness &gt; 1), so medians and nonparametric statistical tests are reported unless otherwise noted. For interested readers, we also developed modified one-and two-cycle CPT models using <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tversky and Kahneman's (1992)</ref> original one-parameter probability weighting function (instead of the two-parameter function) and fit these models to our data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Plotted CE medians as a function of probability level</head><p>To provide a general sense of CE patterns (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>, for all gambles of the form (x, p; 0, 1-p), we divided the certainty equivalent (CE) by the gamble outcome (x). For each probability level, the median ratio was plotted by condition as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. The graphed data points can be interpreted as representing the shape of the probability weighting curve in the limited case in which the value function is the identity relationship (i.e., α = 1). We overlaid on this graph the smooth curve that reflects the best fitting one-cycle probability weighting curve for the full-range condition (plotting gamble probability against decision weight in this case). The figure shows that CE response patterns were somewhat similar across conditions, although with some deviations in the limited-range conditions. It is important to keep in mind that because the diagonal line only reflects the identity line for the probability weighting function when α = 1, the CE patterns in the figure are consistent with multiple interpretations of the probability weighting function (depending on α). For example, it is equally plausible that the best fitting probability weighting curve for the upper-range condition data is Probability range and distortion 23 fully below the probability weighting function identity line and that α = 1 or that it is partially above the identity line and that α &lt; 1. Because our primary interest was in estimating decision weights, all future graphs show w(p) plotted against p using Eq. 9 and median parameter estimates obtained through modeling. CEs are not plotted again on these graphs given that CEs do not provide dirct evidence of the fit of the probability weighting function.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Model fit and parameter estimates for full-range condition</head><p>Based on much past work, we predicted that the one-cycle model would fit the full-range condition data well, and it did. The first row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> shows the median parameter estimates and the model fit based on RMSE from the full-range condition using the one-cycle model. The median parameter estimates and RMSE here, nearly identical to those found in past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Patalano et al., 2015)</ref>, reflect declining value of dollars, and an over-under pattern of probability distortion with a crossover at approximately 20%. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>, we also report the number of participants with parameter estimates less than 1 because typical qualitative patterns for the value curvature α, probability weighting elevation δ, and probability weighting curvature γ are reflected by estimates below 1. Note that while the table indicates the percentage of individuals better fit by each model, data from all full-range condition participants were used to compute medians for each model (the same is true for the upper-and lower-range conditions). Also, while we include median R 2 values in the table to give a more intuitive measure of fit, individuallevel R 2 values should not be interpreted as proportion of variance explained given that it is possible for the grand mean model to fit less well than a nonlinear model to an individual's data (which would result in a negative R 2 ). the only change between groups was in the use of an additional reference point (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> for one-and two-cycle curves fit to subsets of participants; this is the only analysis that uses subsets of participants). Additionally, mean numeracy scores (using the Weller et al. 8-item scale but results with the Lipkus et al. 11-item scale were similar) were higher for participants better fit by the two-cycle model (M = 6.30, SD = 0.95) than by the one-cycle model (M = 5.64, SD = 1.47), though the difference was not statistically significant, t(38) = -1.33, p = .191. These findings, while by no means conclusive, are suggestive that some individuals, who may be more numerate, may have utilized multiple reference points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURE 6 ABOUT HERE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3.">Model fit and parameter estimates for limited-range conditions</head><p>The primary question of interest was whether behavior in the upper-range and lowerrange conditions would be better fit by the one-cycle model (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 3a)</ref> or the two-cycle model (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 3b</ref>). To answer this question, we compared the fit of each model to individual data. The RMSE was found to be reliably lower for the two-cycle model than for the one-cycle model for both the upper-range condition (Z = -3.07, p = .002) and the lower-range Probability range and distortion 25 condition (Z = -3.00, p = .003), providing initial evidence that the two-cycle model might provide a better fit to the data. A comparison of the RMSEs for each participant revealed that 67% of participants in the upper-range condition and 67% in the lower-range condition had data better fit by the two-cycle model. That said, differences in RMSEs were very small between models while differences in parameter estimates were large (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>We then considered what the probability weighting curves from the limited-range conditions looked like relative to the standard one-cycle curve from the full-range condition.</p><p>The best-fitting curves based on the one-cycle model, for all three conditions, are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7</ref>; the curves are very similar to one another. The estimated parameters for the one-cycle model for the upper-and lower-range conditions did not differ from those for the full-range condition (Kruskal-Wallis test Hs &lt; 5.50, ps &gt; .080; including for value curvature), consistent with what would be expected if the one-cycle model provided the best description of CE behavior in all three conditions. We then plotted the best fitting curves for the two-cycle model for the two limited-range conditions and the one-cycle curve from the full-range condition (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 8a</ref>). Again, the curves from the limited-range conditions look very similar to the one-cycle curve for the full-range condition. What the figure broadly suggests is that the two-cycle curves, rather than being scaled representations of a typical one-cycle curve, might be better described as portions of the typical one-cycle curve that have been generated from a two-cycle equation (but with some deviations that might be meaningful, like some additional curve in the upper-range condition). It is thus not surprising that there were differences in the two-cycle model parameter estimates in the limited-range conditions relative to the parameter estimates for the one-cycle model in the full-range condition. That is, it is not surprising that different parameter estimates are needed to produce quite similar curves with different equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURE 7 ABOUT HERE</head><p>We formally compared parameter estimates from the one-cycle model in the full-range condition to the two-cycle model in each limited-range condition. In the lower-range condition, δ was higher than in the full-range condition (U = 3.58, p &lt; .001), while α (U = -0.41, p =.682) and γ (U = 0.99, p =.318) did not differ across conditions. In the upper-range condition, parameter estimates for α (U = -3.30, p = .001) and δ (U = -3.04, p = .002) were lower, and γ was higher (U = 2.92, p = .004), than those in the full-range condition. We also compared the lowerand upper-range conditions' two-cycle model parameter estimates directly to one another, finding that α (U = 2.85, p =.004) and δ (U = 5.52, p &lt; .001) were larger and γ was smaller (U = -1.95 p = .051) in the lower-range condition, and thus that behavior was not the same in the two limited-range conditions. Again, it appears that the two-cycle parameter estimates reproduce something close to the one-cycle curve using a two-cycle equation. That said, as indicated earlier, in both limited-range conditions, the data for most individuals were better fit by the twocycle model. Thus, there appears, at least on the surface, to have been some difference in behavior across contexts that might have resulted in the two-cycle model being the better fitting model. Alternatively, the two-cycle model might simply fit better whenever a limited range of probabilities is used during modeling (as both limited-range conditions, by design, used only half the scale of probabilities, while the full-range condition used the full scale). We tested the latter possibility in the next analysis by re-analyzing full-range condition data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4.">Reanalysis of full-range condition (top vs. bottom half of probabilities)</head><p>To address whether the use of a limited range of probabilities during modeling could explain the better fit of the two-cycle models, we re-analysed the full-range condition data. We Probability range and distortion 27 ran a "top-half" analysis using only the gambles from 50-100% in the full-range condition (6 different probabilities) and a "bottom-half" analysis using only the gambles from 0-50% (6 different probabilities; we included the gambles involving 50% in both analyses) and compared the one-cycle and two-cycle models for each subset of data (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>). (We use the terms "top-half" and "bottom-half" instead of "upper-range" and "lower-range" to differentiate these analyses from those for the upper-range and lower-range conditions.) We found that, rather than the one-cycle model fitting better than the two-cycle model, there was no difference in the fit of the two models for either the top-half (W = -1.69, p = .090) or the bottom-half (W = -1.61, p = .107) data. Further, parameter estimates for the one-cycle and two-cycle models for each half of the data were similar to the estimates for the corresponding models applied to upper-range and lower-range condition data (ps &gt; .100). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8b</ref>, we plotted best fitting curves for the twocycle model for the top-half and bottom-half of the full-range condition data; these curves are very similar to the upper-range and lower-range condition curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8a</ref>. While the fullrange condition analyses here were based on a much smaller number of gambles than other analyses (half as many), they do provide some further evidence that the pattern of behavior seen in the upper-and lower-range conditions might not have been different from that in the fullrange condition, and that the better fit of the two-cycle model might, at least in part, be related to the range of probabilities used in modeling. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.5.">Further consideration of two-cycle model fit</head><p>While there is so far little evidence of a difference in CE behavior as a function of condition, the two-cycle model did fit the data better across all conditions than might be expected based on existing literature. We sought to better understand the fit of the two-cycle model in all Probability range and distortion 28 conditions. Further inspection of median CEs in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> suggested that the certainty equivalents generated in all conditions for gambles involving probabilities 50% might have been larger than the CE values predicted by the one-cycle CPT model, and thus closer to the values predicted by a two-cycle model (which, when α = 1, are on the identity line in this <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>. The presence of these high CE values at the midpoint of the 0 -100% probability range might at least partially explain the good fit of the two-cycle model. We formally tested whether an individual's median CE was greater than the median of the CEs predicted by the one-cycle model for that individual for all gambles involving the probability closest to the middle of the full probability scale (49%, 50% and 51%, for the lower-range, full-range, and upper-range conditions respectively). We only used gambles of the form (x, p; 0, 1-p) for this analysis. We found that the one-cycle model did underpredict CE values in all three conditions. In the full-range condition, the actual CE of 47.63 was reliably greater than the model estimated CE of 37.97 (W = -2.65, p = .008). In the upper-range condition, the actual CE of 50.50 was reliably greater than the model-estimated CE of 46.06 (W = -2.58, p = .010). And, in the lower-range condition, the actual CE of 49.88 was greater than the model-estimated CE of 42.39 (W = -4.31, p &lt; .001). The CEs for the three conditions were not reliably different from one another (H = 0.48, p = .785).</p><p>It is also noteworthy that the inverse-S shaped pattern that appears in the CE data in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> for gambles between 50 and 100% in the upper-range condition is very low on the graph relative to what would be predicted if a typical one-cycle curve were simply scaled to the 50 -100% region. In the two-cycle model applied to the upper-range condition, the low CE values were accommodated with an unusually low (relative to other conditions and models) α.</p><p>In contrast, no large change in α was needed to accommodate CE data in the lower half of the probability range (0 -50%) with a two-cycle model. Thus, if one were to adopt an account of the Probability range and distortion 29 findings that assumed a two-cycle model, one would also have to explain why dollar values are more steeply discounted for probabilities above 50% than for probabilities below 50%. That is, such a change in α is possible, but it is not predicted by the CPT model and thus would require some additional explanation. Such a change in α would, however, explain why a two-cycle model better fit the full-range condition data only when the data were split in half: only in the latter case could a different α be estimated for each half of the data. In the final Results subsection 3.3.5, we consider whether it might instead be possible to explain the inverse Sshaped curve in the CEs in the right half of the graph (i.e., for probabilities above 50%) as mixed use of a one-and two-cycle CPT model, rather than by assuming a change in value curvature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.5.">Reanalysis using a mixed (one-cycle and two-cycle) model</head><p>Our final consideration was whether the data might be well fit by a mixed model (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hollands &amp; Dyre, 2000)</ref> that uses one-cycle and two-cycle CPT models in some proportion specified with a weighting parameter ω, where 0 ≤ ω ≤ 1, resulting in CE = ω(onecycle-CPT equation) + (1-ω)(two-cycle-CPT equation), with one set of value and probability weighting parameters used by both equations. We considered this model because it looked possible that the pattern of CEs for the upper-range condition data (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) could be produced by combining a one-cycle and a two-cycle curve (without requiring a change in α).</p><p>The parameter estimates and measures of model fit for the mixed model are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>In the full range condition, the median ω was .93 (i.e., dominant use of the one-cycle model), while ω was .01 for the upper-range condition and .27 for the lower-range condition (i.e., both indicating dominant use of the two-cycle model); there was no reliable difference in the medians for the two limited-range conditions (U = 0.81, p = .422). The models fit slightly better than those of best-fitting one-or two-cycle models (not surprising as the latter are subsets of the Probability range and distortion 30 mixed model) but, overall, the analyses did not change our understanding of the data. Rather, the analyses confirmed that the one-cycle model best fits CE data in the full-range condition, while the two-cycle model best fits data in the limited-range conditions. While it would be possible to develop more complex mixed models (e.g., with separate value curvature and probability weighting parameters for one-and two-cycle equations), developing and testing such models was beyond the scope of the present work. </p></div>

We created one set of deviation measures using parameter estimates from the best-fitting model for each participant and one set using estimates from the one-cycle model only. For α and γ, which are exponents in the CPT model, deviation scores α d and γ d were created by taking the inverse of parameter estimates greater than 1 (e.g., 2 becomes ½ because the degree of curvature for any exponent greater than 1 is the same as that for its inverse), and then subtracting all scores from 1 (so that larger values indicate greater deviation from 1). Because δ is a factor that raises or lowers the curve rather than an exponent, the deviation score was created by simply taking the absolute value of the difference of the parameter estimate from 1 (δ d = |1 -δ|). <ref type="bibr">3</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 4</ref> shows Spearman correlations between deviation scores and the <ref type="bibr">Weller et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The primary goal of the present work was to extend the proportion judgment framework and, in particular, Hollands and Dyre's cyclical power model, to the domain of decision making under risk. We attempted to influence participants' use of a middle reference point through a manipulation of probability range. We then tested whether this manipulation would result in a change in the best-fitting CPT model from one with a one-cycle probability weighting curve to one with a two-cycle probability weighting curve with similar curvature and elevation parameter Probability range and distortion 32 estimates. We found that, consistent with our predictions, for the two limited-range contexts a CPT model with a two-cycle probability weighting function fit the data reliably better than one with a one-cycle function. However, counter to our predictions, the parameter estimates for the two-cycle models for the two limited-range conditions were different from one another and were different from one-cycle-model parameter estimates for the full-range condition. In other words, the estimated probability weighting curves in the upper-and lower-range conditions were not replications of a full-range curve scaled to a narrower range. Further, when we modeled top-and bottom-half of full-range condition data separately, the two-cycle model fit as well as the onecycle model, even though probability range (and thus potential use of a middle reference point)</p><p>was not manipulated in this condition. Thus, overall, the evidence was not consistent with the prediction that the best fitting model in the limited-range conditions would be a two-cycle CPT model with parameter estimates similar to those of the one-cycle models.</p><p>There was one element of procedure and one element of participant characteristics that one might propose could be related to the lack of a greater difference in CEs across conditions.</p><p>The first is that, in the full-range and upper-range conditions, participants were not informed of the probability context at the outset. However, this was not likely consequential in that, in the full-range condition, participants would have presumably assumed a 0-100% range and, in the lower-range condition, participants were explicitly told of the 0-50% range, yet differences in behavior in these conditions were not large either. The second element was that participants in the lower-range condition were less numerate than participants in the other two conditions.</p><p>However, we do not believe this was consequential either in that numeracy was not reliably correlated with which model (one-vs. two-cycle) was the better fitting model in any condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability range and distortion 33</head><p>Further, individuals in full-range and upper-range conditions had similar numeracy scores, yet there was also little difference in behavior between these two conditions.</p><p>The present findings do not rule out the possibility that distortion arises from proportion judgment or, specifically, that it arises from the comparison of targets to reference points as predicted by the CPM. However, they do, at a minimum, suggest that it might not be possible (or at least might not be easy) to manipulate probability-scale reference points. Unlike the bounding reference points in a number line task (which are typically arbitrary, determined by the experimenter, and visually present on each trial), probability range is more fixed in people's minds (and cued by the percentage symbol itself); the end points have important qualitative meaning (i.e., certainty); and the range is in one's mind rather than embodied in a physical scale.</p><p>Further, it is possible that the manipulation was unsuccessful here because even in the limitedrange conditions participants ultimately needed to think about probabilities from 0 to 100% (i.e., across the full range) in order to evaluate the subset of gambles that had two non-zero outcomes.</p><p>That is, if one gamble offered a 10% chance of $100, otherwise $50, a decision maker might explicitly bring 90% (the probability associated with the second outcome) to mind in thinking about the gamble. While not all gambles included non-zero second outcomes, the presence of even a small number of them might have had an influence on the establishment of reference points in this context.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the shape of the probability weighting function has been shown to be influenced by context in other research. Most relevant to the present work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Müller-Trede, Sher, and McKenzie (2018)</ref> recently demonstrated that probability distortion patterns depend on the scale used to communicate uncertainty. Using a bounded scale for outcome values and an unbounded scale for different levels of uncertainty (the opposite of what is standard), they found that distortion patterns reversed; there was an inverse S-shape for the value function and, for probabilities, there was evidence of a diminishing sensitivity to probabilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Müller-Trede et al.'s (2018)</ref> work illustrates that probability distortion is at least in part determined by whether or not the likelihood scale is bounded, a finding consistent with a proportion judgment approach, and suggests that use of intermediate reference points might be more likely to emerge in the context of novel likelihood scales. <ref type="bibr">Stewart et al.'s (2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stewart et al., 2015</ref>; but see Alempaki, in press) decision by sampling theory is also relevant to the present work in that, by this account, the probability weighting function is not the result of an internal mapping of probabilities to decision weights but rather is the result of a series of ordinal comparisons to probabilities sampled from the decision environment, with one's interpretation of a probability highly influenced by what other probabilities have been recently experienced. The modified CPT model developed here is similar to decision by sampling in that both approaches give some role to the decision environment on one's interpretation of a probability. However, in the decision by sampling approach, the decision weight is fully constructed through a series of binary, ordinal comparisons between the present probability and others in the decision environment. The present approach differs in that even though the context here can influence choice of reference points, the underlying process is still assumed to be a psychophysical transformation in which the shape of the curve arises from a part-whole comparison involving imprecisely-mapped magnitudes (although the present approach, of course, does not preclude the possibility that there are other contextual influences as well).</p><p>Even though the probability range manipulation did not alter the probability weighting curve in the expected manner, it was surprising that the two-cycle model fit better than (or at Probability range and distortion 35 least as well as) the one-cycle curve here in a number of situations. We do not necessarily take this as evidence of the use of multiple reference points or of generally better fit of two-cycle models. However, we do take it as evidence that there might have been some aspects of CE behavior that were not fully consistent with a one-cycle model, and that were better fit by the two-cycle model in some circumstances. In particular, in the CE data, there was evidence of overestimation (relative to the one-cycle model prediction) of probabilities at 50%, and there was evidence of an additional inverse S-shaped curve in the upper-range of the scale. To assess whether the full-range condition findings extended to other data sets, we conducted a new analysis in which we fit one-cycle and two-cycle models to a different set of full-range data from our lab that used more common probability values (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 99%). The pattern of findings was the same, with the one-cycle model providing better overall fit and the two-cycle model providing a better fit to each half of these full-range data. What we suspect is that the two-cycle model fits the data slightly better in contexts in which the two described properties (i.e., overestimation at around 50% and inverse S-shaped curvature in the upper range) have greater influence during modeling, such as when a greater proportion of the data points are close to 50% (see <ref type="bibr">Alempaki et al.,</ref> in press, for probabilityrange-related issues in modeling).</p><p>Even though we ultimately conclude that there there is little evidence in support of the two-cycle model, it does appear that probabilities at 50% were overweighted by participants relative to the predictions of a one-cycle CPT model. One possible reason is that individuals have a better understanding of 50% (and perhaps numbers that round to it, such as 55%) due to familiarity (e.g., coin flips), or that the equal likelihood of two events might hold a special status in the mind -perhaps a weaker version of the type of status afforded to complete certainty (i.e., Probability range and distortion 36 0% and 100%). Even if 50% is not used as a reference point in the manner described by proportion judgment models such as the CPM, it might nonetheless be used as an additional anchor (like 0 and 100%) to which other probabilities are compared. It is also possible that there are unexplored demand characteristics of the present elicitation procedure that contributed to the pattern of data, although, as indicated earlier, the elicitation method is a frequently used one. We have not encountered a similar pattern in past work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gonzalez &amp; Wu, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tversky &amp; Kahenman, 1992)</ref> but it is also not common that median CEs are reported as a function of probability level. The data pattern seems worth some further investigation.</p><p>An unresolved question is whether there might be a probability weighting function that fits the data better than either the one-cycle or the two-cycle model but that does not require different value parameters (in the case of the two-cycle model) for the upper and lower halves of the probability scale. In the present work, we considered the mixed (one-and two-cycle) model, but this did not offer new insight. One possibility for consideration for future work would be a model similar to the present two-cycle model in which the curvature of the probability weighting function is reference-point dependent, but where the elevation of the curve is not. To be concrete, imagine plotting a symmetrical two-cycle inverse S-shaped curve, and then raising or lowering the entire curve (constrained only by the 0 and 100% endpoints). It is not clear if such a model would fit the data better, but the approach would arguably be more consistent with the interpetation of the elevation parameter as being related to the overall attractiveness of gambling rather than to proportion judgment. With such an approach, it would be possible to produce a curve that falls largely below (or above) the identity line yet is still multi-cyclical, and it would be possible for the decision weight associated with 50% to take a value other than .50 (in the present two-cycle model, it will always be .50).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probability range and distortion 37</head><p>The present work offers the first study aimed at testing a modified cumulative prospect theory model with a cyclical probability weighting function. Although the data do not provide compelling support for the modified CPT model, they do illustrate that distortion is not highly influenced by simple manipulations of probability range. For example, the underweighting of a probability such as 70% appears to occur whether the probability appears in the context of probabilities between 0-100% or between 50-100%. Another avenue for future work is the consideration of stronger efforts to manipulate reference points including using decision tasks in which narrower boundaries more naturally emerge from the given context (e.g., if you knew that mutually-exclusive Outcome A were more likely than Outcome B, it would be more natural to then assume that Outcome A must have at least a 50% chance); using more extensive training regarding probability context (e.g., learning the likelihood of a new rare disease over many sessions); following Müller-Trede et al. <ref type="formula">2018</ref>, using unfamiliar likelihood scales (e.g., a scale from 0-10 where 0 means definitely will not happen, and 10 means equally likely to happen or not happen); using probability wheels (circular representations with pie-shaped portions) to represent probabilities visually; and even re-doing the present task using only $0 as the outcome for the second gamble. It is important to continue to pursue whether there are unifying cognitive explanations for similar patterns of probability distortion across tasks. Although the present study highlights some ways in which decision making under risk might be different from other proportion judgment tasks, proportion judgment remains a promising candidate as a cognitive account of probability distortion in decision making.

In the present context, this means that reference values are 0 and 1 for the one-cycle model, and 0, .5, and 1 for the two-cycle model, and that gamble percentages are input as values between 0 and 1 (e.g., 10% is p = .10).</p><p>Primary model fit measures and deviation correlations with numeracy are provided in the tables.</p><p>The one-cycle model provided a better fit than the two-cycle model in more comparisons here than in the primary report (when the Lattimore et al. probability weighting function was used).</p><p>We attribute this difference to the present model being less flexible than the Lattimore et al.</p><p>Probability range and distortion 59 model (e.g., less able to accommodate a high crossover of the identity line).
