			<abstract>
				<p>Recent research has examined the importance of moral character assessment in social interactions, focusing on how individuals infer trustworthiness based on others&apos; moral decisions, especially in sacrificial moral dilemmas. These dilemmas typically juxtapose utilitarian principles (harm for the greater good) against deontological ethics (inherent rightness or wrongness of actions). Extending previous work that relied on single-shot sacrificial dilemmas, we study trustworthiness inferences in iterative dilemmas involving multiple moral decisions. This approach addresses some of the limitations associated with prior work by considering the interdependency of moral judgments. In a series of five studies (N = 1234), we uncover robust evidence for a similarity effect in trust inference: people trust those whose moral preferences match their own. This similarity effect not only applies to consistent deontological or utilitarian choices but even extends to switching patterns across dilemmas. These findings challenge prior research that suggested that trust inference primarily favors deontological others.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inferences of Trustworthiness</head><p>Our success in navigating the complexities of our social world greatly depends on our ability to quickly and accurately assess the moral character of the people we meet. Studies in social cognition suggest that one of the first elements we try to gauge in others is their intent to cause harm or provide help <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goodwin et al., 2014)</ref>. Discerning the moral character of others is crucial, as it helps determine whom to trust.</p><p>Naturally, observable judgments or behaviors in the moral domain help signal moral character to others. In their seminal work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Everett et al. (2016)</ref> explored how people's perceptions of trustworthiness are influenced by how others respond to hypothetical moral dilemmas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Everett et al. (2016)</ref> focused on sacrificial moral dilemmas that present situations where inflicting harm serves the greater good, e.g. sacrificing one life to save many <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Greene et al., 2004)</ref>. Embracing harm to save a larger number of people in such cases is considered to be in line with utilitarian or consequentialist ethical principles that judge the morality of an action based on its consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mill, 1861</ref><ref type="bibr">(Mill, /1999</ref>. Conversely, opposing harm in such dilemmas aligns with deontological ethics, which judge actions based on their inherent nature, viewing certain actions as inherently wrong regardless of their outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kant, 1959</ref><ref type="bibr">(Kant, /1785</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Everett et al. (2016)</ref> found that people generally perceive those who reject sacrificial harm as more trustworthy than those who condone it. Building on this, further studies have shown that individuals who oppose harm for the greater good are often seen as more likable, friendly, and trustworthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bostyn &amp; Roets, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown &amp; Sacco, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rom &amp; Conway, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sacco et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smillie et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, deontological decisions, compared to utilitarian ones, are believed to convey stronger benevolent intentions, enhancing trust and desirability in social interactions and relationships.</p><p>However, not all studies have confirmed this general pattern. The moral preferences of the observer and the specific features of the dilemma can influence how trust is inferred. In certain situations, individuals might place their trust in someone who shows a deep commitment to fundamental moral rules, irrespective of the outcomes. In other contexts, there can be a preference for individuals who are characterized by their consideration of consequences.</p><p>Recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bostyn et al. (2023)</ref> highlighted that the context of moral alignment and trust is largely understudied in the literature. This work investigated the robustness of previous findings while accounting for contextual effects (e.g., possible features of the situation described in the sacrificial dilemma). The work demonstrated that deontologists are not always trusted over utilitarians, but rather that trust inference depends on contextual factors, and most notably the similarity between the rater and the target, in their moral judgments: deontologists favored other deontologists and utilitarians favored utilitarians. We use the term 'similarity effect' in the current paper to refer to this effect. This key finding challenges previous findings in the literature, and suggests the importance of similarity may have been overlooked in previous work.</p><p>Although similarity effects have informed findings in other domains of psychology and sociology, such as interpersonal liking <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Byrne, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Byrne &amp; Nelson, 1965)</ref> and social affiliations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(McPherson et al., 2001)</ref>, it has been conspicuously absent in moral psychology literature.</p><p>In the current research, we aim to expand our understanding of moral character assessment by broadening the scope of the moral dilemmas studied. Previous research primarily focused on trust inference based on moral judgment in the context of single-shot, sacrificial dilemmas. These dilemmas present scenarios and targets that involve making a decision on a single action, leading to trust assessments based solely on that decision. Findings based on single-shot sacrificial dilemmas treat moral decisions as isolated incidents, ignoring their interconnected nature and the broader context of recurring moral choices. In one attempt to address this lacuna, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bostyn and Roets (2022)</ref> argued for the need to study iterative sacrificial dilemmas, i.e., exploring how repeated moral decision-making scenarios might shift moral judgments. One-shot dilemma scenarios exclude the possibility that people might try to balance multiple moral concerns across multiple decisions, and that such a balancing act is meaningfully different from decisions that remain consistent within a moral principle (i.e., utilitarianism or deontology). With iterative sacrificial dilemmas, one can examine not only decisions driven by utilitarian or deontological principles, but also those influenced by a concern for the aggregate distribution of harm.</p><p>Consider this iterative dilemma: a device connected to six monkeys can deliver electric shocks. Five monkeys can avoid a distressing shock if it's redirected to the sixth. While not lifethreatening, this scenario mirrors the structure of traditional sacrificial dilemmas. But what if the dilemma repeats, and another shock will be administered? Does repetition lead individuals to consistently choose the same action? <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bostyn and Roets (2022)</ref> show that when dilemmas involve the same subjects repeatedly, decision-makers often switch their choices to distribute the harm.</p><p>We build on <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bostyn and Roets' (2022)</ref> by studying trust inference within the context of iterative dilemmas. This will help us to assess how trustworthy deontological and utilitarian decision-makers are perceived to be, and additionally, how trustworthy people that balance harms are perceived to be. The present work thus extends the literature in two important ways:</p><p>First, we consider how trust is inferred in the context of iterative moral decisions. Second, we explicitly consider and reevaluate the role of observers' own moral preferences on trust inference, i.e., to what extent does similarity in moral preferences between the observer and the target affect trust? We present two sets of studies, each focused on investigating trust inference. In Studies 1a,</p><p>1b, and 1c, participants were tasked with playing a series of trust games. In these trust games, participants received some information about the partner in these games: i.e., the choices the partner had made in an iterative dilemma. In Studies 2a and 2b, we again presented participants with a series of iterative dilemmas and directly probed them on how trustworthy they would rate others based on their responses to those dilemmas.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>For Study 1a, we recruited volunteers from the general population of a Western European country through social media. For Studies 1b and 1c, we recruited North-American participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk through the CloudResearch platform, for participation in the 5-10 minute study. We recruited participants with a task approval &gt; 90% but did not require a minimum number of prior tasks completed. Participants using suspicious geocode locations, and those with duplicate IP addresses were blocked from participation.</p><p>We did not exclude participants from Study 1a. However for Studies 1b and 1c, as per our preregistration (pre-registration link:</p><p>https://osf.io/tbjyp/?view_only=e3683ca79a82492db295bc2c5143a995), participants were excluded from the main analyses if they met at least one of the following criteria: they (1) they indicated a low proficiency in English (self-report &lt; 5, on a 1-7 scale); (2) self-reported not being serious about filling in the survey (self-report &lt; 4, on a 1-5 scale); (3) completed the survey too quickly (within 2 min); or (4) failed any of the two comprehension checks. We excluded 49 and 71 participants from Study 1b and Study 1c from the analysis based on the attention check questions (please see supplementary materials for details).</p><p>Basic demographic statistics and sample sizes for each study are available in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. 237 <ref type="bibr">(117,</ref><ref type="bibr">117,</ref><ref type="bibr">3)</ref> 42.38 (13.66) Note. Study 1b and 1c descriptive demographic information of the participants after the exclusion of responses based on the pre-registered exclusion criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In all three studies, participants first completed an iterative dilemma as a measure of their own moral preference. Subsequently, they were asked to play a series of trust games. Participants were explained how trust games worked and then played an uninformed trust game aimed at measuring participants' levels of baseline trust and cooperation. Participants then played a series of informed trust games, in which participants were provided with some information about their partner in the trust game: their decisions on an iterative sacrificial dilemma (for a similar procedure see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bostyn et al., 2023)</ref>. Notably, the dilemma used to assess participants' moral preferences was different from those used in the trust inference tasks involving others.</p><p>All three studies used the same materials and confronted participants with the same dilemmas. Additionally, Studies 1b and 1c probed participants to rate warmth, competence, empathy, rigidity, courage, and willingness to experience discomfort to bring about greater good to others. The results of the additional measures mirror the results of the trust measure. For brevity's sake, we do not discuss these measures within the main text but the results are available through the online supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moral Preference</head><p>In all three studies, participants' own moral preference was measured by confronting them with a single iterative dilemma taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bostyn and Roets (2022)</ref>. The dilemma, also outlined in the introduction section, required participants to choose between allowing five monkeys to be shocked or redirecting the shock to one monkey across two iterations. While this second iteration is superficially the same as the first, the underlying moral conflict is changed by the prior context. Whereas on the first iteration, participants are torn between a deontological concern not to harm, and a utilitarian concern to minimize harm, the second iteration allows for a third type of decision: to balance the harm across all possible victims by responding differently to each iteration. Participants' moral preferences were classified as deontological or utilitarian when their preferences were consistent across two iterations of the dilemmas. When preferences changed between iterations this was classified as a switch preference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trust games</head><p>The study setup involved engaging participants in a sequence of trust games. Before beginning the initial game, the participants received a detailed briefing on the mechanics of the game. Specifically, it was clarified that each game would involve two roles: a trustor and a trustee. The trustor would start with an allocation of 10 credits and have the freedom to decide how many to transfer to the trustee. It was emphasized that any credits passed to the trustee would be increased threefold, and the trustee would then have the discretion to return any portion of these augmented credits. Therefore, trustors could potentially enhance their gains by entrusting a maximum number of credits to the trustee, albeit with the risk of loss if the trustee proved unreliable. The participants were informed they would engage in multiple rounds of the game, each time paired with a different participant. It was indicated that the games would not be played in real-time, but participants' choices would be paired with participants who completed the study previously. While participants were led to believe they might play in both the trustor and trustee roles, they assumed the role of the trustor in all rounds. After receiving all information regarding the trust games, participants completed two comprehension checks aimed at confirming they understood the nature of the task at hand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures of trust and cooperation</head><p>In all three studies participants were asked to play a series of trust games. The participants in Study 1a did not receive any financial incentives to take part in the study, whereas Study 1b and 1c involved a fixed remuneration to complete the study. Additionally, in Study1b and 1c, to motivate participants to engage seriously with the trust games, they were informed of the possibility of earning a bonus ranging from $0.00 to $0.25 based on their choices in the scenarios. The determination of these bonuses was based on their responses in the initial trust game, where they were hypothetically paired with a trustee. The participant's reported trust directly determined the bonus paid out (ranging from 0$ to $0.25, with .05$ intervals, corresponding to the trust scale ranging from 1 to 5).</p><p>As a measure of their baseline levels of trust and cooperation, participants first played a single uninformed trust game. They were told that they were matched with a random other participant and received no further information about who this other participant might be.</p><p>Participants were asked to rate how much they trusted the (random) other player, using a fivepoint Likert scale spanning from (1) Not at all to (5) Completely, as well as how many credits they wanted to endow the other player with using a sliding scale spanning from 0 to 10 credits.</p><p>Afterward, participants completed a series of three informed trust games. On each of these trust games, participants were asked to read a (different) iterative sacrificial dilemma. Crucially, they were told how their partner in the trust game had responded to that dilemma. Across all three games, participants were confronted with a partner that had a) consistently chosen the utilitarian response, b) consistently chosen the deontological response, and c) switched their response from a deontological response in the first iteration to a utilitarian response in the second iteration. The partner's decision across the conditions was displayed in a similar manner, the decisions taken described for each iteration in bullet points (please refer to supplementary material section for details). Participants were asked to rate how much they trusted the other player, as well as how many credits they wanted to endow their partner with, using the same scales as on the uninformed trust game.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We first looked at participants' own moral preferences, i.e. the pattern of their responses to the iterative dilemma (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Participants' preferences were classified as 'Switch' when participants chose the deontological option in the first iteration of the dilemma and the utilitarian option in the second iteration, or vice versa. Only a small proportion of participants consistently choose the deontological response In Study 1a, a majority of participants can be categorized as "switchers", whereas in Study 1b and 1c, we found a balance between switch and utilitarian preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 2</head><p>Participants' own moral preferences across two iterations of the sacrificial dilemmas All three studies included multiple judgments per participant. Accordingly, we conducted linear mixed-effects regressions using the lme4 package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bates et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">R Core Team, 2023)</ref>. We ran separate models for each study and each dependent variable (trust vs. credits endowed). All models included the type of choice favored by the trustee (Utilitarian vs.</p><p>Deontological vs. Switcher), a dummy factor coding for similarity with participants' own moral preference <ref type="bibr">(Yes vs. No)</ref>, and the interaction of these terms as predictors. As control variables, all models also included the baseline measurement of trust or cooperation, respectively. All models included Participant ID as a random intercept. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> provides a visual overview of the trust ratings and credits endowed in the three studies for the various cells in this design. We tested the overall effect of similarity by comparing these models to models that did not include the dummy factor for similarity and its interactions. Crucially, adding similarity to the models increased model fit in all three studies and on all dependent variables, all Χ2(3) &gt; 16.24, all p ≤ .001.</p><p>Detailed statistical results are available in the supplementary materials.</p><p>Additionally, we conducted post-hoc pairwise comparison tests adjusted using the Tukey method. We observed significant differences between the levels of trust for and cooperation depending on the type of responses preferred by the targets. These effects are summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (see the supplementary section for the detailed results of post hoc comparisons). Across samples and dependent variables, we found that "deontologists" were trusted less than "switchers" and "utilitarians". In some instances, we found "utilitarians" were trusted more than "switchers", though this pattern was not consistent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Inferred trust and cooperation as a function of partner judgment and participant-partner similarity in judgment.</p><p>Note. Annotations carry results of post hoc pairwise comparisons adjusted using the Tukey method. Annotations at the upper part of the plots carry comparisons across target type, and the annotations at the lower part of the plots report the similarity effect within each target condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These first studies provide evidence for the similarity hypothesis. Although we did not uncover statistically significant differences in all individual comparisons, participants did clearly prefer partners displaying the same moral preference over partners displaying a dissimilar preference. This similarity effect is especially noteworthy given that participants' moral preference was measured through a different dilemma than the ones used in the trust games. This suggests, that the similarity effect does not only pertain to direct similarity (i.e., same answers on the same dilemma) but rather to 'moral principle' similarity across different dilemmas.</p><p>In addition to the similarity effect, the type of judgment displayed by the partner also appeared to have an impact. Interestingly, in contrast to prior work in this area (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bostyn &amp; Roets, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown &amp; Sacco, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Everett et al., 2016)</ref>, deontological partners were trusted the least. In this regard, it is worth noting that we did not try to balance the types of responses that people prefer when confronted with the dilemma included in these studies. Indeed, we used iterative dilemmas adapted from earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bostyn &amp; Roets, 2022)</ref>, and on these specific dilemmas, apparently only a small minority of participants favored a consistent deontological response (less than 14% across three samples). One possibility is that trust perceptions are not only driven by a similarity effect but also by a comparison to an assumed majority preference (i.e., norm). In other words, people might be more inclined to distrust others if a particular response is (perceived as) descriptively uncommon on the dilemma at hand.</p><p>We decided to run two more studies to address some potential shortcomings of Studies 1a-c. One potential limitation of these studies is that we used a different dilemma to probe participants' own moral preference as we did to probe trust ratings. While the responses to the initial dilemma indicate a commitment to a particular moral concern, they do not necessarily reflect the specific moral preference participants would display on the dilemmas used in the trust games. Secondly, the target type involved just one type of "switch" decision: participants were confronted with a partner who chose the deontological option in the first iteration and the utilitarian option in the second iteration, but not with a switching partner where the decision pattern is reversed: i.e., a target making a utilitarian choice followed by a deontological one. As a result, these studies do not account for the direction of the switch and potential differences in trust inferences across two patterns of switch decisions. Finally, the dilemma that was used to measure participants' own moral preferences, as well as those used to probe trust, might be 'biased' against deontological decisions given that relatively few people prefer such decisions on these dilemmas. As noted, this might have impacted how participants evaluated partners responding in a deontological manner.</p><p>We aimed to address these shortcomings in Study 2. Additionally, we simplified our procedure. Rather than probing trust through trust games, we simply confronted participants with iterative dilemmas, probed their personal preference and then asked them how they would rate others if they were to respond to those (same) dilemmas in specific ways. This approach also allowed us to differentiate the pattern of "switching" responses. Accordingly, in these studies, participants evaluated four partners, rather than three as in Study 1. Finally, we aimed to confront participants with a more balanced set of dilemmas that drew a relatively equal proportion of deontological and utilitarian responses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and measures</head><p>We used the same procedure for both studies. Participants first completed demographic information (age and gender). Subsequently, they completed two individual difference measures (Need for Cognition; <ref type="bibr">Cacioppo et al., 1984, and Empathic Concern;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Davis, 1983)</ref>. Afterward, they were confronted with a series of three iterative dilemmas in Study 2a and two iterative dilemmas in Study 2b, selected through a pre-test (n = 100 North-Americans recruited through M-Turk) that demonstrated a relatively balanced distribution of deontological and utilitarian responses to these dilemmas (see supplemental materials for the verbatim dilemmas). Dilemmas were administered in random order. On each dilemma, participants were first probed for their own moral preference. They responded in a binary way and each iteration within each dilemma was administered in a sequential fashion: participants first read and responded to the first iteration, and then read and responded to the second iteration. They were then asked to rate others based on how these others had supposedly responded to that same dilemma. On each dilemma, participants were asked to rate the trustworthiness of decision-makers that had (in random order) consistently responded in a utilitarian fashion, consistently responded in a deontological fashion, had initially responded in a utilitarian fashion but had switched their response on the second iteration, and vice-versa. Participants were asked to rate trust on a 5-point scale spanning from (1) Not at all to (5) Extremely. In both studies, participants were also asked to rate warmth and competence. In study 2b, participants were additionally asked to rate warmth, competence, fairness, empathy, and caring. Again, we focus only on the results with the trust measure as those with other measures mirror the pattern we uncovered for trust. Full results for the additional measures are available in the Supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We first looked at the pattern of participants' responses on the iterative dilemma as a measure of their own moral preference. Whereas in the dilemmas of Study 1 only a small minority of the participants across three samples gave a deontological response, we found sufficient variation in decisions across the scenarios employed in Study 2 (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). Note. We refer to 'Switch (Deo-Uti)' when participants chose to be deontologists in the first iteration of the dilemma and utilitarian in the second iteration, and vice versa in the case of 'Switch (Uti-Deo)'.</p><p>We conducted the same type of analysis as in the Study 1 series. We collapsed participants' responses for all dilemmas and analyzed them through linear mixed-effects models that included trust ratings as the dependent variable and judgment type (Utilitarian vs.</p><p>Deontological, vs. Switchers (Deotologist-Utilitarian) vs. Switchers (Utilitarian -Deotologist)),</p><p>Similarity, and the interaction between these variables as predictors.  Additionally, it shows the post hoc pairwise comparisons adjusted using the Tukey method.</p><p>Whereas evidence for the similarity in Study 1 was found in most but not all comparisons, the comparisons in Study 2 indicate very robust and consistent support for the similarity effect.</p><p>Possibly, the adapted procedure testing direct similarity in judgment strengthens the effect. As depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, we also found some significant differences in trust ratings between the levels of Target Type, but the patterns were not consistent across the two samples (see supplementary section for the detailed results).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Accurately ascertaining the moral character of others is critical for successfully navigating the social world. This manuscript investigated how moral judgments in sacrificial dilemmas influence trust inference in iterative decision-making. Traditional moral psychology paradigms, focused on single-shot dilemmas, may not fully capture the complexity of real-world decision-making, where choices often have cumulative effects. Our iterative approach reveals how people navigate moral complexities over time, balancing ethical considerations. Notably, 14-63% of respondents switched their responses between iterations, suggesting many adhere to equity/fairness by distributing harm. This suggests we should look beyond the utilitarian vs.</p><p>deontological distinction to better understand how people balance moral imperatives in sacrificial dilemmas (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bostyn &amp; Roets, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Roets et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings highlight the importance of the similarity effect in trust inference, showing that individuals tend to trust those whose moral judgments align with their own. This effect was consistent across various dilemmas, regardless of whether participants consistently preferred deontological or utilitarian responses, or switched between them. These results challenge the notion that deontological decisions are inherently more trust-engendering than utilitarian ones.</p><p>Instead, trustworthiness appears more closely tied to perceived moral congruence between individuals than to adherence to a specific ethical doctrine. This finding sheds new light on previous research that may have overlooked the impact of moral preference alignment on trust assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bostyn &amp; Roets, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Everett et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rom et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, our research underscores the dynamic nature of moral decision-making and its implications for trust inference. By demonstrating the robustness of the similarity effect and nuanced trust patterns in iterative moral dilemmas, our studies provide a broader understanding of the interplay between moral judgments and social trust. These insights have significant implications for moral psychology, particularly in understanding and assessing the morality of actions in complex social settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations, and future directions</head><p>We note limitations that suggest promising directions for future research. Firstly, our initial studies used dilemmas adapted from earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bostyn &amp; Roets, 2022)</ref> where most participants favored the utilitarian response, possibly influencing results through descriptive norms. Study 2 used a more balanced set of dilemmas, yet the impact of assumed majority norms on judgment warrants further research. Additionally, our studies do not distinguish whether the trust ratings are influenced by the perception that a decision maker's response is (perceived as) descriptively uncommon or by the belief that the response is morally wrong. Future studies can explore this further.</p><p>Descriptive norms vary between dilemmas and cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Graham et al., 2016)</ref>, so investigating the similarity effect in diverse cultural contexts (e.g., non-western contexts) would enhance our understanding of these mechanisms.Future research could also explore the boundaries of the similarity effect in non-sacrificial dilemmas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gordon-Hecker et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Singer et al., 2019)</ref> and examine whether moral identity centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aquino &amp; Reed II, 2002)</ref> influences reliance on moral similarity in trust judgments. As societies become more interconnected yet polarized, understanding trust formation in the face of diverse moral preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Graham et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shweder &amp; Haidt, 1993</ref>) is increasingly important.</p><p>Discovering ways to overcome distrust towards those with dissimilar moral values could be particularly valuable in navigating disagreements and fostering compromise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The introduction to the trust game was common across Study 1a, Study 1b, and Study 1c</head><p>A trust game is played with two players. One person plays the role of the GIVER, and the other person plays the role of the RECEIVER</p><p>The game works as follows: the GIVER gets 10 credits, and the receiver starts without any credits.</p><p>The GIVER gets to decide how many of the 10 credits they give to the RECEIVER. The GIVER can freely decide not to give anything to the RECEIVER, to give all their credits to the receiver, or something in between these two extremes.</p><p>Everything the GIVER gives to the RECEIVER will be tripled! For instance, if the GIVER gives 10 credits to the RECEIVER they will receive 30 credits in total. If the GIVER decides to give 3 credits, the RECEIVER will get a total of 9 credits.</p><p>As a final step in the game, the RECEIVER gets to decide how many of the total credits they share with the GIVER.</p><p>Importantly: these games are not happening "live". You are playing with people that have previously completed this survey and we will link up your responses afterwards. Once the experiment is over, we will calculate how many credits everyone has earned. The choices you make will help determine the bonus you will receive.</p><p>You will be asked to play five Trust games. Each game is a new game and in each game the GIVER will start off with 10 credits. Importantly, you will be paired up with a different player for each of these games.</p><p>For the first of these trust games, you will not receive any information about your partner in the game. For each of the subsequent three games, you will be provided with the responses that your partner provided to two dilemmas.</p><p>On the next page, we will first ask you to answer a simple comprehension question. We will then inform you whether you will be playing these games from the perspective of the GIVER or the receiver.</p></div>

Dam Dam, Iteration 1 Imagine the following scenario. You are the governor of a state that was just hit by a hurricane. The hurricane has damaged a dam causing it to be on the verge of breaking down. When the dam breaks, the water will flood a nearby town with 10.000 inhabitants. While the break cannot be averted, you could open a floodgate to divert the water to another river thus saving the city from a flood. However, doing so will flood another, smaller town with 500 inhabitants. Fortunately, you have already managed to evacuate both towns to ensure that no lives will be lost.

You could put the three smaller dogs outside in the courtyard, or drag Lassie, the larger dog, outside and give her cage to the three smaller dogs. What do you decide to do this time? Do you decide to do nothing, leaving the three smaller dogs outside in the cold, or do you drag Lassie outside?</p></div>

Six cars were brought into your garage for repair this week. You have each owner's permission to complete the repairs with used parts. You have just finished repairing the car that was brought in a few days before the others when you get a call that the delivery of the used parts you were planning on using for the remaining cars will be delayed by 10 days. This is inconvenient but you realize that you could repair all five remaining cars by harvesting the necessary parts from the car you just finished. Doing so would allow you to repair all five cars more quickly but will cause the repair of the first car to be delayed by the 10 days it will take to have the new parts delivered. What do you decide to do?

While the repairs from last year are holding up well, other problems have emerged for each of the cars. Like before, you have the permission of each owner to complete the repairs with used parts. Strangely enough, the exact same thing as the year before happens: you have just finished repairing the car that was brought in a few days before the others and that you also finished first last year when you get a call that the delivery of the used parts you were planning on using for the remaining cars will be delayed by 10 days. This is inconvenient, but you have the same option as last year: you can harvest the necessary parts from the car you just finished and fix the five remaining cars.

All the participants in Study 1a read Same-victim version of the dilemmas. Participants in the Study 1b were allocated either to Same-victim or Different-victim versions of the dilemmas. Participants in Study 1c were allocated to one of the One-shot, Same-victim, Different-victim versions of the dilemmas.</p><p>The primary difference between Study 1a, 1b, and 1c was the inclusion of additional control conditions in Studies 1b and 1c. More specifically: Study 1a only involved confronting participants with iterative sacrificial dilemmas that involved the same set of targets on each iteration. Study 1b included these same dilemmas in the main condition, but also included a condition in which the iterative sacrificial dilemmas involved different targets for each iteration. Study 1c included all conditions from Study 1b and included yet another between-subject condition involving single-shot sacrificial dilemmas. All conditions in Studies 1b and 1c were run between subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1a Method Participants and procedure</head><p>We recruited 147 North American participants from the CloudResearch platform of which 83 identified as female and 63 identified as male. Participants had an average age of 34.91 (SD = 17.61).</p><p>Participants were asked to complete basic demographic information (age &amp; gender) and were subsequently confronted with two tasks. The first task was to answer an iterative dilemma task as a decision-maker in which they had to pursue had to decide which option they would pursue. The second task was to play a series of four trust games. The first of these trust games was an uninformed trust game, aimed at measuring participants' baseline levels of trust and cooperation. The following three trust games were informed trust games in which participants were provided with some information about their partner in the trust game: their decision on an iterative sacrificial dilemma. All the iterative dilemmas involved the same victim scenario. Once all trust games were completed participants were debriefed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Participants as decision-makers answered an iterative electroshock dilemma. The electroshock dilemma described a hypothetical situation in which 6 monkeys were hooked up to an electroshock machine. Participants were told that a single monkey would be shocked but this could be averted by shocking the five other monkeys instead. The participants chose between a response option to minimize overall harm and a response option to refrain from personally doing harm. Participants decided for the first iteration and the dilemma is repeated and another shock is to be delivered to the same targets.</p><p>Following the first task participants were invited to play a series of four trust games. Before playing their first trust game, participants were explained how trust games work. More specifically, participants were explained that each trust game has two players: a trustor and a trustee. Participants were told that the trustor would receive 10 credits and that they were free to decide how many of these credits to give to the trustee. They were told that all credits given to the trustee would be tripled and that afterward, the trustee was free to decide how many of the credits they wished to return. Trustors could thus maximize their earnings by endowing the trustee with a large number of credits but in doing so they risked losing out on earnings if they decided to endow an untrustworthy trustee with their credits. Participants were told that they would play a series of these games and that they would be matched with a different partner on each game. Participants were told they would not be playing these games live but that their responses would be randomly matched to those of other participants after the study was completed. We told participants that they would play games as either the trustor or the trustee but in reality, all participants played all games from the perspective of the trustor.</p><p>After receiving instructions on the trust game, participants were asked two comprehension questions. First, they were asked to imagine a situation where the trustor transferred 5 credits to the trustee and asked how many credits (if any) the trustee should return if the trustee wants to maximize their earnings. Participants were asked to respond using a multiple-choice format and were presented with four choice options: returning 0, 5, 10 or 15 credits. Subsequently, they were asked how many credits a trustee would receive if a trustor endows them with 10 credits and had to select the correct response from the options: 10, 20, 30, or 40 credits.</p><p>After completing the comprehension checks participants started playing the trust games. First, they played an uninformed trust game. Participants were told they were matched up with a random other participant about whom they received no information. They were asked to rate how much they trusted this random other person using a five-point Likert scale spanning from (1) Not at all to (5) Completely. They were also asked how many credits they wanted to endow this random other person with, using a sliding scale spanning from 0 to 10 credits.</p><p>Subsequently, they played an additional three informed trust games. In each of these trust games, participants were shown an iterative dilemma with the same targets across two iterations and were told what their supposed partner's response was to this sacrificial dilemma. Participants were presented with a partner who responded in a deontological fashion across two iterations, a partner who responded in a utilitarian fashion across two iterations, and a partner who switched from a deontological choice from the first iteration to a utilitarian choice in the section iteration, we labeled as "switcher".</p><p>The dilemmas presented as part of the informed trust games are drawn from three iterative sacrificial dilemmas. The first dilemma described a situation in which a gas leak in a hospital threatened to lengthen the recovery time of five injured patients with an additional month. Again, this outcome could be averted only by redirecting the harm to a single injured patient instead. The second dilemma described an overflooding dam in which the decision maker faces a choice: allow a dam break to flood a town of 10,000 people or divert the water to flood a smaller town of 500. The third dilemma involved a hostage situation where the choice was between not intervening, leading to harm for the hostages, or redirecting the harm to a single hostage. Accordingly, each dilemma contrasted a response option to minimize overall harm with a response option to refrain from personally doing harm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The first task involved participants answering an iterative dilemma taking the role of a decisionmaker. Only a large proportion of participants decided in favor of sacrificial harm on the first iteration of the electroshock dilemma (82.3%). However, when confronted with the second iteration, a decreased proportion of participants condoned the sacrificial harm: 34.0% of participants favored sacrificial harm (See <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). A McNemar test for paired proportion confirmed this difference was statistically significant (χ2(1) = 52.69, p &lt; .001).</p></div>

For the 'Need for Cognition' scale, the participants had to indicate how characteristic the following statement applied to themselves. The items were scored on a scale from one to five (1 = Extremely uncharacteristic, 5 = Extremely characteristic). An example of a statement is: "I would prefer complex to simple problems.". For the 'Empathic Concern' scale participants had to indicate to what extent the following statements described them. The items were scored on a scale from one to five (1 = Does not describe me well, 5 = Describes me well). An example of a statement is: "I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me."</p><p>The three dilemmas we used in our study were taken from the pilot study and then adapted to an iterative version. For each of the three dilemmas, the participant responded to a dilemma as a decision-maker. Subsequently, the participant was told that he or she was matched with four other participants. The other persons were indicated by a code which was a random combination of letters and numbers. However, these were fictional individuals whom the participant did not know. The participant and the fictional individual had four answer combinations on the dilemma (Utilitarian, Switch (Deontological-Utilitarian), Switch (Utilitarian -Deontological), Deontologist). Based on the information about the fictional individual they were asked to rate the person on warmth, competence, and trust. The ratings were presented as follows: 'How warm/competent/trustworthy is this person?'. The participants could answer with Not at all, Slightly, Somewhat, Moderately, and Extremely.</p></div>
