			<abstract>
				<p>Metacognition, the ability to monitor and reflect on our own mental states, enables us to assess our performance at different levels-from confidence in individual decisions to overall self-performance estimates (SPEs). It plays a particularly important part in computationally complex decisions that require a high level of cognitive resources, as the allocation of such limited resources presumably is based on metacognitive evaluations. However, little is known about metacognition in complex decisions, in particular, how people construct SPEs. Here, we examined how SPEs are modulated by task difficulty and feedback in cognitively complex economic decision-making, with reference to simple perceptual decision-making. We found that, in both types of decision-making, participants&apos; objective performance was only affected by task difficulty but not by the presence of feedback. In complex economic decision-making, participants had lower SPEs in the absence of feedback (compared to the presence of feedback) in easy trials only but not in hard trials, while in simple perceptual decision-making, SPEs were lower in the absence of feedback in both easy and hard trials. Our findings suggest that people estimate their performance in complex economic decision-making through distinct metacognitive mechanisms for easy and hard instances.</p>

Decision confidence, elicited around the time of an individual choice, can be conceptualized as the subjective probability of success given the available evidence (i.e., Bayesian posterior probability of the chosen option being correct) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> . Previous studies in psychology and neuroscience have focused on the formation of confidence in perceptual <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and knowledge-based decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> .</p><p>Participants in these experiments were asked to indicate their confidence of the correctness of their judgment after each choice. Results showed that self-reported confidence was well captured by the posterior probability of the choice being correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> . Abnormalities in decision confidence are known to be related to psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</p><p>More recent studies in metacognition have examined whether and how human participants aggregate decision confidence in individual choices to form a "global" selfperformance estimate (SPE). SPE is an overall belief about one's skills and capacities to solve a given task. University students, for example, might integrate their performance in different assignments and exams to form an estimate of their overall academic abilities. It plays a key role in shaping our behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> , selecting goals to achieve <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> , and allocating time and resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> . For instance, finding it hard to achieve some objective after multiple attempts, many people will be inclined to stop investing more time or effort in it and turn to pursue another, more achievable goal.</p><p>Rouault and colleagues assessed how SPEs in perceptual decisions are constructed across multiple decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> . They found that the feedback about the correctness of decisions affected SPEs significantly in a simple, perceptual decision-making task.</p><p>Participants underestimated their performance (i.e., had lower SPEs) in the absence of feedback compared to the case with feedback, even though their objective performance in those decisions was not affected by the presence of feedback; that is, absence of feedback is associated with lower SPEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> . Computational modelling further suggests that participants formed the global SPEs by integrating decision confidence of each choice over multiple trials in a Bayesian manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</p><p>Unlike simple perceptual decisions, many decisions we make are computationally hard. Suppose you have to choose the set of items in a supermarket that maximise your satisfaction while sticking to your budget constraint. In a supermarket stocking just 100 items, assuming that you would only pick an item at most once, there are 2 100 combinations of items to choose from, a computationally intractable task. Another example is constructing investment portfolios by picking stocks listed on the market given a budget or risk constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> . There are currently more than 41,000 stocks listed on stock exchanges around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> , which makes building portfolios another intractable task. While this kind of decision is ubiquitous in life, which is reflected in modern choice theories (e.g., utility maximization 29 and satisficing 30 ), it requires individuals to solve intractable, that is, computationally complex, problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> .</p><p>The mathematical framework of computational complexity allows the quantification of computational hardness -or computational resource requirements -of tasks such as decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> . Behavioral studies to date have shown that the level of computational complexity is negatively related to human performance in decisions -the higher the level of computational complexity, that is, the more computational resources are required to compute the optimal course of action, the lower the performance in those decisions, that is, the less likely people are to choose the optimal course of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> . Importantly, the computational complexity of tasks, including decisions, can be quantified without reference to any particular algorithm -it is an objective attribute of a task. Furthermore, computational complexity can be quantified in a domain-general way. That is, the measures of computational complexity are not task-specific. It has been shown that such objective, task-independent measures of computational complexity predict both the extent of cognitive effort exerted on a decision as well as performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> . However, at this point, little is known about 'metacognition' in complex decisions. That is, whether and how humans internally evaluate their own performance in computationally complex decisions remains elusive.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the formation of SPEs in computationally complex economic decisions with reference to that in simple perceptual decisions. In line with previous studies on perceptual decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> , we examined the effects of decision difficulty and the presence/absence of feedback on SPEs. To this end, we conducted a behavioral experiment in which participants solved both a simple, perceptual decision-making task (sample task; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> as well as complex, economic decisionmaking task (knapsack task; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> . The latter is based on the 0-1 knapsack problem, a canonical (NP-complete) constrained optimization computational problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> , in which task difficulty is manipulated by a theoretical measure of computational hardness (i.e., "instance complexity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> ). The knapsack task is closely related conceptually to many daily decisions (e.g., attention allocation, budgeting, task management). The experiment consisted of four different types of blocks ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1e</ref>): two difficulty levels (easy vs. hard) and two feedback conditions (presence vs. absence of feedback). In each block, participants performed 10 trials of a task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1f)</ref>. Crucially, at the end of each block, participants submitted a bid in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> to purchase the right to complete additional 5 trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1c, f)</ref>. Note that, in the additional 5 trials, no feedback was provided, and the difficulty level was the same as in the first 10 trials within the block. The auction procedure allowed us to measure a participant's SPEs in an incentive-compatible manner (see Methods for details). If a participant thought that they could perform well in the additional trials, they should have bid high to secure the chance of attempting the additional trials.</p><p>Participants were also asked to report their performance estimation on a Likert scale at the end of each block <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1d, f</ref>). (e) Block types. For each task, we employed a block-wise two-by-two design with two difficulty levels (easy vs. hard) and two feedback conditions (feedback vs. no-feedback).</p><p>(f) Schedule of a block. Schematic examples of an easy block with feedback (top) and a hard block without feedback (bottom) are shown. In each block, participants performed 10 trials of a decision-making task (sampling or knapsack task) and then bid in the BDM auction to purchase the right to complete additional 5 bonus trials. Note that, in the additional trials, no feedback was provided, and the difficulty level was the same as the first 10 trials within the block.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pilot experiment</head><p>We first conducted a pilot experiment (N = 17) to determine the sample size of the main experiment. In the sampling task, difficulty affected both objective performance (i.e., the proportion of correct choices) and SPEs (i.e., bid value in the BDM auction) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a, b</ref>). As expected, they were lower in hard trials than in easy trials. Moreover, SPEs were lower in the no-feedback condition compared to the feedback condition, although objective performance remained unchanged. We observed a similar pattern of SPEs when considering self-reported performance ratings instead of BDM auction bids ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2c</ref>). Overall, participant behavior in the sampling task was consistent with a previous study based on a similar task 18 .</p><p>In the knapsack task, objective performance was lower in hard trials compared to easy trials but performance was not affected by the presence/absence of feedback ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2d</ref>).</p><p>SPEs were lower in hard trials compared to easy trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2e</ref>). They were also lower in the absence of feedback (compared to the presence of feedback) but only in easy trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.   2e</ref>), which is different to the pattern observed in the sampling task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. The same pattern is present in self-reported performance ratings ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2f</ref>).</p><p>We estimated generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs) of objective performance and SPEs for each task, which we used to compute the sample size of the main experiment <ref type="table">(Tables S1-4)</ref>. We then determined the sample size in the main experiment to ensure a statistical power of at least 0.8 for the effects of interest (N = 36) (see Methods for details).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main experiment: objective performance</head><p>We first examined how objective performance in decisions was affected by difficulty and feedback about correctness of a decision.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main experiment: self-performance estimates</head><p>In the sampling task, SPEs (bid values in the BDM auction at the end of each block) were significantly lower in hard trials compared to easy trials (effect of difficulty: b = -0.044 ± 0.008, Pcorr &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4a, b</ref>; <ref type="table">Table S7</ref>) and in the absence of feedback compared to the presence of feedback (effect of feedback: b = 0.060 ± 0.008, Pcorr &lt; 0.001 ; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4a, b</ref>; <ref type="table">Table   S7</ref>). There was no significant interaction between difficulty and feedback conditions (interaction effect: b = -0.018 ± 0.008, Pcorr = 0.085; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4a, b</ref>; <ref type="table">Table S7</ref>). These findings replicate the results of previous studies <ref type="bibr">18,35 .</ref> In the knapsack task, SPEs were lower in hard compared to easy trials (effect of difficulty: b = -0.077 ± 0.009, Pcorr &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4c, d</ref>; <ref type="table">Table S8</ref>). SPEs were also lower in the absence of feedback compared to the presence of feedback but only in easy trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig.   4c</ref>), indicated by the significant interaction between difficulty and feedback (b = -0.030 ± 0.009, Pcorr = 0.005; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4d</ref>; <ref type="table">Table S8</ref>).</p><p>As a robustness check, we confirmed that our findings in relation to SPEs are robust with regards to the measurement of self-performance.

To this end, we included a factor variable representing the order of the blocks (i.e., 1 for the 1 st block, 2 for the 2 nd block and so on) into our GLMMs. The additional analysis revealed that the main results above were not affected by block order <ref type="table">(Tables S9-12</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study investigated metacognition in computationally complex decision-making.</p><p>Specifically, we examined the effects of task difficulty and the presence of feedback about the correctness of a decision, on the formation of global SPEs when people are making cognitively simple, perceptual and complex, economic decisions (i.e., the sampling and the knapsack tasks, respectively).</p><p>We replicate previous findings about the effects of task difficulty and the presence of feedback in perceptual decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> . In the sampling task, objective performance was lower in harder trials but was not modulated by the presence of feedback <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3a, b</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, SPEs were found to be modulated by both task difficulty and the presence of feedback <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4a, b</ref>): they were lower in harder trials and in the absence of feedback (compared to trials with feedback: i.e., a reduction of SPEs in the absence of feedback).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Most studies of metacognition in perceptual decision-making to date have examined local</head><p>confidence in individual decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> . Only a small number of studies has investigated global SPEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">40</ref> . Our findings thus contribute to the growing literature on the formation of SPEs in perceptual decision-making <ref type="bibr">18,19,35 .</ref> In the knapsack task, a complex economic decision-making task, we found that objective performance was modulated by task difficulty, defined based on a theoretical measure of computational hardness (instance complexity) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3c, d</ref>). This finding is consistent with findings about the effects of instance complexity on performance demonstrated by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> . The present study thus contributes to the growing literature highlighting the importance of formal measures of computational complexity as a predictor of human performance in complex decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> .</p><p>Similar effects of the theoretical measure of computational hardness were found on SPEs in the knapsack task. Specifically, we demonstrated that SPEs were lower in harder trials, that is, trials with lower instance complexity (instance complexity is inversely correlated with computational hardness <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> ) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4c, d</ref>). This result indicates that participants were able to sense task difficulty while evaluating the quality of their complex decisions, even though the difficulty level was not explicitly indicated to them in the experiment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that people are capable of internally evaluating their own performance in computationally complex decisions, similar to perceptual decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> , knowledge-based judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> , motor control <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> , and memory retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> .</p><p>Moreover, we show that in complex decisions, feedback modulates SPEs differently in easy and hard trials ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4c, d)</ref>. In easy trials, participants displayed lower SPEs in the absence of feedback compared to the presence of feedback. This pattern of SPEs in easy trials is consistent with the genuine reduction of SPEs in the absence of feedback observed in the sampling task <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> , despite the substantial differences between cognitive burden required for solving the sampling (i.e., counting dots and computing the difference) and knapsack (i.e., combinatorial optimisation) tasks. Strikingly, one previous study of perceptual decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> suggests such a pattern of SPE may result from a metacognitive process in which people integrate information about feedback (that is, in the presence of feedback) and decision confidence (in the absence of feedback) over multiple trials in a Bayesian manner.</p><p>In hard trials, on the other hand, we didn't observe any modulation of SPEs by feedback ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4c)</ref>. Both in the presence and absence of feedback, participants displayed low SPEs around the chance level (i.e., 0.5) even though objective performance was above chance level <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3c</ref>). This pattern cannot be explained by the same kind of Bayesian integration 18 that can account for pattern of SPEs observed in easy trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4c</ref>) and in the sampling task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4a)</ref> Our study has several limitations. First, we only collected a limited number of SPEs (i.e., two data points per condition and task), due to the relatively long duration of a trial in the knapsack task (approximately 30 seconds). This makes it difficult to implement advanced data analyses (e.g., computational model fitting) to further elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying the formation of SPEs. Second, the current study used the knapsack decision problem as a representative of computationally intractable problems.</p><p>However, it remains an open question whether the results we found here are generalizable to other computationally intractable problems. To explore this question, future studies should test the generalizability of the patters of SPEs found in the knapsack decision task to other NP-complete problems such as Boolean satisfiability problem (K-SAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> and the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> . Lastly, the attribution of differences between SPEs of two types of decision-making in the current study needs further investigation. The difference between the two types of tasks may not simply be limited to computational difficulty, but also to perceptual uncertainty, as the stimuli in the perceptual task were only flashed on the screen briefly, while in the knapsack task, they were much longer.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides insights into metacognition in complex decisionmaking by examining the effects of task difficulty and feedback on global SPEs in a computationally hard task. In contrast to perceptual decisions, our findings suggest that people estimate their global performance in complex decisions through distinct metacognitive mechanisms for easy and hard instances. We believe that the current study is the first step towards a comprehensive understanding of how humans learn about their own performance when making complex decisions.</p></div>

The factorial design resulted in four types of blocks ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1d)</ref>: easy-feedback, easy-no feedback, hard-feedback, hard-no feedback. Each combination of the four block types and the two decision-making tasks was presented twice in the 16 blocks of the experiment in a random order.</p><p>In each block, participants solved 10 trials of the same level of difficulty <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1f)</ref>. After that, they were instructed to indicate their willingness to pay to earn the chance of attempting an additional 5 trials of the same level of difficulty as the preceding 10 trials in the same block using a Becker-DeGroot-Marschke (BDM) auction <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1c)</ref>.

The difficulty of the decision was modulated by the adjusting the difference in number of dots in the two boxes (the differences were 46 and 18 dots in easy and hard trials, respectively). Each trial started with a fixation cross displayed at the centre of the screen (1.2s). On the subsequent screen, two black boxes containing a different number of white dots were briefly flashed (300ms). Participants had 3s to indicate which of the two boxes they thought contained the larger number of dots.</p><p>Knapsack task. Participants solved 80 trials of the 0-1 knapsack decision problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.   1b</ref>). Each trial started with a screen displaying a fixation cross at the centre (1.2s). On the next screen, six items were presented at random locations. Each item has two attributes: a value and a weight. Item values (in dollars) were indicated with dollar bills, and item weights (in kilograms) were indicated with a black weight symbol. The size of both the dollar bills and the weight symbols were proportional to the value and weight, respectively, they indicated.</p><p>The weight limit (capacity) of the knapsack in kilograms and the target profit in dollars were displayed inside a green circle at the centre of the screen, and the green circle indicated the time remaining in the trial (maximum of 25s). Participants were asked to indicate whether there exists a subset of items whose total weight does not exceed the capacity, while the total of value is at least as high as the target profit. Once participants had solved the instance, the indicated their response ("YES" or "NO") by pressing a corresponding button on the keyboard (maximum of 3s).</p><p>Following previous studies 34 , we defined the difficulty of each trial in terms of 'instance complexity' (IC): the distance between the target profit and the maximum profit attainable in the corresponding instance of the optimization variant of the 0-1 knapsack problem. Note that IC is inversely correlated with computational hardness, which means a lower value of IC corresponds to a higher level of computational hardness. Specifically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= &amp; − * ∑ " &amp;</formula><p>where is the target profit of the problem, * is the maximum profit achievable in the corresponding optimization instance (i.e. the highest total value of a knapsack achievable with the given set of items and the given weight constraints), and " denotes the values of ith item. The values of IC were 0.16 and 0.01 in easy and hard trials, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-performance estimates (SPE)</head><p>. At the end of each block, participants were asked to indicate their SPEs in two ways: a bid in a BDM auction, and a self-reported rating on a Likert scale. After finishing 10 trials in a block, a participant was endowed with A$1 and made a bid for the chance of attempting an additional 5 trials. These additional 5 trials were of the same difficulty level as the first 10 trials within the preceding block. A participant was rewarded with A$0.2 for each correct decision. In each BDM auction, a counter-bid was drawn randomly from the range A$0-A$1. If the participant's bidding value was equal or greater than the counter-bid, the participant paid the counter-bid and could attempt an additional 5 trials. Otherwise, the participants kept the initial endowment of A$1 and left the block. This auction mechanism is incentive-compatible in the sense that the optimal strategy for a participant is to always bid the number closest to their true belief about the proportion of additional trials they thought they could solve correctly (i.e., SPE; See Text S1). Participants were explicitly instructed in the optimal strategy, and using a questionnaire, we confirmed that they correctly understood it. Participants were also asked to report their selfperformance directly. Specifically, a participant was asked to indicate on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = none of them, 5 = all of them) of how many additional trials they thought they could solve correctly. The order of the BDM auction and the Likert rating was randomized across blocks and participants.</p></div>

We examined the effects of difficulty and feedback on trial-by-trial objective performance (i.e., mean percent correct) and block-by-block SPEs (i.e., BDM bid value) using generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs). We modelled objective performance as follows: logit P(correct) ~ 1 + D + F + D x F + (1 | participants) (see <ref type="table">Tables   S1 and S3</ref>). Here, P(correct) was coded as 1 if the participant chose the correct option and 0 otherwise.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>. Instead, the pattern of SPEs observed in hard trials can potentially be explained by metacognitive control of cognitive resources. When participants are making hard decisions, a larger proportion of their (limited) cognitive resources is allocated to the decision-making process, leaving little or no resources to other metacognitive and other cognitive processes. In this case, not enough resources are allocated to paying attention to or memorizing feedback (in the presence of feedback) and decision confidence (in the absence of feedback), leading to the failure of incorporating such information into estimates of global self-performance. As a result, participants exhibited low SPEs, around chance level, in hard trials regardless of the presence or absence of feedback. Those findings suggest that distinct cognitive mechanisms may be involved in the estimation of global selfperformance in easy and hard problems in computationally complex decision-making. Future work is needed to examine this conjecture in more details.</figDesc></figure>
