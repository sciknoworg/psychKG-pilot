<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high</head><p>There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.</p><p>Everyone knows "Over the Rainbow," the song made famous by a young Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz. The song was intended to take viewers to an imagined fantasy landa place of yearning and hope, distant, abstract, and hypothetical. Importantly, the song was performed at quite a slow tempo (around 72 beats per minute <ref type="bibr">(NoteDiscover, n.d.)</ref>. Now imagine listening to Judy Garland singing her song at a much faster tempo. Would you still be carried on the wings of the song to a distant and abstract place? Probably not. Judy Garland's original "Over the Rainbow" invites the listener to transcend the here and now; to travel along a pivotal organizing dimension of conscious experiencethat of psychological distance. This is a process we engage in every time we think of a future plan, hear news about a distant location, take the perspective of a friend, or simulate what might have been. Critically, ample evidence suggests that this mental travel is enabled by shifts in the level at which we construe the involved objects and events <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Liberman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The attempt to map elements of conscious experience, their connections and interactions, has occupied experimental psychologists for generations. Structural psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Titchener, 1909)</ref>, the study of semantic space and meaning dimensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Osgood &amp; Suci, 1955)</ref>, and the conceptual metaphor approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Landau et al., 2010)</ref> all reflect an endeavor to better understand the structure of the mind and of human experience. In the spirit of this endeavor we examine the as-yet unstudied possibility that both psychological distance and its representational counterpartconstrual levelare associated with another central dimension of consciousness: that of stimulus speed. We further propose that these associations exert subtle effects on subjective experience and may hold implications for domains as varied as communication, person perception, decision making, behavioral intentions, negotiation, urban design and more.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Distance and Construal Level</head><p>A critical attribute of objects and events in our world is that they vary with respect to how close or distant they are from the "point of direct experience" -i.e., one's own self in the here and now <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Liberman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010, p. 440)</ref>. Psychological distance is the subjective experience of the extent to which objects are removed from this zero-distance point. Objects can be removed in space (near versus far); time (close versus removed in the future or the past); the social dimension (applying to someone more versus less known to us, or more versus less similar to us); and hypotheticality (real or likely versus imaginary or unlikely).</p><p>An object's psychological distance affects its subjective meaning and its potential implications for the self here and now. Indeed, whether something is real or hypothetical, as well as how distant it is from us in space, time, and social perspective, is of utmost importance for functioning and survival. It can determine whether the object poses a risk to us, whether and to what extent we can benefit from it, whether and how we should prepare to act on it, whether and how we can appropriate it, how much information we have about it, and much more.</p><p>This centrality of psychological distance is reflected in studies of the semantic space.</p><p>In their efforts to measure meaning, <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Osgood and Suci (1955)</ref> identified three culturally universal factors that define the semantic space, each capturing to a greater or lesser degree physical attributes and subjective perceptionsevaluation (i.e., good-bad), potency (e.g., strong-weak), and activity (e.g., active-passive). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bentler and LaVoie (1972)</ref> expanded this list to include seven dimensions, adding density (e.g., many-few), orderliness (e.g., constantchangeable), familiarity (e.g., common-rare), and reality (or, as we might say, hypotheticality e.g., imaginary-real, abstract-concrete). Similarly reflecting its centrality, psychological distance is accessed automatically, even when extracting such information is not one of a person's explicit current goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bar-Anan et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Construal level theory (CLT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010)</ref> suggests, and extensive empirical evidence establishes, that the four dimensions of psychological distance are interrelated, such that psychological distance forms one integral dimension of subjective experience. Indeed, thinking about distant places (spatial distance) invokes the distant rather than the near future (temporal distance), other people rather than oneself (social distance), and unlikely rather than likely events (hypotheticality) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Fiedler et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bar-Anan et al. (2007)</ref> showed that participants respond faster to words connoting psychological proximity (e.g., "tomorrow," "friend") when these are presented at a proximal point in an image of a landscape compared with a distal point, whereas the reverse is true for words connoting psychological distance (e.g., "year," "enemy").</p><p>CLT further proposes that people engage with the world that lies beyond the here and now by using abstraction to represent objects that are more psychologically distant. It is assumed that high-level construals (e.g., abstract categories, high-level goals) suit better the representation of psychologically distant stimuli because they are more likely than low-level construals (e.g., concrete exemplars, low-level goals) to remain unchanged as one gets closer to an object or farther away. Thus, while psychological distance is the subjective experience of the extent to which objects are removed from the point of direct experience, construal level refers to how objects are represented in our mind.</p><p>Ample evidence supports the association between psychological distance and construal level <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gamoran et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Liberman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sodeberg et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Wakslak &amp; Trope, 2009)</ref>. For example, in an implicit association task, participants were faster to respond in trials where high-level stimuli (e.g., animals) were paired with psychologically distant stimuli (e.g., a year) and low-level stimuli (e.g., poodle) were paired with psychologically close stimuli (e.g., soon) compared with the reverse. This finding held for all four dimensions of psychological distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bar-Anan et al., 2006)</ref>. The present research adds to the well-established link between construal level and psychological distance by showing that both also have predictable associations with a seemingly unrelated dimension speed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Speed</head><p>Just as all stimuli can be described in terms of their spatial distance from a target, all stimuli can be described in terms of their speed (even if this speed is zero). In turn, the mind has evolved to perceive and assess this characteristic. This makes sense, given that an object's speedthe speed of an approaching car, a slamming door, a prey animal bolting awaycan have huge implications. Together with an object's spatial distance, its speed is critical in determining the specific defensive behavior that it activates <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Fanselow, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Maren, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Mobbs et al., 2007)</ref>. The high loading of the fast-slow scale on the "activity" factor described above <ref type="bibr">(.70;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Osgood &amp; Suci, 1955)</ref> reflects the centrality of speed as a dimension of meaning.</p><p>Despite its great importance as a meaning dimension, speed has attracted scarce research attention. In a notable exception, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ben-Haim et al. (2015)</ref> found that much like valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bargh et al., 1996)</ref> and psychological distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bar-Anan et al. 2007)</ref>, the speed of an object is automatically extracted even when this information is completely irrelevant to the task at hand. Specifically, participants were faster both to name pictures of objects characterized by high velocity (e.g., a rocket) and to read words naming such objects compared with objects characterized by slow velocity (e.g., a wheelchair). The same pattern emerged when an object's apparent velocity was manipulated through context. For example, a car depicted driving downhill was named more quickly than a car shown driving uphill (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Matlock, 2004</ref>, for related findings).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Speed, Spatial Distance, Psychological Distance, and Construal Level</head><p>Thus far, we have seen that the different dimensions of psychological distance (spatial, temporal, social, and hypothetical) map onto each other, as do psychological distance and construal level. We have also seen that both psychological distance and speed are accessed automatically even when extracting this information is not one of a person's conscious goals.</p><p>Here we probe into whether and how the speed dimension of meaning is associated in the mind with psychological distance and construal level.</p><p>In CLT, one way to explain the relation between psychological distance and abstraction is based on logical-functional principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Gilead et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gilead et al., , 2021</ref>. Similar logical-functional principles suggest a relation between speed and both psychological distance and abstraction. First, other things being equal, spatially distant objects take longer to affect us, and in that sense are slower to affect us. All else being equal, a pizza delivered from the other side of town (vs. from a nearby restaurant) will take longer to satiate our hunger, and in that sense has a slower effect. Similarly, a snake two meters away could bite us sooner (and thus "faster") than a snake two blocks away. Thus, the spatial distance of a stimulus and the speed with which it affects the self here and now are logically associated. Second, other things being equal, slower objects will necessarily affect us later in time. For example, a slowly moving car heading our way will hit us later than a fast-moving car. Thus, speed and temporal distance are logically associated. Because the other two dimensions of psychological distancesocial distance and hypothetical distanceare associated (in reality and in our minds) with spatial distance and temporal distance and are automatically activated by them, a stimulus's speed may very well be associated with psychological distance more generally. We thus hypothesize an association between the speed of a stimulus and its psychological distance, such that what is psychologically distant is "slow," and what is psychologically close is "fast" (Hypothesis 1).</p><p>Speed and level of construal are also logically related, for the same reason that, according to CLT, the latter is associated with psychological distance. Specifically, low-level features, being specific, secondary, and context-dependent, change faster across time, space, social worlds, and hypothetical worlds. High-level features, in contrast, being general, primary, and context-independent, change more slowly (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gilead et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hansen &amp; Trope, 2013)</ref>. Indeed, in CLT high-level construals are assumed to "smooth out" low-level, local, and idiosyncratic variation, rendering the representation of an object more stable across distance . For example, personality characteristics or the function of a tool change more slowly than specific behaviors or a tool's appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Note that speed of change is related to but not identical with speed of motion. In the language of calculus, speed of change is the first derivative of any quantity as a function of time, such that a speed of zero implies no change. The change involved may relate to the position of an object relative to other objects, as in the case of motion (e.g., the speed of an approaching car, or of floating dots on a screen), but it may also be a change in some other quality of an object, as when things grow, or when a situation develops. In that sense, "speed of change" is the more general construct, of which "speed of motion" is a specific case, in which the change in question is a change in location relative to other objects or to a reference point.</p><p>We thus further hypothesize an association between the speed of a stimulus and its construal level, such that what is abstract (a high construal level) is "slow" and what is concrete (a low construal level) is "fast" (Hypothesis 2).</p><p>The hypothesized associations are also consistent with a cognitive-ecological approach to cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Fiedler, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Fiedler, , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Pleskac &amp; Hertwig, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">and see also Brunswik, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Gigerenzer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Lewin, 1951)</ref>. This approach suggests that "in order to understand intrapsychic processes within the human mind, it is necessary to analyze the structure and constraints of the stimulus environment impinging on the mind" <ref type="bibr">(Fiedler, 2014, p. 659)</ref>. In other words, the structure of the feedback from our interaction with the environment shapes what we learn.</p><p>One inevitable regularity of our interaction with the environment is that as objects move relative to us, images of stimuli that are farther away from us move more slowly on the retina. This very basic association between a stimulus's speed and its distance serves as a pivotal cue of depth perception, called motion parallax <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Gibson, 1950)</ref>: what moves faster on the retina is closer, what moves slower on the retina is further away. As succinctly put by Helmholtz: "The apparent angular velocities of objects in the field of view will be inversely proportional to their real distances away; and consequently safe conclusions can be drawn as to the real distance of the body" <ref type="bibr">(Helmholtz, 1925, p. 295)</ref>. Thus, spatial distance and speed are interrelated in our experience.</p><p>The mental association between the spatial distance of a stimulus and the speed with which it may affect the self obviously serves an important survival function. This explains the well-established relationship between a stimulus's spatial distance, its position in the visual field, and the speed of our response to it. Spatially close stimuli are prevalent in the lower visual field, below eye level, whereas spatially distant stimuli are prevalent in the upper visual field, above eye level. Importantly, people generally respond more quickly to stimuli in the lower part of the visual field compared with the upper part <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Previc, 1990)</ref>. A related finding is that spatial distance from a threatening stimulus affects our choice of behavioral strategy, and specifically whether we deploy a slower, more complex avoidance strategy or a fast, reflexive one (fight/flight). Perceiving a more distant threatening stimulus activates the prefrontal cortex, which regulates slower, more complex planning. As the threatening stimulus gets closer, regions in the midbrain (the central amygdala and periaqueductal gray) which regulate fast, reflexive behaviors (fight or flight) gain control <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Maren, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Mobbs et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>From the perspective of the cognitive ecological approach, these built-in associations in our interaction with the environment between spatial distance and speed give rise to an association between these two dimensions of meaning. As noted before, distance on other dimensions (temporal, social, and hypothetical) as well as level of construal are associated in our experience with more spatial distance and are automatically activated by it. Given that spatial distance is repeatedly coupled in our experience with speed, it should then follow that from the perspective of cognitive ecological approach, too, <ref type="formula">1</ref>what is psychologically distant is "slow," and what is psychologically close is "fast" (Hypothesis 1); and <ref type="formula">2</ref>what is abstract (a high construal level) is "slow," and what is concrete (a low construal level) is "fast" (Hypothesis 2).</p><p>Finally, it may be tempting to view the hypothesized associations between speed, psychological distance, and construal level as of purely theoretical interest. We argue here that in fact, the hypothesized associations have many practical ramifications and empirically examine their implications in two domains: communication and person perception.</p><p>Specifically, we propose that changes in the speed of speech may affect aspects of the perceived relationship between speaker and audience and the perceived regulatory scope of the speaker, with faster-paced speech perceived as contracting both aspects of the relationship with the audience (Hypothesis 3) and the speaker's perceived regulatory scope (Hypothesis 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Research</head><p>The current research consists of twelve studies in three study sets. Study Set I examines the hypothesized association between speed and psychological distance. If indeed this association exists, it may result in (at least) four kinds of effects: an implicit association between the two dimensions (Hypothesis 1a), an experienced compatibility between the two (Hypothesis 1b), an effect of stimulus psychological distance on its perceived speed (Hypothesis 1c), and conversely, an effect of stimulus speed on its perceived psychological distance (Hypothesis 1d). These hypotheses were examined in four studies. Study 1 tested whether people implicitly associate psychological distance and speed, and whether people experience compatibility between the dimensions as reflected in an explicit association between them (H1a, H1b). Study 2 examined whether participants' preferences reflect an experienced compatibility between dissimilar (psychologically distant) words and slow music and between similar (psychologically close) words and fast music (H1b). Study 3 examined the effect of psychological distance on perceived speed, testing whether people conceive the pace of life in psychologically distant places as slow and in psychologically near places as fast (H1c). Study 4 considered the converse effect, testing whether people experience acts performed slowly as more imaginary and less real than acts performed quickly (H1d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Set II examines the hypothesized association between speed and construal level.</head><p>This association may result in (at least) five kinds of effects: an implicit association between the two dimensions (Hypothesis 2a), an experienced compatibility between the two (Hypothesis 2b), a compatibility in their appearance in natural language (Hypothesis 2c), an effect of stimulus construal level on its speed (Hypothesis 2d), and an effect of stimulus speed on its preferred construal level (Hypothesis 2e). To examine these hypotheses, we ran five studies. Study 5 was similar to Study 1, but with construal level instead of psychological distance (H2a, H2b). Study 6 empirically examined whether participants' preferences reflect an experienced compatibility between abstract words and slow music and between concrete words and fast music (H2b). In Study we examined whether the hypothesized association between abstractness and speed is supported by the structure of word distribution in natural language (H2c). Study 8 examined the effect of construal level on speed, testing whether situations characterized by more abstract verbs are perceived as slower to change (H2d).</p><p>Study 9 examined the effect of speed on construal level, testing whether actions imagined as performed slowly are construed at a higher level (in terms of goals rather than means) compared with actions imagined as performed quickly (H2e).</p><p>Finally, Study Set III examines implications of the hypothesized associations between speed, psychological distance, and construal level for the domains of communication (Hypothesis 3) and person perception (Hypothesis 4). In Study 10a we examined whether the speed of recorded messages is associated with the perceived spatial distance between the speaker and her audience (H3a), with the perceived social distance between the speaker and her audience (H3b), and with perceived audience size (H3c). Study 10b extends the results of Study 10a to spoken messages in a foreign language. In Study 11 we examined whether people infer an expansive regulatory scope from slow-paced spoken speech, and a contractive regulatory scope from fast-paced speech (H4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Methodology</head><p>All the studies but four (Studies 1, 5, 7, and 8) were conducted in Hebrew. Participants were Hebrew-speaking Israeli university students and graduates aged 18-40 with no learning disabilities. They were recruited via one of two Israeli platforms (Panel4All and Hamidgam), and were instructed to complete the study in a quiet place from beginning to end with no breaks. The studies were presented to participants as focusing on intuitive information processing. Participants were encouraged to follow their gut feelings. Participants were allocated randomly to experimental conditions and to versions of the studies. IRB approval and protocol number -3470.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency and Openness</head><p>Preregistration. Eleven of the 12 reported studies (all but Study 7) were preregistered (designs, hypotheses and analysis plans). Links to all preregistrations are available in the Electronic Supplementary Materials (ESM). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Sample Size. Sample sizes for all studies were determined a-priori based on power analyses conducted using G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Faul et al., 2013)</ref>. In Studies 2, <ref type="bibr">3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10a, 10b and 11</ref>, we assumed either a small-to-medium or a medium effect (d = 0.3-0.5, η 2 p = .06) in a two-tailed test. The analyses suggested we should recruit 88-128 participants to achieve 80%</p><p>power. As we ran the studies in noisy conditions (online), we aimed to recruit additional 20-30 participants for each study. We therefore collected data from 108-150 respondents in each study. Computations of sample sizes for Studies 1 and 5 are described in their respective Participants sections.</p><p>Exclusions. In all studies except two (Studies 1 and 5) we excluded participants based on any of four criteria: taking excessive amounts of time to complete the study (over an hour and more than 3 SDs longer than the mean completion time); showing zero variance on the DV; failure to follow instructions; and reporting technical issues. In Studies 2 and 6 we also considered excluding participants on the basis of extreme difficulty or lack of enjoyment with the experimental task, because of the risk that these participants might have had trouble relying on their gut feelings. However, none of our participants reported extreme levels on these variables, and we made no exclusions based on these criteria. In Studies 10b and 11, which used stimuli in Finnish to create the experience of hearing a foreign language, we also excluded participants who reported knowing Finnish or understanding any of the message.</p><p>These exclusion criteria were preregistered.</p><p>Data availability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Implicit and Explicit Associations Between Psychological Distance and Speed</head><p>This study examines whether people implicitly associate words or phrases conveying psychological distance (e.g., "in 10 years," "in a distant land") with words conveying the concept slow (e.g., "slowness," "slower"), and words conveying psychological proximity (e.g., "this evening," "next door") with words conveying the concept fast (e.g., "speedy,"</p><p>"rapid"). To measure an implicit association between the two dimensions, participants completed a sorting paired features task (SPF; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bar-Anan et al., 2009)</ref>. The study further examined whether people experience compatibility between the dimensions by measuring explicit associations between the two sets of concepts using visual analog scales (VAS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. Participants were recruited from Project Implicit's participant pool (http://implicit.harvard.edu; <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Nosek, 2005)</ref>. Because this was the first study to test for the hypothesized effects, we sought to maximize the odds of detecting a small-to-medium effect Implicit Association Measure. In the SPF, participants categorized pairs of words or phrases (e.g., "Far, far away" + "Slowly") into one of four pairs of categories (Far+Slow, Far+Fast, Near+Slow, Near+Fast) in three blocks of 40 trials (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). Each pair included one of four words or phrases representing psychological distance ("in 10 years," "far, far away," "once upon a time," "in a distant land") or psychological proximity ("right here,"</p><p>"right now," "next door," "next evening") and one of four words representing slowness ("slow," "slower," "slowness," "slowly") or speed ("fast," "rapid," "quick," "speedy"). Faster response times for categorizing pairs of words or phrases from one category pair (e.g., Far+Slow) compared to another (e.g., Far+Fast) can be interpreted as indicating stronger associations for the former than for the latter.</p><p>Following standard procedure for computing scores for the SPF (Bar-Anan et al., 2009), we examined whether participants showed stronger implicit associations between word pairs that matched the combinations Far+Slow and Near+Fast over pairs that matched</p><p>Far+Fast and Near+Slow. Specifically, we first computed the difference between average response latency in trials where the target pairs matched either of the combinations Far+Slow or Near+Fast, and that in trials where the match was to Far+Fast or Near+Slow. This difference was computed for each of the three SPF blocks, then divided by the overall standard deviation of that block to produce that block's SPF D score. The average of the three SPF D scores (one for each block) was the overall SPF D score, used as the measure of implicit associations. Positive SPF D scores indicated stronger associations for the combinations which were congruent with the hypothesis (Far+Slow and Near+Fast) than for the incongruent combinations (Far+Fast and Near+Slow).</p><p>In the SPF, each of the four category combinations is located in the corner of a square, such that the categories belonging to one dimension are separated vertically and those belonging to the other dimension are separated horizontally (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). In this study, combinations containing the category Far were always positioned in the two top corners of the square, and combinations containing Near in the bottom corners, so as to avoid conflict with the natural appearance of physically close stimuli in the lower visual field and of distant stimuli in the upper visual field <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bruno &amp; Cutting, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Cutting &amp; Vishton, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Previc, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Previc, , 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Previc et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Yonas et al., 2002)</ref>. We manipulated between participants whether the categories Slow and Fast appeared in the left-or right-hand corners. The E and C keys were used to indicate the upper and lower left corners, respectively, and the I and N keys the upper and lower right corners. Participants were asked to put their left middle and index fingers on the E and C keys, and their right middle and index fingers on the I and N keys.  Explicit Association Measure. Following the SPF, participants completed one of two self-report questionnaires. Half the participants were given each of the eight words or phrases used for psychological distance and psychological proximity in the SPF task, and were asked to indicate for each one whether they associated it more with the concept Slow or the concept indicating stronger associations between psychological distance and Slow and between psychological proximity and Fast than the reverse. We also examined whether the effect on the SPF scores depends on the positioning of the two speed concepts (i.e., whether Slow was to the left or the right; this analysis was not preregistered).  Associations with Distance. For those questionnaires where participants were asked to associate the speed words with psychological distance versus proximity, we submitted the average reported associations (detailed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>) to a 2 (speed: Slow, Fast) x 2 (concept on the left of the VAS: Far, Near) mixed ANOVA. The results can be found in the lower panel of was on the left size of the VAS than when it was on the right, F(1, 127) = 9.14, p = . 003, η 2 p = .07, 95% CI [0.01, 0.16]. There was no significant interaction, F(1, 127) = 1.42, p = . 234, η 2 p = .01, 95% CI [0.00, 0.07]. Thus, the results indicate that participants explicitly associate slowness more than speed with the category Far (rather than Near).</p><p>In sum, the results of Study 1 support Hypothesis 1a, suggesting that people automatically associate psychological distance (far vs. near) with speed (slow vs. fast). They further support Hypothesis 1b, suggesting that people experience a compatibility between the dimensions: participants explicitly associated words and phrases reflecting psychological distance (rather than proximity) with the concept "slow" (rather than "fast"), and they consciously associated words reflecting slowness with psychological distance.</p><p>Note that in this study, psychological distance was represented only by its spatial and temporal dimensions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. One hundred twenty-four participants (80 females, Mage = 27.52, SD = 4.33) participated in the study (see the description of the sample pool under "The Current Research" above). Three were excluded based on preregistered criteria (details in the ESM under Exclusion of Participants). This left a final sample of 121 participants.</p><p>Materials and Procedure. Participants were asked to imagine two pieces of music, first a slow passage and then a fast one. They were then told that their task would be to choose which of the two categories of music (slow or fast) is a better fit for songs on different themes. In each trial, participants were presented with two boxes, one labeled "slow music" and the other labeled "fast music," along with a pair of wordsallegedly the themes of two songs. They were asked to match each of the two words to the type of music that suits it better by dragging and dropping them into the appropriate box (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>). Participants were assured that there were no right or wrong answers in this task and were encouraged to follow their gut feelings. Participants were presented with pairs of words, comprising three pairs for each of the four dimensions of psychological distance (spatial, temporal, social, and hypotheticality).</p><p>In each pair, one word connoted psychological distance (e.g., "there," "later," "theirs,"</p><p>"imaginary") and the other psychological proximity (e.g., "here," "now," "ours," "real"). The two words in each pair had the same number of syllables. The two words were presented sideby-side to the right of the two boxes, midway up, with their order randomly determined. The position of the "slow music" box to the left or to the right of the "fast music" box was counterbalanced across participants in two versions of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The proportion of pairs placed in congruence with the hypothesis was 0.78 (SD = 0.22). A t-test comparing this proportion with the constant 0.5 yielded a significant difference, t(120) = 13.78, p &lt; .0001, d = 1.25, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[1.01, 1.49]</ref>. We also examined the effect separately for each of the experimental versions and for each of the four dimensions of psychological distance (this analysis was not preregistered). The effect did not vary across experimental versions (M =0.78, SD = 0.21, with the "fast music" box on the right; M =0.78, SD =0.23, with the "slow music" box on the right, t &lt; 1). Furthermore, the effect emerged for each of the four dimensions of psychological distance: spatial, t(120) = 7.83, p &lt; . versus proximity are experienced as compatible with slowness versus speed, respectively.</p></div>

Participants read that there are places where the pace of life is slow and everything seems to move slowly, and others where the pace of life is fast and everything seems to move quickly. They were then asked to take a moment to think about a place which is very distant from (close to) where they are now. Next, they were asked to imagine the pace of life in that distant (close) place and to indicate it on a 175 mm slider anchored at "very slow" on the left and "very fast" on the right. Distance from the left end of the slider (1-100) served as the dependent variable (higher numbers indicate a faster pace of life). As a manipulation check we asked participants how close by or far away they imagined the place to be on a scale from 1 (very close) to 7 (very far).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>As hypothesized <ref type="formula">(</ref> A possible concern is that asking participants to call to mind a "distant" place prompted them to think of a rural locale, and that this artifact rather than psychological distance per se underlies the result. Future research may ask participants who live close to or far from the selfsame place to consider its pace of life (while controlling for the pace of life in participants' own place of residence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4: The Effect of Speed on Psychological Distance</head><p>If indeed psychological distance and speed are associated, then the speed of a stimulus may affect its psychological distance (Hypothesis 1d; for a similar rationale see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Cian et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Nussinson et al., 2019;</ref>. The hypotheticality dimension of psychological distance has two aspectsthe likelihood that a certain event will happen, and the degree to which a certain object or event is real vs. unreal or imaginary <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bar-Anan et al., 2006)</ref>. This study focuses on the latter. We asked participants to visualize a certain behavior being performed slowly or fast, and then to rate how imaginary or real they perceived it to be. We hypothesized that participants would perceive behaviors performed slowly as more imaginary (less real) than behaviors performed quickly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. One hundred and twenty participants (87 females, Mage = 29.23, SD = 4.56) took part in the study. Seven were excluded based on preregistered criteria (details in the ESM). Thus, the analyzed sample had participants.</p><p>Materials and Procedure. Participants read that there are moments and situations in life where everything happens fast, and other moments and situations where everything happens slowly. For each of 20 common behaviors expressed in a few words (borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vallacher &amp; Wegner, 1989</ref>; e.g., opening a door) participants were asked to picture it happening either slowly or quickly. Their task was to indicate how imaginary versus real they experienced the behavior to be. They were asked to indicate their judgment on a 175 mm slider from "real" on the left to "imaginary" on the right. Distance from the left end of the slider (1-100) served as the dependent variable (lower numbers indicate greater perceived reality).</p><p>To strengthen the speed manipulation, participants were presented at the start of each trial with an animation in which colorful dots were seen floating inside a rectangle (480px X 320px) either slowly or quickly. They were told that the moving dots simulated the speed at which they should imagine the following action being performed. The speed at which each action was to be imagined was counterbalanced across the two versions of the experiment. To ensure the robustness of the manipulation, after reading the instructions participants were shown the two versions of the animation and were asked to indicate in which one the dots were moving slowly. Finally, as a manipulation check, at the end of the study participants were asked to rate the speed of the fast-moving and slow-moving dots on a scale from 1 (very slow) to 7 (very fast). Analysis of participants' ratings (not preregistered) yielded a strong and significant effect (see ESM-Study4-AnalysisOfManipulationCheck).</p><p>Note that in both conditions participants were asked to imagine a behavior being performed, and then rate the degree to which they thought of the behavior as occurring in reality versus in the realm of the imagination. To ensure that participants' ratings on the perceived reality-imagination scale did indeed reflect variation on the hypotheticality dimension, we conducted an auxiliary study, in which we asked 42 participants to imagine having dinner with a person of their choice, then to write a few sentences describing the dinner, and finally to rate the scene they had imagined on the reality-imagination scale (the same scale that we use in the current study). Participants were then asked to describe the extent to which the imagined scene was dim or sharp, vague or vivid, sketchy or detailed, and whether it was in black and white or in color, all on scales from 1 to 7. These four items were borrowed from the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Johnson et al., 1988)</ref>. Participants</p><p>were further asked to answer seven questions aimed at assessing their psychological distance from the event and its level of construal: the degree to which (1) they served in the imagined event as observer or participant;</p><p>(2) the general character of the event was vague or vivid; the scene's imagined location was (3) blurry or clear, (4) distant or close, and (5) unknown or familiar; (6) the imagined event could take place only in the distant future or in the very near future; and (7) the person imagined in the scene was socially distant (someone they barely knew) or socially close (a family member or close friend). Participants indicated their ratings on a scale from 1 to 7. The 11 items were highly correlated (Cronbach's α = .861).</p><p>Importantly, an index combining these items positively and substantially correlated with the reality-imagination ratings of the dinner, r(40) = .579, p = .001. It thus seems that the perceived reality-imagination ratings provided by participants can indeed reflect variation on the hypotheticality dimension (see ESM-Study 4-Validation of DV-DATA and Code).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Some behaviors (e.g., brushing one's teeth) were rated as more real than others (e.g., climbing a tree). To take out this irrelevant source of variance, participants' ratings for each behavior were normalized across versions (this part of data preparation was not preregistered).</p><p>To test Hypothesis 1d, we conducted a (speed: Slow vs. Fast) X 2 (version: 1 vs. 2) mixed</p><p>ANOVA with the first variable as a within-participants factor and the second as a betweenparticipants factor. As hypothesized, we found an effect of speed on the perceived reality of the behavior, F(1, 111) = 32.04, p &lt; .0001, η 2 p = .22, 95% CI [0.10, 0.35]. Behaviors visualized as performed quickly were perceived as more real (M = -0.17, SD = 0.45) than those visualized as performed slowly (M = 0.17, SD = 0.53). This effect did not depend on the version of the questionnaire, F(1, 111) = 0.12, p = .727, η 2 p = .00, 95% CI [0.00, 0.04] for the interaction. The results thus support the hypothesis that stimulus speed affects its psychological distance.</p><p>Altogether, the results of Study Set I established that people automatically associate speed and psychological distance (Hypothesis 1a), that they experience compatibility between the two dimensions (Hypothesis 1b), that psychological distance affects perceived speed (Hypothesis 1c), and that at least under some conditions speed affects psychological distance (Hypothesis 1d). These results strongly suggest the existence of a bi-directional association between psychological distance and the speed dimension of meaning.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5: Implicit and Explicit Associations Between Construal Level and Speed</head><p>In Study 5 we used the same procedure as in Study 1 to examine whether people implicitly associate words conveying abstractness (e.g., "general," "aim") with words conveying the concept slow (e.g., "slowness," "slower"), and words conveying concreteness (e.g., "specific," "means") with words conveying the concept fast (e.g., "speedy," "rapid").</p><p>We further examined whether people experience compatibility between these concepts and words.</p></div>

As in Study 1, participants were recruited from Project Implicit's participant pool (http://implicit.harvard.edu; <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Nosek, 2005)</ref>. Again, to maximize the odds of obtaining our hypothesized effect, we aimed for 99.9% power, which would enable us to detect a small effect (d = 0.2). A power analysis indicated that 462 participants would be required. Among volunteers randomly assigned to this study, 902 consented to participate, and 499 completed the SPF task.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bar-Anan et al.

Implicit Association Measure. In the SPF, participants categorized pairs of words (e.g., "why" + "slowly") into one of four pairs of categories (Abstract+Slow, Abstract+Fast, Concrete+Slow, Concrete+Fast) in three blocks of 40 trials (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>). Each word pair included one of four words representing a high construal level ("abstract," "general," "why," "aim") or a low construal level ("concrete," "specific," "how," "means"), and one of four words representing slowness ("slow," "slower," "slowness," "slowly") or speed ("fast," "rapid," "quick," "speedy"). As in Study 1, faster response times for categorizing word pairs from one category pair compared to another can be interpreted as indicating stronger associations for the former. This time we examined whether participants preferred word pairs that matched the combinations Abstract+Slow and Concrete+Fast over pairs that matched Abstract+Fast and Concrete+Slow. Positive SPF D scores indicated stronger associations for the former than for the latter.</p><p>In this study, combinations containing the category Abstract were always positioned in the two top corners of the square, and combinations containing Concrete in the bottom corners (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>), so as to avoid conflict with the established association between high construal level and up and between low construal level and down <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Nussinson et al., 2019;</ref>. We manipulated between participants whether the categories Slow and Fast appeared in the left-or right-hand corners. Explicit Association Measure. Half the participants were given each of the eight words used for the construal-level concepts, and were asked to indicate for each one whether they associated it more with the concept Slow or the concept Fast (e.g., "Do you associate the concept 'specific' more with the concept 'Slow' or the concept 'Fast'?"). They indicated their answers using a visual analog scale ranging from Slow to Fast (we randomly assigned one of the concepts to the left side of the VAS and the other to the right  In sum, our results suggest that although people do not implicitly associate construal level (abstract vs. concrete) with speed (slow vs. fast), they do experience a compatibility between the two dimensions, and hence an explicit association between them, in both directions: words denoting high (vs. low) construal level were rated as more slow (rather than fast), and words denoting slowness were rated as more abstract (rather than concrete).</p></div>

Such models translate knowledge representations into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors are typically obtained by performing a form of dimensionality reduction on word co-occurrence data. The use of word co-occurrence to obtain representations implies that similar concepts, which are often talked about in language in a similar manner, have similar vector representations and are closer to each other in the semantic spacei.e., they show meaning similarity (e.g., words related to speed, such as quickness, miles-per-hour and swiftness, have similar vector representations). As <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Firth (1957)</ref> famously said: "You shall know a word by the company it keeps"; building on this intuition, word vectors encompass the company they keep, and their proximity in a multidimensional space provides a way to gauge the semantic distance between different words.</p><p>Vector space semantic models have been shown to predict a wide range of behavioral phenomena, including similarity judgments, categorization, free association, text comprehension, semantic priming, probability judgments and forecasting, stereotyping and social judgments, consumer choice, and perceptions of risk (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bhatia et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Bullinaria &amp; Levy, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Jones et al., 2015)</ref>.

In this approach, word cooccurrences in large corpora are reduced to N-dimensions. Each word is then represented by a vector of length N that encompasses latent features of the word.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arousal</head><p>Construal level and speed are logically related, because high construals (decontextualized, abstract, central features of objects) are slower to change than low construals (contextualized, concrete, secondary features of objects). This study, unlike most other studies in the present paper, focuses on the speed of change rather than speed of motion.</p><p>As explained in the introduction, speed of change is the more general term, of which speed of motion is a specific case (where the change is in relative location) and our theory predicts that construal level would be associated with the speed of change (and not only with speed of motion). For example, abstract categories are slower to change than concrete categories. Thus, when walking down the produce aisle in the supermarket, displays of specific itemspeaches, apples, or grapesare faster to change than the category "fruit". The present study set to empirically test the relation between construal level and speed of change.</p><p>Study 8 examined whether situations described in more abstract terms would be perceived as slower to change (Hypothesis 2d). Participants were presented with short descriptions of situations, each via a single short sentence comprising a subject and predicate, and were asked to indicate how quickly or slowly the situation would change. We used the four increasingly more abstract categories identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Semin and Fiedler (1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">1991;</ref> descriptive action verbs (DAVs), interpretative action verbs (IAVs), state verbs (SVs), and adjectives (ADJs). To rule out valence and arousal as alternative explanations for speed of change in selecting the terms we made sure that (a) half the terms in each category were positive in valence and half were negative in valence, and (b) the mean arousal level associated with the four categories was similar. We hypothesized that participants would perceive situations described by abstract terms as likely to change more slowly. Method Participants. One hundred and eight (73 females, Mage = 26.47, SD = 4.13) participated in the study. One was excluded based on preregistered criteria (details in the ESM 7 ). Thus, 107 participants were included in the analysis.</p><p>Materials and Procedure. In each trial participants were presented with a sentence describing a situation, with either one of four types of predicates, as follows (from the lowest level to highest level of construal): DAV (e.g., "Rebecca strokes Sharon"); IAV (interpretative action verb, e.g., "Jonathan flatters Stephen"); SV (state verb, e.g., "Jacob disdains Gary"); and adjective (e.g., "James is outgoing") <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988)</ref>. Their task was to estimate how quickly or slowly the described situation would change, and to indicate its speed of change on a 175 mm slider anchored at "Quickly" on the left and "Slowly" on the right. Distance from the left end of the slider (1-100) served as the dependent variable (higher numbers indicate a slower speed of change). In total, there were 48 sentences, twelve from each category. DAVs, IAVs, and SVs were adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Hoorens et al. (2012)</ref>, and ADJs were adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Semin and Fiedler (1988)</ref>. Half the terms in each category were positive in valence (higher than the median valence by the norms of <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Warriner et al., 2013)</ref> and half were negative (lower than the median valence). The terms in all four categories had similar arousal levels (DAVs: Mean = 4.99, SD = 0.78; IAVs: Mean = 5.06, SD = 0.98, SVs: Mean = 4.78, SD = 0.87; ADJs Mean= 5.00, SD = 0.55).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>As predicted (Hypothesis 2d), a repeated-measures analysis on perceived speed of change of the situation yielded a significant effect of construal level, F <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">318)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Semin and Fiedler (1988)</ref> demonstrated that the linguistic categories they identified differ on a dimension they labeled "temporal stability," which might seem similar to our notion of "speed." We should note, however, that this similarity is more apparent than real, as it is greater on the theoretical level than operationally. Specifically, they operationalized "temporal stability" by the question "How enduring a quality does the attribute (action) in this sentence express about the subject?" This operationalization does not fully correspond to speed of change of the referred-to situation, which is our focus of interest. For example, research on spontaneous trait inferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Winter &amp; Uleman, 1984)</ref> found that people readily infer enduring stable characteristics of actors from actions that are described by descriptive action verbs, which are fairly concrete (e.g., "John kicked a cat" may be seen as expressing the enduring quality "John is aggressive," and at the same time as describing a situation that would change quickly)."</p><p>Study 8 examines our hypothesis with respect to the effect of construal level on speed of change for verbs and actions. Future research may want to examine noun categories. For example, we could measure the speed at which categories vs. exemplars are expected to change as one moves about in natural environments. We would expect categories such as furniture, people, or food to change more slowly than their particular exemplars when one moves about in a relevant environment, such as a restaurant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 9: The Effect of Speed on Construal Level</head><p>If indeed speed and construal level are associated, then a stimulus's speed and its construal level may be congruent or incongruent: high-level construals of a stimulus should be relatively easier to process when the stimulus is associated with slowness, whereas its lowlevel construals should be relatively easier to process when the stimulus is associated with speed (Hypothesis 2e; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Cian et al., 2015</ref>, for a similar rationale). Thus, given the choice between construing a stimulus at a high or low level, people should be more likely to choose a high construal level when the stimulus is slow rather than fast. Study 9 tested this hypothesis.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Wegner's (1987, 1989)</ref> action identification theory, actions (e.g., conducting a study) may be represented in terms of superordinate goals, meaning the ends for which we perform the action (e.g., advancing science), or in terms of subordinate goalsi.e., the means by which we perform it (e.g., testing a hypothesis). The former, high-level action identification is associated with why we perform an action, while the latter, low-level action identification is associated with how we perform it. Ample evidence suggests that people choose higher-level construals for more distal (as compared to near)</p><p>behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Day &amp; Bartels, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Grinfeld et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Libby et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Liviatan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Sánchez et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Wakslak et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In Study 9 we examined whether the speed at which an action is imagined to be performed (slow or fast) affects whether it is construed in terms of the ends for which it is performed (high-level, "why" terms) or the means by which it is performed (low-level, "how" terms). Participants were presented with common behaviors (e.g., opening a door) and were asked to imagine that the behavior was performed either slowly or fast. For each behavior, participants indicated which of two alternative descriptions or action identifications best fit the behavior: a high-level or low-level action identification. If congruence exists between how people construe a behavior and its speed, then participants should prefer high-level action identifications to a greater extent for actions they imagined were performed slowly, and lowlevel action identifications to a greater extent for actions they imagined were performed quickly.</p></div>

Participants were told that every action can be described in various ways. For example, the behavior typing a document might be described as pressing down keys or as expressing thoughts. Participants were then presented with a series of stimuli (22 stimuli in all), each comprising a short action together with two descriptions (the stimuli were borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Vallacher &amp; Wegner's [1989]</ref> Behavior Identification Form and translated into Hebrew). One of the descriptions in each set was at a high construal level, focusing on the ends for which the action is performed (the why), and the other was at a low construal level, focusing on the means by which the action is performed (the how).</p><p>Participants' task was to quickly and intuitively choose the description which best fits the action. The why description appeared to the right of the how description in half the trials, and to the left in the other half.</p><p>Before being presented with every action, participants were asked either to imagine it being performed slowly by someone living in a place characterized by a slow pace of life, or to imagine it being performed quickly by someone living in a fast-paced society. To strengthen the speed manipulation, at the beginning of each trial participants were presented with the floating dots animation used in Study 4. They were told that the moving dots simulate the speed at which they should imagine the action being performed and the pace of life they should call to mind. The speed at which each action was to be imagined was counterbalanced across the two versions of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>For each participant the proportion of high-construal descriptions chosen as best fitting the action was computed separately for actions that were imagined to be performed slowly and for actions imagined to be performed quickly.

In this study, participants were asked to imagine certain behaviors being conducted quickly or slowly, and then to choose between high and low construals of each behavior (goals vs. means). In real life, however, many other factors may interfere with such judgments. For example, performing certain actions slowly may reflect difficulty (e.g., lifting a heavy load, walking over uneven ground).</p><p>We found that slowness reflects a higher construal level, but difficultywhich is associated with slownessis known to lower level of construal <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Vallacher &amp; Wegner, 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">, 1989</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the effects we hypothesized and found may be smaller and even reverse in real-life situations, in which slowness could be interpreted as reflecting difficulty.</p></div>

If indeed the speed of a stimulus affects its psychological distance (as suggested by the results of Study 4), then one possible implication is that slow-paced spoken messages will be perceived as addressing spatially and socially more distant audiences than fast-paced messages (H3a &amp; H3b). Furthermore, findings by <ref type="bibr">Joshi, Wakslak and colleagues (2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, 2016</ref> suggest that larger audiences are experienced as being more spatially and socially distant, and are also associated with more abstract messages.

For each pair, the two audios were displayed side-by-side, labeled audio 1 and audio 2.

For each pair and judgment, only one audio could be placed in each box (e.g., if one audio was placed in the "spatially close" box, the other had to go in the "spatially distant" box).

By extension, this implies that by speaking fast, leaders and speakers in general can signal to listeners that their message/ decision making/ policy/ agenda is local, and matters for the here and now, and by speaking slowly speakers may signal that their message/ decision making/ policy/ agenda is universal, and that its implications transcend time and space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Anyone who has read fairy tales aloud knows that their familiar opening lines -"Once upon a time, in a distant land…," "Far, far away…," "A long, long time ago"are most effective when pronounced slowly. Like Judy Garland's "Somewhere over the Rainbow," these lines send us to psychologically distant realms not only through their semantics, but also via their slow tempo. In 12 studies, we provide the first empirical support for the existence of mental associations between speed, on the one hand, and both psychological distance and construal level on the other.</p><p>As expected, in Study 1 participants demonstrated both implicit and explicit associations between psychological distance and speed. In Study 2, participants' choices showed that they regarded it as intuitively more correct to couple concepts exemplifying psychological distance (in all its four dimensions) with slow music and concepts exemplifying psychological proximity with fast music. In Study 3 we manipulated the psychological distance of stimuli and examined the effects on the speed associated with them. We found that participants attributed a slow pace of life to psychologically distant places more than to psychologically close places. In Study 4 we manipulated the speed associated with stimuli and examined the effects on their psychological distance. Behaviors visualized as being performed slowly were perceived as more imaginary (less real) than behaviors visualized as performed quickly.</p><p>Turning next to the hypothesized association with construal level, Study 5 did not reveal an implicit association between construal level and speed, but participants did explicitly associate the two dimensions. In Study 6, participants intuitively coupled abstract concepts with slow music and concrete concepts with fast music. In Study 7 we found that the more concrete a word, the greater its tendency to appear in semantic proximity in written texts to the concept fast as compared to the concept slow. In Study 8 we found that situations characterized by concrete terms were perceived as faster to change than situations characterized by abstract terms. In Study 9, we manipulated the speed associated with stimuli and examined the effect on construal level. Participants construed behaviors visualized as being performed slowly on a higher level, in terms of their goals rather than their means, than behaviors visualized as performed quickly.</p><p>Finally, we turned to implications of the associations for both communication and person perception. Studies 10a and 10b showed that people infer a larger spatial and social distance between a speaker and her audience, and a larger audience, from slow-paced speech compared to fast-paced speech. These findings suggest that speed, and in particular the speed of speech, serves as a potent cue for increasing or decreasing the psychological distance between a speaker and her audience, and for signaling the size of the audience the speaker aspires to address. Study 11 showed that people attribute a more expansive regulatory scope to a speaker who speaks relatively slowly (as compared to relatively fast). The findings of that study suggest that speed, and in particular the speed of speech, can signal the degree to which a target person is taking into account local and immediate (vs. broader and more remote)</p><p>considerations.</p><p>The association of speed with psychological distance and abstraction is well reflected in art and culture. For example, John Lennon's "Imagine" uses a slow tempo to take us to a hypothetical world, one where there are no possessions, no countries and no religion. By contrast, fast, upbeat pop music is all about inspiring us to live in "the here and now." Various advertising campaigns take advantage of this feature of musical tempo, encouraging us to savor the moment and indulge in the concrete pleasures of our bodies and senses (by buying their product). <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">10</ref> Art and culture also often exhibit a simultaneous association of speed and vertical position, such that psychological distance is induced both by slow tempo and by reference to elevated locations (e.g., in the songs "Over the Rainbow," 11 "When You Wish Upon a Star,"</p><p>or "Beyond the Sky" ; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Nussinson et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Nussinson et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Van Kerckhove et al., 2015</ref> for studies on the association of vertical position with psychological distance and level of construal). This power multiplier is used to great effect in the sharp contrast between the slow-paced, up-oriented song "Part of Your World," sung by Ariel, the Little Mermaid, when she fantasizes about (for her, far and unlikely) life on land, 14 and the fast-paced, downoriented song "Kiss the Girl" (AKA "Under the Sea"), sung by her old friend Sebastian, the crab, who tries to convince her of the benefits of her real life underwater. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">15</ref> We can see a similar pairing between "slow" and "high" in popular meditation videos which couple slow music with elevated landscapes (e.g., clouds or mountains). 16</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential Underlying Mechanisms</head><p>Probably, the examples adduced above "work" because they reflect the poetic language spoken by our own minds. That is, we believe that the findings presented in this article reflect mental associations between speed and psychological distance, and between speed and construal level. What, then, are the underlying processes through which these relationships are established within people's mental lives?</p><p>While our findings are silent as to the specific process or processes that underlie these associations, we can suggest several contributory mechanisms. First, both psychological distance and construal level are logically related to speed. When considered in light of logicalfunctional principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Gilead et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gilead et al., , 2021</ref>, the associations may reflect the facts that what is more spatially distant is necessarily slower to affect us (speed-spatial distance); that what is slower necessarily affects us later (speed-temporal distance); and that higher-level aspects of an object change more slowly across repeated interactions with it (speed-construal level) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hansen &amp; Trope, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010)</ref>. We assume that because social distance and hypothetical distance are associated with spatial distance, temporal distance, and construal level (both in our minds and in the world) and are automatically activated by them, they too become mentally associated with speed.</p><p>A second type of explanation draws on the cognitive-ecological approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Fiedler, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Fiedler, , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Pleskac &amp; Hertwig, 2014</ref>; and see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Fiedler et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Fiedler et al., 2015)</ref>. It notes built-in associations in the environment, such that a stimulus which is farther away generally moves more slowly on the retina, and is responded to more slowly by the cognitive system.</p><p>Note that although from this perspective the association between speed and spatial distance is the root cause for the associations between speed and the other dimensions of psychological distance and between speed and construal level, we believe that once formed, these mental associations have a life of their own. They might be strengthened in their own right, for example through couplings prevalent in art, language, and culture more generally (see below;</p><p>and see <ref type="bibr">Schubert et al., 2011, Figure 2</ref>, for a similar conceptualization). Thus, deriving the hypothesized associations from the cognitive-ecological approach to cognition does not imply that our effects should be stronger for spatial distance as compared to the other dimensions of psychological distance (and see the results of Study 2); nor does it imply that the associations with higher construal levels are mediated through perceptions of spatial distance.</p><p>The associations between speed, psychological distance, and construal level may also be generated or strengthened by embodiment effects and conceptual metaphor effects. An embodiment approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barsalou, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barsalou, , 2016</ref> might suggest that images which move more slowly on the retina typically represent more physically distant objects. As a result of this association <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Gibson, 1950)</ref>, information processing about spatially distant objects is repeatedly coupled with the proprioception of low-speed movement on the retina, while information processing about spatially close objects is coupled with the proprioception of high-speed movement on the retina. Under these conditions, perceptual experiences associated with distance in space are likely to be schematized, such that thinking about spatial distance would involve perceptual simulation of low-speed movement (in contrast to highspeed movement).</p><p>Conceptual metaphor explanations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Casasanto, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Landau et al., 2010)</ref> suggest that people may rely on information about the source dimension of speed (fast vs. slow) when they reason about, interpret, or evaluate the target dimensions of psychological distance and abstractness in relation to a given stimulus. The basis for this conceptual mapping would presumably be the same association between the spatial distance of a stimulus and the multiple facets of speed as detailed above <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Gibson, 1950;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Maren, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Mobbs et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Previc, 1990)</ref>. The manipulation of speed to foster psychological distancing and abstractness in art and culture, as described above, is in line with the conceptual metaphor approach and with the notion of metaphoric transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Landau et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The findings of Study 7 offer support for several of these different theories. To some, the fact that concrete words were more likely to be paired in written texts with the concept fast as compared to the concept slow may seem to support a cognitive-ecological approach, in the sense that the associations could be afforded by the ecology of word associations. Note, however, that while these naturalistically observed associations in written language could serve as a basis for learning the associations (and see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Hauser &amp; Schwarz, 2022)</ref>, they are at the same time a reflection of the associations in people's minds. Alternatively, the fact that we were able to validate the associations in an NLP study where the input is entirely linguistic may reflect the fact that the associations are symbolic. Again, however, note that the corpora on which our NLP analysis was run are the products of embodied minds.</p><p>We may further profit from considering the reported effects in terms of the semantic space and meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Osgood &amp; Suci, 1955)</ref>. The quick-slow scale forms part of Osgood's activity dimension, along with active-passive and hot-cold. Thus, quick is active while slow is passive. At the same time, activity, acting on the world, is associated withand may even demanda lower construal level than passivity. For example, the linguistic category model <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988)</ref> suggests that passive states are more abstract than active ones.</p><p>Notably, this model is aligned with the constraints that distance imposed until relatively recently on human activity: in pre-modern life, one could only act directly on stimuli in one's immediate surroundings (i.e., stimuli that were spatially, temporally, and socially close);</p><p>relationships with psychologically remote stimuli were by nature passive, limited to "state verbs" such as contemplation (for a related argument see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gilead et al., 2014)</ref>. This analysis may suggest that the associations exemplified in our studies between both psychological distance and construal level, on the one hand, and speed on the other, may reflect to some extent a more general mental association of both psychological distance and construal level with activity. Indeed, we believe that both line of theorizing co-exist.</p><p>Another factor to consider is arousal. As speed is interrelated with activity, and because activity is often associated with arousal, one may assume that speed and arousal are often interrelated in one's experience. Thus, to the extent that the activity dimension is somehow more overarching, our findings may be seen, at least in theory, as a specific example of a more general association with activity, and thus perhaps with arousal.</p><p>Importantly, however, our results do seem to be more consistent with a more specific effect of speed rather than arousal. First, further analysis of the data of our Study 7 (the NLP study)</p><p>provides us with a unique opportunity to delve into the relationship between the concreteness of concepts, their relative distance in semantic space from fast as compared to slow, and the arousal levels associated with them. To assess the arousal associated with speed and construal level we used arousal ratings taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Warriner et al. (2013)</ref>. The zero-order correlation between concreteness and arousal was negative: r (13,325) = -.17, p &lt; .0001. The zero-order correlation between arousal and speed was very weak and negative: r (13,325) = -.06, p &lt; .0001. We then fitted a linear model to predict concreteness with speed and arousal. The model was statistically significant (R2 = 0.09, F(2, 13301) = 648.39, p &lt; .001, adj. R2 = 0.09).</p><p>Importantly, whereas the effect of speed was statistically significant and positive <ref type="bibr">(b = 4.88,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [4.56,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.20]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[-0.17, -0.14]</ref>). Thus, whereas the closer a concept is to fast as compared to slow the more concrete it is, the more a concept loaded on arousal, the less concrete it is. This suggests that the association between speed and construal level is, at least in part, independent of the association between arousal and construal level.</p><p>Also of note, Study 8 demonstrated an effect of construal level on perceived speed that is independent of arousal. Specifically, the more abstract the term describing a situationfrom DAVs to IAVs to SVs to ADJs <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Semin &amp; Fiedler, 1988</ref>)the slower the situation was expected to change, despite the fact that all four categories of terms were equal in their arousal level. This further suggests that the association between speed and construal level is at least partly independent of the association between arousal and construal level.</p><p>Finally, in some of the studies reported above, differences between versions emerged in the strength of the effects connecting speed to distance and construal level. Specifically, in studies conducted in English (Studies 1 and 5) the associations between fast/psychologically close/concrete and between slow/psychologically distant/abstract were stronger in versions of the studies where the concept "fast" was presented to the left of the concept "slow." In Study 10a, which was conducted in Hebrew, these associations were stronger in a version where the concept that represented "fast" (e.g., faster-paced audios) was presented mainly to the right of the concept that represented "slow." In Studies 10b and 11, which were conducted in Hebrew but involved Finnish-speaking audios, no differences between versions emerged. When viewed in light of the Social Agency Bias (SAB) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Suitner &amp; Maass, 2016)</ref>, these differences may reflect rightwards versus leftwards writing/reading habits. According to this model, for English readers what is on the left is more agentic, and hence associated with more</p><p>speed, than what is on the right, whereas for Hebrew readers the reverse is true. Thus, experimental versions which are compatible with this mapping may yield stronger associations between the dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Our findings have a range of potential theoretical ramifications. First, if, as suggested by our findings, a stimulus's psychological distance and construal level are associated in our minds with its speed, it is possible that the association between psychological distance and construal level  is driven at least in part by their mutual associations with speed. Repeatedly throughout each day, stimuli that move more slowly on our retina, and to which we respond more slowlyin other words, spatially distant stimuliare construed both as psychologically more distant (on the different dimensions) and as more abstract. It is possible that this coupling feeds into the psychological distance-construal level association and facilitates the emergence of construal-level effects.</p><p>Second, our findings join dozens of findings inspired by the conceptual metaphor <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Landau et al., 2010)</ref> and embodied cognition approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barsalou, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Matheson &amp; Barsalou, 2018)</ref> which show that variation on one dimension of conscious experience imbues our experience on seemingly unrelated dimensions. For instance, previous findings have pointed to effects of social exclusion on perceived ambient temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">(Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008)</ref>; effects of weight on perceptions of importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Chandler et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jostmann et al., 2009)</ref>, severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kaspar, 2013)</ref>, and disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Stroch et al., 2019)</ref>; and effects of vertical position on perceptions of power <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Giessner &amp; Schubert, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Schubert, 2005)</ref>, valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Meier &amp; Robinson, 2004)</ref>, and psychological distance and construal level <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Nussinson et al., 2019;</ref>. In the same way, our current findings suggest that speed colors perceptions of psychological distance and construal level. Our findings thus join the long tradition of embodiment research in unveiling a little further the language of our subjective experiences.</p><p>Third, on an even more general level, our results may have implications for possible associations between dimensions of meaning. Specifically, as noted above, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bentler and LaVoie (1972)</ref> propose reality (i.e., the distinction between real and non-real) as one of seven dimensions of meaning that extend the semantic space beyond the three dimensions of meaning proposed by Osgood, namely evaluation, potency, and activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Osgood &amp; Suci, 1955</ref>). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bentler and LaVoie (1972)</ref>, the reality dimension comprises such scales as imaginary-actual, fantasized-truthful, and abstract-concrete, and thus seems to partially map onto psychological distance and construal level. As noted earlier, the quick-slow scale, on the other hand, is part of Osgood's activity dimension. Our findings naturally raise the question as to whether the documented associations between speed and abstractness and between speed and psychological distance attest more broadly to an association between the reality and activity dimensions of meaningand if so, what are the implications of this association.</p><p>Finally, a comparison between our findings and those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Shani-Feinstein et al. (2022)</ref> is theoretically telling. Shani-Feinstein and her colleagues found that when actually or virtually moving faster, people rely on more abstract mental representations during decision making. These findings are seemingly contradictory to ours. Note, however, that Shani-Feinstein et al. manipulated the perceived moving speed of their participants (e.g., being in a slow vs. a fast train) and found that participants who move faster use higher-level construals.</p><p>In contrast, our studies manipulate the perceived speed associated with the stimulus. This reversal in the associations goes hand in hand with previous findings showing opposite associations between dimensions of meaning when the self serves as a reference point (as in <ref type="bibr">Shani-Feinstein et al.)</ref> versus when the object serves as a reference point (as in our studies).</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Seibt et al. (2008)</ref> showed that when induced into a self-as-reference-point perspective (thinking about arm movements as decreasing vs. increasing distance from the self), participants are faster to move a joystick toward the self (and away from the screen) in response to positive words and away from the self (and toward the screen) in response to negative words. In contrast, when induced into an object-as-reference-point perspective (thinking in terms of decreasing vs. increasing distance from the word), participants are faster to move a joystick toward the screen in response to positive words and away from the screen in response to negative words. Thus, the very same bodily feedback is construed in opposing ways (as approach vs. avoidance behavior) depending on participants' frame of reference.</p><p>Similarly, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aggarwal and Zhao (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Slepian et al. (2015)</ref> using the self as reference pointshow that participants who experience themselves in a higher position looking down (e.g., from the top of a descending staircase) use a higher construal level than those who experience themselves in a lower position looking up (e.g., from the bottom of an ascending staircase). In contrast, using the object as reference point, we show <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Nussinson et al., , 2021</ref>) that looking at stimuli located at the top of a screen results in a higher construal level than looking down at the bottom of the screen. Again, the very same bodily feedback is associated in opposing ways with construal level depending on participants' frame of reference. We thus contend that in a similar manner, high speed is associated with a high construal level when (as in Shani-Feinstein et al.) the self serves as a reference point, and with a low construal level when (as in our studies) the stimulus serves as a reference point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Psychological distance and construal level have been shown to affect judgments, preferences, and subjective experiences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Liberman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010)</ref>. The present findings suggest that because speed is associated with distance and construal level, manipulating speed may exert effects on our judgments, subjective experiences, and preferences that are similar to those of distancing and abstraction.</p><p>The results of Studies 10a and 10b seem to suggest that speed, and in particular speed of speech, serves as a potent cue for increasing or decreasing the psychological distance between a speaker and her audience. By speaking fast, speakers may signal to their listeners that they are similar to them, and that they are speaking to them intimately and personally. We live in an era when much human communication is conducted via technology (e.g., cellular phones, videoconferencing software, social media) and involves built-in spatial distance between communicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Ruben et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Watt, 2010)</ref>. (that is yet to be examined) is that as power is associated with both greater experienced psychological distance from others <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Magee &amp; Smith, 2013)</ref> and with abstract information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Smith &amp; Trope, 2006)</ref>, slow speech signals power. Future research may want to examine whether our findings extend to written messages as wellthat is, whether the speed associated with written messages (e.g., via slow-vs fast-moving dots in the background, or text that scrolls quickly or slowly)has comparable effects on communication.</p><p>Furthermore, the results of Study suggest that perceivers may use the speed of a spoken message to infer the speaker's (current or chronic) regulatory scope. Fast speech may suggest that the speaker is planted in the here and now, that her decisions and agendas take into account local, immediate, and high-likelihood considerations, whereas slow speech may suggest that her decisions and agendas take into account psychologically more distant consideration, are more universal, and have implications that transcend time and space (see Martin Luther Kings's "I have a dream" speech, <ref type="bibr">August 18, 1963)</ref>. Here again, this cue may be especially critical in modern times, when social leaders, politicians, business figures, and scientists alike manage how others perceive them from a built-in distance.</p><p>Of course, the design of Studies 10a, 10b and 11 is somewhat artificial, in that participants were exposed to both slow-and fast-paced speech, and were asked to consider both with respect to the DV (characteristics of the communication or perceived regulatory scope). Future studies should examine these effects in real lifefor example, comparing how leaders are perceived as a function of their pace of speech (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Grinfeld et al., 2021</ref>, for a discussion of the importance of explicit comparison in CL research and beyond).</p><p>Those caveats aside, from a practical perspective, the associations reported in this paper have a range of potential implications in various realms. We point here to a few of these.</p><p>One set of potential implications relates to priming effects. It is possible that when making a decision, the same event, plan, option or idea may be perceived as less likely, more hypothetical, or more distant in time or space when presented (e.g., read or displayed) at a slow (rather than fast) pace, or when accompanied by slow (vs fast) music. Similarly, when primed with slow stimuli (as compared to fast stimuli), people may perceive unknown target persons as less familiar and less similar to the self (that is, as psychologically more distant;</p><p>see <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Stephan et al., 2011)</ref>, and may construe the self more in terms of invariable traits (as opposed to changing depending on the situation) (see <ref type="bibr">Nussbaum et al., 2003, Study 4;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Pronin &amp; Ross, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Wakslak et al., 2008)</ref>. Inducing slowness in decision making may increase the salience of desirability concerns as opposed to feasibility concerns (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Liviatan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Todorov et al., 2007)</ref>, and of pros as opposed to cons (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Eyal et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Herzog et al., 2007)</ref>. Finally, inducing a slow pace may strengthen the role of values in shaping people's behavioral intentions with respect to future situations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Eyal et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Eyal et al., 2009)</ref>, and increase the weighting of high-level concerns over low-level concerns in self-regulation, thereby helping people avoid giving in to temptation . It is further possible that priming negotiators with slow-paced stimuli may promote logrolling or concession-making on low-priority issues in exchange for favorable outcomes on high-priority issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Henderson et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Henderson &amp; Trope, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kelley, 1966)</ref>. On the other hand, it is also possible that speed dating (where potential partners serve as rapidly changing stimuli) makes parties consider each other in a concrete, low-level manner.</p><p>Second, ample evidence suggests that processing of a stimulus is facilitated when associated dimensions of the stimulus match <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chae &amp; Hoegg, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Cian et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Deng &amp; Kahn, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Hilbert et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Meier &amp; Robinson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Romero &amp; Biswas, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Sherman &amp; Clore, 2009)</ref>. Based on our findings, information that is abstract and psychologically distant may be easier to process when presented at a slow pace or accompanied by slow music, whereas information that is concrete and psychologically proximal may be easier to process when presented at a fast pace or accompanied by fast music. Note that we do not claim or predict that proximate and concrete information will be processed more deeply <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972)</ref> when it is presented at a fast pace, but rather only that it will be more compatible and easier to process (i.e., its processing will be more fluent) when associated with a fast pace, whereas distant and abstract information will be more compatible and easier to process when associated with a slow pace. A concomitant possible implication is that proximate and concrete information "feels right" when associated with speed, whereas distant and abstract information "feels right" when associated with slowness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Begg et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dechêne et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Reber &amp; Schwarz, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Unkelbach, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, based on the notion that the fluency with which a message is processed contributes to its persuasiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aaker &amp; Lee, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amit et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Briñol et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Lee &amp; Aaker, 2004)</ref>, we might predict that messages and ads involving abstract values and long-term goals (e.g., health, sustainability, security, charity) and psychologically distant objects (e.g., retirement, a vacation destination, luxuries) may be processed more fluently and hence may be more convincing when presented at a slow pace. In contrast, messages involving concrete concepts (e.g., how to solve a concrete problem, such as opening a plugged pipe) and psychologically close objects (e.g., immediate hunger, thirst, bodily sensations, everyday scenarios) may be easier to process and hence more convincing when presented at a fast pace.</p><p>Our findings may also be of interest and importance for those who design the spaces around us, such as architects, landscape designers, urban planners, and policy makers.</p><p>Specifically, with the development of technology, human work and living environments are increasingly characterized by higher speeds (e.g., of information transfer, of surrounding stimuli). Our studies suggest that this trend may inadvertently contract our minds to pay attention to more proximate times, locations, persons and possibilities, as well as to induce low construal levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Trope et al., 2021)</ref>. If some of these effects are undesirable, we might be able to offset them by designating specific places (neighborhoods, parks, rooms) or times (e.g., days or hours) to be characterized by a slower pace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We found that construal level and psychological distance are associated with speed, such that the speed of a stimulus affects both its construal level and its psychological distance, and vice versa.

Thus, the results of Study 10b replicate those of Study 10a in a foreign language.These findings join those of Study 10a in supporting H3a, H3b and H3c. Specifically, they show that slow-paced speech is perceived as being delivered to a spatially and socially more distant audience, and to a larger audience, than fast-paced speech; and that this holds even when the listener does not understand any of the content of the message. Indeed, the fact that the participants in Study 10b did not know the content of the message may have rendered pace of speech an even more potent cue. The results of Studies 10a and 10b thus complement each other in suggesting that the speed of speech serves as a potent cue for increasing or decreasing the psychological distance between a speaker and audience. In practice, this means that by speaking fast, speakers may signal to their listeners that they are similar to them, that they are socially and spatially close, and that they are speaking to each audience member personally. By speaking slowly, speakers may convey, rather, a sense of separatenessperhaps superiorityand distance. These findings, therefore, demonstrate an important potential implication of the basic association between slow-psychologically distant-abstract and fast-psychologically close-concrete for communication.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>If, as suggested by our findings, the speed of speech is a modifier of social and perceived spatial distance, then shedding light on this role may contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of communication in general, and of communication via technology in particular. Furthermore, whereas until relatively recently in human history, speakers spoke to an audience of a known size, today politicians, social leaders, scientists, celebrities, and lay people alike use technology to approach audiences of unknown and ever changing size. If, as suggested by our findings, the speed of speech is a modifier of perceived audience size, then it is possible that speakers may fine-tune what they signal to listeners merely by adjusting their pace of speechconveying a sense of intimacy by speaking fast (with the implication that the speaker is addressing each listener personally), or slowing down so listeners feel part of an immense crowd.

The remaining participants were asked to associate the eight words used for the concepts Slow and Fast with the concepts Abstract and Concrete (again, randomly assigned to the left and right, with Equal Association in the center). Responses were coded and recoded such that larger numbers indicated a stronger association with Slow or Abstract than with Fast or Concrete. The mean SPF score was relatively low, 0.002 (SD = 0.41), and was not significantly different from zero, t(475) = 0.15, p = .876, d = 0.01, 95% CI[-0.08,   0.10]. Thus, these findings do not support the existence of stronger associations between a high construal level and Slow and between a low construal level and Fast compared with the reverse. We also examined (in a non-preregistered analysis) whether the effect on the SPF scores depended on the positioning of the two speed concepts (i.e., whether Slow was to the left or the right). The effect of positioning had a moderate effect on the SPF scores, with lower scores under Slow-left and Fast-right compared with Slow-right and Fast-left, t(456) = 3.43, p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.32, 95% CI [0.14, 0.51].5  We will return to these differences between the experimental versions in the General Discussion.
