			<abstract>
				<p>Cooperation is a crucial prosocial skill that is refined during adolescence and relies on trust. A substantial body of literature has shown that adolescence is a time of significant development in social decision making. It is unclear how this development affects adolescent decisions to establish trust and sustain cooperation with peers versus artificial agents. Given the current technological advances, adolescents have been immersed in virtual interactions with human and artificial intelligent (AI) agents, so they may establish similar levels of trust and reciprocity with human and non-human agents. On the other hand, adolescence is a time of increasing interest in peer relationships and, consequently, establishing trust and reciprocity with peers may be a more important goal. The current study directly tests whether adolescents differ in their cooperation tendencies when interacting with, or believing that they interact with peers, versus knowingly interacting with artificial partners in economic exchange games. Adolescents (N= 67) were invited into the laboratory to play various rounds of the multiround trust game. Some participants (N= 38) also played version of the game with a fixed strategy algorithm by themselves on a separate visit. 40 participants returned for a second visit in pairs. Pairs were matched for race, sex, age, and IQ and played the multi-round trust game with each other. On some consecutive games, they were told that they continued to play with a peer (i.e., social condition) but they were actually playing with an adaptive algorithm, while in the remaining games, they were correctly informed that they were playing with an adaptive computer algorithms (i.e., non-social condition). In line with our hypothesis, we found that both partner adaptivity and social context (believing that they interacted with a peer) influenced cooperation. In line with our expectation, adolescents sustained cooperation more when interacting with adaptive versus fixed partners. They were also more generous when playing with an adaptive partner, particularly in the social condition. We employed fixed economic strategies, reinforcement learning (RL) models, and a combination thereof to describe adolescents&apos; cooperation. Across games, direct reciprocation, i.e., the economic tit for tat strategy, best captured their cooperation behavior. In the social condition, however, adolescents reinitiated cooperation more often after previously defecting. The winning model was a more generous strategy that combined tit for tat with an RL confidence term that prescribed repairing trust and reinitiating cooperation. Overall, we show that that both partner adaptivity and social context support sustained cooperation in adolescence.</p>

It is essential for building communities and enabling uniquely human traits like morality, cumulative culture, and technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Burkart et al., 2014)</ref>. Studying cooperation systematically in real-life is challenging due to the fragile nature of trust and its dependence on individual predispositions and social context. Most research has focused on how adults build and update representations of their cooperation partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Behrens et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Behrens et al., , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Behrens et al., , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hampton et al., 2008)</ref>, and relatively little is known about how this skill develops over the course of adolescence. Adolescence is a critical period for the emergence of reciprocal social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lee et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Liu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Sutter &amp; Kocher, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Van den Bos et al., 2012)</ref>. Peer interactions and cooperation gain increasing importance during adolescence, significantly impacting social adaptation and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Blakemore, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">O'Reilly, 2020)</ref>. Research on cooperation strategies in this period could provide crucial insights into addressing social adaptation and mental health challenges among adolescents.</p><p>Economic games offer a controlled framework to characterize the essential features of real-life cooperation, such as social norms, or an individual's tolerance of risk and uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alós-Ferrer &amp; Farolfi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Berg et al., 1995)</ref>. Cooperation has been widely studied with economic exchange tasks such as the trust game <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alós-Ferrer &amp; Farolfi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Berg et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Glaeser et al., 2000)</ref>. In the trust game, one player, the investor, is endowed money and can choose to share some of their endowment with another player, the trustee. The trustee in turn can reciprocate and share back a proportion of this endowment with the investor <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Güth et al., 1997)</ref>. The iterative multi-round trust games have been characterized by the emergence of reciprocal behavior, often described by a tit for tat (t4t) strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Axelrod, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Axelrod &amp; Hamilton, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Nowak &amp; Sigmund, 1992</ref>). An agent using this strategy will initially cooperate, then will subsequently mimic the interaction partner's previous move: cooperate when their partner cooperates, and defect when their partner defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Axelrod, 1980)</ref>. This strategy, however, can easily turn into a cycle of mutual defection. To avoid this cycle a player can occasionally choose to 'forgive' their partner's defection, by choosing to reinitiate cooperation after their partner's defection choice. This strategy has been coined generous tit for tat <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Nowak &amp; Sigmund, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Economic strategies such as t4t or generous t4t prescribe adapting to the choice of a partner. They are considered fixed or static in that agents are thought to act according to a predetermined script. They do not consider learning over the course of an interaction or situational constraints, such as the potential familiarity, or preferences for certain interaction partners. Furthermore, they do not describe the cognitive processes involved in repairing trust after a partner defected <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Haselhuhn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">James Jr, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kim et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Schweitzer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Tomlinson et al., 2004)</ref>. Participants may deviate from such static strategies by building dynamic representations of their partners' mental states from observed behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Behrens et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Behrens et al., , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Mars et al., 2012)</ref>. A body of research has successfully used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to capture how players learn to anticipate the behaviors or beliefs of their partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barfuss &amp; Meylahn, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barraclough et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Crandall et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ezaki et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">McKee et al., 2023)</ref>. More generally, RL models have been shown to describe how people update their beliefs about environmental contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gershman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Vanyukov et al., 2019)</ref> or about the mental states of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Behrens et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Frolichs et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lockwood et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Lockwood et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Rosenblau et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Rosenblau et al., , 2021</ref>.</p><p>Across development, humans use and update their beliefs about potential interaction partners before deciding whether to cooperate with them. Children and adults sample information about others' trustworthiness prior to cooperation to minimize the risk of exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bowler et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Liu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ma et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Niebaum et al., 2022)</ref>. While studies have shown that children use the same strategies as adults to sample information and engage in cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Liu et al., 2023)</ref>, relatively little is known about ongoing development in sustaining cooperation once it has been established. Some studies have found that adolescents become increasingly adaptive to their cooperation partner's behavior. Older adolescents have been found to differentiate more between trustworthy and untrustworthy agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lee et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Sijtsma et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Westhoff et al., 2020)</ref>. Other studies, however, did not find age related changes in trust behavior during adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Fett et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lemmers-Jansen et al., 2017)</ref>. To our knowledge, no study has directly investigated how social context, the belief that you play with a human peer versus computer, may change how adolescents sustain and repair trust.</p><p>Adults have been shown to hold their computer opponents to different standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Burton-Chellew et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Crandall et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dafoe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">McKee et al., 2023)</ref>. A primary reason for this may be a lack of trust in computers, which extends to artificial intelligence (AI). Research has found that adults show preferences for speaking to a human medical provider over an AI medical provider, even if the AI provider is at equal accuracy and cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Longoni et al., 2019)</ref>. Humans also display higher generosity towards other human compared to computer partners. This was shown by using the dictator game, a simple economic task in which participants can choose how to distribute money between themselves and their partners. Participants were more willing to share their endowment with a human versus a computer partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Nielsen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">von Schenk et al., 2023)</ref>. These differences in the willingness to cooperate with humans versus computers may be due to differences in adaptivity of human versus computer partners. Most research comparing cooperation in human-human versus humancomputer dyads included algorithms with fixed reciprocation strategies. More research is needed on human cooperation with adaptive computer partners that adjust their behavior to their partner's choices in real-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asher et al., 2012)</ref>. One study using the stag hunt game, a paradigm that investigates how agents trade-off between pursuing individual versus collective gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Duguid et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fang et al., 2002)</ref>, found that adults spent more time and effort in the game when interacting with adaptive agents compared to non-adaptive agents, similarly to how they would interact with human opponents <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Craig et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Adolescents may show less preference than adults for sustaining cooperation with peers versus adaptive computer partners because the current adolescent cohort has spent most of their life in an era of smart technology and they have been shown to be well versed in using online platforms and interacting with AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abi-Jaoude et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Boer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Keles et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Orben et al., 2024)</ref>. Conversely, they may prefer human interaction partners and adapt more to peers as opposed to computer partners during social exchange. This hypothesis is based on adolescents' challenges in virtual social interactions with computer partners. In fact, social media and AI have been named among the top contributors to the reported increase of mental health challenges in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abi-Jaoude et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Boer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Keles et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">O'Reilly, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">O'Reilly et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Orben et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>The current study takes an important step towards conclusively addressing this question by characterizing how adolescents sustain cooperation with peers versus computer partners that differ in their level of adaptivity. Specifically, we tested the effects of partner adaptivity (i.e., whether partners were fixed or adaptive computer algorithms) and social context (i.e., adolescents' beliefs about playing with a human versus a computer) on cooperation magnitude and strategies. Adolescents played a simplified child-friendly version of the multi-round trust game. To examine the role of social context, adolescents were invited to come in pairs to the lab and first played the trust game with the peer. After that, adolescents were sometimes told that they continued to interact with the peer (social condition) and at other times, they knowingly interacted with adaptive algorithms (non-social condition). We used computational modeling of behavior to characterize participants' cooperation strategies and latent cognitive variables that govern them. We tested whether variants of economic strategies, i.e., t4t, RL models, and an economic strategy with an RL feature best described participants' behavior. We also ran simulations of the strategies that best described participants' behavior to test whether and how these different strategies produce differences in behavior.</p><p>We hypothesized that age, IQ and social skills would influence overall cooperation behavior and the underlying cognitive strategies. Prior studies on ongoing development of adolescent cooperation tendencies produced mixed results, with some studies finding that older adolescents differentiated more between trustworthy and untrustworthy agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lee et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Sijtsma et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Westhoff et al., 2020)</ref>, and others not finding such age differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Fett et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lemmers-Jansen et al., 2017)</ref>. Social skills have also been shown to be a significant predictor of cooperation tendencies in early adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Liu et al., 2023)</ref> in a one-shot game. Here, we aimed to test whether the magnitude of social skills, measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale also predicted sustained cooperation. Finally, previous studies have linked IQ to strategic decision making like the trust game. Individuals with higher IQ scores exhibited less risk aversion in the trust game <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Hula et al., 2021)</ref> and higher cooperation tendencies the stag hunt game <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Proto et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>With respect to adaptivity, we predicted that adolescents would be more generous overall and adapt more to their partners' behavior when interacting with adaptive versus fixed computer partners. In line with this hypothesis, adolescents exhibited increased cooperation frequency, generosity (average amounts shared), and reciprocity towards adaptive versus fixed partners. Based on previous findings in adults, we also hypothesized that social context would modulate cooperation behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Behrens et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Pillutla &amp; Chen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Rand et al., 2015)</ref>. Adolescents were hypothesized to show more prosocial tendencies (i.e., a higher level of forgiveness, here reinitiating cooperation after the partner defected) when believing that they played with the peer. As hypothesized, adolescents exhibited increased cooperation frequency and generosity when cooperating with a peer, and reinitiated cooperation more often after their partner defected. While across conditions, the t4t strategy outperformed RL models, adolescents relied on a more generous t4t mixture model with an updating term based in RL in the social condition. This model used an RL component to prescribe trial-by-trial increases in cooperation probabilities after a partner defected. Simulations corroborated that the generous t4t mixture model sustains cooperation over a longer period of time compared to the fixed t4t model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were enrolled at two different research sites, as detailed below.</p><p>Yale University research site: 48 adolescent participants were recruited via mailing lists and existing participant databases (27 female, mean age: 12.8±3.2). Adolescent participants were consented in the presence of at least one parent/legal guardian. We obtained both parental written informed consent and written assent from the adolescents. Adolescents were compensated $20 per hour for participation. The study was conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Human Research Protection Committee at Yale University (HIC1004006656).</p><p>George Washington University site: 19 adolescents (9 female, mean age:10.9±1.7) were recruited via advertisements on online (social media) platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, lab website) or through local recruitment and outreach events. Adolescent participants were asked for assent and at least one parent/legal guardian was asked to consent to the study. Adolescents were compensated $20 per hour for participation. The study was conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institutional review board of the George Washington University (GW) (FWA00005945).</p><p>Inclusion criteria at both research sites: Participants were recruited via online advertisements (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, lab website), local events, or internal databases. Eligible participants had no uncorrected sensory deficits (visual/hearing), neurodevelopmental disorders, learning disabilities, or immediate family members with such conditions.</p><p>The final group for our model-free analyses included 67 adolescents (36 female, mean age: 12 ± 2.98, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1C</ref>). The sample size was based on the number of participants included in previous similar studies ( <ref type="bibr">King-Casas et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang et al., 2015)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study procedures</head><p>Data was collected across two research sites: Yale and GW. The initial data collection at the Yale site served the purpose of optimizing parameters for the adaptive computer partners in the trust game. Data collection at the GW site was delayed significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the experimental task and manipulations were the same across sites and study procedures were closely matched, we aggregated data across Yale and GW sites to ensure that we have a sufficiently large sample size. At both research sites, Yale and GW, participants attended two consecutive visits.</p><p>First visit: During the first visit, cognitive testing was conducted to establish IQ. This was done to match participants for the second in-person visit. At Yale, IQ scores were determined using the Differential Ability Scales second edition (DAS-II) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Elliott et al., 2007)</ref>. At GW, IQ scores were determined using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Second Edition (WASI-II) <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Wechsler, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The primary difference between the two cohorts was that at Yale participants played the trust game with two fixed computer partners in the first visit. This occurred in the same visit as the IQ assessment. The fixed computer partners either reciprocated 30% or 70% of the time (i.e., fixed condition). Participants were given a child-friendly instruction and then played the trust game with two fixed computer partners, each programmed to reciprocate either 30% or 70% of the time (i.e., fixed condition). The order of these games was counterbalanced across participants. One participant in the Yale cohort did not complete DAS-II. This participant only contributed data to the individual fixed condition. At GW only IQ was measured in the initial visit. The procedure for the second study visit, in which participants attended in pairs did not differ between sites.</p><p>Second visit: Parents of a subset of participants across sites (N=43) filled out the SRS-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Constantino, 2013)</ref> for their child, a measure of social skills normed for typically developing and autistic samples. This measure was included to test whether adolescents' cooperation behavior was modulated by their level of social functioning in everyday life. Subsequently, participant pairs were introduced to each other and to the potential prizes that they could receive based on their performance. Participants sat next to each other in front of a computer. Desks were separated by dividers, so that participants could not see each other's screens. They first had to read instructions for the investor and trustee roles on the computer screens and were told that they may play the game in either role.</p><p>Participants were paired with a peer, matched for age, sex, race, and IQ. Participants first played an iterative economic exchange task known as the trust game <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Berg et al., 1995)</ref> in pairs. Participants did not know their partners prior to the experiment. This was verified by explicitly asking participants if they knew their partner after their joint visit. The second visit took approximately an hour to complete. Participants were told that in addition to compensation, they could receive small ($1-5 dollar equivalent), medium ($7-10 dollar equivalent), or large prizes ($10-25 dollar equivalent) based on the coins they gained during the games. Participants were told that they would sometimes play with the peer (i.e., real social condition) or with a computer algorithm (adaptive computer conditions). In fact, they only played with the peer once at the beginning of the experiment. During the remaining four games they played with the adaptive computer algorithms but were either told that they played with the peer (i.e., social condition) or with a computer partner (i.e. non-social condition).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The iterative trust game</head><p>The trust game is a well-established behavioral economics paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Berg et al., 1995)</ref> involving two players: an investor and a trustee. In the fixed and adaptive computer conditions, all participants played as investors. When playing with their peer (real social condition), participants were randomly assigned to either investor or trustee roles (see details below). Participants played a child-friendly version of the trust game with reduced task demands and more engaging graphics. We told participants that they will play the "dollar game", in which they could share coins or keep them for themselves ( <ref type="figure">Fig.1A)</ref>. In this game, investors were endowed with five coins, which they could keep to themselves or share any amount of the coins (1-5) with the trustee. If they chose share, the trustee received the endowment multiplied by four. The trustees could then choose to share half of the endowment back with the investor, or to defect and keep all coins to themselves. All games consisted of 20 rounds with the same partner, but participants were unaware of the number of rounds. The instructions explained the game in much detail including going through potential scenarios of how much money they could make when investing different numbers of coins if the partner shared back versus not. After reading the instructions on the computer screens, participants went through some example scenarios with the experimenter to test whether they understood the task.</p><p>The two study visits yielded five experimental conditions (also see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixed condition</head><p>Participants were told that they would play as investors with two different computer partners. They were not told the reciprocation probability of the computer partners. One computer partner was generous (reciprocated 70% of the time), while the other one was selfish (reciprocated 30% of the time). For response of computer partners in 30% and 70% condition, we used two prespecified sequences of keep and share behavior. The order of the generous and selfish partners was counterbalanced across participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real social condition</head><p>Pairs of participants were randomly assigned to either the trustee or the investor role during the first game of the second session and played the trust game with each other participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adaptive computer conditions</head><p>After playing the real social condition, participants played four games as investors with adaptive computer algorithms. Participants were either told that they continued to play with each other (i.e., social condition) or that they played with computer partners (i.e. non-social condition). The computer algorithms were programmed to reciprocate investor decisions based on the number of coins shared by the investor on previous and current trial. The reciprocation probability (Pshare) was determined by a sigmoid function with the inputs t, the amount shared by the investor on the current trial, and t-1, the amount shared by the investor on the previous trial. The a and b parameters manipulated the generosity level of the algorithm. The higher the a parameter the higher the likelihood of the algorithm to share back. The higher the b parameter, the greater participants tendency was to become greedy and keep if participants shared many coins on the current trials. δt= STt− STt−1 (1) Pshare = ! !"# !" * a * (%&amp;'()')(b * %&amp;')</p><p>(2) There were two versions of the algorithm to add some variability to the partner's behavior. Participants played both algorithms in two separate games in the social and non-social conditions. One of the algorithms was slightly more generous (a=0.5, b=0) than the other (a=0.5, b=0.1). The order of the four games with the adaptive algorithms (two in the social and two in the non-social condition) were counterbalanced across pairs to control for order effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study-based inclusions and exclusions</head><p>To robustly characterize reciprocation during cooperation, we excluded games with more than 25% missed responses within each game. Two games from the non-social condition and three games from the social condition were excluded across participants. No participant had to be fully excluded from the analysis (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1C</ref>).</p><p>For the computational modeling analyses, we additionally excluded participants with too little variance in behavioral responses (either keep or share on less than 10% or more than 90% of the trials, N=3). This is because our main computational models hinge on participants exhibiting some degree of variability in reciprocation behavior. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperation behavior analysis</head><p>Two types of linear mixed effect models were set up to test the overall hypothesized effects of conditions (adaptive / fixed, social / non-social adaptive) on participants trial by trial investment decisions across games. These models were either set up to predict cooperation frequency (whether participants cooperate or defect) or generosity (how many coins they shared).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall cooperation behavior</head><p>First, we assessed if adolescents' cooperation behavior differed between adaptive and fixed computer conditions. To this end, we used linear mixed-effects models (LME) with a random intercept per participant as implemented in the lme4 package in R (www.r-project.org R Core Team, 2014). We performed these analyses separately for cooperation frequency (the percentage of share decisions across the rounds of the game), and generosity (average coins shared across rounds in each game range from 0 to 5), which adds more granularity comparing with the cooperation frequency. Differences in cooperation decisions between adaptive vs. fixed partners and social vs. nonsocial conditions We specified six LME models to test main effects of age, IQ and social skills based on our hypotheses as well as interactions between these demographic variables (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> for all LME models used in cooperation behavior analysis). Model 1 tested whether adolescents' cooperation frequency was predicted by partner adaptivity (fixed versus adaptive). Specifically, due to the significant differences in age and IQ shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we included those as random intercept for differences between adaptive vs. fixed partners. Model 2 tested the effects of adaptivity (fixed versus adaptive), age, IQ, and social skills (SRS) on cooperation frequency. Model 3 tested the interaction between adaptivity and the demographic variables age, IQ, and social skills. Models 4-6 followed the same logic but predicting generosity instead of cooperation frequency. Analogous analyses were also conducted to test the differences between social and non-social conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperation behavior regarding partner's reciprocal decision</head><p>To quantify overall adaptivity of participants to the trustees' behavior, we investigated cooperation frequency and generosity for these three options: 1) after the trustee kept, 2) after the trustee shared back and, 3) after the participant defected. We compared differences in cooperation frequency and generosity for each of these options separately. Differences in reciprocation between adaptive vs. fixed partners and between social vs. nonsocial conditions For each of the three response type options, we specified six LME models. Three models tested the effects of adaptivity on cooperation frequency and generosity, and the other three tested the effects of social context analogously (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> for a detailed list of models tested). Additionally, due to the significant differences in age and IQ shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we included those as random intercept for differences between adaptive vs. fixed partners</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sustaining Cooperation</head><p>Differences in sustained cooperation between adaptive vs. fixed partners and social vs. nonsocial conditions We assessed whether adolescents' tendency to sustain cooperation over the course of the game differed based on adaptivity or social context. We used generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) with a random intercept per participant as implemented in the lme4 package to test the interaction between time (i.e. game trial) and adaptivity / social context. Model 1 tested whether adolescents' cooperation frequency was predicted by time, partner adaptivity (fixed versus adaptive) and their interaction. Specifically, due to the significant differences in age and IQ shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we included those as random intercept for differences between Adaptive vs. Fixed partners. Model 2 tested the effects of time, adaptivity (fixed versus adaptive), age, IQ, and social skills on cooperation frequency. Model 3 tested the interaction between time, adaptivity and the demographic variables age, IQ, and social skills. Three LME models were set up analogous to the ones above but exploring the difference between social and non-social conditions instead of adaptivity (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling</head><p>We tested whether a well-established economic strategy, t4t, or RL models that formalize how agents learn about their partners over time were better in describing adolescents' cooperation strategies in the investor role. Importantly, we aimed to capture the underlying differences between cooperation decisions in fixed versus adaptive and non-social versus social conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcement Learning models</head><p>A variant of the Rescorla-Wagner updating rule was used to describe how participants adjust their cooperation decision based on feedback from the trustee on a trial-by-trial basis.</p><p>On each trial (t) in which the investor (i.e. participant) shared, participants observe the trustee's response (Ft). This feedback is used to update their current expected response (ER). The prediction error (PE) quantifies the mismatch between their current expected response and the feedback. The PE is weighted by the learning rate α, which is a free parameter that adjusts how much recent the expected response is updated based on feedback:</p><p>(1) ER $"! = ER $ + α PE $ (3) (2) PEt = Ft − ERt On the first trial, ERt0 is initialized as 0.5, which can be regarded as an uninformative prior meaning that the two options of the trustee, reciprocation or defection, are equally likely. In the social condition, ERt0 was initialized as the average reciprocation frequency of their human partner in the real social condition (i.e., the percentage of trials that their partner shared when partners played with each other). This was done because participants always played the real social condition first and in the social condition participants were told that they continued to play with their partner, When the investor chose to keep all their coins, the trustee had no response option, meaning that nothing could be learned about the trustee behavior. We assumed that the investor was inherently motivated to repair trust after defection by rebuilding the trustee's confidence in their trustworthiness. This assumption was captured by an additional function that was activated after investor keep trials with a free confidence parameter ( ). The function describes the assumption that the trustee would have reciprocated if the investor had shared coins with them. Therefore, the feedback (Ft) was set to 1. The prediction error (PEkeep) was calculated as follows:</p><p>(3) PE %##&amp;,$ = 1 − ERt The degree to which this PE is incorporated into their future decisions is determined by the confidence parameter ( ). The higher this parameter, the more participants apply the prediction error and opt to repair trust accordingly in the future.</p><p>(4) ERt+1 = ERt + × PE %##&amp;,$</p><p>(4) Finally, the investor's probability of sharing with the trustee (Probt) was computed based on their ER at each time point as described in the sigmoid function below. How precisely the ER was implemented into this share probability depended on the decision noise ( ) as specified in the sigmoid function. The RL full model has three free parameters: learning rate (α), confidence ( ) and decision noise ( ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(5) Probt = ! !"# +,'("!-./ 0<label>(5)</label></formula><p>We also set up two simpler model variations as follows: The generous RL model has three free parameters: learning rate (α), a free parameter that determines the generosity (ω) and decision noise ( ). This simpler model describes the likelihood of reengaging with the trustee using the free parameter (ω) on trials in which investors kept the following equation is activated. When the investor chose to keep all their coins, the trustee had no response option:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(6) ERkeep, t+1 = ω (7) Probkeep = ! !"# +,'("!-./ 0<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The RL fixed model has two free parameters: learning rate (α) and decision noise ( ). This model prescribes that participants do not repair trust and continue to keep after their first defection, thereby ending their interaction with their partner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tit for tat strategies</head><p>The t4t economic strategy prescribes that investors match the behavior of their interaction partners; they share when the trustee shares and defect after the trustee defected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(8) ERt+1 = Ft</head><p>We introduced a generous t4t strategy with an RL confidence term, which allows the investors to repair trust by reinitiating cooperation after they or their partners defected. As in the RL full model above, the t4t full model has an RL component with a confidence parameter ( ) that prescribes that investors rebuild confidence in the trustees over time. This t4t full model has two free parameters: confidence ( ) and decision noise ( ). On each trial (t) in which the investor (i.e. participant) shared, participants mimic the trustee's response (Ft). On the first trial, Ft0 is initialized as 0.5, which can be regarded as a 50 percent probability for either of the two options of the trustee -reciprocation or defection.</p><p>(9) ERt+1 = ERt + κ × PE %##&amp;,$ (8) (10) PE %##&amp;,$ = 1 − ERt The probability of sharing (Prob) is given by a sigmoid function as specified below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(11) Probt = ! !"# +,'("!-./ 0<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Analogously to the RL models, we also introduced two simpler t4t strategies. The standard generous t4t model has two free parameters: free parameter (ω) that describes the participants' probability of reengaging with the partner after the partner's defect decision and decision noise ( ). The t4t fixed model has one decision noise ( ) as free parameter. This is the classical t4t model which assumes that participants continue to keep the coins after the first defection, because they are not reinitiating cooperation. This model describes agents that cut ties to their partner after a first defection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fitting and model comparison</head><p>To test whether participants' cooperation strategies differed between conditions, we first fitted each model variant for each participant and condition (fixed30, fixed70, adaptive nonsocial, and adaptive social) separately. The optimization algorithm used likelihood estimation for model fitting as implemented in the fminserach routine in MATLAB. For each condition, model evidence was assessed at the group level using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We compared BIC values of each variant of the two main models. For this fixed-effects analysis, we calculated the log-group Bayes factor (BF) by computing the summed BIC scores across participants and each model and then subtracting this value from the value of the reference model (worst performing model). The fixed-effects model comparisons identified the best version of the t4t and RL models for each condition.</p><p>We performed a bootstrapping analysis on BIC scores and a random-effect model comparison to arbitrate between the best fitting versions of the t4t and RL for each condition. For bootstrapping analysis, we computed the 95% confidence intervals of the summed difference in model evidence via BIC using 100000 iterations for each model. The Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Stephan et al., 2009)</ref> characterizes both the population distributions over a model's parameters as well as each individual subject's parameters given the population distribution. We compared the protected exceedance probability (PXP) of these two models, which indicates the probability that the model is the most likely model across participants and tested models. This approach considers the null hypothesis that any difference between model frequencies is due to chance.</p><p>To investigate whether developmental and social cognitive differences were reflected in computational model metrics, we set up linear regression models (LM) in R. We tested the effects of the continuous predictors age in months, age squared, and social skills via total SRS raw scores on model metrics derived from the winning computational model. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulated cooperation behavior</head><p>To determine whether the prescribed strategies that were used to describe participants' behavior were differentiable when playing with the adaptive trustee algorithms, we simulated games between artificial investors that played according to the prescribed strategies and adaptive trustee algorithms. To this end, we let the winning computational models play the trust game against the two adaptive trustee algorithms. To approximate participants' choices during the game, the simulations were using the entire range of possible investor choices from zero to five coins. On the first trial, the model randomly chose to share between one and five coins on the first trial. Subsequent decisions were based on the responses of the adaptive trustee algorithms. For each model we simulated 1000 games.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational modeling analysis</head><p>We fitted variants of two types of models to participants' cooperation decisions.

We performed a fixed effects analysis to identify the best performing model variant within RL and t4t model types for each condition. We investigated which of these best performing model variants of each model fit participants data best, using a fixed-effects model comparison and computed the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the BIC differences using bootstrapping.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we set out to test how adolescents' cooperation tendency differed based on partner adaptivity and social context (knowingly interacting with a computer versus believing that they interact with a human). We found that adolescents were more generous when cooperating with adaptive versus fixed computer partners. Social context also modulated adolescents' cooperation behavior. We found that adolescents were more generous in the social condition, when believing that they interacted with a human compared to the non-social condition, when knowingly cooperating with a computer partner. In line with the notion that social skills are becoming more refined in adolescence, we found that age was modulating the effects of partner adaptivity and social context -older participants cooperated more in adaptive versus fixed and social versus nonsocial conditions.</p><p>Computational modeling revealed that adolescents used a fixed t4t strategy in both fixed and non-social conditions. According to this strategy, adolescents do not repair trust once, they decided to defect. In the social condition, participants relied on a more generous t4t strategy (t4t full model), which included an RL based belief updating function that was activated when participants defected. The confidence parameter of this function, which determined how fast participants repair trust, was modulated by age. Younger and older adolescents were more likely to repair trust than those in the middle age group. Model simulations corroborated that the fixed and full t4t models made distinguishable predictions -the fixed strategies led to overall less cooperation and less sustained reciprocity compared to the generous strategy.</p><p>Cooperation hinges on partner adaptivity and social context Partner adaptivity played an important role in cooperation. Adolescents were more generous when cooperating with adaptive versus fixed computer partners. This finding is in line with previous studies on strategic social decision making, showing that adults engage more with adaptive partners compared to opponents with fixed strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Engemann et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fang et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Harris, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Rilling et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Yoshida et al., 2010)</ref>.

Their capacity for continuous learning enhances their partners' motivation to sustain cooperation over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Karalunas et al., 2018)</ref>. In line with this notion, adolescents sustained cooperation more over the course of the game when playing with adaptive as opposed to fixed algorithms. Cooperation typically decreases over the course of iterative games as the probability that the present round is the last one increases and partners may be more tempted to reap the benefits of defection without facing negative consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Efferson et al., 2016)</ref>. This overall pattern was also observed in the current study. Participants' cooperation decreased over time across games, but adolescents were more likely to sustain cooperation when playing with adaptive partners compared to fixed partners. This suggests that participants deem fixed algorithms to have a higher chance of exploitation because of lacking reciprocity over the course of the game.</p><p>Like partner adaptivity, we found that social context plays a pivotal role in cooperation. Despite interacting with the same algorithms, adolescents were more generous in the social condition, when believing that they interacted with a human compared to the non-social condition, when knowingly cooperating with a computer partner. We found that adolescents were more generous in the social condition and showed a greater degree of coaxing, reengaging with the trustees when they believed them to be a peer. Specifically, they reinitiated cooperation more often after the trustee previously defected. Computational modeling results corroborated these findings. The model that best described participants' behavior in the social condition prescribes reengaging with a partner after defection. In contrast, in the fixed and non-social conditions, participants relied on simpler tit for tat strategies that prescribe ending reciprocity after the first defection.</p><p>Repairing trust and reciprocation hinges on social context Adolescents showed higher rates of cooperation and more sustained cooperation, reengaging with a partner after defection, when believing that they played with their human partner. This higher level of pro-social behavior may stem from the fact that individuals empathize and ascribe intentions to people but not to artificial agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adolphs, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Malle et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Todorov et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Zelazo et al., 2023)</ref>.

In this study coaxing is represented an investor's decision to reinitiate cooperation after previously defecting, thereby risking exploitation by a partner who might retaliate for previously defecting. In line with the previous literature, we find that adolescents show coaxing more in the social condition, when participants believed that they played with their peer. Mirroring these behavioral patterns, computational modeling analyses showed that participants used a more generous t4t strategy with an RL confidence in the social condition. This term prescribed increasing confidence levels on a trial-by-trial basis and reinitiating cooperation after defection. Model simulations corroborated that this strategy leads to more sustained cooperation than the fixed t4t strategy that best described adolescent behavior in nonsocial conditions.</p></div>

Older adolescents showed a higher level of generosity in adaptative versus fixed conditions, showing a higher willingness to establish trust and cooperation with adaptive partners. Older participants also differentiated more between social and nonsocial conditions, by showing greater generosity towards trustees when believing them to be their human partners. This is in line with the observation that with increasing age, adolescents become more motivated to establish and maintain positive peer relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Flook et al., 2019)</ref> as peers exert the greatest influence on cooperative behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Crone &amp; Dahl, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lafontana &amp; Antonius, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Nelson et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Younger and older adolescents were more likely to repair trust after defection than those in the middle age group.

In line with this literature, we found a quadratic age effect on the ability to repair trust when adolescents were playing under social condition. The middle age group of 10-15-year-olds were less likely to repair trust after defection compared to those in the older and younger age range.</p><p>Cognitive skills, measured by standardized IQ measures, were also predictive of both adaptivity and social context. Paralleling the effects of age, adolescents with higher IQ scores showed greater generosity and were more likely to repair trust. This effect was more pronounced when playing with an adaptive versus fixed partner. Cognitive skills have been previously shown to play an important role in initiating mutually beneficial behavior on strategic tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alaoui et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Jones, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">McNally et al., 2012)</ref>. For instance, in line with our findings, it has been shown that group with higher IQs converge to full cooperation in complex economic games such as repeated prisoner's dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bolling et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Downs &amp; Smith, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Huang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Proto et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Proto et al., , 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Stanovich &amp; West, 2000)</ref>. In addition to cognitive skills, social skills measured by SRS scores was also predictive of the level of generosity in social contexts. In accordance with previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Liu et al., 2023)</ref> and our hypotheses, adolescents with higher social skill as measured by the showed greater generosity in social condition comparing with non-social condition. The gap of generosity between social and non-social condition was larger in adolescents with higher social skills comparing with adolescents with lower social skills.</p><p>To summarize, we have demonstrated that adolescence is a crucial developmental stage for the emergence of cooperative behavior, which was influenced by both partner adaptivity and social context. Reinitiating cooperation after previous defection was unique to the social condition, highlighting that adolescents are selectively prosocial if they believe their partner to be a peer. While this study makes an important contribution to understanding how adolescents sustain cooperation with different kinds of agents, from fixed algorithms to real social partners, there are several limitations.</p><p>First, the sample size of the study is rather small given the large age range of participants. This is due to the constraints imposed by the relatively sophisticated study design (e.g., inviting two race, sex, age, and IQ matched peers) and to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on in-person research participation. Second, to reduce task demands for the younger age group, we opted to include a more restricted version of the trust game with less options. Third, although participants thought that they were interacting with a peer in the social condition, the behavioral patterns of their real partners deviated from that of the adaptive algorithms and this may have raised some suspicion in investors, albeit no participant mentioned that they did not believe our manipulation. Finally, participants did not play the first real social exchange game in the same condition, and this may have influenced how they perceived their human partner. Half of the participants played in the investor role and the other half played the trustee role.</p><p>An important next step is assessing a larger number of participants, which would be more feasible in an online setting. These studies would have to replicate the behavioral patterns in this more controlled study. Such a larger study would also allow to build adaptive algorithms based on the behavior of real adolescent trustees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Taken together, our study makes an important contribution to characterizing adolescent tendencies in sustaining cooperation. It shows that adolescents systematically adapt their cooperation behavior based on their partner's adaptivity and task context. Adolescents are more generous when playing with adaptive partners particularly when believing them to be peers. This social context motivates adolescents to cooperate more frequently and to invest a larger proportion of coins on average. Social context also elicited more prosocial tendencies, such as repairing trust. Adolescents actively reinitiated cooperation after previously defecting, when they believe that they play with a human partner. Conversely, when knowingly playing with a computer algorithm, they were more likely to continue to defect. We also found significant developmental and individual differences in cooperation based on IQ and social skills of participants. Older adolescents and those with higher IQs were more sensitive to adaptivity and social context. The middle age showed less prosocial tendencies in the social condition compared to younger and older peers. They were less likely to repair trust after a mutual defection in comparing with older and younger adolescents. Adolescents with higher social skills were more sensitive to social context where they showed more prosocial tendencies in the social condition compared to non-social condition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>frequency ~ adaptivity + (1|Age) + (1|IQ) Model 2: Cooperation frequency ~ adaptivity + Age + IQ + SRS Model 3: Cooperation frequency ~ adaptivity * (Age + IQ + SRS) Model 4: Generosity ~ adaptivity Model 5: Generosity ~ adaptivity + Age + IQ + SRS Model 6: Generosity ~ adaptivity * (Age + IQ + SRS) Social vs. Non-social conditions Model 1: Cooperation frequency ~ social Model 2: Cooperation frequency ~ social + Age + IQ + SRS Model 3: Cooperation frequency ~ social * (Age + IQ + SRS) Model 4: Generosity ~ social Model 5: Generosity ~ social + Age + IQ + SRS Model 6: Generosity ~ social * (Age + IQ + SRS) Cooperation Behavior Regarding Partner's Reciprocal Decision 2.
