			<abstract>
				<p>Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by extreme concerns about food and weight. These concerns are linked to changes in decision-making, such as persisting with actions that are no longer rewarding. This study tested whether people with eating disorder symptoms show increased persistence due to altered decision thresholds for behavioural adaptation. A group with heightened concerns about eating (ED; N=48) and a healthy control group (HC; N=56) completed a foraging task, in which an option on screen was exploited for reward. With each decision to exploit, reward feedback decreased and participants had to decide when to move on to a new option. Each block was time limited to 7.5 minutes. Behavioural persistence was measured as the number of seconds spent exploiting each option. Decision thresholds were measured when deciding to move on, as the counterfactual reward that would have been received for an exploit action. We predicted that the ED group would show increased persistence and decreased decision thresholds (i.e. lower counterfactual reward when deciding to move on). We found no evidence for these predictions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the ED group exhibited progressively faster response times (RTs) when approaching the time limit for each block. This increase in motor vigour correlated with the severity of eating disorder symptoms and total rewards earned. Our results point to changing motor vigour as a potential transdiagnostic marker of ED tendencies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Extreme preoccupation with food and weight loss are defining characteristics of Anorexia Nervosa <ref type="bibr">(AN)</ref>. Research indicates that people with AN make different decisions from the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Guillaume et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Radzikowska et al., 2023)</ref>. When given the choice between different foods, people with AN choose high fat foods significantly less than people who are otherwise healthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Foerde et al., 2015)</ref>, a pattern of decision-making that persists even after weight has been restored <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Foerde et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Although it is clear that discrete choices between food options are altered in AN, other decision-making processes also contribute to the condition. To illustrate, imagine making a decision about how long to exercise before stopping, or whether to continue fasting when initial feelings of hunger arise. In such cases, one intuition is that a person with AN will persist for longer than the general population, exercising for longer before stopping or fasting for longer before eating. Indeed, current evidence suggests that exercise duration increases with restrictive eating symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rizk et al., 2015)</ref> and individuals with AN continue using decision rules once they become irrelevant, longer than healthy controls do <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Filoteo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Steinglass et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wu et al., 2014)</ref>. One hypothesis that emerges from these findings is that people with restrictive eating disorders (EDs) struggle to disengage from actions or activities, even when it would be beneficial.</p><p>Computational studies of restrictive eating disorders suggest that difficulties adapting behaviour when needed could arise from a combination of reduced exploratory behaviour and increased perseveration <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Filoteo et al., 2014)</ref>. Reduced risk aversion could also contribute in certain cases, increasing persistence when actions lead to illness consistent outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Jenkinson et al., 2024)</ref>. In addition to these changes, decision-making in AN and subclinical EDs becomes less model-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Foerde et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Onysk &amp; Seriès, 2022)</ref>, a form of behavioural control that normally supports flexible adjustment to changing circumstances <ref type="bibr">(Voon et al., 2017)</ref>. Based on current evidence, there are several candidate mechanisms that could contribute to maladaptive persistence in restrictive EDs.</p><p>One theoretical possibility that has not been considered is an altered threshold for adapting behaviour. This idea is formalised in Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT), which examines when to leave an option as its reward decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Stephens &amp; Krebs, 1986)</ref>. Under certain conditions, the normative solution is to adapt behaviour (leave the current option) when its reward falls below a decision threshold, set to the average environmental reward rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Charnov, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hayden et al., 2011)</ref>. This implies that failures to adapt could be due to an abnormal decision threshold. In the case of deciding how long to exercise, for example, the diminishing returns of continued exercise would have to drop to a lower level before a person decides to stop. The application of Optimal Foraging Theory has revealed altered decision thresholds in addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addicott et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Raio et al., 2022)</ref>, but has so far not been used to examine failures to adapt in restrictive EDs.</p><p>Based on research suggesting maladaptive persistence in restrictive EDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Filoteo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Steinglass et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rizk et al., 2015)</ref>, the present experiment aimed to test whether individuals with restrictive ED symptoms show increased persistence due to altered decision thresholds for adapting their behaviour. Based on Optimal Foraging Theory, we predicted this would be seen in a computerised foraging task as: 1) more time spent exploiting each option before deciding to disengage from it (increased persistence) and 2) exploiting options down to lower levels of reward before disengaging (a decreased decision threshold).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To investigate whether individuals with restrictive eating symptoms persist with actions for longer before stopping, we ran a multi-stage online experiment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). In the first stage, prospective participants completed the Eating Attitudes Test <ref type="bibr">(EAT-26;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Garner et al., 1982)</ref>, where higher scores indicate greater concerns about eating. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Onysk &amp; Seriès (2022)</ref>, individuals with scores 14 or above were included in an 'eating disorder' (ED) group and individuals with scores below 10 were included in a 'healthy control' (HC) group. People in the ED group did not necessarily have a diagnosed eating disorder and we use this label purely to distinguish the participant group with higher concerns about eating.</p><p>In the second stage of the experiment, participants completed a more extensive questionnaire set that again measured eating attitudes, but additionally measured body image, anxiety and depression, sensitivity towards uncertainty and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The questionnaires used are listed in the methods section under materials.</p><p>In the third stage of the experiment, participants completed a decision task ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>). The task was themed as a treasure collection game, in which participants controlled a pirate ship and sailed to different islands to search for buried treasure. On each island, participants could select between two actions: digging for treasure (an exploit decision) and leaving the island (a leave decision). After an exploit decision, reward feedback appeared showing the number of gold medallions earned. With each successive exploit action, the reward decreased, forcing participants to decide when to leave the current island. When a leave decision was finally made, participants experienced a travel delay while sailing to the next island. This structure continued for 7.5 minutes, at which point the block ended. Participants were shown the remaining block time in the top right corner of the screen. Islands are called patches hereafter for consistency with Optimal Foraging Theory.</p><p>Participants completed four blocks in total. Across blocks, we manipulated how quickly rewards declined with each successive exploit decision in a patch (the decay rate), and the travel time between patches. These manipulations took place in a 2x2 factorial design, in which the factors were decay rate (fast x slow) and travel time (short x long). Optimal Foraging Theory predicts that faster reward decay and shorter travel times should result in earlier leaving times. We used these predictions to validate the experimental task. Our primary interest was testing the predictions that people with restrictive eating symptoms would spend longer in each patch and leave patches at lower levels of reward.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Garner et al., 1982)</ref>. Participants were sorted based on their scores. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Onysk &amp; Seriès (2022)</ref>, those with scores of 14 or higher were assigned to the eating disorder (ED) group and those with scores below 10 were assigned to the healthy control (HC) group. From this stage on, the groups proceeded in parallel tracks. Participants from each group were invited to complete a full questionnaire set that assessed eating behaviours and attitudes, body image, anxiety and depression, as well as intolerance for uncertainty and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. In the final stage, participants were invited to complete a decision task. B: During the decision task, participants sailed to islands to dig for buried treasure. Sailing to an island involved a 2.5s or 9s delay. After arriving, participants could choose between an exploit action (digging) or leaving to sail to a new island. An exploit action resulted in reward feedback, after which participants faced a new decision about whether to exploit or leave. With each successive exploit action on the current island, the reward decreased (fast decay rate = 0.81; slow decay rate = 0.91). Across blocks, we manipulated the travel time between islands and how quickly the reward depleted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental manipulations produced changes in leaving time</head><p>We first validated our experimental manipulations. Leaving times are expected to change based on how fast patch values decline and the travel time between patches. Patches that decline in value faster lead to earlier leaving times, as do shorter travel times between patches. Consistent with these expectations, we observed significant main effects of decay rate and travel time on the number of seconds participants spent in each patch before leaving (decay: X 2 (1, N=104)=285.23, p&lt;.001; travel time: X 2 (1, N=104)=116.66, p&lt;.001). Participants spent fewer seconds in each patch when rewards dropped quickly (M=11s) compared to slowly (M=17.4s). Participants similarly spent fewer seconds in each patch when travel times were short (M=12.1s) compared to long (M=16.4s). These results confirm that participant behaviour was sensitive to the experimental manipulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group characteristics</head><p>Having validated the experimental task, we examined the characteristics of each participant group <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. The ED and HC groups were comparable in age, gender and education. Mean scores on all questionnaires differed between the groups (see Supp. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). As multiple questionnaires were used to measure similar constructs (e.g. concerns about eating, anxiety), we performed a factor analysis to identify transdiagnostic factors spanning across specific measures <ref type="bibr">(Wise, Robinson and Gillan, 2023)</ref>. This resulted in three factors: Factor 1 (F1: Eating attitudes) loaded mainly on questionnaires concerned with eating attitudes and appearance anxiety (EAT-26, EDE-Q, AAI). Factor 2 (F2: Uncertainty sensitivity) was characterised by questionnaires measuring intolerance to uncertainty and partially by obsessive-compulsive tendencies (IOU and OCI). Factor 3 (F3: Anxiety and depression) loaded predominantly on trait anxiety and depression measures (STAI-T, BDI). For full factor loadings, see Supp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Scores on all three factors differed between the groups. Despite differences in eating attitudes (F1), the groups had comparable BMIs. Statistics are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. These results confirm that the experimental procedure was successful in recruiting two distinct participant groups, who differed in their levels of concern about eating. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ED and control groups showed comparable leaving behaviour</head><p>We next tested our experimental predictions: 1) that the ED group would spend longer in each patch before leaving and 2) that the ED group would exploit each patch down to a lower reward level before leaving. Contrary to the first prediction, we did not detect an effect of group on the number of seconds spent in each patch (M ED =13.17s, SD ED =5.07, M HC =13.72s, SD HC =4.94, X 2 (1, N=104)=0. <ref type="bibr">51, p=0.475)</ref>. Contrary to the second prediction, we did not detect a significant main effect of group on the prospective patch reward, at the time participants decided to leave (M ED =37.40 points, SD ED =12.09, M HC =37.83 points, SD HC =13.96, X 2 (1, N=104)=0.001, p=0.973).</p><p>As patch rewards decline monotonically, the prospective reward for exploiting is a good approximation of a patch's current reward level. The pattern of results above did not change when considering more specific interactions. The time in each patch was not influenced by an interaction between group and travel time ( <ref type="bibr">22, p=0.270)</ref>, nor by an interaction between group and decay rate (X 2 (1, N=104)=0.13, p=0.722). The prospective patch reward was not influenced by an interaction between group and travel time (X 2 (1, N=104) =0.44, p=0.509), nor by an interaction between group and decay rate (X 2 (1, N=104)=0.001, p=0.974).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X 2 (1, N=104)=1.</formula><p>These results suggest that the ED and control groups showed comparable decisions about when to disengage from each option. The left panel shows the predicted group difference, in which the ED group is expected to spend longer in each patch before deciding to leave. The middle panel shows the expected data profile in the case of no group difference. The right panel shows the empirical patch residence time for the ED and HC groups. B: Leaving threshold. The left panel shows the predicted group difference, in which the reward prospect for an exploit decision is lower at the time of leaving for the ED group. As patch rewards decrease monotonically, the reward prospect for exploiting is a useful measure of current patch value, and thus the reward level/threshold at which patches are abandoned. The middle panel shows the expected data profile in the case of no group difference. The right panel shows the empirical leaving threshold for the ED and HC groups. A-B: Dots show data from individual participants.</p><p>ED group showed increasing response vigour Next we performed a set of exploratory analyses, to ask whether there were alternative markers distinguishing the ED and HC groups. One strong group difference was evident in how much participants' reaction times changed as a function of remaining time in each block (total block length: 720 sec; visible to participants). We observed a significant interaction between group and remaining time in the block on choice RTs (X 2 (1, N=104)=39.01, p&lt;0.001). Follow-up tests comparing the change in RTs between groups revealed that the ED group showed a stronger reduction in RTs with increasing block time, compared to the HC group (B HC = -1.91e-04, B ED = -5.06e-04, B ED-HC =-3.15e-04, SEM=4.92e-05, z ratio =6.406, p&lt;.0001). Providing some intuition, the HC group took on average 0.37s to respond at the end of the block compared to 0.42s at the beginning of the block, while the ED group took about 0.27s to respond at the end compared to 0.38s at the beginning (coded as: beginning = 1st-10th remaining time quantile; end = 91st-100th remaining time quantile). The difference in RT between HC and ED groups was already significant in the first 10% of trials (independent samples t-test, t(77)=-2.55, p=.013).</p><p>To assess whether this effect was specific to eating attitudes, we compared regression models that used either the pre-assigned group membership (HC/ED) or the estimated factors F1 (eating attitudes), F2 (uncertainty sensitivity) or F3 (anxiety and depression) as the individual difference variable. The model that best predicted RTs across time was the model using F1 (eating attitudes), which was evident in a lower AICc score (-27947.8) compared to the other models (group: -27916.1, F2: -27898.6, F3: -27874.0). This indicates that eating attitudes were the best predictor of the decreasing RT effect. This was further supported by looking at the X 2 values for the interaction of the factor scores (F1-3) with remaining time within each model. The F1:remaining-time interaction was by far the strongest (X 2 (1, N=104)=79.66, p&lt;.001), although F2 and F3 interactions with remaining time were also significant; F2: (X 2 (1, N=104)=27.78, p&lt;.001); F3: (X 2 (1, N=104)=10.41, p=0.001; Supp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). Correlation results were consistent with this pattern, indicating a robust association between higher eating concerns (F1 scores) and RT acceleration, r(102)=0.276, p=0.005 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig 3B)</ref>.</p><p>In a final set of exploratory analyses, we tested whether group membership and continuous restrictive eating symptoms were related to performance. The ED group earned more reward on average than HCs (R ED =44058, R HC =42530), although this increase was not statistically significant, X 2 (1, N =104) = 2.03, p=0.15). When looking at continuous variation in restrictive eating symptoms, we found that the F1 factor had a positive correlation with overall reward, r(102)=0.205, p=0.036 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig 3C)</ref>. Together, the results in this section suggest that ED symptoms were associated with both increasing response vigour and better performance. Increasing vigour effect by group.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present experiment aimed to test the hypothesis that individuals with subclinical restrictive EDs take longer to disengage from actions or activities that are no longer rewarding. To measure time until disengagement, we used a theoretical framework called Optimal Foraging Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Stephens &amp; Krebs, 1986)</ref>, in which a single option is exploited at a time as its reward decreases, and people must decide when to disengage from it. We predicted that a subclinical ED group would (1) spend longer exploiting each option and (2) that each option's reward prospect would be lower when deciding to leave, in comparison to HCs. Contrary to these predictions, the ED group showed comparable exploitation times and comparable reward prospects at the point of leaving. Unexpectedly, exploratory analyses identified robust group differences in the RT domain. RTs for the ED group decreased throughout each block, significantly more than the HC group. Follow-up analyses showed that eating attitudes was the strongest predictor of this effect. Moreover, eating attitudes reflected a broad range of ED symptoms associated with all three traditional diagnostic categories (anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder). Together, these factors indicate that ED symptoms are associated with increasing response vigour under time pressure and that this could be a transdiagnostic marker of eating disorders, which includes symptoms from multiple ED subcategories.</p><p>Increasing motor vigour in the ED group is consistent with past research reporting faster RTs in acute AN, which could indicate more efficient processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(King et al., 2016)</ref> or reduced dependence on reward that lowers deliberation time and results in more automatic responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Steinglass &amp; Walsh, 2016)</ref>. The ED group might also have been calibrating motor vigour to maximise reward rate. This interpretation can be explained with reference to Yoon et al. <ref type="formula">2018</ref>, who demonstrated a normative relationship between motor vigour and reward rate during foraging. In their framework, the average reward rate depends on both patch leaving times and the vigour with which one moves to the next patch. Hence, motor vigour itself is an explicit variable available for optimisation. Travel times between patches were fixed in the present experiment. However, high-level principles from Yoon et al. (2018) can be applied: participants could increase their reward rate through increasing their motor vigour within patches. Indeed, further analysis showed that participants who sped up more within each patch tended to earn higher reward overall, r(102)=.232, p=.018.</p><p>Two possible biological candidates for changing response vigour are dopamine and serotonin. Previous theoretical work has proposed that tonic dopamine could encode the average reward rate across time, enabling increased response vigour when reward rate is high <ref type="bibr">(Niv et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Niv, 2007)</ref>. Empirical studies have shown at least some evidence for this idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hamid et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beierholm et al., 2013)</ref>. In the present data, we observed that participants with higher concerns about eating tended to decrease their RTs the most over time and tended to earn more reward overall, suggesting a higher reward rate. This link between increased eating symptoms, increased reward rate and lower RTs could indicate a potential increase in dopamine. Previous research has suggested that serotonin has a counteracting influence to dopamine, with higher serotonin leading to increased behavioural inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kaye et al., 2009)</ref>. From this perspective, lowering serotonin might be expected to decrease inhibition and produce faster response times, as suggested in rodent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Härmson et al., 2022)</ref>. These biological candidates for increasing motor vigour in the ED group are speculative. It is also unclear which cognitive processes might sit between potential biological changes and motor responses. For instance, both dopamine and serotonin are implicated in reward monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Batten et al., 2024)</ref> and compulsive responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Robbins et al., 2024)</ref>. Future work could use pharmacological manipulations to test potential causal relationships between dopamine and serotonin in foraging behaviour under time pressure, in people with heightened concerns about eating.</p><p>One interesting implication of our findings is that ED symptoms are associated with more adaptive changes in (motor) behaviour. This observation contrasts with most previous studies that report less flexible behaviour in restrictive EDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Filoteo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Steinglass et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rizk et al., 2015)</ref>. Although unexpected, our findings resonate with a recent experiment, which found more flexible adjustments in learning rate between task environments in women who had recovered from AN <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pike et al., 2023)</ref>. We note that their experiment did not show a difference between a subclinical ED group and HCs, however.</p><p>Previous studies on restrictive eating have proposed several possible mechanisms for maladaptive persistence, including reduced goal-directed control <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Foerde et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Onysk &amp; Seriès, 2022)</ref>, reduced risk aversion in disorder relevant contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Jenkinson et al., 2023)</ref>, as well as reduced exploratory behaviour and increased perseveration <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Filoteo et al., 2014)</ref>. One motivation for the present experiment was to test an alternative mechanism for increased persistence, in which an internal threshold for adapting behaviour is altered in restrictive EDs. Under Optimal Foraging Theory, decisions to interrupt an ongoing pattern of behaviour can occur when immediate reward falls below an internal decision threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Charnov, 1976)</ref>. To measure this internal threshold, we used the average reward prospect when people decided to leave each option but found no difference between ED and HC groups, suggesting comparable thresholds for adapting behaviour. One possible reason could be the abstract decision task used, which was not specific to EDs. This is relevant because past research indicates that, although some cognitive changes in restrictive EDs can be detected in abstract settings (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Foerde et al., 2021)</ref>, other changes are visible in disorder-relevant settings <ref type="bibr">(Jenkinson et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Onysk &amp; Seriès, 2022)</ref>. In addition, there is good reason to be critical about the hypothesis that individuals with restrictive eating disorders are more persistent in general, without considering how persistence is regulated in different contexts. When eating, for example, individuals with Anorexia Nervosa clearly do not persist in their consumption, with reduced calorie intake and a slower eating rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sysko et al., 2005)</ref>, although mealtimes themselves can be longer due to more non-ingestive behaviours, such as moving food around <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Tappe et al., 1998)</ref>. The implication is that our data do not preclude changes in an internal threshold for behavioural adaptation in restrictive EDs, in contexts where decisions are relevant to ED symptoms (such as choice contexts involving food, exercise or body image). Future research could therefore examine the predictions from this experiment in a task adapted to EDs, with the predicted direction of changes in decision threshold set on the basis of relevant symptoms.</p><p>To conclude, the present experiment did not find evidence for a change in the decision threshold used to adapt behaviour in restrictive EDs. These findings do not rule out a change in decision threshold in contexts relevant to ED symptoms, such as food, exercise and body image. Instead, we found individuals with restrictive ED symptoms showed a robust increase in motor vigour over time that was higher than HCs, predicted by eating attitudes, and correlated with higher reward on the task. These findings are intriguing for at least two reasons. First, eating attitudes were the strongest predictor of speeding up under time pressure, stronger than uncertainty sensitivity or anxiety and depression symptoms (see Supp <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">. Fig. 2)</ref>. Second, eating attitudes reflected a broad range of ED symptoms (see Supp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Together, these factors point to increasing response vigour under time pressure as a potential transdiagnostic marker of ED tendencies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The final sample had a 48 participant ED group (mean age=25, mean years of education=16, mean BMI=21.94, 43 female, 5 male), and a 56 participant control group (mean age=27, mean years of education=17, mean BMI=22.74, 45 female, 11 male). Participants were separated into groups based on scores from the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Garner et al., 1982)</ref>, where higher scores indicate greater concerns about eating. Those in the ED group had scores of 14 or higher (mean=34.33), whereas those in the control group had scores below 10 (mean=3.13). These cutoffs were taken from previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Onysk &amp; Seriès, 2022)</ref>. Eleven people in the ED group indicated they had a formal ED diagnosis, compared with zero individuals in the control group (seven individuals across both groups chose not to report this information). Participants were fluent in English and did not report using medication for a neurological or psychiatric condition. Height, weight, age, gender and years of education were self-reported. Participants received £10.10 for completing the full experiment, as well as a bonus of up £2 based on performance in the decision task. Baseline compensation was distributed across the experimental stages as: £0.6 for the prescreening, £4 for the bigger questionnaire battery, and £5.50 for the decision task. The study was approved by the ethics committee at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development (approval reference i2023-03) and participants gave informed consent before taking part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Participants completed a series of questionnaires about eating attitudes and mental health. These included the EAT-26 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Garner et al., 1982)</ref>, Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fairburn &amp; Beglin, 2008)</ref>, Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Veale et al., 2014)</ref>, Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bohn &amp; Fairburn, 2008)</ref>, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Spielberger, 1983)</ref>, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beck et al., 1996)</ref>, Intolerance for Uncertainty Scale (IUS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buhr &amp; Dugas, 2002)</ref>, and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Foa et al., 2002)</ref>. Questionnaires were presented in Limesurvey (https://www.limesurvey.org/). Participants also completed a cognitive task, built in Psychopy-3 (https://www.psychopy.org; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Peirce et al., 2019)</ref> and hosted on Pavlovia (https://pavlovia.org/). The task included two cartoon stimuli that were created by icon developers Smalllikeart and Nikita Golubev (accessed from https://www.flaticon.com). Arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> were created by Atif Arshad (accessed from https://www.flaticon.com). Participants were recruited for the experiment using Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/) and tested online. Analyses were conducted in Python3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The final sample was reached using a three-step procedure. In the first step, prospective participants completed the EAT-26. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Onysk and Seriès (2022)</ref>, Prolific's prescreening tools were used to distribute the EAT-26 to relevant participants. For the ED group, invitations were sent to people who reported: 1) going on a diet in the past; 2) restricting their food intake for the last week or longer, to lose or maintain weight; and 3) a BMI below 20. The mean BMI for the eventual ED sample was 21.94, higher than the information provided by Prolific. Although Prolific's prescreening tools were used to distribute the EAT-26 to participants with BMIs&lt;20, we calculated BMIs based on self-reported height and weight from the experiment itself (shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and Supp. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). This did not affect group inclusion, which was determined using EAT-26 scores. For the HC group, invitations were the sent to people who reported: 1) not having been on a diet before; 2) not restricting food intake to manage weight in the last week; 3) a BMI below 24.9; and 4) not having a diagnosed mental health condition with an ongoing or daily impact. Participants from both groups also needed to be 18-40 years old, fluent in English and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 518 individuals completed the initial screening session.</p><p>In the second step, people with EAT-26 scores above 20 or below 10 were invited to complete the full questionnaire battery, listed in the materials section. Questionnaires were presented in a random order. 120 individuals completed the full questionnaire set, with an average completion time of 17.5 minutes. At this stage, we excluded participants who reported taking medication for low mood, anxiety or depression (N=6). We also remeasured EAT-26 scores. Individuals from the HC group with EAT-26 scores above 10, and individuals from the ED group with EAT-26 scores below 14, were excluded (N=10). The criterion for the ED group membership was lowered from 20 to 14 in the current stage based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Onysk &amp; Seriès (2022)</ref>, to account for individuals with small reductions in EAT-26 scores between stages.</p><p>In the final step, participants who completed the questionnaires and met all inclusion criteria (N=104) were invited to a decision-making task. To test our experimental predictions, we used a custom patch-leaving task, based on Optimal Foraging Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Stephens &amp; Krebs, 1986)</ref>. The general structure of a patch-leaving task is that participants are presented with an option (a "patch") that can be exploited for reward. With each round of exploitation, the reward gained from the patch decreases. In light of these declining returns, participants must decide how long to exploit the current patch before switching to a new one that might be better. The particular patch-leaving design used in this experiment combined elements from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Constantino and Daw (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hall-McMaster et al. (2021)</ref>. Participants controlled a pirate ship sailing to different islands in search of buried treasure. Each block started with a time delay as participants sailed to the first island. After arriving, participants needed to press the spacebar to dig for treasure. This revealed the number of gold medallions added to their treasure chest. Feedback was shown for 1.5s and then disappeared from the screen. Once the feedback disappeared, participants could choose to dig again (spacebar) or set sail from the island <ref type="bibr">('s' key)</ref>. No time limit was imposed for responding in the task. If the participant chose to dig again, more medallions were added to their treasure chest but it was less than the previous dig. Participants were repeatedly presented with a choice between digging or leaving the current island, until a leave decision was recorded. Once the participant chose to leave, there was a time delay while sailing to the next island. This structure continued for 7.5 minutes at which point the block ended. Throughout the block, the time remaining was shown in the top right corner of the screen. Reward dynamics in the task were controlled using precise mathematical functions. When first arriving at each island, the reward received for the first dig was drawn from a gaussian distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10. For each subsequent dig on the island, the reward received was the reward from the previous trial multiplied by a decay constant, k:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Reward t = Reward t-1 * k t</formula><p>The decay constant used on each trial, t, was drawn from a gaussian distribution with a block specific mean and a standard deviation of 0.07. If the value drawn on a trial was above 1, k was set to 1. Participants completed four blocks in total. Across blocks, we manipulated two factors known to influence optimal leaving times: decay rate and travel time. Slow reward decay within patches and short travel time between them reduce the optimal patch residence time (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Constantino &amp; Daw, 2015)</ref>. In the present experiment, the mean decay constant used in each block was either 0.81 (fast decay) or 0.91 (slow decay). The travel time in each block was either 9s (long travel time) or 2.5s (short travel time). These values were selected on the basis of simulations (Supp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). Each simulation computed the total reward per block for leaving each patch after a fixed number of actions. Simulations assumed a mean reaction time of 1 second. This allowed us to estimate optimal patch residence times (number of actions per patch) for different decay rate and travel time combinations. We then selected combinations for the experiment that were expected to produce a smooth increase in optimal residence times. One decay/travel time combination was used per block. The block order was randomised for each participant and participants did not have direct experience with the islands or the reward dynamics before starting the first block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p>Data were analysed using appropriate generalised linear models, as implemented in glmmTMB <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brooks et al., 2017)</ref> and lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref> packages. Data-appropriate distributions were selected for each analysis: reaction times and leaving times were analysed using Gamma response distribution while patch actions (discrete positive numbers) were analysed using Poisson regression. All GLMs used a log link function. Reward data were analysed using GLM with Gaussian likelihood and identity link function. All models included random intercept for participant and random slopes for within-subject factors (decay condition, travel time condition). This was determined by estimated models for all combinations of random slopes and selecting the one with lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) scores (the two metrics were in agreement in all cases). The statistical test was performed using the type II Wald χ2 test (using the car package; Fox and Weisberg, 2019). Post-hoc analyses including marginal means and slopes estimation were performed using the modelbased <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Makowski et al., 2020)</ref> and emmeans <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lenth, 2020)</ref> packages. Holm correction was applied to all post-hoc tests to control for multiple comparisons. For analyses focusing on change in RTs, the slope of RT change over time was estimated using the appropriate GLMs. For example, the following Gamma GLM with log link function was used to extract remaining-time slopes for each block:</p><p>Eq.: RT~decay_fac*travel_time*group <ref type="bibr">+ (1+decay_fac+travel_time+remaining_time | block/id)</ref> This approach removes any fixed effects from the data as well as within-subject variability associated with decay and travel time conditions, isolating the remaining time variable for each block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor analysis</head><p>The collected questionnaires (EAT-26, AAI, EDE-Q, BDI, STAI-T, IOU, OCI) were subjected to exploratory factor analysis using oblique rotation (psych::fa(); <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Revelle, 2023)</ref>. The number of factors was identified at three using the Cattel's criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cattell, Nelson &amp; Gorsuch, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cattell-Nelson-Gorsuch test)</ref> at three.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor analysis</head><p>Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Exploratory factor analysis identified three factors. F1 -Eating Attitudes, F2 -Uncertainty Sensitivity and F3 -Anxiety &amp; Depression. The Y-axis represents loadings of each item on a respective factor dimension, with every bar representing a unique questionnaire item. Colours represent which original questionnaire the items belong to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trait factors and the speeding up effect</head><p>In the main text we report an interaction effect, in which the ED group exhibited a significantly faster RT acceleration within each block. Model comparison and X 2 statistics for the factor*remaining-time interaction suggested that eating attitudes had the strongest impact on the acceleration effect. To further assess this, we performed a median split for each factor and re-plotted the data (Supp. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). The figure shows RT plots split by group (as in the main text) and split by median for each trait factor. Visual inspection of the figure confirms the statistical result: Eating attitudes appear to be associated with RT acceleration most prominently. In each panel, the more severe group (i.e. individuals with trait loadings above median value) is shown in maroon while the less severe group is shown in blue. The left-most panel corresponds directly to <ref type="figure">Figure 3A</ref>. All demonstrate the relationship between reaction times (y-axis = log seconds) over time (x-axis = remaining time in a block). The thick lines represent posterior marginal means with 95% confidence intervals. The thin lines show estimates for each individual.</p></div>

The simulations assumed a reaction time of 1s per action. The optimal number of actions are presented in Supp. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Simulated block reward for taking a given number of actions per patch. Simulations are shown for different travel times (2.5s = orange; 9s = purple) and reward decay rates (0.81 = solid lines; 0.91 = dashed lines). A dot at the top of each simulated curve represents the optimal number of actions for response times of 1s.</p></div>
