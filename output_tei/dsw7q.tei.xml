				<p>How does time pressure influence exploration and decision-making? We investigated this question with several four-armed bandit tasks manipulating (within subjects) expected reward, uncertainty, and time pressure (limited vs. unlimited). With limited time, people have less opportunity to perform costly computations, thus shifting the cost-benefit balance of different exploration strategies. Through behavioral, reinforcement learning (RL), reaction time (RT), and evidence accumulation analyses, we show that time pressure changes how people explore and respond to uncertainty. Specifically, participants reduced their uncertainty-directed exploration under time pressure, were less value-directed, and repeated choices more often. Since our analyses relate uncertainty to slower responses and dampened evidence accumulation (i.e., drift rates), this demonstrates a resource-rational shift towards simpler, lower-cost strategies under time pressure. These results shed light on how people adapt their exploration and decision-making strategies to externally imposed cognitive constraints.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>We have all experienced the pressure of making decisions under limited time. For instance, choosing what to order at a restaurant while the waiter waits impatiently behind your shoulder. Or deciding which analyses to run as a paper submission deadline looms near. With less time to think, we have less opportunity to perform costly computations. But does time pressure merely make us more noisy as we deal with the speed-accuracy trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> ? Or are we able to adapt our decision-making processes, to make the best use of our cognitive resources given external constraints on our computational capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> ?</p><p>Here, we are interested in the cognitive processes involved in navigating the exploration-exploitation dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> , which plays a key role when learning through interactions with the environment, such as in reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> (RL) problems. Should you exploit your usual menu option or should you explore something new? The usual option may yield a predictably rewarding outcome, but forgoes the opportunity of learning about other menu items. A new option could lead to either a pleasant or unpleasant surprise, but will likely be informative for future decisions and could improve future outcomes.</p><p>Since optimal solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma are generally unobtainable <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> except in limiting cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (e.g., infinite time horizons among other assumptions), there is great interest in understanding the strategies that humans use <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Empirical evidence from a variety of experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and real-world consumer data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> suggests people use a mix of two strategies: random and directed exploration. Random exploration increases the diversity of choices by adding stochasticity to the agent's behavioral policy, instead of only maximizing expected value. If you have only ever tried a handful of items on the menu, then you might have an imperfect picture of which options are good. Thus, adding In unlimited time rounds, participants could take as long as they wanted to make each selection and received positive feedback (happy face) and were shown the value of the acquired payoff for 400ms (feedback period). In limited time rounds, participants were only given 400 ms to make each selection. If they exceeded the time limit, they earned no rewards and received negative feedback (sad face) with the value of the payoff they could have earned crossed out. We used the same feedback period duration of 400ms before the next trial automatically began and participants were shown the choice screen. Inputs during the feedback period had no effect. c) Each payoff condition specifies a normal payoff distribution for each option, with the means and variances described numerically in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The reward distributions are designed to compare how differences in reward expectations and differences in uncertainty influence choices, where IGT refers to a payoff distribution inspired by the Iowa Gambling Task (see Methods). Dots and the Tukey boxplots describe 100 randomly drawn payoffs, while the half violin plots show the generative distribution, with the diamond indicating the mean.</p><p>more variability to your choices may give you a better perspective about which options you should value. In contrast, directed exploration adds an exploration bonus to each option, proportional to the agent's level of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Rather than simply behaving more randomly, directed exploration is more strategic, prioritizing choices with the highest uncertainty to gain more information <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Perhaps there is an item on the menu you have never tried before. Directing your exploration to that novel item would be more effective at achieving an information maximization goal than choosing randomly. But since representations of uncertainty need to be factored into the decision-making process, this may be computationally more costly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limiting Decision Time</head><p>We manipulate decision time as a method for imposing external limitations on cognitive resources, to better understand the differential cognitive costs associated with random and directed exploration. With less time "budgeted" for costly computations, resource-rational decision makers 4, 5 might be expected to choose cheaper strategies in order to achieve a better trade-off between the costs of computation and the benefits in terms of reward. One line of research on human decision-making commonly assumes that time pressure causes participants to rely more on "intuitive decision making" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , making immediate outcomes more salient <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , and making people more reliant on fast, recognition-based processes as compared to slower, more analytical processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Research using formal computational models has also related time pressure to changes in the speed-accuracy trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , yielding faster, less accurate decisions, but nevertheless still achieving an efficient rate of rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . However, there is disagreement in the literature about how time pressure changes exploration patterns. On the one hand, taxing cognitive capacities has been shown to increase exploration, producing less consistent and fewer expected value-maximizing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Similarly, people and monkeys placed under time pressure become more eager to select uncertain options, independent of outcome value <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Time pressure has also been linked to making people become more risk-seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> , although recent modeling work has challenged the reliability of this shift in risk preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Nevertheless, a common thread is that limiting cognitive capacity reduces the scope or detail with which people evaluate different options <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> , producing more impulsive decisions or a switch to simpler, heuristic decision-making strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> , both with similar patterns of increased exploration.</p><p>On the other hand, time pressure has also been shown to decrease exploration, leading to more repeat choice behavior and a reduced preference for uncertain options. Participants under time pressure are more likely to repeat previous actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , even to the detriment of producing more costly errors. This can also be related to a trade-off between reward and policy complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , where less complex and cheaper-to-encode policies will lead to higher rates of choice perseveration (i.e., repeat choices). Time pressure has also been shown to increase participants' preferences for a known payoff over an uncertain alternative in the domain of gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , although the inverse was true in the domain of losses. There are also similar findings from description-based gambles, where time pressure can increase risk aversion in the domain of gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</p><p>These divergent results could be interpreted through the lens of early work on coping mechanisms people use when put to the limits of their cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> . One mechanism is acceleration, where information is processed at a faster rate. Combined with lower evidence thresholds, acceleration can lead to more frequently choosing options that would otherwise be ignored, consistent with increased random exploration. Recent work using drift diffusion models has supported this hypothesis by connecting random exploration to lowered evidence thresholds and increased drift rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> . Conversely, longer response times have been related to the ability to mentally simulate a greater number of future outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> , producing more directed exploration but decreased random exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> . Acceleration as a response to time pressure could thus produce a trade-off between different forms of exploration.</p><p>Another potential mechanism is repetition, where previous actions are repeated or recycled <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> , since it may not always be cost effective to simulate any future outcomes at all. This can be related to value-free habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> , where not all decisions justify the cognitive costs of using value expectations (both rewards and uncertainty) to select new actions. Whereas you might normally enjoy exploring new restaurants in a new city, limits on decision time, such as an imminent departure at the airport, might motivate you to default to a previously visited restaurant, instead of weighing the alternatives and selecting a new option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals and Scope</head><p>We present a rich experimental setting, where we use a within-subject design manipulating the presence or absence of time pressure to gain insights into the cognitive processes underlying exploration. We use multiple four-armed bandit tasks, where across four payoff conditions (within-subject), we independently manipulate reward expectations and uncertainty across different options <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>). This allows us to dissociate value-directed and uncertainty-directed choices, where compared to previous studies with twoarmed bandit tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , the richer set of options makes efficient exploration more relevant and observable over more trials. Given less decision time, participants can be expected to have less access to costly computations, leading to less value-maximizing choices and more random exploration. Simultaneously, time pressure may limit the capacity for reasoning about the uncertainty of each option, thus leading to less uncertainty directed exploration.</p><p>As predicted, time pressure made participants less sensitive to reward values (more random exploration) and less likely to select options with high relative uncertainty (less directed exploration). We then estimated three hierarchical Bayesian models to understand how expectations of reward and subjective uncertainty influenced choices, reaction times (RTs), and evidence accumulation, which reaffirmed our behavioral analyses, with additional insights into the decision-making and evidence accumulation process. Time pressure diminished uncertainty-directed exploration through several mechanisms: i) reducing the selection of uncertain options during early trials, ii) encouraging more aggressive exploitation of known options in later trials, and iii) heightening the tendency to repeat previous choices.</p><p>Our analysis of the RT data revealed how this shift in exploration is related to the computational costs of different exploration strategies. High reward expectations corresponded to faster choices, while high uncertainty (both relative and total) were associated with slower choices. Under time pressure, participants selected highly rewarding options even faster, but slowed down less when selecting highly uncertain options-independent of having faster choices in general. These changes in RT can be linked to the evidence accumulation process. While time pressure did not change how reward expectations influenced evidence accumulation (faster choices were due to lower decision-thresholds), it reduced the extent that relative uncertainty dampened the rate of evidence accumulation.</p><p>Our findings indicate that time pressure selectively impacts how uncertainty is integrated into decisions. Put under time pressure, people are less influenced by uncertainty, less value-directed, and more likely to repeat previous choices. This is a simpler strategy and comes at lower costs, representing a potentially resource-rational adaptation to time pressure. These results enrich our understanding of human exploration strategies under changing task demands, providing insights into the cognitive costs of reasoning about and acting on uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We conducted an online experiment on MTurk (n = 99; 36 female; M age =34.82; SD age =10.1)) to study how time pressure influences exploration behavior ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Our "Time Bandit" experiment employed repeated four-armed bandit tasks, where we independently manipulated expected reward and uncertainty across four payoff conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c</ref>; <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), along with time pressure (limited vs. unlimited time). This allowed us to disentangle how relative differences in reward expectations and uncertainty influence choices, and how time pressure modulates this influence, in a single within-subject design (see <ref type="table">Methods)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Analyses</head><p>To analyze the influence of time pressure and payoff conditions on performance and choice behavior, we constructed a series of Bayesian mixed-effects regression models. Specifically, we estimated how average rewards ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2a</ref>), the entropy of choices <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref>, the number of repeat choices <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2c)</ref>, and the probability of making a repeat choice conditioned on payoff ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2e</ref>), were influenced by time pressure and payoff conditions, whilst also accounting for individual differences in the random effects structure. This allows us to describe the influence of either time pressure or payoff conditions in terms of the estimated marginal means (∆ EMM ), which uses contrast analyses to quantify differences in the dependent variable marginalized over the other independent variables. For instance, examining how average rewards were influenced by time pressure, marginalized over the four payoff conditions, or vice versa. The raw posterior estimates are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S1</ref> and visualized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>, while <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref> provides the raw data separated by payoff condition.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig S1c)</ref>, perhaps because participants were able to more quickly identify and exploit the highest rewarding arm with less variance in observed outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4/21</head><p>Lastly, we also included a variant of the repeat choice model, which included the (unshifted) value of the previous reward as an additional predictor <ref type="figure">(Fig 2d)</ref>. Here, we modeled the probability of each choice (after the first trial) being a repeat using logistic regression. We find the same influence of the experimental manipulations on repeat behavior as above (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S1</ref>), but also find an interaction between time pressure and previous reward value. Participants were more likely to repeat a choice with higher rewards in unlimited time (OR= 1.24 <ref type="bibr">[1.19, 1.29]</ref>). Put differently, time pressure reduced participants' sensitivity to reward value in their repeat behavior, as evidenced by the flatter response curve in <ref type="figure">Figure 2d</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 2e</ref> visualizes the aggregate choice proportions to get a better sense of patterns related to reward expectations and uncertainty. These bars indicate the aggregate choice frequency of each option relative to chance, where bars above zero indicate the option was chosen more frequently, and bars below zero indicate the option was chosen less frequently. The difference between the orange and green bars illustrates the differences in choice behavior as a function of time pressure. We aggregate the data using the canonical mapping of reward distributions (see inset plots in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2a</ref> for reference) to the [Q,W, O, P] keys, although the keys were randomly mapped in each round for participants. To provide statistical support for choice differences, we use Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression to model how time pressure influenced the probability of choosing a given option. We focus on two informative cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Patterns</head><p>In the IGT condition (named for mimicking the structure of the so-called Iowa Gambling Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> ), there were two high reward and two low reward options, with each pair having either a low or high variance.</p><p>We focused on the two high reward options (indicated as 'O' and 'P' in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2e</ref>), and modeled whether time pressure influenced the likelihood of choosing the riskier, high variance option 'P' over the safer low variance option 'O', as a simple test of how decision time can influence the role of relative uncertainty (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2e</ref> inset for the raw data). We found that overall, participants chose the high variance option ('P') more frequently in unlimited time (Odds Ratio: OR = 1.11 [.80, 1.53]; <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S2</ref>), although the estimates overlapped with chance (OR = 1). However, there was also an interaction with round number, where the difference between time conditions widened over successive rounds. Participants in the unlimited time condition increased their likelihood of selecting the high variance option over rounds (OR = 1.39 <ref type="bibr">[1.23, 1.57]</ref>). This effect tended towards the opposite direction for limited time rounds, where participants selected the high variance option less frequently over rounds (OR = 0.83 [0.68, 1.02]). We find the clearest differences arising from the time-pressure manipulation in the Equal Means condition ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2e inset)</ref>, where compared against all other options, participants were more likely to select the highest variance option ('P') in the unlimited time condition (OR = 1.44 [1.12, 1.86]; <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S2</ref>). This illustrates a clear shift in preferences away from uncertain options when time pressure is introduced. Whereas participants tend to be risk-seeking and choose more uncertain options under unlimited time, they become more risk-averse and choose them less often under time pressure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim Discussion</head><p>Altogether, we find behavioral evidence that time pressure reduced exploration. There were less diverse and more repeat choices, which ultimately resulted in lower reward outcomes. From these analyses, we find two important behavioral signatures of the underlying cognitive processes that produced this shift in exploration. First, time pressure reduced participants' sensitivity to reward values in repeating previous choices, making them more likely to repeat a low-reward choice <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2d</ref>). Second, participants were less likely to select options with higher relative uncertainty under time pressure ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2e</ref>). In the next section, we employ model-based analyses, which use RL models to explicitly track expected reward and uncertainty estimates. We then use these estimates to model choice behavior, reaction times, and evidence accumulation (i.e., drift rate).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model-Based Analyses</head><p>To model learning and decision making in our task, we use a Bayesian mean tracker (BMT) as an RL model for estimating expected rewards and associated uncertainties, which are then updated based on prediction errors (see Methods). The BMT is a special case of the Kalman filter, which assumes time-invariant reward distributions (as was the case in our experiment). The BMT provides a Bayesian analogue <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> to the classic Rescorla-Wagner 56 model of associative learning, and has described human behavior in a variety of multi-armed bandit and decision-making tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> .</p><p>We generated predictions from the BMT using participant choices and reward observations at each trial t to compute posterior distributions of the average reward of the options, and then using these as prior predictive distributions at trial t + 1. These prior predictive distributions are all normally distributed, and we used the mean and standard deviation as measures of predicted reward and the associated uncertainty, respectively (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. S5</ref>), which we use to conduct three model-based analyses predicting choices, reaction times, and evidence accumulation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choices.</head><p>In our first analysis, we assessed how reward expectations and uncertainty estimates influenced the likelihood of an option being chosen on each trial. We applied hierarchical Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of a softmax policy (see Methods), under the assumption that a participant's choice on each  trial is influenced by both the predicted mean and uncertainty of an option. Each participant's parameters are assumed to be jointly normally distributed and assumed to interact with time pressure. The probability of choosing option j on trial t is a softmax function of its decision value Q j,t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P(C t = j) = exp(Q j,t ) ∑ 4 k=1 exp(Q k,t ) .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The decision value Q j,t is a function of the prior predictive mean m j,t and uncertainty √ v j,t (standard deviation) of each option according to the BMT, with an additional stickiness bonus for the most recently chosen option (δ j,t−1 = 1 if option j was chosen on trial t − 1; see Methods):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q j,t = α(m j,t + β √ v j,t ) + γδ j,t−1 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We computed hierarchical Bayesian estimates for the value-directed component α (factoring in both rewards and uncertainty), the uncertainty bonus β (governing the trade-off between exploitation and exploration), and the stickiness bonus γ, including interactions with the time pressure manipulation (limited vs. unlimited). Larger α estimates indicate more value-directed choices, whereas lower α suggest more random choices, which are not explainable by reward expectations or uncertainty estimates (i.e., random exploration). More positive β estimates indicate a higher level of uncertainty-directed exploration.</p><p>Higher estimates of γ indicate more perseveration in choice behavior, with more frequent repetitions of previous choices. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3a</ref> shows the posterior estimates of the model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Fig. S7</ref>-S8 for comparison to alternative models). We find less value-directed choice behavior under time pressure (α Unlimited −α Limited = 1.90 [1.24, 2.56]), with positive estimates in both conditions (α Unlimited = 9.21 [8.31, 10.1]; α Limited = 7.31 <ref type="bibr">[6.23, 8.44]</ref>). This pattern can be seen in the raw BMT predictions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4a</ref>), where chosen options had both higher relative reward expectations and relative uncertainty in unlimited time. By definition, the inverse of the value-directed component defines the level of random exploration, with the interpretation that participants' choices were less predictable and more random when given less time to deliberate (limited time). This may seem at odds with the behavioral results showing reduced entropy under time pressure, but the lack of correlation between α and choice entropy under time limitations (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S6b</ref>) suggests that participants consistently chose non-value maximizing options (i.e., repeating low-value choices; <ref type="figure">Fig. 2e</ref>). In contrast, α estimates were correlated with higher average rewards in both conditions (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S6a</ref>).</p><p>Time  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4b</ref> provides additional clarity about this result. Participants with unlimited time experienced an early uptick in selecting relatively uncertain options around trial 3, suggestive of an "exploration phase". Afterwards, there was a gradual shift towards exploitation, indicated by the monotonic decay of the relative uncertainty of chosen options, indicating an increasing preference for relatively less uncertain options. Under time pressure, there is a similar trend, yet the early exploration phase has almost vanished (the relative uncertainty of the chosen option on trial 3 is indistinguishable from 0: t(98) = 0.9, p = .387, d = 0.1, BF = .16) and later trials are associated with more strongly negative relative uncertainty. Thus, a reduced exploration bonus under time pressure appears to be a combination of less exploration in early trials, and more aggressive exploitation in later trials, which is also apparent in the higher levels of total uncertainty during limited time rounds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4c</ref>). This reduction in directed exploration may also be related to the lower overall performance under time pressure, since higher β estimates in the limited time condition were associated with higher rewards (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S6a</ref>).</p><p>In addition to these changes in exploration, time pressure increased the stickiness of choices (γ Unlimited − γ Limited = −0.32 [−0.46, −0.19]), with positive estimates in both conditions (γ Unlimited = 1.58 [1.36, 1.80]; γ Limited = 1.91 <ref type="bibr">[1.64, 2015]</ref>). This increase in choice perseveration is consistent with the reduced entropy and higher repeat choice probabilities found in the behavioral data, but estimates of γ were unrelated to average reward (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>).</p><p>Overall, time pressure reduced the value-directedness of choices, reduced uncertainty-directed exploration, and increased the stickiness of choices. We now turn to modeling reaction times (RTs) to better understand how reward expectations and uncertainty influenced the speed of decisions.</p><p>Reaction Time.</p><p>Our second analysis looked at how RTs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig S3 for</ref> raw RT analysis) were influenced by expectations of rewards and estimated uncertainties. We first computed the relative reward and relative uncertainties of the BMT predictions using the difference between the chosen option and the average of the unchosen options on each trial. Thus, positive values indicate that the expected reward or uncertainty were larger than the mean of the unchosen options. We also computed total uncertainty, based on the sum of uncertainty estimates across the four options on any given trial. We then regressed relative mean, relative uncertainty, total uncertainty, and round number onto log-transformed RTs in a Bayesian mixed effects regression (see Methods).</p><p>The resulting posterior parameter estimates ( . Thus, higher reward expectations made people faster, whereas uncertainty (both relative and total) slowed them down. Both effects were less pronounced under time pressure.</p><p>There was also a notable interaction between predictors (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S9</ref> for the full model and Figs. S10-S11 for interaction plots). While high relative reward expectations generally sped up choices, this pattern was inverted when high rewards were also accompanied by high relative uncertainty, with participants slowing down instead of speeding up (b = .04 [.001, .08]; no difference between time conditions). Thus, certainty about high rewards produced rapid decisions, whereas uncertainty about high rewards produced slower choices.</p><p>Overall, more exploitative choices (with higher relative reward expectations) were faster, while more explorative choices (with both higher relative uncertainty or higher total uncertainty) were slower. This differs from previous findings using two-armed bandits <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , in which higher relative uncertainty was related to faster decisions. Here, we find that uncertainty is not just a bonus that adds to the decision signal, making choices easier and faster. Rather, grappling with uncertainty takes time.</p><p>Evidence Accumulation.</p><p>In our third analysis, we used a Linear Ballistic Accumulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> (LBA) to model choices and RTs simultaneously (see Methods). This model assumes that choices are the result of an evidence accumulation process, where evidence for each option accumulates as a function of drift rate, which is independently estimated for each option. Whichever option first exceeds the decision threshold is chosen. The interplay between the drift rate and evidence threshold captures how participants trade response speed for accuracy, with higher thresholds requiring more evidence and producing more value maximizing choices, yet slower responses. Thus, we can use the LBA to separate out how time pressure impacts evidence accumulation in terms of the rate of evidence accumulation and the amount of evidence collected.</p><p>Consistent with the need to arrive at decisions more quickly, we observed both lower relative evidence thresholds k (t(98) = −5.2, p &lt; .001, d = 0.5, BF &gt; 100; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S12</ref>) and higher mean drift rates (t(98) = 7.1, p &lt; .001, d = 0.7, BF &gt; 100) under time pressure. This suggests an accelerated processing of information (faster drift rates), which is also more prone to errors (lower threshold). The maximum pairwise difference between drift rates was also larger under limited time (t(98) = 6.0, p &lt; .001, d = 0.6, BF &gt; 100), suggesting larger separation between different options, which is also related to lower choice entropy and more frequent repeat choices (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S13</ref>). Additionally, participants had shorter nondecision times τ (t(98) = −4.6, p &lt; .001, d = 0.5, BF &gt; 100) and less maximum starting evidence A (t(98) = −7.8, p &lt; .001, d = 0.8, BF &gt; 100), when placed under time pressure. All parameters where strongly correlated across time conditions (Kendall rank correlations; all r τ &gt; .40; BF &gt; 100; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S12</ref>), are recoverable <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S14)</ref>, and can be used to simulate realistic choice and RT patterns <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S15)</ref>. Thus, our LBA results confirm the intuition that participants reached faster decisions at lower evidence thresholds when time limitations were imposed, but they also accumulated evidence faster and with larger separation between options.</p><p>In a final step, we sought to better understand how expectations of reward and uncertainty influence the evidence accumulation process and how time pressure may impact this relationship. Thus, we regressed the BMT predictions of relative expected reward, relative uncertainty, and total uncertainty for each option onto its estimated drift rate using a Bayesian mixed effects regression. Note that the LBA parameters are estimated on each round, thus the BMT predictions are averaged over trials, but nevertheless capture differences in the trajectory of learning and the independent manipulations of expected rewards and uncertainty in the four payoff conditions.</p><p>The result of this analysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3c)</ref>  The main interaction between predictors (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S16</ref> for the full model and Figs. S17-S18 for interaction plots), was that the effect of total uncertainty could be inverted depending on relative reward  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S17h</ref>). Total uncertainty amplified evidence accumulation when the stakes were low (low relative rewards or low relative uncertainty), but dampened evidence accumulation instead when the stakes were high (high relative rewards or relative uncertainty). Since total uncertainty is the same across all options, amplified evidence accumulation under low stakes corresponds to faster, more random choices, consistent with little benefit from increased deliberation in these settings. Conversely, dampened evidence accumulation under high stakes corresponds to slower, and more reward-or uncertainty-directed choices.</p><p>Overall, we find that reward-modulated increases in evidence accumulation were unaffected by time pressure. However, uncertainty-driven decreases in evidence accumulation were less pronounced under time pressure, with drift rates less influenced by uncertain options. We also found an influence of high total uncertainty, which was modulated by expectations of rewards and relative uncertainty. When more was at stake, total uncertainty dampened drift rates and produced slower decisions. But when relative differences in reward expectations were minor, higher total uncertainty amplified drift and produced faster decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>How is exploration and decision-making constrained by cognitive limitations imposed through time pressure? We investigated this question using several variants of a four-armed bandit task, designed to independently manipulate differences in reward expectations and uncertainty. We then used a time pressure manipulation to either give participants unlimited decision time or to limit decision time to less than 400 ms for each choice. Both payoff and time pressure manipulations were conducted within-subjects, allowing us to use hierarchical modeling to achieve a high level of detail into the interplay between learning strategies and cognitive limitations imposed by time pressure.</p><p>Our behavioral results show that time pressure induced participants to earn fewer rewards, made them less sensitive to reward values in their repeat choice behavior, and less likely to select options associated with higher uncertainty. We then used RL models to analyze how reward expectations and uncertainty affected choices, RTs, and the rate of evidence accumulation.</p><p>High reward expectations made participants more likely to select options, producing faster RTs for such exploitative choices, and amplifying the rate of evidence accumulation. Adding time pressure reduced the value-directedness of choices, but increased their tendency to speed up when choosing options with high relative reward expectations (i.e., exploitation), and made them more likely to repeat previous choices.</p><p>In contrast, while uncertainty also made participants more likely to select options, choices with higher relative (and to some extent total uncertainty) were associated with slower choices and reduced evidence accumulation rates. Adding time pressure reduced uncertainty-directed exploration in choice behavior and also reduced the influence of uncertainty on RTs. This is consistent with the notion that uncertainty takes time to process and deploy strategically. Without the necessary time to grapple with uncertainty, participants shifted to exploiting known options and repeating previous choices, rather than integrating the value of exploring uncertain options.</p><p>Similar reductions in directed exploration have also been observed when participants were placed under working memory load <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . The resulting behavior may thus be seen as a resource-rational 4, 5 adaptation to externally imposed limitations on cognitive resources, consistent with other findings showing that people are sensitive to the cost-benefit tradeoffs of different learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> . Indeed, the interactions of our LBA model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S17g-h</ref>) suggest that people are sensitive to the cost-benefit trade-off of increased deliberation, producing faster more random decisions when the stakes are low, but slowing down and deliberating longer when the stakes are high. Future research should examine the underlying mechanisms of the arbitration between strategies and the neural locus of cognitive control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and extensions</head><p>One limitation is that we only account for how time pressure influences exploration strategies, but not for changes in learning. Time pressure might not only change which computations we engage in when deciding how to explore or exploit, but it might also influence the richness of the representations we form during learning or the extent to which these representations are updated in response to new information.</p><p>Indeed, previous work in economics has shown a reduced efficacy of training <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> . However, our use of Bayesian RL in modeling choices and RTs may not be able to differentiate between these hypotheses, although similar models in related tasks have been used to predict directly elicited participant judgments about reward expectations and confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> . Future studies may consider modeling not only choices and RTs, but also participant judgments about future outcomes in a similar time pressure manipulation.</p><p>Our current results also only examined uncertainty about reward expectations. However, there exist several alternative measures of uncertainty such as confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> , perceptual uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> , and computational uncertainty induced by cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> , all of which could influence exploration behavior in different ways. Thus, we expect future studies to increasingly focus on disentangling different sources of uncertainty and their effects on the exploration-exploitation dilemma.</p><p>Additionally, while our four-armed bandit task was designed to provide a richer choice set beyond two options, magnifying the difference between directed and random exploration, it still pales in comparison to the complexity of many real world problems. Since participants may be more likely to engage in directed exploration in highly complex or highly structured domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> , an important future direction will be to understand how environmental structure modulates changes in learning as a function of cognitive limitations.</p><p>Lastly, we have also only looked at multi-armed bandits in which participants only gain positive rewards or earn nothing when exceeding the time limit. We did not, however, probe how exploration behavior changes in the domain of losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> or risky outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> . Since the distribution of rewards can affect participants' learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79</ref> and losses have been shown to produce risk-seeking under time pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> , studying this domain will be a crucial next step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We studied the interplay of human exploration strategies and cognitive limitations imposed by time pressure, showing that participants are sensitive to the costs and benefits of different computations. Put under time pressure, people were less influenced by uncertainty, less value-directed, and repeated past choices more often. These behavioral changes are linked to the cognitive costs of reasoning about rewards and uncertainty. Exploitative choices (i.e., high reward expectations) were generally faster, while exploratory choices (i.e, high relative or total uncertainty) were slower. Taken together, our results suggest that people display a resource-rational sensitivity to the cost-benefits of different exploration strategies under externally imposed limitations on cognitive resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Design.</head><p>We recruited 99 participants (36 female, aged between 21 and 69 years; M=34.82; SD=10.1) on Amazon Mechanical Turk (requiring 95% approval rate and 100 previously approved HITs). Participants were paid $3.00 for taking part in the experiment and a performance contingent bonus of up to $4.00 (calculated based on the performance of one randomly selected round). Participants spent 13.0 ± 5.6 minutes on the task and earned $5.87 ± $0.91 in total. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p><p>We used a 2 × 4 within-subject design to examine how the presence or absence of time pressure and the payoff structure of the task (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c</ref> and Tab. 1) influenced choices and reaction times. In total, the experiment consisted of 40 rounds with 20 trials each. In each round, a condition was sampled (without replacement) from a pre-randomized list, such that each combination of time pressure and payoff structure <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Payoff Conditions. Means shown are unshifted. In the experiment, a random value between 30 and 60 was added to all rewards of all options, and actual rewards were always positive. IGT refers to payoffs inspired by the Iowa Gambling Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> . Participants were required to complete three comprehension questions and two practice rounds (one with unlimited time and one with limited time) consisting of 5 trials each before starting the experiment. Each of the 40 rounds was presented as a four-armed bandit task, where the four options were randomly mapped to the [Q,W, O, P] keys on the keyboard <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1a)</ref>. Selecting an option by pressing the corresponding key yielded a reward sampled from a normal distribution, where the mean and variance was defined by the round's payoff structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1c</ref> and Tab. 1). Participants completed 20 trials in each round and were told to acquire as many points as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payoff</head><p>Before starting a round, participants were informed whether it was an unlimited or a limited time round. In unlimited time rounds, participants could spend as much time as they needed to reach a decision, upon which they were given feedback about the obtained reward (displayed for 400 ms) before continuing to the next trial <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. In limited time rounds, participants were instructed to decide as fast as possible. If a decision took longer than 400 ms, they forfeited the reward they would have earned (presented to them as a crossed-out number with an additional sad smiley; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b)</ref>. We used the same feedback period of 400 ms to display feedback about obtained rewards in both limited and unlimited time rounds.</p><p>We applied a random shifting of rewards across rounds (i.e., different minimum and maximum reward) to prevent participants from immediately recognizing when they had chosen the optimal option. For each round, we sampled a value from a uniform distribution U <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60)</ref>, which was then added to the rewards. Together with random shifting, we also truncated rewards such that they were always larger than zero. In order to convey intuitions about the random shift of rewards, payoffs were presented using a different fictional currency in each round (e.g., ß, Þ, ϑ ), such that the absolute value was unknown, but higher were always better.</p><p>At the end of each round, participants were given feedback about their performance in terms of the bonus they would gain (in USD) if this was the round selected for determining the bonus. The bonus was calculated as a percentage of the total possible performance, raised to the power of 4 to accentuate differences in the upper range of performance: Bonus = total reward gained mean reward of best option×20 trials 4 × $4.00</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Payoff conditions</head><p>We used four different payoff conditions as a within-participant manipulation <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c</ref>). Each payoff condition specified the mean µ j and variance σ 2 j of the reward distribution R j ∼ N (µ j , σ 2 j ) for each option j. Each distribution was randomly mapped to one of the four [Q,W, O, P] keys of the keyboard in each round. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a classic design that has been related to a variety of clinical and neurological factors affecting decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> . We implemented a reward condition inspired by the IGT such that there are two high and two low reward options, with a low and high variance version of each. We also constructed two conditions with equally spaced means, but with either uniformly low variance or uniformly high variance. Lastly, the equal means condition had identical means and gradually increasing variance, such that we can observe the influence of uncertainty independent of mean reward.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian mean tracker</head><p>The Bayesian mean tracker (BMT) learns a posterior distribution over the mean reward µ j for each option j. Rewards are assumed to be normally distributed with a known variance but unknown mean. The prior distribution of the mean is also a normal distribution. This implies that the posterior distribution for each mean is also a normal distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p t (µ j |D t−1 ) = N (m j,t , v j,t )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where p t is the posterior distribution at trial t and D t−1 denotes the observed rewards and choices up to and including trial t (for all options). For a given option j, the posterior mean m j,t and variance v j,t at trial t are only updated when it has been selected at trial t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">m j,t = m j,t−1 + δ j,t G j,t y t − m j,t−1 (4) v j,t = 1 − δ j,t G j,t v j,t−1 (5)</formula><p>where δ j,t = 1 if option j is chosen on trial t, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, y t is the observed reward at trial t, and G j,t is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">G j,t = v j,t−1 v j,t−1 + θ 2 ε (6)</formula><p>where θ 2 ε , referred to as the error variance, is the variance of the rewards around the mean. Intuitively, the estimated mean of the chosen option m j,t is updated based on prediction error, which is the difference between the observed reward y t and the prior expectation m j,t−1 , multiplied by learning rate G j,t ∈ [0, 1]. At the same time, the estimated variance v j,t of the chosen option is reduced by a factor 1 − G j,t . The error variance (θ 2 ε ) can be interpreted as an inverse sensitivity, where smaller values result in more substantial updates to the mean m j,t , and larger reductions of uncertainty v j,t . We set the prior mean to m j,0 = 0 based on the (unshifted) expectation across payoff conditions, and the prior variance is set to v j,0 = 55 * 20, which is also the expectation across payoff conditions, scaled by a constant multiple of 20. We use unshifted reward values (i.e., before adding the shift ∼ U <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60)</ref> were observed by participants), with the means in each condition centered on 0. For our model-based analysis, the error variance θ 2 ε was set to the true underlying variance of the chosen option.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Too slow analyses</head><p>We also analysed the pattern of "too slow" responses that exceeded 400ms during the limited time condition, where participants received no reward. Using a one-way within subject ANOVA, we found no differences in the number of "too slow" responses across payoff conditions (F(3, 98) = 0.088, p = .966, η 2 = .001, BF = 0.012; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S4a</ref>). Too slow responses tended to follow lower-valued reward observations (paired t-test: t(93) = −6.2, p &lt; .001, d = 0.8, BF &gt; 100; omitting 5 participants who never had slow responses; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S4b</ref>). However, this effect is mediated by trial number, since the vast majority of "too slow" responses occurred on the second trial <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. S4c</ref>). Since the learning curves in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2a</ref> indicate gradual increases in reward over trials (except for the Equal Means condition), a tendency for "too slow" responses to take place during early trials will generally correspond to lower reward observations. In order to simultaneously model the influence of payoff conditions, trials, and reward observations on the tendency to produce a "too slow" response, we fit a Bayesian logistic mixed-effects model <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. S4d</ref>). We again found no influence of payoff condition (all estimates overlapping with an odds ratio of 1). However, we find a strong effect of trial , such that both later trials and larger rewards observations were less likely to produce "too slow" responses.  , where DV is the dependent variable (columns), and PayoffConditions were defined using dummy coding, with the baseline being the Equal Means condition. We report the posterior mean and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval below in brackets. The 'Repeats' model is a Binomial regression based on 19 successive Bernoulli trials (since the first trial cannot be a repeat). The 'P(Repeat)' model is a logistic regression, with the previous reward value added as an additional predictor. Both the 'Repeats' and 'P(Repeat)' models are reported as Odds Ratios. σ 2 indicates the individual-level variance, τ 00 indicates the variation between individual intercepts and the average intercept, and ICC is the intraclass correlation coefficient.

In the IGT regression, we only consider choices where the two highest mean reward options were chosen ('O' and 'P'), where DV = 1 when 'P' was chosen, and zero otherwise. For the Equal Means condition, we include all choices. We report the posterior odds ratio and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval below in brackets. σ 2 indicates the individual-level variance, τ 00 indicates the variation between individual intercepts and the average intercept, and ICC is the intraclass correlation coefficient.  <ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref>.

The early upticks indicates uncertainty directed exploration (substantially less in limited time), followed by exploitation as this value decays below zero (dashed line). e) Total uncertainty (stdev) decays monotonically, with a faster decline in unlimited time due to more uncertainty directed exploration.  <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>.

However, we only find a reliable effect of β under time pressure (r τ = .25, p &lt; .001, BF &gt; 100), but not with unlimited time (r τ = .13, p = .055, BF = .81). This suggests that the lower overall performance under time pressure, may have a result of the reduction in uncertainty directed exploration <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. We find no relationship between stickiness and rewards (unlimited time: r τ = .13, p = .052, BF = .85; limited time: r τ = .08, p = .265, BF = .24). b) We find no correlation between α and choice entropy (unlimited time: r τ = −.13, p = .053, BF = .84; limited time: r τ = −.01, p = .835, BF = .13). However, higher β estimates generated higher entropy choices in both conditions (unlimited time: r τ = .26, p &lt; .001, BF &gt; 100; limited time: r τ = .36, p &lt; .001, BF &gt; 100), while higher γ were related to lower entropy (unlimited time: r τ = −.53, p &lt; .001, BF &gt; 100; limited time: r τ = −.41, p &lt; .001, BF &gt; 100). c) Similar to choice entropy, we find no relationship between α and the frequency of repeat choices (unlimited time: r τ = .06, p = .384, BF = .19; limited time: r τ = −.04, p = .545, BF = .16). However, higher β estimates were correlated with less repeat choices in limited time (r τ = −.30, p &lt; .001, BF &gt; 100), and more weakly correlated in unlimited time (r τ = −.19, p = .006, BF = 5.4). Stickiness γ was unsurprisingly correlated with more repeat choices in both conditions (unlimited time: r τ = .73, p &lt; .001, BF &gt; 100; limited time: r τ = .65, p &lt; .001, BF &gt; 100).

Coefficient plot of RT mixed effects regression. Posterior estimates of the Bayesian mixed effects regression predicting (log) RT. The mean posterior estimate is displayed numerically and indicated by the black dot, while the 95% HPD is illustrated by the length of the horizontal line. Coefficients are sorted by largest to smallest, with blue and red colors corresponding to estimates that are above or below 0, respectively, but do not indicate whether the difference is meaningful. See Figs. S10-S11 for interaction plots. RelMu: relative reward; RelSig: relative uncertainty; TotalSig: total uncertainty.   <ref type="figure">Figure S15</ref>. LBA simulations. a) Observed vs. simulated choice probabilities. For each set of participant parameter estimates, we generated 10k simulated choices that we used to define choice probabilities for each option (y-axis), which we compared against participants' observed choice probabilities (x-axis). Each dot represents the choice probabilities for each option for each set of parameter estimates. The colored line is a linear regression, with the ribbon showing the 95% CI. b) Observed vs. simulated RTs Using the same set of simulated data as above, we created a matched dataset where we sampled a simulated RT value yoked to each participant set of observed choices (i.e., an RT corresponding to the chosen option rather than any of the four options). We then aggregated the data by payoff condition and time pressure, and computed 20-quantiles along the participant RTs (x-axis), plotting the median (dot) and 95% CI (error bar) for the corresponding simulated RTs.  </p></div>
